2,Mr RUDDOCK,INFORMATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. As part of its fundamental role to protect Australia's national security, the government has sought to strengthen the protections for security sensitive information. These protections were significantly enhanced earlier this year with the commencement of the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act 2004. This act applies to federal criminal proceedings to protect information that relates to, or whose disclosure may affect, national security. The aim of the act is to facilitate the prosecution of an offence without prejudicing national security and the rights of the defendant to a fair trial. This bill extends these protections to include certain civil proceedings. It has become apparent that security sensitive information may, and in fact does, arise in civil proceedings, including, in particular, accident compensation and family law proceedings. As with prosecutions for criminal offences, it is essential that parties can curity sensitive information in these cases without jeopardising Australia's national security. The bill introduces a number of measures to strengthen the protections in civil proceedings for information that is likely to prejudice our national security. It broadly adopts the same procedure that applies to federal criminal proceedings under the principal act, but with some necessary departures to account for the distinctive features of a civil proceeding. As with criminal proceedings, the bill will only apply when notice is given to parties to a proceeding. Once it applies, the bill enables information to be disclosed during a civil proceeding in an edited or summarised form. It also provides for closed hearings to consider the disclosure of information that may prejudice national security. Only parties and their legal representatives who possess security clearances to an appropriate level may attend these closed hearings. This raises a significant point of difference with the principal act. The bill departs from the procedure for criminal proceedings by enabling the parties, not just their legal representatives, to obtain security clearances to an appropriate level. Unlike criminal proceedings, parties to civil proceedings come from all walks of life and many may qualify for, or already have, security clearances. In addition, many parties will represent themselves in civil proceedings. In recognition of the additional financial burden involved in engaging a security cleared legal representative to attend a closed hearing, the government has agreed that a self-represented litigant involved in a civil use sematter under Commonwealth law who is refused a security clearance at the appropriate level would be eligible to apply for financial assistance under the non-statutory special circumstances scheme. If approved, this would provide financial assistance for the legal costs and related expenses associated with engaging a legal representative to attend the closed hearing. It is my expectation that such legal assistance in those circumstances would be available. While the bill changes the way that information that may affect our national security is used in civil proceedings, it also seeks to uphold the interests of the parties to the proceeding. The bill makes it clear that courts, in makother ing an order in relation to the disclosure of information or a witness, must consider whether the exclusion of information or a witness would have a substantial adverse effect on the substantive hearing in the proceeding. It also ensures that a court can stay a ceeding where it would have such an effect, even if the court had previously found otherwise. The bill requires the court to give reasons to the parties and their legal representatives for a decision to make an order to admit, exclude or redact information, or to exclude a witness. The court must also make a record of the closed hearing and provide this record to security cleared parties. These measures demonstrate that the government has yet again struck the right balance between protecting national security and protecting the rights of parties. It was also recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission that this protection should be provided in civil proceedings, and that is one of the additional reasons that we are legislating in this form. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
3,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 and related legislation to improve the overall efficiency of migration litigation. The bill builds on the substantial progress already made by the government in implementing a comprehensive package of migration litigation reforms. In May 2004, the government provided an proextra $34.2 million over four years in the 2004-05 budget for the appointment of eight additional federal magistrates. These additional magistrates, who have all taken up their appointments, are enabling the Federal Magistrates Court to handle the migration workload more efficiently. The government has been concerned about the high volume of migration cases, unmeritorious litigation and delays which are impacting on the federal courts and the migration system as a whole. In recent years, the government has won over 90 per cent of all migration cases decided at hearing. Of course the government recognises that not all unsuccessful cases are unmeritorious. However, the very large proportion of unsuccessful migration cases is a strong indicator that some unsuccessful visa applicants are using judicial review inappropriately to prolong their stay in Australia. The measures in the bill have been drawn from recommendations by the Migration Litigation Review-also called the Penfold inquiry. This was established by the government to inquire into more efficient management of migration cases. Other measures stem from recommendations by my department in a federal civil justice system strategy paper which was published in December 2003. A key feature of the bill is to enhance the role of the Federal Magistrates Court in migration cases. The court was established to deal with a high volume of shorter and less complex matters, making it a suitable forum for most migration cases. It is common sense that efficiency is to be gained by directing migration cases to the Federal Magistrates Court. To that end, the bill limits the original jurisdiction of the Federal Court in migration cases. The bill provides that the Federal Magistrates Court has the same jurisdiction under the Migration Act as the High Court under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution. Identical grounds for relief in the High Court and Federal Magistrates Court will assist the courts to quickly identify applicants who are seeking to re-litigate matters that have already been the subject of judicial consideration. A complementary reform in the bill requires the disclosure by applicants of any prior judicial review applications in relation to the same migration decision. Migration cases filed in the High Court's original jurisdiction and remitted will be directed to the Federal Magistrates Court. Further, the bill expressly provides that the Court may remit on the papers without hearing. This is an appropriate efficiency for the handling of all matters filed in the High Court. The High Court is the apex of our judicial system. It should not be burdened with cases that are more appropriately handled by a lower court. The Federal Court will retain appellate migration jurisdiction. The bill will facilitate the current practice of single judges hearing most migration appeals from the Federal Magistrates Court, except in circumstances where it is appropriate for the appeal to be heard by a full court. The bill also includes amendments to ensure that procedural provisions relating to judicial review in parts 8 and 8A of the Migration Act apply to all migration decisions. These amendments are necessary following the High Court's decision in Plaintiff S157 v Commonwealth. In S157, the High Court upheld the constitutionality of the privative clause in the Migration Act but the decision meant that time limits ceased to apply in many migration cases. The bill reinstates the original intended operation of these procedural provisions. More than one-third of all applications currently seeking judicial review of migration decisions are made outside the 28-day time limit specified in the Migration Act. Some applications are being lodged up to six years after the original visa decision. The bill provides uniform extendable time limits in the High Court, the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The time limit measures provide a balance between giving applicants an opportunity to seek judicial review of migration decisions and ensuring timely handling of these applications. The bill also strengthens the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters, by High broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases. It is appropriate that this provision is of general application. It will be a useful addition to the courts' powers in dealing with any unsustainable case. Having regard to the high rate of unsuccessful migration cases, the government is also concerned to ensure lawyers and other advisers on migration matters do not promote the prosecution of unmeritorious cases and claims. It is grossly irresponsible to encourage institution of unmeritorious cases as a means simply to prolong an unsuccessful visa applicant's stay in Australia. It is equally irresponsible for advisers to frustrate the system by lodging massproduced applications without considering the actual circumstances of each case. The measures in this bill seek to deter such conduct and require lawyers and others who provide advice on bringing migration litigation to do so carefully and having regard to the chances of the claim succeeding. Before lawyers file documents in migration cases, they will be required to certify that the application has merit. Lawyers acting ethically and in accordance with their professional duties have no need for concern. However, representatives who encourage the institution and continuation of proceedings which have no reasonable prospect of success run the risk of a costs order being made personally against them if they did not give proper consideration to the prospects or acted for an ulterior purpose. The bill also includes amendments to the arrangements for the administration of the Federal Magistrates Court to reflect its growth from 16 magistrates in 2000 to 31 at present, including the eight new magistrates funded in the 2004-05 budget. The Chief Federal Magistrate will be responsible for the administration of the court. This brings the arrangements for the administrative management of the court in line with the arrangements in the Federal Court and Family Court of Australia. All of the measures in the bill, taken together, combined with the additional resources that the government has provided to the Federal Magistrates Court, will assist the courts in managing their workloads and will improve access for all cases with merit. I the certainly hope this will lead to shorter times for which people might be detained-a matter that is often commented on-and to a situation where issues are quickly resolved and those who have no lawful entitlement to remain in Australia return home. I commend this bill and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",18
4,Mr RUDDOCK,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2005 introduces important new measures that will criminalise the use of the internet to encourage others to take their own lives. The bill will make it an offence to use a carriage service, including the internet, to access, transmit or make available material that counsels or incites suicide. The bill will also make it an offence to possess, produce or supply such material with the intent to make it available on the internet. There is a real need to protect vulnerable individuals from people who use the internet with destructive intent to counsel or incite others to take their own lives. The internet contains readily accessible sites and chat rooms that positively advocate suicide and discourage individuals from seeking psychiatric or other help. Many of these sites also provide explicit instructions on methods of committing suicide. There have been instances where internet chat rooms have been used by a person, or even a group of persons, to urge another to commit suicide. Recent studies have shown that in some cases such internet chat room discussions have led to a person attempting suicide, and sometimes successfully. This research points to evidence that vulnerable individuals were compelled so strongly by others to take their own lives that they felt to back out or seek help would involve losing face. Disturbingly, ABC Online recently reported on a trend in Japan towards strangers arranging suicide pacts over internet suicide chat rooms. According to that report, over a threemonth period in late 2004 at least 35 people made suicide pacts online. Tragically, these people then met in small groups in remote locations and died together. The proposed offences recognise the harm that can be done by those who use the internet with a destructive intent. The bill seeks to protect vulnerable individuals by preventing the use of the internet in this way but does not seek to stifle legitimate debate on euthanasia or suicide related issues. Clarifying provisions have been included within this legislation which provide that a person is not guilty of these offences merely because the person uses a carriage service to engage in public discussion or debate about, or advocates reform of the law relating to, euthanasia or suicide. These provisions make it clear that the offences only apply where the person intends to use the material concerned to counsel or incite suicide, or to promote or provide instruction on a method of committing suicide. These offences complement existing customs regulations prohibiting the physical importation or exportation of suicide kits and information related to those kits. The new offences will carry the same maximum penalty as the customs offences of $110,000 for an individual. This bill was initially introduced on 4 August 2004 but lapsed with the prorogation of parliament. The government remains committed to the protection of the vulnerable in our society. The importance of the bill is reflected by its early reintroduction. This bill contains important measures that will protect our most vulnerable and help to prevent the internet from being used for destructive purposes towards those individuals. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA BILL (No. 1) 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
5,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Most of the amendments contained in this bill have previously been introduced into parliament as a customs tariff proposal. Part 1 of the bill creates a new item 22 in schedule 4 of the tariff with effect from 18 October 2003. The new item replaces the existing item 22, which relates to goods for use in oil and gas exploration. The extended coverage of new item 22 accommodates changes in technology in the oil and gas industries. The new item will reduce the cost of certain goods imported for use directly in connection with exploration for, and discovery of, oil and gas deposits and the preproduction development of wells on those deposits by allowing duty-free entry of those goods, provided that substitute goods are not available from Australian manufacturers. These amendments not only address industry concerns but also, by reducing the costs of imports, maximise the recovery of Australia's petroleum resources, which is consistent with the government's objective of encouraging a supportive environment for investment and enhancing productivity. Part 2 of the bill contains amendments to chapter 29 of the tariff to allow the herbicide paraquat dichloride, containing an emetic added for safety reasons, to be classified in subheading 2933.39.00 of that chapter. By enabling the inclusion of paraquat dichloride with an added emetic in subheading 2933.39.00, the same duty outcome of free is achieved as for paraquat dichloride that contains other allowable safety measures such as stenching agents. Part 3 of this bill amends item 68 in part III of schedule 4 to the tariff to extend the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement (Textile Clothing and Footwear Provisions) Scheme. On 8 August 2004, the Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that this scheme would be extended for seven years, to 31 December 2011, from its current legislated end date of 31 December 2004. The scheme currently provides for the duty-free entry of certain textiles, clothing and footwear from forum island countries covered by the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement. Parts 5 and 6 of this bill amend the rates of customs duty payable on certain alcohol and tobacco products in accordance with the consumer price index (CPI) adjustments in February and August of each year. The US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Act 2004 that implemented the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was introduced into parliament prior to the announcement of the August 2004 CPI figures. Consequently, this act, when enacted, contained duty rates that had not been adjusted in accordance with the CPI. The amendments in part 5 are effective from 1 January 2005, when the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement came into effect, and those in part 6 are effective from 1 February 2005, when a further CPI increase occurred. These amendments ensure that rates of duty on United States originating alcohol and tobacco products are consistent with duty rates for the same non-US originating goods, in accordance with the terms of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. The remaining amendments in this bill are administrative in nature and do not impact on customs duties. I commend the measures to the House and present an explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT (RICE) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
6,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The primary purpose of this bill is to increase the existing maximum allowable rate for the rice research and development (R&D) levy from $2 to $3 per tonne. This proposed increase has been progressed after a request from the rice industry. The rice industry is now facing a third year of significant drought related production downturns which have placed financial pressures on the industry's R&D programs due to subsequent reductions in levy revenue. The rice industry is seeking an increase in the maximum allowable levy rate to provide them with the flexibility to better manage future fluctuations in levy revenue. This will allow the industry to ensure adequate funding is maintained for core R&D programs. The government believes that by using innovation to drive productivity growth and boost profitability on farms, Australia's rural industries can continue to play a key part in maintaining our national prosperity. Australia's rural industries have also long recognised this principle and have shown a long standing and widespread willingness to invest in innovation through industry-wide levies. In this context the government was happy to put forward these changes to assist the rice industry manage their R&D programs into the future and for producers to continue to take up R&D outputs, whether they be to adopt new practices or bring out new products. The bill will also provide mechanisms for the introduction of regulations for the implementation of the operative rate of the rice R&D levy. Currently, changes to the rate of the levy are done through a ministerial declaration published in the Gazette. This bill enables these functions to be rolled into new regulations which will be tabled soon after this bill receives royal assent. By switching to regulations it will bring the operation of the rice levy into line with the majority of other primary industry levies. It will also provide a greater level of scrutiny by parliament than is available under the existing arrangements. The government will only favourably consider a request to raise the operative levy rate beyond the current $2 cap if the request demonstrates compliance with the government's levy principles and guidelines. These guidelines include a requirement that there be widespread industry support for such a request. The current operative levy rate will not be affected by this bill. This bill reflects the government's willingness to assist rural industries to develop internal capacity to manage significant threats to ongoing sustainability, such as drought. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned.

7,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, I am very pleased to announce that the major components of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 have come into effect as of 1 January this year. These have been groundbreaking reforms contained in the new legislative framework and they give universities access to the funding they need to deliver world-class higher education, with a focus on quality learning outcomes. Laying the foundation for this is an increase in public investment in the sector of around $2.6 billion over five years from 2004. The Australian government will provide some $11 billion over 10 years in new support for the higher education sector from 2004. There will be almost 36,000 new Commonwealth supported student places, otherwise known as HECS places, added to the higher education sector over the next five years and more funding for each Commonwealth supported student, linked to improvements in how universities are actually managed. In addition, there are extra funds for regional universities and new schemes and funding to encourage excellence in teaching, more collaboration between institutions and a renewed focus on equity. There will also be new places for the national ity areas of nursing and teaching and special fee arrangements to encourage people to enrol in these fields. The benefits to the Australian higher education system will become increasingly apparent as students and higher education providers take full advantage of the opportunities that the reforms provide. The Australian government is taking this opportunity to make a number of technical revisions to refine and enhance the effective implementation of the act and give certainty to higher education providers and students. This bill now before us will, in particular, enable higher education providers to respond to changes in student demand in a more flexible way. It also ensures that students are properly informed and protected about decisions made by higher education providers which affect them. Included in the bill is a series of measures designed to clarify the requirements for the review of decisions made by higher education providers in relation to students. The amendments will ensure that providers have clear advice on their responsibilities, and students will be well informed of their rights and the procedure they need to follow if they wish to seek a review of a decision. The bill also includes amendments to the act which will give higher education providers more flexibility to deal with changes in demand and supply for particular courses or units of study. The changes will enable providers to publish more than one schedule of student contribution amounts and tuition fees per year, and specify more than one date for the publishing of census data and equivalent full-time student load values. The bill also includes technical amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 which clarify the tax file number reprior- quirements for students. These amendments will build on the implementation of the new arrangements under the Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future package of reforms. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA NA (REGULAR REVIEWS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.30 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Telecommunications Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005 amends the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to insert provisions for a framework for future, regular and independent reviews of the adequacy of regional telecommunications services. The bill also amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to enable the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to delegate administrative decision-making powers to the Australian Communications Authority in respect of any licence condition placed on Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote areas and makes a consequential amendment to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. This legislation is part of a package that delivers on the government's commitments to implement its response to recommendations of the regional telecommunications inquiry as a matter of priority. The measures contained in this bill are directed at ‘future proofing' regional telecommunications so that: - service quality is maintained into the future; - when future services start being provided, rural Australia will not miss out or face unreasonable delays; and - other benefits that Telstra currently provides as a result of its regional presence do not diminish. The provisions in this bill were previously linked with the Telstra sale legislation. However, these provisions have now been delinked to fulfil the government's commitment to lock in its response to regional telecommunications inquiry recommendations as a matter of priority and to support its commitment not to progress any further sale of Telstra until arrangements are in place to Legislation ensure that Australians have access to adequate telecommunications services. The bill concerns regional telecommunications inquiry recommendations relating to: - regular independent reviews into the adequacy of telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia; and - the need for Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Though forming part of the government's ‘future proofing' package for regional telecommunications, introduction of this bill will not preclude the government from taking further action as warranted to safeguard the ongoing needs of regional Australia. Changes in Telstra's ownership status will not affect the government's ability to protect the interests of consumers, competitors and the public generally. The regional protection measures introduced in this bill, along with general consumer regulatory safeguards such as the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, price controls, the network reliability framework, and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, will be maintained into the future. The bill provides for establishment of a Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee to review the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia on a regular basis. The key objectives of these provisions are, firstly, to provide a high degree of certainty for regional, rural and remote communities that the review process will result in improved, equitable access to important telecommunications services and, secondly, that the reviews are independent from the executive government of the day. To provide a high degree of ongoing certainty to the public, the reviews must occur at a minimum of five-yearly intervals, there must be public consultation and the government of the day must publicly respond to recommendations made by the committee. To assure independence from government, the bill provides safeguards regarding the appointment of the chair of the committee and other committee members and in relation to conflicts of interest that may arise. The minister is currently developing a licence condition and expects to make an announcement on this shortly. However, to provide additional flexibility to the government about how the local presence arrangements will be administered into the future, the bill also clarifies that, if a licence condition is imposed on Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural or remote parts of Australia, the minister may delegate the power to make decisions of an administrative nature to the Australian Communications Authority. The actual detail of Telstra's local presence obligations will be spelt out in a licence condition currently being developed. The licence condition will provide a high degree of certainty and reassurance: - for regional, rural and remote communities-that an effective Telstra local presence will be maintained; and - for Telstra-that it will maintain the right to manage its regional operations autonomously and in its commercial interests. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. PAYMENT SYSTEMS (REGULATION) AMENDMENT BILL 2005 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.36 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 sets out the regulatory framework governing the operation of Australia's payments system. The act allows the Reserve Bank to designate a payment system where this is in the public interest. Designation of a payment system allows the Reserve Bank to establish rules of access for participants, determine standards, give enforceable directions to participants and arbitrate disputes on technical standards. The Reserve Bank has used its powers under the act to establish standards for interchange fees for the credit card schemes operated by Visa, MasterCard and Bankcard. These standards came into effect on 1 July 2003. The Reserve Bank's reforms to the credit card payments system have three objectives. Firstly, they aim to ensure that fees charged to merchants and consumers for credit card services reflect the costs of their provision. Secondly, they aim to ensure that fees and charges are transparent to the consumer. Thirdly, they aim to promote competition between credit card service providers. Information released by the Reserve Bank shows that these reforms have delivered significant reductions in credit card merchant service fees. This has resulted in an estimated annual saving to business of over $500 million. This amount is $100 million more than originally forecast. Consumers can expect the benefits of these savings to flow through due to the competitive nature of Australian retailing. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that financial institutions will not contravene the competition provisions in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 by complying with the Reserve Bank's standards for credit card interchange fees. It does this by specifically authorising conduct carried out in compliance with the Reserve Bank standards. An exemption from Part IV of the Trade Practices Act is currently contained in the Payment Systems (Regulation) Regulations 2003. However, it will cease to operate after 30 June 2005. This bill provides a permanent replacement for the current regulations. It would also enable a similar authorisation to be extended to conduct carried out in compliance with Reserve Bank standards for other payment systems, such as EFTPOS or Visa Debit, in the event that such standards are made. The amendments contained in this bill are technical in nature. They do not represent a change in government policy. The bill will provide ongoing commercial certainty for payments system participants. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be considered immediately. Senate's amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (after line 20), after section 5F, insert: 5G Hospital treatments by accredited podiatrists (podiatric surgeons) (1) Hospital costs in relation to theatre fees, bed costs and prostheses incurred by private patients treated by accredited podiatrists may be eligible for benefits provided from the applicable benefit arrangements (hospital tables) of registered health benefit organizations for persons with appropriate cover. (2) Benefits for professional fees of accredited podiatrists may be provided from the ancillary health benefit tables of registered health benefit organizations for persons with appropriate cover. (3) The role of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman includes monitoring the operation of provisions relating to accredited podiatrists within this Act and the Health Insurance Act 1973 and reporting and acting on complaints. (2) Schedule 1, item 7, page 5 (line 16), omit “prosthesis”, substitute “prosthesis, or the provision of the prosthesis is associated with podiatric treatment by an accredited podiatrist”. (3) Schedule 1, page 7 (after line 25), after item 8, insert: 8A After paragraph 82ZS(1)(c) Insert: (ca) an accredited podiatrist; (4) Schedule 1, page 7 (after line 25), after item 8, insert: 8B At the end of section 82ZSA Add: ; or (d) the level of hospital costs being met by registered health benefit organizations under their applicable benefit arrangements in relation to patients of accredited podiatrists; or (e) restrictions on access by an accredited podiatrist or the patient of an accredited podiatrist to hospital and day hospital facilities covered by an applicable hospital purchaser provider agreement or minimum benefit determination (default benefit) under paragraph (bj) of Schedule 1. (5) Schedule 1, item 11, page 8 (line 7), omit “prosthesis”, substitute “prosthesis, or the provision of the prosthesis is associated with podiatric treatment by an accredited podiatrist”. (6) Schedule 1, item 12, page 10 (after line 6), after subitem (1), insert: (1A) The review must include: (a) an assessment of the adequacy of informed financial consent arrangements; and (b) an examination of the extent of outof-pocket costs experienced by patients for clinically appropriate theses.  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.40 a.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. There were two groups of amendments accepted by the government in the Senate. One relates to the access to health insurance benefits for prostheses implanted by podiatric surgeons, a small group of practitioners, and some related matters. The other relates to the terms of reference for the independent review. The government has accepted amendments about the private health insurance treatment of podiatric surgeons. Besides having very constructive discussions with Senator Lees in the Senate, who moved the amendment, the government also considered the majority report on the Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005. In the light of the available evidence it became clear to the government that there is a case for some changes to the bill to recognise services provided by podiatric surgeons. After all, if you go to any hospital for any reason, and you have hospital cover, it is only reasonable that you can claim hospital benefits. Amendments to legislation last year clarified this for nursing and hospital accommodation costs, and it is reasonable to ensure that prothesis benefits are covered in the same way. The amendments also refer to theatre fees which are subject to contracts between health funds and hospitals. There are administrative arrangements to facilitate and improve the contracting arrangements for theatre services involving funds, hospitals and providers. Nevertheless, theatre fees are a hospital cost and, while there is no impediment to podiatric surgeons' access to them under existing legislation, it is acceptprosable to recognise them here. The government also note that nothing in these amendments compels health funds to offer cover for podiatric surgery services and related costs and only agree to the amendments on this basis. But we acknowledge that they do make the case for funds offering such cover more persuasive. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has been consulted and has indicated that his office has the capacity to take on this additional reference. The Minister for Health and Ageing will be writing to ask him formally to monitor matters and complaints in relation to the cover of podiatric surgery. The government, therefore, will not oppose these amendments. In terms of the review of the terms of reference, although the opposition has claimed credit for forcing the government to accept an independent review of the operation of the new prostheses arrangementsMr Gavan O'Connor interjecting The reality is, as the shadow minister well knows, that we agreed with the medical devices industry and other stakeholders the best part of a year ago that a review after about two years was both desirable and necessary. The independent review and its terms of reference incorporated into the bill by the opposition were just the sort of things we indicated we would commission. The Senate amendments around informed financial consent and cost to consumers are also consistent with what we had envisaged. Therefore we have accepted them, and we thank the opposition for their support in these matters. They are always a bit behind the eight ball but they like to pretend that they are in front of it on occasion. Mr Gavan O'Connor interjecting member for Corio today. These amendments make an already good bill better. The provision of prostheses under private health insurance will improve as a result of these new arrangements. Even the opposition agrees to that. Passing this bill will give certainty to processes under way and help to reduce cost pressure on premiums without depriving patients of choice when it comes to joint and lens replacements, heart pacemakers and stents, and a very wide range of vital medical technology. I remind the House that the new arrangements will ensure that there will be clinically appropriate and gap-free prostheses options for any one treatment. No-one will be forced to be out of pocket; there will always be no-gap choices. I commend the amendments to the House. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 March, on motion  That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Fitzgibbon moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) constraining the economy's productive capacity by failing to build on Labor's competition reforms; (2) its failure to adopt all the recommendations of the Report of the Senate Inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business; (3) its failure to promptly introduce appropriate criminal sanctions for cartel-type behaviour; (4) limiting the ability of small businesses to make their own choices in relation to appointing agents in collective bargaining negotiations; and (5) endangering small business collective bargaining reforms by including them in the same bill as the highly contentious changes to the merger approval regime and third line forcing laws”.",24
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,The question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,30
9,Mr ANDREN,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I wish to make a brief contribution to the tail end of the second reading debate on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005, particularly in relation to collective bargaining. This bill represents the government's response to the Dawson review of the Trade Practices Act and the recommendations that followed from that review. I would like to make a contribution to the debate on this bill insofar as it relates to businesses and collective bargaining. Specifically, I would like to speak about how these changes may relate to orchardists from my electorate and other small businesses, such as smash repairers. In both industries, the smaller grower or repairer is at a considerable disadvantage in dealing individually with the large-scale wholesale markets and retail grocery chains or motor vehicle insurance companies respectively. I have been working closely with both these groups over the past five years in their efforts to implement mandatory codes of conduct to help level the playing field in their business tionships with their bigger brothers in the industry. In the absence of mandatory codes, the right to collective bargaining is a reasonable though far from perfect option for small businesses in these industries in particular. Schedule 3 of this bill provides the mechanism by which small businesses may notify the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of their intention to enter into arrangements for collective bargaining with a target business or corporation, whether that corporation is a supplier or a buyer. Currently such arrangements can only be entered into if they are first authorised by the ACCC-a more thorough and timeconsuming process. The commission will authorise such an arrangement if it decides it will result in a net benefit to the public. The notification process proposed under section 93AB means that the onus will be on the commission to object to the proposed collective bargaining arrangement within a period of 14 days. This period may be changed to 28 days by regulation, as suggested in the minister's second reading speech. I am concerned that this bill lacks a clear definition of what constitutes a small business, and, therefore, those businesses eligible to enter into collective bargaining arrangesmall ments. Under section 93AB(4) a corporation may enter into collective bargaining with their target if they do not make more than $3 million in transactions with that target in any 12-month period. Whilst this limit will encompass small businesses, it does not preclude medium and large businesses, those with access to far greater resources to negotiate the terms of their business relationships. I also note the need for some account to be taken of those businesses with large turnover but small profit margins, such as fuel retailers; hence the opportunity for the minister to prescribe different limits by regulation. But rela- again, this may lead to medium and larger businesses attempting to enter into collective bargaining. The only parliamentary scrutiny available here would be if a disallowance motion were moved and supported. Come July, the success of such a motion is highly unlikely unless moved by a government member. Midway through last year, I supported my local growers' calls for collective bargaining rights as they waited for movement from the government on the Buck report-its review of the voluntary code conduct for the grocery industry. The vast majority of opinion amongst those growers was that the voluntary code had not been successful and it was time to move on to a mandatory code. Being realists, these producers know that only a mandatory code of conduct will help everyone in their industry get a fair price for their produce. Following the election, the government made good on its commitment to begin the development of a mandatory code of conduct to, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister: ... improve the day-today business relationships between fruit and vegetable growers and buyers ... There will be a seven-step process before the nature and detail of the mandatory code is decided. Nothing is likely to happen in a hurry, so this bill, allowing collective bargaining in the meantime, may help improve the lot of growers in my electorate. Whether it does or not remains to be seen. Similarly, Calare's smash repairers have been seeking support, initially through the ACCC and now through the Productivity Commission, in their business relations with the four large motor vehicle insurance companies. A group of smash repairers not only from the Calare electorate but from all over western New South Wales came to me with their concerns, which led to our submission to the ACCC on this particular issue. That helped highlight the fact that many smash repairers feel that they are in no-win position, faced with rising costs from council regulations about waste products and the like and yet screwed right down to the boards in their ability to have any flexibility in meeting those added costs given the position of the insurance companies. They are looking at the very least for a code of conduct that can regulate their industry. Since 2001 I have assisted repairers to put their case for regulation of their relationship with the insurance companies, who are able to set the terms and conditions of work done for insurance customers. The repairers claim that hourly rates paid for various repair jobs have not increased for over a decade, and that the times allotted by the insurers for the completion of work is completely unrealistic. The honouring of lifetime guarantees offered by the insurance company also falls to the repairer and is at the repairer's cost. Many repairers also have issues with the preferred repairer programs that potentially lock independent repair shops out of work, especially now with the introduction of a new premium for some policies if motorists want to have their vehicles fixed by the repairer of their choice. This issue is currently under examination by the ACCC also. Certainly, collective bargaining, given a workable arrangement can be reached, could be beneficial in this industry if a mandatory code of practice is unlikely. But both the orcharding industry and the smash repair industry are suggesting that a mandatory code is by far the preferred option. In conclusion, I support the collective bargaining provisions for small businesses in this bill. Like the previous speaker in the debate last evening, I share the reservations of the opposition in excluding unions or union officers from being involved in the collective bargaining notification process, especially where industry bodies are free to be involved, and I support this particular aspect of the second reading amendment. As with voluntary student unionism, it seems the very word ‘union' triggers something like a pavlovian response from the government, and I really question the reasoning behind this exclusion in this piece of legislation. I will be interested to see any amendments to this bill when it returns from the Senate. It begs the question as to why substantive amendments are not being debated here-they should be. It may be one bonus of the post-June setup and the change in the political landscape when I would hope that, at last, substantial amendments can be introduced here in the people's house and debated, as they should be, and then moved on to the other place if necessary, rather than using the Senate as the first option in all cases. Amendments should be introduced here and debated, whatever their eventual fate.  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.55 a.m.)-The government would like to thank those honourable members who participated in the debate on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. This bill implements the government's response to the independent review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act in 2003, chaired by Sir Daryl Dawson. The Dawson review is the most comprehensive review of the competition provisions of the act for a decade. After extensive and comprehensive consultation and consideration, the Dawson review concluded that the competition provisions of the act have served Australians well. The committee made a total of 43 recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the competition and authorisation provisions as well as the administration of the This bill forms the first part of the government's extensive trade practices package announced during its last term to benefit Australian consumers and business, including important changes to the misuse of market power, unconscionable conduct provisions and the criminalisation of cartel behaviour. These latter measures are being developed and consulted on with the states and territories in accordance with the intergovernmental conduct code agreement, and legislation giving effect to these measures will be introduced later this year. The overall theme of the Dawson review is that the competition provisions should protect the competitive process rather than particular competitors. The government strongly supports this view of the act and has accepted the vast majority of the Dawson review recommendations. This bill will improve existing ACCC processes by providing for greater accountability, transparency and timeliness in decision making and reducing the regulatory burden on business. Following the government's response, the government undertook the three-month consultation period with the states and territories and the 35-day voting period on the text of the original bill required by the conduct code agreement. All eight jurisdictions have approved that bill and the government is eager to see early access to the benefits that are contained in the bill for business, both big and small, and for consumers. The new processes and requirements include a new voluntary former merger clearance process to operate in parallel with the informal clearance system. It will provide definite time limits for consideration by the ACCC that business can rely on and the certainty that a clearance is legally binding. Merger authorisation applications will be considered directly by the tribunal, instead of the ACCC, to ensure commercially realistic act. timeframes for applications and to prevent strategic appeals by third parties. Nonmerger authorisations will have strict time limits for consideration by the ACCC and, of particular advantage to small business, the ACCC will be able to waive the filing fee. The bill will reduce the regulatory burden on small business by introducing a notification process for collective bargaining by small business dealing with large business as an alternative to the authorisation process. Third line forcing can be beneficial and procompetitive and will be subjected to a substantial lessening of competition tests instead of being prohibited per se, consistent with other forms of exclusive dealing. Serious cartel type conduct, such as exclusionary and price-fixing provisions, will continue to be prohibited outright. Genuine joint ventures will provide a defence on competition grounds. Dual-listed companies will be treated on the same basis as other companies under the TPA. The ACCC will have a new ability to seize evidence, but this will be anced by the requirement to obtain a warrant from a magistrate. The bill provides higher penalties for a contravention of the act, allows persons to be disqualified from directing or managing a corporation and prohibits the indemnification of officers against the imposition of pecuniary penalty. This will ultimately be of great benefit to consumers, providing a strong incentive for companies and those responsible for managing company business to comply with the act. Other measures help ensure the constitutional validity of the act's national application and apply the competition provisions to local government, insofar as it carries on business consistent with the act's application to the other levels of government. The opposition has been critical of some of the provisions contained in this bill, including the new process for merger authorisations, the amendments to the treatment of third line forcing and the collective bargaining provisions. Let me first go to merger authorisations. The opposition indicates it will oppose the merger authorisation proposals in the bill. The Dawson review considered many submissions and concluded that the current merger authorisation process was commercially unrealistic for many merger proposals, particularly because of delays arising from third-party intervention. Consideration of merger authorisation by one body, the Australian Competition Tribunal, will streamline processes and provide certainty for business. It will also prevent regulatory gaming. The tribunal is the appropriate body to consider questions of public benefit. The tribunal is constituted of members with a wide range of skills, experience and community backgrounds, including in industry, commerce, economics, law and public administration. This debate has indicated that there is some confusion as to how the authorisation balprovisions will operate. The Dawson report did not recommend, and this bill does not implement, changes to the tests for assessing mergers. Section 50 will continue to prohibit mergers that substantially lessen competition. The public benefit test for authorisation will continue to be whether there is a net or overall benefit after any detriment to the public resulting from the conduct is taken into account. Applicants will not be able to bypass the ACCC. The bill requires the ACCC to provide information, reports or any other assistance that the tribunal requires to reach its authorisation decision. Applicants will only seek authorisation if there is a risk of breaching the competition test. If competition has not already been assessed by the ACCC in the formal clearance process, the tribunal will be able to seek the ACCC's views on the level of competition in the market as part of its process of considering net benefit or detriment. The views of third parties will continue to be considered as part of the new merger processes by both the tribunal and the ACCC. The competition provisions are not there to decide between the interests of particular parties but to maintain the competitive process and overall public benefit. Third parties will not be able to leverage unfair advantage by strategic interventions once a decision has been made. Let me now go to the third line forcing issues. The Dawson review recommended, and the government's bill will ensure, that the prohibition of third line forcing will cease to be a per se prohibition and instead be subject to a substantial lessening of competition test, consistent with other forms of exclusive dealing. This is because third line forcing can be beneficial and competitive. For example, the ACCC report into shopper dockets and retail petrol prices schemes considers that there are significant benefits to the public, they have encouraged competition and lowered prices in the fuel market. Small businesses-for example, franchisees-are protected like any other business by a number of safeguards elsewhere in the Trade Practices Act. Section 46 proscribes misuse of market power by corporations which have a substantial degree of power in a market, and section 51AC provides specific protection against unconscionable conduct in business transactions. The government's response to the Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business announced a number of changes to further clarify the prohibition on the misuse of market power and extend the application on the prohibition of unconscionable conduct in business transactions. Legislation to implement these changes will be introduced into parliament later this year. I turn to collective bargaining. In considering public benefit and detriment arising from proposed collective bargaining arrangements, the ACCC will have particular regard to the government's intention that the collective bargaining provisions not be used to pursue matters affecting employment relationships. The Trade Practices Act is for the promotion of competition and fair trading and the provision of consumer protection, not the pursuit of employee entitlements. This is further reinforced by the amendment to the bill which makes a notification invalid if it is lodged on behalf of a small business by a trade union, its officers or a person act- Henry, S. ing on the direction of the trade union. This will ensure that employment relationships continue to be regulated through workplace relations legislation and not trade practices legislation. The new notification process is aimed at straightforward arrangements involving small businesses and a single target. Unions may appropriately continue to apply as for authorisation of more complex arrangements-for example, those involving multiple targets. In conclusion, business, and particularly small business, is eagerly awaiting the benefits that this bill will confer. I am hopeful the government will receive the support that is needed to streamline and improve the administration and enforcement of the act. I commend the bill to the House.

Third Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.17 a.m.)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time.",30
10,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"I would like to take the opportunity to speak very briefly to the third reading, conscious of the fact that the standing orders and House of Representatives Practice offer only a very restricted debate on the third reading. I commit to taking about two minutes. I only have cause to speak to the third reading as a means of taking the opportunity of having the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer answer a couple of simple questions. I will only keep the House for a couple of minutes. During his summary, the parliamentary secretary made the point that this bill had run the gauntlet of the COAG conduct code. In other words, consultation had been undertaken with the states. However, I note that this bill is not in the same form as it was when last presented to the House just prior to the 2004 election. I pose the question to the parliamentary secretary as to whether the states have been consulted once again since the change was made to the bill-the change, of course, being section 93AB(9), which is the union exclusion clause. I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to that question. The other question he did not answer appropriately was the question of the difference between certain small business sectors and others. Labor is very firmly of the view that this new provision-the streamlined notification process for collective bargainingshould be available to all small business, including the tens of thousands of ownerdrivers, building contractors and chicken growers out there in the Australian business world. I made the point to the parliamentary secretary by way of interjection that I fail to see what the difference is between a grower of beef and a grower of chickens. Obviously, a beef grower would use an organisation such as the National Farmers FederationMr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is in order to raise matters on the third reading but not to reopen and canvass the debate generally. The member for Hunter is clearly, I think, infringing against the provisions of the standing order in the way in which he is seeking to cross examine the parliamentary secretary. If he had wanted to ask questions he should have done so during the consideration in detail stage.",35
11,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The minister raises a very important point of which I know the member for Hunter is fully aware. I would ask him to restrict himself to the strict third reading debate.,36
12,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"I point out to the minister that the consideration in detail stage was not available to me, because no technical amendments were moved. But I simply pose the question: what is the difference between a beef grower represented by the NFF and a chicken grower represented by the AWU? Can I further ask the parliamentary secretary why he is allowingMr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The House of Representatives Practice makes it very clear that debate is limited to the contents of the bill. It states: ... it has been held that the debate on the motion for the third reading is limited to the bill as agreed to by the House to that stage. It is not in order to reopen debate or repeat debate on matters discussed on the motion for the second reading or during the consideration in detail. Clearly, the member is going beyond that and he ought to be not only",36
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I would ask that the member for Hunter take recognition of the points raised by the minister and restrict his debate.,36
14,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"The question is: what is the difference between a beef grower represented by the NFF and a chicken grower represented by the AWU? The first question I asked, which the parliamentary secretary seems not to have understood, is: was the COAG process revisited after the bill was amended? The last question is: how can the government explain why unions should be involved in the authorisation process but not the notification process? I invite him to answer those questions during this third reading debate. Over to you, Parliamentary Secretary. Mr Ruddock-You're asking me to breach the standing orders like you. Mr Adams-Why don't you answer the question? Why don't you answer the political point that he's making?",36

NA AMENDMENT (RIGHT OF ENTRY) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 December 2004, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time.",36
17,Mr GRIFFIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I am here today to talk very briefly to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004. As has probably been noticed by people in the gallery, there is a little bit of confusion occurring on the floor of the parliament as to what is happening at the moment, which is a result of some changes in circumstances regarding the availability of some speakers at this particular time. The bill we are looking at relates to workplace relations and right of entry, and it raises the important issue of the conduct of industrial relations in this country. I would like to take the opportunity to talk about the importance of right of entry to the conduct of business of unions who are representing their members with respect to their rights in the workplace. Right of entry as a general concept is very important for union officials. I was a union official myself in years gone by, a long time ago-many more years ago than I would like to remember. The capacity to access your members and potential members is a very important role for any union official. It goes to the very heart of being able to represent workers in a workplace. If you are not able to access those members or those potential members then the capacity to recruit, to represent and to be there to deal with the concerns of members is severely limited. That has a tremendous impact on the capacity of unions to represent their members. Those opposite have a real problem with unions and seek to blame them for many things. The way this place tends to work at the moment is that the government have two or three major complaints about almost anything: it is either the union's fault or the opposition's fault for just about anything you would like to name. When it comes to the economy and interest rates, the complaint is that we have not had workplace reform, which is just absolute rubbish. Many experts have been commenting on the current economy, interest rates and the current account deficit. Attempts to blame unions and the industrial relations situation as major factors are just plain ridiculous. I suspect this government would blame us for the drought if there were one on at the moment. They certainly take that opportunity whenever they can. Right of entry, as I was saying earlierand I apologise to those in the gallery for the disjointed nature of this speech-is crucial to very the operations of the union official. When I was a union official I had to get in there to talk to my members and I had to be in there to be able to represent them. If you have difficulties with employers in gaining access, it really strikes at the very heart of your capacity to represent. Those opposite often say: ‘The problem with unions is that they don't represent. The problem with unions is that they go in and they just take charge and take control.' But in fact if you want them to be able to represent and to do the right thing by workers then you have got to give them that access and that opportunity to get in there and do the job. It is interesting that this government talks so much about the importance of family and community. The role of unions in representing people within workplaces is very important in this country, and they are a very important part of a lot of local communities. You really need to make sure that unions have access to workplaces in order to properly represent their members. If you do not, you really undermine the whole point and the whole principle behind unionism-collective activity on behalf of workers-and you really undermine the capacity of workers to be represented properly. Although there is no doubt that there are many good employers out there, the fact of the matter is-again speaking as a union official in a previous life-that I have actually dealt with employers who have been unreasonable and unfair around the question of allowing representatives into workplaces to look after the interests of their members. I have had employers on occasions endeavour to deny me access to consider legitimate claims and to talk to workers about what is in their interests. Quite often, particularly in areas that are not heavily unionised, you find that the workers themselves are nervous about maintaining their employment and are open to intimidation in certain circumstances. They need to be able to see their officials. They need to be able to get information about what their rights are and what the responsibilities of employers are in order to make sure they can better look after themselves and have people like union officials looking after them. With those few commentsMr Billson-Gripping comments, too!",37

APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI NA AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA PARTNERSHIP) BILL 2004-2005 Cognate bill: APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2004-2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 March, on motion by Mr Costello: That this bill be now read a second time.",38
20,Mr RUDD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"The human impact of the Boxing Day tsunami is beyond the comprehension of all Australians and all people of the world. As we in Australia watched the casualty figures rise exponentially in late December and early January it was difficult not to become numbed by the sheer extent of the horror wrought by this disaster. The Indonesian province of Aceh was of course the region worse hit by the tsunami on 26 December 2004. The latest official figures from the Indonesian government put the tsunami death toll at 124,573 with the number of estimated missing at 111,745. I note that, unless positively identified, missing persons will only be officially classified as dead after one year has elapsed. As a result, the final death toll could be over 230,000 in Indonesia alone. The financial impact, particularly in the province of Aceh, has been nothing short of catastrophic. A preliminary damage and loss assessment prepared by international agencies, including the World Bank, has estiat mated the total loss and damage as a result of the tsunami in Indonesia as 41.4 trillion Indonesian rupiah, which is $US4.45 billion or $A5.61 billion. While the impact on Indonesia's national economy overall is estimated to be moderate, the same cannot be said for the impact on the Acehnese economy. The estimated value of the damage and loss amounts to a staggering 97 per cent of Aceh's GDP. In its report, the World Bank noted that ternational experience has shown that, when impact to GDP ratios exceed 40 per cent, the affected economy confronts significant difficulties in recovering and as a result requires substantial external assistance. It goes without saying that this is the case in Indonesia, as far as Aceh is concerned. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the associated bill, the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 20042005, are an admirable attempt by the Australian government to respond to that clearly demonstrated need for external assistance. The most recent needs assessments of international organisations and government organisations dealing with the aftermath of the disaster have highlighted the following areas of need. The first need is for housing and shelter. With an estimated 600,000 people displaced by the disaster, the reconstruction of homes and the provision of shelter must be a priority for aid agencies. A recent report of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs highlighted concerns about the poor standard of sanitation in the temporary settlements that have been built to house those who lost their homes in the tsunami. Concerns include poor drainage, lack of waste disposal areas, open defecation sites and poor construction due to sandy soil. Of course, those accommodated in the temporary settlements are the fortunate ones. A large number of displaced persons continue to live under makeshift shelters or camp with family and friends. According to the Red Cross, many of the people evacuated to Banda Aceh and Medan during the first days of the emergency now wish to return to their communities of origin. It would appear that the matter of evacuees has not yet been adequately addressed and is being investigated by UN agencies as a matter of urgency. Approximately 10,000 people were evacuinated to Banda Aceh and 18,000 to Medan in the first days after the tsunami. The second need is to generate enterprise, commerce and income creation. A feature of the disaster is that the financial impact has been largely borne by individual families, households and businesses. According to the World Bank, 78 per cent of the estimated damage and loss was to private assets and incomes-in other words, the loss of fishing boats and nets, agricultural crops, shopfronts, taxis and other means of generating income, not to mention homes and personal possessions. In addition to providing for the humanitarian needs such as food, water and shelter for those who lost their livelihoods as non- a result of the disaster, long-term projects aimed at generating enterprise and income creation will be critical to rebuilding Aceh and the health and well-being of the Acehnese people. The third need is to rebuild the rural economy. Not only were the agricultural and fishing sectors the hardest hit by the disasterthe loss in these districts made up a third of the province's total losses-but these industries were the backbone of the economies of the local communities most affected. The rebuilding of these industries is crucial to the ongoing viability of the local communities. The fourth need is the provision of public services. In addition to the damage to property and infrastructure, the human infrastructure of the province has also been in large part destroyed. In many areas the local administration no longer functions. This was most clearly demonstrated by the experience of the Zinoel Abidin Hospital in Banda Aceh. When Australian ADF personnel arrived and discovered not only a damaged building filled with debris but a hospital without staff-the nurses and doctors necessary to run it-they faced an extraordinary challenge indeed. Of the hospital's 250 nurses only 30 reported for duty. They too had been swept away by the tsunami. It is important, therefore, that local villageand regional-level councils are established and civil society organisations rebuilt as soon as possible not only to provide community leadership to play a role in rebuilding the social infrastructure of the province but also to play a role in the reconstruction and to contribute to policy decisions about the distribution of aid. The fifth need is to assist the vulnerable. I have spoken previously in this House of one of the most distressing aspects of this tragedy. UNICEF has said that children have borne the real brunt of the tsunami. While thousands of them have died, thousands have also been orphaned. There is an immediate need to identify these children and to design special programs for their rehabilitation. These were remarks I made earlier to the parliament when we addressed the immediate impact of the tsunami when the parliament resumed earlier this year. UNICEF now estimates that as many as 35,000 children have been orphaned as a result of the tsunami. Obviously, a focus of the aid effort must be on assisting the newly created vulnerable, including orphans and those who have lost the support of their extended families. On the issue of funding, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs-UNOCHA-overall aid pledged so far from or through governments, non-government organisations, businesses and private sources totals $6.28 billion. Disappointingly, governments have only paid or committed themselves to pay $721 million of the $979 million sought. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which is distributing 10,000 tents in Aceh, remains underfunded, as does the UN Development Program, which is seeking to bring hospitals back online and provide work, among other tasks. As overall funding now stands, according to a list compiled by UNOCHA, Germany is the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance, with $683 million. That is followed by the Asian Development Bank, $600 million; private donations, $576 million; Japan, about $500 million; the European Commission, $494 million; France, $443 million; Australia, $431 million; the United States, $354 million; and Canada, $351 million. Labor believes that the scale of the disaster demanded a response on the scale proposed by the Australian government. I have previously placed on the record in this place and in the community more broadly Labor's wholehearted support for the five-year $1 billion reconstruction package which has been offered to the Indonesian government by the government of Australia. The aid package to be delivered through the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development is a reflection of the concern of the Australian people for their neighbours. The package provides a good basis, a good framework and an amount of money to work with, and it indicates that we are not there for the short-term fix but hopefully for the long haul. I would, however, sound a note of caution. While Australians can feel justifiably proud of their generous response in the face of the suffering experienced by our friends and neighbours in Indonesia, I would remind the House that the spirit of giving is to give without expecting to receive in return. The government should be under no illusion that its $1 billion package has somehow bought it an enduring political advantage in Indonesia. Certainly, it has assisted in terms of improving the current tone of the Australia-Indonesian relationship, but that relationship will take a lot of work over a lot of years to repair some of the damage from the immediate past. When it comes to the needs of the people affected by the tsunami and the assistance necessary for the reconstruction of roads and hospitals, and also homes, communities and livelihoods, it is important to see that this package reaches those most in need. Of course there is no doubt that the package should be seen as a reflection of our strong and abiding friendship with Indonesia and as a statement of Australia's commitment to stand by Indonesia for the long haul. The unique proposal for the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, which will see Australian and Indonesian ministers and officials working alongside each other, provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of each other and strengthen ties between our governments and our government officials. While we support the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development in principle, we will also wait with interest for more details from the government on how the partnership will be established, who will represent both Australia and Indonesia on the partnership, how decisions about funding will be made and how the spending of the partnership will be made transparent and accountable to the parliament and the people of Australia. The opposition has received reports from Australian aid organisations operating in Aceh that one of the biggest problems hampering the efficient delivery of aid is the ficulty of coordinating donor efforts. With so many different organisations from around the world on the ground in Aceh and with so much work to do, one of the problems has been not only keeping a track of who is doing what but, disappointingly it seems, competition between aid agencies for the most prestigious work and duplication may be reducing the effectiveness of some aid efforts in Aceh. Also of concern are reports that the Indonesian government's concerns about the presence of foreign aid workers in Aceh may lead to a restriction in access for Australian aid workers. Any unreasonable restriction would hamper the ability of aid agencies to deliver the programs they asked the Australian people to support and in response to which the Australian people so warmly responded. Of course, access must be contingent always on an appropriate provision of security for those delivering the aid. Expectations are therefore high that the money so generously donated by the Australian people will be used as intended. That is important in terms of keeping trust and faith with the Australian people during the month of December and January when they gave so generously; it will also be important in terms of ensuring the generosity of the Australian people in the future when other natural disasters, regrettably, occur. While we appreciate that the fact that the brunt of the Tsunami was felt in the middle of a conflict zone and that this poses security problems for the Indonesian government, we also believe that this presents some opportunity for dealing with a long standing and, at times, intractable security problem in Aceh. We would urge the Indonesian government to seize the opportunity presented by this tragedy to rebuild not only the infrastructure of the province of Aceh but also Acehnese difcivil society and to make the most of this opportunity to reduce separatist tensions in the province and to bring about a lasting peace settlement. All countries of goodwill, all friends of Indonesia, would hope that the radical change in circumstances in Aceh which has occurred as a result of the tsunami would provide a basis for an enduring peace settlement. The aid package to Indonesia should therefore be seen as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship rather than as an exercise of Australian influence per se. Of course the potential for such positive developments in the bilateral relationship must be warmly embraced in the wake of, frankly, a tumultuous period in Australia's bilateral relations with Indonesia during the course of the Howard government. The strength of Australia's ties with its nearest neighbour has been consistently challenged by a number of the foreign policy statements and initiatives on the part of the Prime Minister. We have had the Howard doctrine, where the Prime Minister, in the period subsequent to the East Timor operation, stated that Australia should act in South-East Asia as a US deputy sheriff. At the time, that particular statement by the Prime Minister went down like a lead balloon across South-East Asia and in Indonesia in particular. The Howard doctrine, so called, is still seminared upon in various Indonesian universities and still talked about within Indonesian elites and society more broadly as indicative of where the Prime Minister's overarching foreign policy priorities lie. The original version of the Howard doctrine was further enhanced when the Prime Minister added the second plank-namely, his doctrine of regional military pre-emption. The Prime Minister publicly-and, in our judgment, irresponsibly-speculated about the possibility of future pre-emptive military strikes against our neighbours in South-East Asia. Is it any wonder that we had such significant and adverse political reactions from so many regional capitals? Just when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, thought he had done all that he could to mop up the considerable diplomatic fallout from the Prime Minister's irresponsible comments on both these questions, in the heat of the federal election campaign the Prime Minister again came over, in terms of his overall posturing on the security needs of the region, in a manner which did not play well in regional capitals and did not add substantively to Australia's inherent national security priorities and interests. The two planks of the so-called Howard doctrine were announced publicly, with a firm eye on Australia's domestic political agenda, but they came at the expense of Australia's long-term foreign policy interests in the region, which are core to this country's long-term national security interests. These are important questions for Australia's long term relationship with Indonesia and the region, and it is hoped in the post-tsunami period of our relationship with Indonesia that lessons are learned by this Prime Minister and this government in how to deal more effectively with Jakarta in the future. Recently again, however, an opportunity was presented to make amends for some of these errors in the past and to put our relationship with Indonesia and the region on a new footing. Unfortunately, when this occurred in the case of the proposal for Australia to consider signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, the Prime Minister once again indicated that he was not only lukewarm on the idea but in fact not inclined to support it at all. This again played badly with regional governments, particularly when they discovered that other allies of the United States, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, had found no difficulty whatsoever in signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the 10 countries of South-East Asia in order to place their countries' relationships with the South-East Asian region on a long-term institutional footing. Again, Labor would call upon the Prime Minister to review his position on that as further meetings with ASEAN occur in the year ahead. The government sent officials to consult with the United States and the United Kingdom on the development of its latest maritime security policy, but did so in a way which did not adequately bring our friends in Indonesia into the loop in terms of how any changes to Australian maritime and strategic doctrine may affect the long-term security relationship which we have with Jakarta. In all of these examples, the point at issue is this: whereas improvements have occurred in the Australia-Indonesia relationship as a consequence of the government's entirely positive handling of the natural disaster brought about by the tsunami, underneath that there are still enduring tensions in this relationship which have been caused by a series of foreign policy actions by the government which need to be dealt with fundamentally if we are to have a sustainable basis for our relationship with Jakarta in the future. Our position on this is that there is no more important regional relationship for Australia in South-East Asia than our relationship with Jakarta. Australia's national security interests have always attached fundamental priority to our relationship with Indonesia. If you look back to the period of the Second World War, Australia's national security interests were immediately shaped by actions which occurred in the then Dutch East Indies, as the strategic pathway to Australia. Nothing has changed in terms of this country's national geo-strategic circumstances. It behoves, therefore, any government of Australia-Liberal or Labor-to ensure that our relationship with Jakarta is placed in the best order possible. Therefore, the challenge again-and I say this in the strongest possible terms to the House-is to ensure that the good legacy which has been left by our handling of the tsunami is now built upon and that the mistakes of the past are not simply repeated, thereby undoing the good work which has now been done. Of course we have a long-term interest in South-East Asia as far as the war against terrorism is concerned as well. Here, we must be concerned about winning the battle for hearts and minds. This is a point which we in the Australian Labor Party have repeatedly emphasised not only to this government but to other governments over a long period. Our ability to confront terrorism in South-East Asia has in part depended upon the prosecution of two simultaneous campaigns. One is to enhance the capabilities of countries in South-East Asia to deal effectively with the policing, border control, immigration and intelligence related concerns in dealing with terrorist organisations or emerging terrorist organisations in their area. That is an area of work which still has much to be done within it. There are still huge capability gaps across the region which need to be addressed. I say again to this parliament that we need a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy in South-East Asia to ensure that that work is done-that there are proper, region-wide border security arrangements, that there are proper, region-wide intelligence-sharing arrangements and that there are proper, regionwide police capabilities in place, so that when terrorists are identified they can be tracked down, captured and prosecuted. That is one part of such an effective strategy. The other part is the battle for hearts and minds. Terrorist organisations are able to recruit in many impoverished parts of South East Asia because underlying social and economic conditions and political conditions make it easy for them to recruit. It is therefore important that any balanced and therefore comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy deals with this as well. That brings me back to the question of the tsunami and Australia's response to it. Plainly, through Australia's action on the tsunami, the Indonesian people in part have seen a government and people in this country responding at a humanitarian level to the needs of ordinary Indonesians right across the archipelago, particularly in Aceh and most particularly in Banda Aceh. This is to the good. But the key challenge is to ensure that that message actually reaches the whole of the Indonesian people so that those Indonesians-young Indonesians, unemployed Indonesians-who are forming part of radical militant Islamist organisations see evidence themselves that this country and its people have given generously to our friends and our brothers and sisters in Indonesia in their time of need. Part of the challenge is that the mass media in Indonesia have not uniformly ensured that that message has got through to the Indonesian people. The simple message and challenge for us in this parliament is: if we are extending $1 billion worth of assistance to the Indonesian people, are we conveying that message to the broader Indonesian community in a way which leaves a lasting legacy in our long term battle for Indonesian hearts and minds in the wider war against terrorism? The challenge that I place before the government today is as follows. We have had this extraordinary event, this tsunami. The response by the Australian people, the Australian parliament and the Australian government has been equally extraordinary. But we need a mechanism available to us to get the message out. This government, for reasons I have never understood, has removed from itself the principal mechanism available to it to transmit our message to wider South-East and East Asia-namely, Radio Australia. Not long ago, before this government was first elected, Radio Australia was one of the most powerful shortwave transmitting organisations in the world. Through the Cox Peninsula transmitters, we were able to extend a sound footprint right across South-East Asia, right across East Asia and almost into Central Asia, and across the entire Pacific, including Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. You could pick up Radio Australia's signals easily in Beijing. You could pick them up in Pakistan. You could certainly pick them up with great strength right across the Indonesian archipelago. But as a consequence of two things-firstly, the sale by the Howard government of the Cox Peninsula transmitters to a Christian evangelical organisation and, secondly, the radical reduction in funding for Indonesian language programs through the remaining Radio Australia serhere vice-we have now taken from ourselves our capacity to effectively broadcast our message through our radio system to the Indonesian people. At present, because we have a reduced transmission capability, now limited primarily to Shepparton in Victoria rather than Cox Peninsula off Darwin, our ability to transmit a signal is effectively limited to eastern Indonesia-the eastern part of the archipelago-and to Melanesia. If you look at the map, the problem for us is that Sumatra is not in eastern Indonesia; it is in western Indonesia. Therefore the ability of Radio Austo it tralia today-this day in March 2005-to send a strong and continuing signal to Sumatra and Aceh in bahasa Indonesia explaining precisely what the Australian government has done, rightly, in response to this disaster is highly limited. The only way in which Radio Australia seek to make up for this is to beg, borrow and steal broadcasting space and time, which they pay for at commercial rates, from other private transmitters in other private operations. This is not nearly as effective, comprehensive or continuing as having a professional Radio Australia service dedicated to that end. My call to the Australian government is a genuine one. It is not driven by partisan political concern of any description. Radio Australia, I say to members opposite, was Menzies' child. Menzies created Radio Australia-from memory, it was in 1939 or 1940. When we were in government, we built upon it. Other national broadcasters, whether it is Deutsche Welle, Radio Nederland, the Voice of America or the BBC, have all added to their global shortwave transmission capabilities right across the world. Why are they doing that when we, at the same time, are reducing our transmission capability? It is very simple. They recognise that, across the rural communities in particular of developing Asia, shortwave is still the principal means by which people get news. Furthermore, if you are able to use a substantial transmission footprint with a clear signal, with regular programs so that people know when to tune in, and to do so with regular language programs in the principal languages of the region, then you are able-over a period of not just months, not just years, but decades-to construct an image for Australia in the region which reflects who we are as a people and, particularly in terms of our response to the tsunami, what we have done to assist the people of Indonesia and Aceh at this particularly difficult time. As the government considers its options for the upcoming federal budget, I simply lay before it this challenge: in the various priorioperation. ties you assess in terms of expenditure, it is important that you seize this opportunity to set to rights what I think is one of the worse decisions you have made. The situation which presents itself in the post-tsunami period provides a classic opportunity for doing that. If you fail to do so, my concern is that the good work that you in the government and we, the country and the people of Australia, have done will simply be wasted and lost on the Indonesian people. When I was in Jakarta in January, and subsequently in Banda Aceh, I visited the Australian Defence Force and saw the work they were doing on the ground. I was told by officials at our embassy in Jakarta that the Indonesian language media's coverage of Australia's contribution to the clean-up in Banda Aceh was much more muted than the reality warranted but, because we did not have our own capacity to project our message through Radio Australia, we had no other means of getting the message out. This is a genuine foreign policy tragedy. Our challenge beyond the immediate issues of the tsunami and how we punch that message through to those communities across rural Indonesia that might otherwise, over time, be tempted to lend various forms of tacit, indirect or even direct support to the emergence of further terrorist organisations like Jemaah Islamiah is to ensure that that does not occur, by getting out a positive and strong message about what we in this country are doing. I repeat: we are in the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia. To succeed in that, we need good policy from the government, as its response to the tsunami has been, and we do not need a repetition of bad policy of the past. I have referred to the Howard doctrine and the doctrine of regional military pre-emption and others, including the Prime Minister's refusal to give consideration to signing ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and CoBeyond all that, we need a capacity to get our message out, and Radio Australia presents precisely that. Through the minister at the table to his colleagues in the cabinet, I say: consider the Cox Peninsula transmitters and getting a decent transmissions capacity back for Australia when you consider options for expenditure later in the year; and consider rebuilding the Indonesian language services of Radio Australia and, beyond that, services in the other principal languages of the region, including Chinese. This would mean that our enduring achievement from our response to the tsunami would lend itself to the long term foreign policy benefit of the nation. I therefore commend the bill to the House.",38
21,Mr BILSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"I am very keen to add my support to the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 provides appropriation to replenish funding for programs, including programs in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID, Australia's overseas development agency, which was diverted to enable the emergency response to those horrendous and epic events that surrounded the tsunami. The passage of these bills will ensure that the government's emergency response is not funded from other priority programs and will underpin the government's commitment, in partnership with the Indonesian government, to supporting Indonesia's reconstruction and development. Our initial response was rapid, generous and appropriate. We chose as a nation not to wait but to attend to the needs of a neighbour facing a crisis; it was characterised in the media as seeing your neighbour's house burning but not waiting for the council to give you the green light to go and help. The need was obvious and Australia, along with partners with the capacity and the tools available, responded very quickly. In hindsight, those who criticised our responsiveness as being not in keeping with a more coordinated arrangement will look back and think that that response was entirely appropriate, very timely and very much welcomed and needed. We were able to rapidly deploy consular personnel, personnel from AusAID, the Defence Force and federal and state police and other staff to assist in the days following the 26 December disaster, which was a natural disaster of epic proportions, the human cost of which continues to unfold. Over 300 officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were deployed to help deal with this crisis, including 150 of those fine individuals-outstanding public servants, every one of them-who were recalled from leave to make a very meaningful and substantial contribution to the effort. Many of them have been working in Canberra, but 36 staff were also dispatched to Thailand to establish temporary consular offices and liaise with the local authorities and citizens helping Australians. We provided crisis management and emergency hotline services around the clock, coordinating the Australian government's response. Staff from other agencies, including Centrelink, the Protective Security Coordination Centre, Customs, the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Austrade, were all brought into assist with over 84,000 phone calls from Australians concerned for their families and loved ones who may have been in the affected areas. I would like to put on the record my admiration and praise for the remarkable effort of the consular team of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all of those officials and coordinating and collaborating agencies for a remarkable job. They are extraordinary individuals who were working in very difficult circumstances. I am pleased to know that, if Australians are in need overseas, we have people of such high calibre standing ready to provide whatever assistance we are able. In the weeks following the disaster, in collaboration with state, territory and federal police and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was able to confirm the safety of over 14,300 Australians originally reported to its consular hotline. We continue to give the highest priority to assisting Australians caught up in disaster, families who lost loved ones and particularly those who are still waiting for their loved ones to be identified. Our early financial contribution of $60 million in emergency relief through AusAID was focused on supporting direct assistance to communities in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and other affected areas. In addition to those resources, civilian medical teams made a priceless contribution of expertise in primary health and preventative health which is often not reported on. We know the loss of life that the moving water caused and that still water poses an enormous threat of waterborne diseases such as cholera. Our expertise from state, federal and territory governments and from the private sector made a remarkable contribution in helping local authorities on the ground guard against still water having the same horrendous effect that moving water had caused. We had expertise made available to assess the damage to the coral reef. Another untold story is the horrendous impact that this natural disaster has had on nature herself. These are some of the most blessed parts of our planet. Many Australians are very fond of these regions; they are places where dreams are played out, where idyllic holidays are had and where adventures are enjoyed. But nature has been very unkind to herself. The coral reef and the marine ecosystems in these areas have taken an absolute hammering and, as countries seek to rebuild themselves and communities seek to re-establish livelihoods, those who rely upon the sea look out at that thing that caused them such grief and know that the sea itself has been damaged. I spoke with the President of the Seychelles and he said, with tears welling in his eyes, that the first thing that children hear when they are born in his country is the sound of the sea. Their culture, their livelihoods and many of the stories that are passed down from generathe tion to generation come from the sea. People's livelihoods centre on the sea, whether it be in the fishing industry or in the tourism industry and the like. The President spoke of how many of his citizens now fear the very thing that gives them the essence of their being. Our people are helping to assess what nature has done in terms of damage to herself around coral reefs and the marine ecosystems. Those remarkable people who work in and in collaboration with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research are sharing their expertise. There is an exercise going on call ground-truthing. I did not know what ground-truthing meant until I spoke with the ACIAR team. They are actually trying to work out what is now the reality on the ground. I mentioned what the marine ecosystems have had done to them, but in the areas where we are working the very coastal zones themselves have changed. The inundation of what I call the ‘marine muck', the debris and the sediment that has washed on to those areas, has changed not only the topography of those areas but the soil structures. Once you knew you could successfully grow a particular crop for years and years; now it is not clear what those soils will produce, what harvest they will get or what bounty and nourishment they will provide for their citizens. That work continues, and we know in some of those areas that for years ahead the soil composition will not be as it was, and work needs to be done to understand those changes and how to move forward. The Treasurer, in his excellent second reading speech, has already identified some of the key elements of the Australian government's relief effort. I would like to mention some other important efforts that are being undertaken. Australian-aid-funded experts including logisticians and engineers were critical in enabling key international organisations such as the World Food Program and the UN to set up operations. In fact, they were grateful that our aircraft were available to move food and supplies around. An Australian pharmacist made a major contribution to health care through the establishment of an emergency pharmaceuticals procurement and supply distribution network. The model used is likely to be adopted broadly in Indonesia for pharmaceutical supply. Working through Australian and international non-government organisations, Australian aid was the first to be distributed by boat to the outlying islands and remote areas on the devastated west coast of Aceh. Recognising the critical role of schools in returning communities to a normal state of affairs after the disaster, Australia has worked closely with UNICEF to make available basic materials-pencils, paper and text books-for primary school students in both state and Islamic schools in Aceh. Over 30 AusAIDfunded staff have been deployed to Aceh and Sri Lanka to monitor the humanitarian response and to ensure that funds provided reach the intended beneficiaries. In the Treasurer's remarks he outlined the enormous generosity of the Australian people and of the Australian business community. I have seen some of that working to make a remarkable contribution where World Vision Australia is funding the endeavours of the World Vision Foundation of Thailand in areas north of the tourist zone of Phuket, where they are seeking to provide temporary housing, to restore the fishing fleet and to bring in ties. expertise to help rebuild those communities. They are apocalyptic when you see them first hand and the task ahead is enormous. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 relates to the AustraliaIndonesia partnership for reconstruction and development and this bill reflects the enormous contribution Australia has made and the leading role it is playing in the international relief effort. Indonesia is the country most severely affected by the tsunami. Indonesia has warmly welcomed our efforts. During the Prime Minister's visit to Jakarta in early January, Indonesian ministers were generous in their praise of Australia. In the work I have done leading delegations on behalf of our country since, the international community has been very, very full in its praise and its recognition of the role Australia and its people have played. Indonesia's President Yudhoyono said he would never forget Australia's role. Nearly 2½ months after the tsunami, Indonesia's assistance needs are changing from immediate emergency relief to longer term reconstruction efforts. It is difficult to put into words, and therefore to put a price on, Aceh's needs. Indeed, regardless of physical reconstruction-that is, re-establishing the hardware of those communities-the human cost will endure. The software has taken a battering, and it remains still beyond comprehension that so many were lost to their families, their communities and their countries. It has been estimated that half the population of Banda Aceh has lost its life as a result of this disaster. In some places it is difficult to comprehend that communities even existed. These are landscapes which are apocalyptic and lunar in their characteristics today but which just prior to Boxing Day were vibrant, energetic and happy communiBut an important part of an eventual healing will be the reconstruction of the tsunami devastated parts of northern Sumatra, particularly in Aceh. Together, the Indonesian government and international community have been working to estimate the cost of reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas in Indonesia-arriving at a figure in the billions of dollars. The Indonesian government is well advanced on developing an Aceh reconstruction plan, which is scheduled to be released in mid March. Indonesia will need the world's help, and Australia will have an important role to play. On 5 January, 10 days after the tsunami, Prime Minister Howard and President Yudhoyono agreed to a major new bilateral program, the $1 billion Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. The partnership presents an historic opportunity to assist Indonesia's recovery from the devastating loss of life and the economic damage inflicted by the tsunami. In addressing Indonesia's reconstruction and development needs, it will also serve to our countries and our peoples closer together. The Australian government has decided to contribute $500 million in grants and a further $500 million in loans to the partnership over the next five years. The partnership is Australia's largest single aid program. These funds will be additional to Australia's existing development cooperation program and will bring Australia's commitment to Indonesia to a total of $1.8 billion over the next five years. Many people might not be aware that this year there is approximately $161 million of aid and development assistance work being provided by Australia to Indonesia. That bilateral development cooperation program aims at strengthening economic and financial management, building the institutions of democracy, promoting stability and security, and improving the quality and accessibility of government services. Australia's counterterrorism capacity building initiative for Indonesian police, financial intelligence and border control agencies is also continuing. There has been a boost in funding for improvements in access to education, including a new learning assistance program for Islamic schools. We are also expanding our program of assistance in the area of HIVAIDS prevention and treatment as well as building capacity, in partnership with the Indonesian authorities and their people, in communicable disease surveillance and control. So it would be wrong to characterise our constructive, welcomed and meaningful engagement at a development assistance level as not being something long established. We have those networks and there has been good work going on. This remarkable package represents a very substantial upscaling in that already positive engagement. The Prime Minister and the Indonesian President will jointly oversee the implementation of the Australia-Indonesia Partnership bring for Reconstruction and Development, with advice and assistance from a joint commission comprising the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Treasurer and two Indonesian ministers. The first meeting of the joint commission will take place in ever Canberra on 17 March. The partnership will support Indonesia's reconstruction and development efforts, both in Aceh and beyond. An important part of the partnership's activities will be focusing on practical efforts to rebuild physical structures, such as buildings and infrastructure. But reconstruction will require much more than bricks and mortar. Given the horrendous loss of life in Acehincluding doctors, nurses, policemen and government workers-rebuilding human capital will be equally important. As the details of the program are developed and worked through in partnership with Indonesians, a number of areas of interest are emerging, such as: support for income genthe eration and having people get back to their livelihoods; education and child welfare; water and waste management; health and human services; disaster preparedness; and governance, making sure the civil architecture is there to support vibrant and forwardlooking communities. The partnership's focus will not be restricted to just Aceh or reconstruction; the partnership provides us with an opportunity to make a major contribution to Indonesia's own reform goals and to contribute to a stable and prosperous society. It is a strategic commitment to support the new Indonesian government in its efforts to raise the living standards of the people of Indonesia. Through grants offered under the partnership, we hope that communities will be able to quickly rebuild and re-establish local infrastructure destroyed or damaged by the disaster, as well as participate in education and training opportunities. The concessional financing provided through the partnership is aimed at reconstruction, including the rehabilitation of major infrastructure. We are awaiting the finalisation of Indonesia's reconstruction plan for Aceh. This planning document will be critical in guiding programming decisions by Australia and other donors. We also have two officers seconded to Bakornas, Indonesia's official aid coordination agency. They will work with their Indonesian colleagues to determine exactly what projects will be recommended to the joint commission. Australia continues to be a firm supporter of increased harmonisation of donor programs and we will continue to work with other donors to ensure that reconstruction efforts in Aceh and elsewhere in the region are well coordinated, effective and accountable. The AIPRD's joint commission will consider a range of assistance proposals over the next five years. It will be guided by Indonesia's own assessment of its reconstruction and development needs, as well as our common experience as long standing development cooperation partners, which I alluded to earlier. Funding under the program will be available to help Indonesia advance its reform program. President Yudhoyono has outlined an ambitious reform program, includjust ing reform in the areas of economic governance and public sector management-where Australia has relevant expertise. More effective and efficient governance has the potential to provide a significant benefit to all Indonesians, including those affected by the tsunami. Funding will also be available under the partnership to support Indonesia's economic and social development plans outside Aceh-for example, to improve health and education outcomes. These appropriation bills are an important step in implementing the agreement between the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono to establish the partnership. The government will be working hard over the coming months and years to ensure that Australia's reconstruction and development assistance is delivered effectively and promptly. At the same time, we recognise that we have a clear duty to ensure that the partnership spends money in a transparent and accountable manner. The Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, though born of tragic circumstances, is an opportunity for Australia to contribute to Indonesia's reconstruction and development for the future. I also believe it is an opportunity for our nation to forge an even stronger relationship with Indonesia for the future. I commend these bills to the House.",46
22,Mr SWAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"The Labor Party welcomes Australia's commitment of $1 billion over five years to the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development as announced by the Prime Minister on 5 January. On the morning of Sunday, 26 December a severe earthquake in the ocean off the coast of northern Sumatra caused tidal waves that devastated communities in neighbouring countries and other countries in the Indian Ocean. The earthquake measured nine on the Richter scale, the world's most severe earthquake in 40 years. The tsunamis resulted in a disaster of extraordinary proportions. The death toll is now put at more than 225,000. The casualty list continues to grow and it is acknowledged that an exact death toll will never be known. The UN estimates that the tsunamis displaced one million people and deprived five million people of basic services. The human cost of the disaster is clearly beyond measurement. But this tragedy has galvanized the humanitarian spirit around the world and in Indonesia. Whilst it is impossible to replace the losses from this truly horrific event, the government of Indonesia, with the support of the international community, is taking on the important task of reconstruction. Ultimately this task is less about replacing physical sets than it is about rebuilding livelihoods and communities. This can only happen by developing a credible recovery plan, relying on an approach that truly captures the aspirations and the vision of the people of Aceh and northern Sumatra. As the needs shift from immediate relief to longer term recovery, we do need a coherent, credible and comprehensive strategy that addresses the considerable challenges raised by the scope of the disaster. As we know, Indonesia bore the brunt of the disaster, concentrated in the provinces of Aceh and north Sumatra. Hundreds of communities have been washed away, local governments have collapsed and, in many cities and villages, the tsunamis painted a line of destruction across the landscape. On one side of the line, nearly all the infrastructure must be rebuilt or rehabilitated. But the wounds on the other side are devastating as well, as the people of Aceh and north Sumatra have been severely traumatised by the scale of the tragedy. Rebuilding the region will require far more than rebuilding roads and bridges; it will entail reviving lives, livelihoods and resurrecting entire communities. The government of Indonesia's response to the immediate needs of relief efforts has been swift and effective. As this critical work makes the transition to reconstruction and communities begin to recover from the initial shock and face the future, we need a comprehensive strategy to guide the reconstruction process. These bills pave the way for that partnership and lay the groundwork for a closer and more cooperative relationship between Australia and Indonesia. The Asian Development Bank reports that houses, boats, ports, hotels, clinics, roads, railways, fishing boats, shops, vehicles, businesses and so on were lost, and this is obvious to everyone who has viewed the tragedy on television. You could see the tremendous impact as- on local communities. That is why we have a very big challenge ahead of us. We have been faced with human loss on an unprecedented scale, but it is not just that. How do we minimise the economic impact, particularly, on these communities and help them to rebuild their livelihoods and their businesses? The direct economic impact of the events of 26 December will come through in negative effects on consumption and business activity in the areas affected. The disaster, however, has not had a substantial impact on financial markets; much less, it has not led to financial or economic crisis. Standard and Poor's has already announced that, despite the extensive property damage and loss of life, sovereign credit ratings of Asian countries affected will not be modified. So far, the currencies of the affected countries have remained stable and the financial markets have been calm. The tsunami has not yet had an adverse effect on stock markets. The two sectors most affected by the events of 26 December 2004 are tourism and fishing. Reconstruction after natural disasters requires new investment that should have a positive impact, and investment should translate into jobs. The aid process has already increased demand for a range of domestic goods and services, including food, water, medicines, building materials and clothing, as well as transport and communication services. At a macroeconomic level, evidence of growing institutional commitment to and investment in disaster risk reduction is growing. Among the international financial institutions, the Hazard Management Unit of the World Bank has been instrumental in raising the visibility of investment in the disaster risk region. The overwhelming response of Australians is demonstrated by donations in excess of $A260 million, and thousands have volunteered their time, expertise and skills. lia was among the first of many nations to offer humanitarian aid, providing medical and pharmaceutical assistance, food and water, and professional assistance. A tremendous contribution was made by the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police and many government departments, and, of course, a wonderful role was played by Australian non-government aid agencies, including trade unions. Attention is now shifting to the mediumterm reconstruction of the affected region, with the opportunity to further strengthen the strategic relationship within the region, in particular bilateral relations with Indonesia. Multilateral organisations and industrialised nations have a significant role to play by working with the ravaged nations and ‘deploying a cohesive and coordinated coalition ... to assist the affected'. Austrade will be holding a series of tsunami reconstruction workshops around Australia, profiling regional experts from the World Bank, Washington; the Asian Development Bank, Manila; and AusAID, in conjunction with Austrade's senior trade commissioners for New Delhi and Jakarta. The seminars will provide participants with a detailed understanding of the progress of reconstruction planning, how funds are being disbursed and likely arrangements for contract tendering and identifying which agencies will take the lead in coordinating projects. The workshops will also provide advice to participants wanting information on ongoing procurement programs operated by multilateral development agencies. Australia has the opportunity to work with multilateral organisations and governments on three key outputs: a damage and loss assessment; a reconstruction and recovery strategy; and a recovery financing, management and governance strategy. Australia should support efforts to develop a better sense of voluntary and official flows and Austrahow these may be managed. To manage the recovery effort, the government needs to establish some general principles: maximize the use of on-budget financing; develop an effective governance framework; phase out central government support as regional governments recover capacity; and maximize grant financing, then soft loans as needed depending on fiscal and balance of payment needs. The magnitude of the disaster and its impact on multiple countries and conflict-affected regions also presents special challenges for financing reconstruction and for aid coordination. Particular issues include: ensuring strong country ownership of reconstruction and commitment to implementation; making the transition from emergency relief to reconstruction seamless and efficient; channelling funds efficiently and transparently; providing for an equitable distribution of reconstruction activities; and ensuring that funds are put to their intended use. But the most important priority in the transition from relief to reconstruction is to put money into the pockets of those people left without a source of income-for example, through ‘cash for work' programs. Paying people for participating in the immediate clean-up after the disaster puts cash in the hands of families and helps people rebuild their lives. Giving people back some selfsufficiency and coordinating assistance to small-scale activities has implications for how efficiently we provide support. There are lessons from elsewhere that show the advantages of cash for work and communitydriven development programs that build upon the knowledge and resources of the community. Credit and microfinance is important. As commercial banks re-establish operations, the demand from SMEs and large firms for new credit to rebuild and purchase working capital will be high. A credit facility through commercial banks to business should be established to promote investment and accelerate rebuilding. A large number of small businesses which may not have access to the formal banking sector will try to access credit through non-commercial bank sources such as a framework for recovery and reconstruction cooperatives, credit unions, development banks and microfinance institutions. Smaller business credit programs should be channelled through these organisations. We need to rehabilitate transport infrastructure. The reconstruction program needs to restore the structural integrity of heavily damaged or destroyed roads, ports and airports. This could include new construction where this would improve the resilience of the transport network against disasters and improve the capacity for future growth. The reconstruction work should include upgrading of construction standards where necessary to ensure capacity, loadings and resilience of structures. Employment-intensive investment in infrastructure is also needed. In the rehabilitabe tion phase, the main priority is to focus on infrastructure that is fundamental to improving access to markets which provide productive inputs and basic living necessities. Labour based methods should be used to the extent that is economically and technically feasible. The infrastructure should therefore be both asset creating and employment creating. We need to encourage entrepreneurship. In parallel with a local economic revival strategy, we should focus on local entrepreneurship and the promotion of micro and small enterprises, enhancing their capacity to respond to emerging opportunities and new initiatives. During the rehabilitation phase many people will turn to microenterprise activities to generate income. These emerging entrepreneurs will need access to microfinance and know-how. Special attention must be given to women entrepreneurs, as they commonly constitute the largest number of microentrepreneurs yet are the most disadvantaged in terms of access to productive resources. Trust funds are a proven instrument for channelling funds to priority areas, lowering the costs of administration in both recipient and donor countries and simplifying reporting and oversight. Trust fund oversight can only be done by a committee of multilateral institutions that will ensure equitable distribution of trust fund resources. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund has been cited as an example of how such a trust fund might be organised. The World Bank is having discussions with several countries and donors about establishing multidonor trust funds that will finance the next phase of recovery. In all of this, ensuring accountability and transparency is essential to maintaining the confidence of both affected communities and donor country governments, who must accountable to their taxpayers. Again there are established models for making information on the sources and uses of funds available to those receiving services and for contracting out auditing, financial management and procurement to outside firms. The tsunami disaster should be seen in the context of other disasters that have hit Asia. Historically, Asia has been subjected to regular, unexpected shocks. The developing countries of Asia have always responded swiftly and pragmatically. Resilience in the face of turbulence has characterised Asia. Sound macroeconomic management, particularly fiscal discipline, has been fundamental in providing governments with the needed degrees of freedom to respond. At the microeconomic level, the availability of appropriate institutions, incentives and infrastructure is a precondition for recovery. The impressive improvements in both macreconomic and microeconomic fundamentals will make developing Asia increasingly resilient. Australia, through this program, the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005, has a critical role to play in ensuring that this aid package is delivered in an effective, transparent and sustained manner.",50
23,Mrs MAY,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"MCPherson) (11.33 a.m.)There is not a member of this House or, indeed, any Australian who was not affected and moved by the devastating coverage of the Boxing Day tsunami disaster on our television screens. There was the enormity of the loss of life-more than 290,000 people lost their lives, including, sadly, 21 confirmed Australians; the complete devastation of homes and entire villages; the heartwrenching stories of human courage; and the miracles we witnessed over the first week or so after the tsunami hit. Sitting in our lounge rooms, it was hard to comprehend the enormous destruction and the long road that lay ahead in rebuilding those communities, spread across a number of countries from Indonesia to South Africa, which were destroyed in some way by this natural disaster. Australia was there on the ground first. Our government realised very quickly what was going to be needed, announcing a $60 million package of emergency assistance to address the immediate needs. Our aid agencies went into action immediately and Australians responded magnificently, with unprecedented fundraising of more than $280 million. The overwhelming generosity of Australians was magnificent and to this day that fundraising continues. On the Gold Coast, our local communities responded very quickly and I was delighted to be involved in a number of fundraising events, including the tsunami concert at the Royal Pines Resort that was put together by Normie Rowe and a great bunch of volunteers. The legislation before the House today commits Australia to ongoing support and aid to Indonesia, particularly to communities in Aceh and to the city of Banda Aceh-a troubled area of Indonesia but undoubtedly the area that suffered the most from the tsunami disaster. The immediate problems of providing clean water, shelter and food, stemming the real danger of disease breaking out and restoring services and infrastructure were enormous tasks undertaken by Australian Defence Force personnel. ADF engineers were on the ground in Banda Aceh to help restore these services and the infrastructure within days after the tsunami disaster struck. Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force personnel established a water purification plant to produce 480,000 litres of clean water for the Indonesian province. Members of the Combat Engineer Regiment in the Northern Territory were deployed to Banda Aceh on HMAS Kanimbla. Their tasks were to assist with road construction and repair, airfield construction and repair, general infrastructure repair and recovery, more water purification, removal of debris, the distribution of supplies, the creation of centres for displaced persons and other identified tasks for the Indonesian people. The group took a large quantity of heavy plant equipment, including trucks, bulldozers, excavators, rollers and other engineering equipment, which has assisted with the removal of debris, the clearance of roads, the removal of partly demolished buildings and the clearance of rubbish. This is but a small sample of the tasks that had to be undertaken and will continue to be undertaken over months and possibly years in an effort to rebuild the Aceh province. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 will ensure ongoing Australian support to Indonesia in the wake of the tsunami disaster. There are two main elements to the funding included in the bills, including supplementary funding for departments and agencies for their involvement in the immediate response to the tsunami disaster and the $1 billion associated with the AustraliaIndonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development Program. The AIPRD will assist with post-tsunami reconstruction as well as reinforcing the increasingly close relationover ship between our two countries. For example, Indonesia is included in Australia's top 10 trading partners, both for exports and imports. Similarly, Australia is included in donesia's top 10 trading partners, also both for exports and imports. In order to manage such a large commitment effectively, the $1 billion will be appropriated to two special accounts created under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. By using special accounts, the funds will be separated from other aid money and can only be spent on the purposes for which they have been established. The AIPRD also ensures a high degree of transparency and accountability. One special account will provide $500 million in grant aid. The other will provide loans for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of major infrastructure. The loans will involve up to $500 million in interest free financing for up to 40 years, with no repayment of principal commencing before 10 years. The partnership will support Indonesia's post-tsunami reconstruction and development efforts. Its approach will be long-term cooperation focused on economic and social development projects and Indonesian programs for reform and democratisation. The supplementary funding for emergency assistance is $131.4 million to fund the disaster response activities of Australian agencies in the weeks and months immediately following the tsunami. AusAID will receive $50.6 million for projects which include a civilian hospital in Banda Aceh, which performed 20 to 30 operations a day and treated hundreds of other patients with serious medical conditions such as severe lung infections, the supply of five medical teams to Indonesia and one medical team each to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, the delivery of four tonnes of medical supplies and eight tonnes of medical equipment to Sri Lanka, valued at $1 million, the delivery of 2.5 million litres of water to Banda Aceh, and the establishment of a medium-term civil medical team at Banda Aceh's general hospital and In- the commencement of rapid master planning exercises for the Banda Aceh health and medical sectors. The Department of Defence has been allocated $50.5 million for key defence activities during the emergency, including running a 90-bed hospital in Banda Aceh, producing 4.7 million litres of clean water with water purification plants, and clearing 7,000 cubic meters of debris. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requires $17.3 million to cover costs associated with providing consular assistance to Australians in the affected areas. The Disaster Victim Identification Process involved repatriating Australian remains and handling the return of personal effects. The Australian Federal Police, who were involved in the Disaster Victim Identification Process, will receive $4.9 million. The Department of Health and Aging and the Department of Family and Community Services will each receive $2.5 million and $2.4 million respectively, having responsibility for a package which includes health and psychological care for Australians injured in the tsunami, psychological care for Australians who are relatives of anyone who was injured or deceased in the tsunami and funding to help meet the transport, accommodation and funeral costs for those injured in the tsunami and the next of kin of the deceased. A number of other agencies are to receive a total of approximately $1.4 million. They are the Attorney-General's Department, CrimTrac, the Health Insurance Commission and the National Blood Authority. The areas of assistance covered by this appropriation legislation certainly demonstrate the level of emergency assistance that Indonesia needs to assist the people of Indonesia to rebuild their lives, be ongoing. I am proud that the Howard government has recognised the enormity of the need and responded appropriately. This is the largest single aid contribution in Australia's history. The magnitude of Australia's response is entirely appropriate, given the scale of the tragedy, its impact on the people of our region and the important long-term ties between Australia and its neighbours. The scale of the response was made possible as a result of the government's strong fiscal position. To all those Australians who are working on the ground, and who will continue to work for many years to come in helping to rebuild Indonesia and the Aceh province, we wish you well in the enormous task that lies ahead. Our thoughts are with you as you undertake the rebuilding of those communities affected by the tsunami. We all hope that our help, and the provision that has been made through the bill, will continue, that the rebuilding will continue and that we will see a positive outcome in the future. I commend the bill to the House.",54
24,Mr BOWEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"Of course, I support the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and cognate bill, the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005, as I think all members of the House would. This was, perhaps, the most tragic natural disaster of our time. It was also a catalyst for an outpouring of sympathy and support and national unity. The response of our nation was unprecedented for an event that occurred overseas. Perhaps it was because it occurred at Christmas time, or perhaps because so many Australians had been to the affected areas, like Thailand, or Indonesia or Sri Lanka. Perhaps it was because we are an island with so much of our population living on the coast and it was brought home to us how easily this could and that need will happen to us. The figures tell a devastating story. In Indonesia alone, 124,000 people have been confirmed dead. Another 111,000 are missing and likely to be deceased. While the reduction in Indonesia's gross domestic product is estimated at just 0.1 to 0.4 per cent, a more startling figure is the estimated reduction in Banda Aceh's gross domestic product, which is 97 per cent. Perhaps one of the most chilling statistics of all is that an estimated 35,000 children have been orphaned in this tragic event. The government's commendable response has been matched by an outpouring of private generosity. There were dinners, cricket matches and afternoon teas and we saw pensioners and young children donating perhaps small amounts of money, but a large percentage of their savings, to various appeals. Like many members, I had an appeal box in my electorate office. I know that some young people came in and left small amounts of money which were big contributions for them. At the other end of the scale, I was pleased to be able to attend function-organised by the Italian Affair Committee, which is a big charity group in my electorate-which raised $1,000,000 for the tsunami appeal. I congratulate the Chairman of the Italian Affair Committee, Pat Sergei OAM-a person who has been congratulated in this House before for his other works-for his role and the role of his organising committee. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Brand, was able to join us at that function. The target of $1,000,000 was helped to be reached by a very generous donation from Sergeants Pies of $500,000, which, from a single organisation, is a major contribution. I would like Hansard to record the House's recognition of the contribution from Sergeants Pies. This outpouring of generosity and contributions is an endorsement of the government's generous donation to the appeal. The government's response is an example of our support for our neighbours. Indonesia and Australia have, from time to time, had issues and disagreements. We have been through a very difficult period with the Bali bombing and the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Indonesia. But, at the end of the day, we are neighbours and friends and our contribution recognises this. Such generosity also provides us with an opportunity to engage the public in a debate about foreign aid generally-about our support for those less welloff, about our role in this part of the world and about our role in the world generally. I saw a study recently, which was conducted in the United States. It asked members of the public what percentage of gross domestic product they thought was spent on foreign aid. Then they were asked what percentage they thought should be spent on foreign aid. It was a very interesting survey. The results showed that the average American thought that about 15 per cent of gross domestic a product was probably spent on foreign aid and that only five per cent should be spent on foreign aid. Of course, in the case of the United States, I think the real figure is 0.5 per cent of GDP or something in that order. There is a wide misunderstanding and Americans are not alone in it. If you conducted that survey in Australia. I think you would find a very similar response and a wide misunderstanding of our role and the amounts we spend on foreign aid. If you have a survey showing that five per cent of GDP is regarded as an appropriate contribution to foreign aid then we certainly have an opportunity to do more. I read a report recently which said that $4 billion spent around the world by major developed countries could eliminate child poverty and child starvation in five to 10 years. When you consider that we pledged $1 billion to this appeal, $4 billion across the world should not be too much of an ask or contribution for the developed economies of the world to make. In supporting this bill it is important that we also engage the public in that debate and point out the benefits to the people who receive this money-the orphaned children, the families of those deceased and people trying to re-establish their microbusinessesas opposed to small businesses-their fishing boats and their small stalls in Banda Aceh, Sri Lanka, Thailand and everywhere else that has been affected. We need to encourage that spirit of entrepreneurship and help them build their infrastructure and rebuild their lives. Just as importantly, we need to engage in that debate and point out that Australia also gets benefits from foreign aid. I am not talking about economic benefits. I am not talking about goods and services being bought from Australian producers, although of course that happens. I am talking about the reputation of Australia as a caring nation which is prepared, to use an Australian vernacular expression, to help out its matescountries going through tough times or disasters, whether they be natural or human inspired. We have shown that through so many disasters-from September 11 in the United States to this tragic natural disaster in the Pacific. More than any words, conferences or dialogue, that sends a very strong message that we are prepared to put political, religious and philosophical differences aside and help people who are going through difficult times. We have seen not only an outpouring of money from the federal government and private individuals and organisations but also outpouring of effort and commitment from some very dedicated people who have travelled around the world in the most difficult of circumstances. I saw one young Australian-I think she was from Melbourne-who volunteered for the job of going through all the corpses lined up in Banda Aceh and helping families to identify them. To in some way alleviate their pain she did most of the work checking the bodies, and they just checked the ones that she identified as possiwhat's bly being their relatives. That is a job I do not think many of us could comprehend doing, but she volunteered. I think she was a medical student who happened to be in Banda Aceh at the time. That really shows the Australian spirit of helping out, which another symbol of the contribution that we have made after this terrible tragedy. We have seen Australian soldiers, police men and women from the various states, and various community aid organisations all volunteering to go and work in the most difficult circumstances imaginable, to do what they can to help in this tragedy, which, as I said, was the worse natural disaster of our time. I think it is also another chance to reassess what more we can do. I support this bill wholeheartedly as I am sure the whole House will. This is a time of national unity, a time for us all to come together and congratulate the government on its efforts. But we can do better. I support the calls from the honourable member for Griffith, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, for the government to re-examine the need to boost resources for Radio Australia. I think the decision to cut funding for Radio Australia taken early in the government's term was one of the more unfortunate cuts. The ability to broadcast was greatly reduced and the ability to engage with people in South-East Asia was emasculated to a degree which I am not sure the government really intended. I know the govan ernment has funded Radio Australia more fully in recent years than it has in the past, and I congratulate it on that, but we still need to go further. Radio Australia needs to be returned to the vibrant service that it once was. It was not a mechanism for propaganda or proselytising the Australian point of view; it was a mechanism of understanding and of saying to people of South-East Asia: ‘Here is where we're coming from on all these issues. Here is happening in Australia.' We really cannot blame people in South-East Asia for misunderstanding us if we have not made the effort to communicate our point of view to them. I understand that in 1996 and 1997 South-East Asia and Radio Australia may not is have been such high priorities as they are today. But we all recognise now, with the difficulties between Indonesia and Australia and other nations, the need to engage in that communication. I add to the calls to the government to re-examine the funding of Radio Australia and to boost that funding as much as possible. In conclusion, many of us have been to the areas which have subsequently been affected by the tsunami, and many of us will return. I spent some time in Sri Lanka. I carefully examined the maps of the devastation to see if the area I had been to had been affected, and it had been. It was brought home to me that many of the children I met in Sri Lanka and many of their parents have now probably passed away. I remember the Sri Lankan people that I stayed with as being the most friendly and open-hearted people that you could ever hope to meet. It is a personal note for me that many of them have now probably-I have no way of ascertaining-passed away. I am sure many Australians are in a similar situation. For those who have spent time in Phuket, Sri Lanka, the east coast of India or Indonesia, many of the people they have holidayed with, stayed with and come to know as friends have been killed in this terrible tragedy. That is, as I said in my opening remarks, perhaps a reason that Australians have responded so generously to this event which really, coming so closely after Christmas, shook us to our core and shook us into a realisation that at the end of the day, despite any political, religious or philosophical differences, we are all citizens of the world and we must all come together in these times of crisis. I commend the bill to the House. I congratulate the government on its initiative and on its generous and quick response. I join with the other members of the opposition in supporting this bill and moving forward to the next stage of reconstruction, which is going to be very difficult. Money itself will not achieve this. It will take effort and a sive logistical operation to procure the raw resources for the reconstruction of housing, small businesses, hospitals et cetera. We will be with the government as it attempts that. We will support that in any way possible and we will continue to support the government and the Australian people for the efforts they have made in the face of this disaster.",56
25,Mr BAIRD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"It is my pleasure to follow the member for Prospect and agree with the sentiments that he has uttered today in his support for the government's Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and cognate bill, the reconstruction program that will be going on in Indonesia and the reason for this bill coming before the House. I think all of us in this country in the last few years have been stunned by the various developmentsSeptember 11, the Bali bombing and now the tsunami impact, which is, in terms of natural disasters, the most significant the world has seen. Many people until Boxing Day were not familiar with the term ‘tsunami'. Certainly its implication has been widespread. The devastation of its impact on our neighbours-particularly Indonesia and the Banda Aceh area and through into Thailand and Phuket, Sri Lanka and India-was significant. The results were appalling and tragic. The separation of families, the loss of loved ones and the fact that thousands of young people remain orphans in this area of the world are significant concerns. The great plus in Australia was the incredible response that we had across all levels of the community. In every area the response was an outpouring of support to our brothers and sisters in these other countries. As the member for Prospect has said, the way in which people have put aside their cultural and religious differences and nationalities, and come together as part of the masworld community to support those affected at this time, is unique. We are sending out in a very significant way members of the government to assist in the clean-up efforts. Members of the defence forces, the Australian Federal Police and medical teams undertook magnificent work. It was heart warming to see the Australians out there responding so well, being involved at the heart of the action. Some of their work was quite tragic, identifying the bodies that have been recovered; some were in teams involved in amputations. I have talked to a group of orthopaedic surgeons. The extent of the devastation on people and the number of amputees that will be around, particularly in Indonesia, will be very significant. The level of aid that has been given across the world has also been very encouraging. I know in my own community that the response was particularly encouraging. Immediately, committees were formed to raise funds. Mr Glen Wheeler, who was previously with radio 2GB, headed up a committee that raised almost $100,000. Some of the leading people in our community were caught up in it. Les Boardman and his wife, Diane, were in Phuket at the time of the tsunami and were caught up in the waves and swept underneath. Mrs Boardman, who was trapped underneath a car, explained to me how horrific it was-she thought that she would die, then suddenly the car was lifted by another wave coming through. She told me first-hand what the experience was like. We will never quite appreciate the number of people who lost their lives in this experience and the number of families who were so devastated by the impact. The numbers are so significant. It was the earth's worse natural disaster in living memory. The current death toll is expected to be in excess of 273,000 people. The Indonesian government alone revised its official death toll to firmed dead and 94,574 missing. We will undoubtedly never know the full impact of this tragedy. So it is our response to this tragedy that is most important. In my area, even tomorrow night we are having yet another fund raiser. We have had previous ones. All of the key restaurants in Cronulla had a special day when all the proceeds from that day went to the recovery work in Banda Aceh. All of the staff gave their time as well. The product was given freely by the seafood merchants in the area. It was great to see the community coming together, including even the local pub. I went to receive a cheque on behalf of World Vision for $60,000 from people down at the pub who gave to this appeal. Tomorrow night Qantas are giving free air travel to Hong Kong for the golf club which is holding a major fundraiser in my area. The purpose of this bill is particularly aimed at the very significant gift that has been given to the reconstruction in Indonesia. Banda Aceh was the worse affected of the tsunami devastated areas. It had the most significant death toll. That is where we will be targeting our aid. We gave in the order of $1 billion. It was a significant amount. It was saying to our closest neighbour: ‘We stand here with you. We realise the trauma you have been through. We understand the need for reconstruction of the country and we want to support you at this time.' The response of the new President of Indonesia was heart warming, as was seeing the way in which the two countries can work together for such an important good. These bills will see not only $500 million in direct grants but $500 million in interest free loans, which is significant. They will start to be repaid in 10 years time. It is most significant. On a pragmatic level, undoubtedly that will lead to opportunities for Australian and Indonesian companies to bid for and participate in re125,598 con- construction activities. This aid package is the largest single aid contribution in Australia's history. It is important that we ensure a smooth delivery of this assistance. I heard the member for Prospect expressing concern about the level of aid. This certainly shows that we are going to be right up there. It is the largest amount of aid given by any country and it is significant. The bill includes two main elements for funding. Part 1 looks at the supplementary funding for departments and agencies that are currently involved in the region and those that were involved in the immediate response to the disaster. The other part contains the billion that the government has pledged for the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. In delivering this very large aid package, the bill builds the very strong economy that we have in Australia. Because of the good management of the Australian economy, we have a strong financial base-we have had growth averaging 3.5 per cent over the past 14 years. On that strong base we have been very blessed and very fortunate in this country. As a result of that good fortune Australia is in a position to provide this aid. The fund will assist with post tsunami reconstruction. It will also provide a platform to strengthen our relationship with Indonesia and enhance our regional partnership. That is so important for a country of 180 million people and our closest neighbour. It is important that we develop that relationship. Indonesia is already one of Australia's top 10 trading partners and vice versa. The package will foster an already large and growing trend of trade between our countries. Since this commitment is so large, under the Financial Management and Accountability Act the government will appropriate $1 billion in two accounts. This will ensure greater accountability and transparency in tracking the aid payments and allocation to ensure that they are allocated for the reason they were given in the first place. There will be one account that provides the $500 million in grant aid and then the interest free loans will be financed up to 40 years with principal repayments after 10 years. Supplementary funding of an additional $131 million is being sought to top up the agencies and departments that responded to the crisis immediately following the tragic event. AusAID, the Department of Defence, DFAT, the Federal Police and the Department of Health and Ageing have all been involved. AusAID, for example, set up a ci$1 vilian hospital in Banda Aceh, carrying out surgical operations 20 to 30 times a day as well as treating hundreds of walk-in patients with serious complications ranging from on lung infections to gangrene. They also supplied five specialist medical teams to Indonesia and one each to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Over four tonnes of medical supplies have been provided to Sri Lanka along with eight tonnes of medical equipment, all valued at more than $1 million. In addition, 2.5 million litres of water have been provided to Banda Aceh. A medium-term civil medical unit has been established at the general hospital, and training and exercises have been carried out for rapid master planning in the health and medical sectors. Some $50.6 million has been allocated for AusAID's contribution. The Department of Defence has been allocated $50.5 million for its activities, ranging from running a 90-bed hospital in Aceh, producing 4.7 million litres of purified, clean water and the clearing of 7,000 cubic metres of debris. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be provided with $17.3 million to cover the costs of providing consular assistance and victim identification, and repatriating the remains of Australians and returning victims' personal effects. The Federal Police, who were instrumental in the identification of victims, will be provided with $4.9 million to cover costs. The Department of Health and Ageing will receive $2.5 million and the Department of Family and Community Services will receive $2.4 million to cover the cost of their packages, which provided for health and psychological care for Australians injured in the tsunami and for the relatives of those who lost loved ones in the disaster. The Attorney-General's Department, CrimTrac, the Health Insurance Commission and the National Blood Authority will receive collectively a total of $1.4 million to cover costs. It is also important to note that many of the departments listed absorbed many of the costs into their existing budgets, which has heavily reduced the amount of supplementary funding required. The total financial implication of this bill is $1.133 billion, which in anyone's language is a very large amount of funding for a bill passing through this House. Also significant is the degree of bipartisan support for this bill, which is encouraging. We can all take pride in the fact that this country is financially strong and in a position to provide level of aid. It is a gesture towards our est neighbour, extending our feeling of solidarity in this time of need to assist them in meeting the impact of the devastation of the tsunami and helping them with the reconstruction and rebuilding of their hospitals, schools and homes. It is going to be a long and difficult path for them, but at least they will know that Australia stands with them and that we will be providing resources to assist them in this program. It is certainly a significant step forward. I commend this bill to the House.",59
26,Mr RICHARDSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"I rise today in support of the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 20042005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005. On 26 December 2004, while Australians recovered from Christmas Day celebrations, watched the Boxing Day test and simply enjoyed the company of family and friends, the most severe earthquake the world has seen in the last 40 years shook the ocean beds surrounding our nearest neighbours. The tragic tsunami that followed meant that, while Australians were enjoying and taking for granted the activities that generally entertain us on Boxing Day, our neighbours were running for their lives and fighting to save their loved ones. This Boxing Day tragedy has resulted in an unprecedented humanitarian disaster the likes of which we have not seen in this lifetime and the likes of which we hope and pray we will never see again. We will never know the true human cost of this disaster. We can never truly understand the emotional cost of having the life of a loved one cut desperately short by a natural disaster of this magnitude or the effect this disaster will have on the small, close-knit communities of the nations affected. We will never truly know the effect this it has had on a generation of children, who closwere either washed away in the disaster or left behind to face life after the loss of parents and grandparents, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbours-a generation of children who, at the hands of nature, were left orphaned. But there is something we can do and that is why I stand before the House today. I stand before the House to support a bill which aims to make a real difference in the lives and communities of those people most affected in the aftermath of the tsunami. I was motivated to speak in support of this bill not only because of the real difference it will make in the lives of so many people scattered throughout the devastated region and not only because of the undeniable merits this legislation has but also because I was inspired by the selfless acts of Australians I saw in the aftermath of the disaster, particularly by the constituents and organisations within my electorate of Kingston and throughout South Australia and nationally. The examples of the extraordinary acts of extraordinary people in my electorate are so wide and varied-from the electrician who jumped on a plane as soon as he was able to get his paperwork organised to go over and help rebuild the devastated townships, to the woman who collected clothing and travelled to Indonesia to distribute it to those Indonesians most in need. Groups of young people in my electorate organised raffles and concerts, and spent their weekends walking around at community fairs collecting donations for the relief effort. The people of Kingston, like the people of this fine nation, showed their extraordinary generosity. Now it is the Howard government's turn, on behalf of all Australians, to do the same. We doing that with the largest single aid contribution in this nation's history. There are two main elements of the funding included in these bills. The first includes supplementary funding for departments and agencies for their involvement in the immediate response to the disaster. The second is the $1 billion which is being committed for the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. The partnership is designed to support Indonesia's posttsunami reconstruction and development efforts with a long-term focus on economic and social development projects, as well as Indonesian programs for reform and democratisation. The first meeting between the resentatives from Australia and Indonesia is scheduled for 17 March 2005 and looms as being one of the defining moments in the modern relationship between our two nations. The supplementary funding which is being sought is for $131.4 million to fund disaster response activities of Australian agencies in the weeks and months immediately following the tsunami. The funds include $50.6 million sought by AusAID for projects which included a civilian hospital in Banda Aceh which was at the coalface of the relief effort, performing between 20 and 30 operations a day and treating hundreds of other patients with serious conditions, including those who faced serious risk from infection; the delivery of 12 tonnes of medical supplies and equipment to Sri Lanka; the supply of five medical teams to Indonesia, one medical team to Sir Lanka and another one to the Maldives; the establishment of a mediumterm civil medical team at Banda Aceh General Hospital, as well as the introduction of master planning exercises for the Banda Aceh health and medical sectors; and the delivery of 2.5 million litres of water to Banda Aceh. Funding in the amount of $50.5 are million has also been allocated to the Department of Defence. The activities funded include running a 90-bed hospital in Banda Aceh, clearing 7,000 cubic metres of debris and producing 4.7 million litres of clean water with purification plants. I would like to digress for a moment to talk briefly about the work of the Australian Defence Force in the region. The very dedicated men and women who join the armed forces do so with the desire and will to stand up and fight to defend our nation, but following this disaster those men and women proudly stood up, as they were shipped off to areas more devastated than a war zone, to help and assist the people of a foreign nation. rep- These soldiers knew they were not going to fight to free an oppressed people or to defend the shores of their nation, but they stood with pride in their uniforms and pride in their nation as they were shipped off to do something that would touch many lives and mark our national history just as proudly. I would like to take this opportunity to thank every member of the Australian Defence Force who has headed to the devastated regionand every husband or wife, son or daughter, mother or father who has had to endure time without their loved ones while they serve their country so honourably. We are proud of your dedication, we are proud of your commitment and we are so very proud of what you have accomplished in such a short time. These bills provide $17.3 million to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to cover costs associated with providing consular assistance to Australians in the affected areas, repatriating Australian remains and handling the return of personal effects. As well, along with the Australian Federal Police effort, the disaster victim identification process, for which $4.9 million is being provided, is supplying much needed closure to the families of victims. The Department of Health and Ageing is to receive $2.5 million, and the Department of Family and Community Services is to receive $2.4 million for a package which includes health and psychological care for Australians injured in the tsunami; psychological care for Australians who are relatives of anyone who was injured or killed in the tsunami; and funding to help meet the transport and accommodation costs of those injured in the tsunami and the next of kin of those who were killed, and funeral costs. A total of approximately $1.4 million will go to a number of other agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, CrimTrac, the Health Insurance Commission and the National Blood Authority. None of this funding accounts for the money spent by agencies which have absorbed the costs within their existing budgets. Having outlined the details of the funding, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the Howard government's assistance to tsunami affected countries has attracted not just broad community support but also bipartisan support. So often Australians look at the two sides of politics and wonder if ever possible for them to agree. So often in this House there are days when we, like the opposition, wonder the same thing. But today both sides of Australian politics have come together in support of this humanitarian legislation. Today we celebrate the sense of bipartisan cooperation which is enabling us to reach out to our neighbours and support them in this desperate time. I thank the opposition for their support. On a personal note, I would like to say that there is no way I can understand the feeling of losing a loved one in a disaster of this magnitude, and I pray that I will never find out. But, as the father of two boys, I was both touched and overwhelmed when a mother from the suburb of Hallett Cove in my electorate contacted my office at the height of the disaster because her son was in the area where the tsunami hit and she was unable to contact him. As this woman spoke to me on the phone about the fear she felt at not knowing if her son was alive or dead, I felt a small part of what other families who were missing loved ones at the time must have been feeling. Fortunately, that mother's son was returned to her alive and well. But when I went home that night and hugged my own wife and sons I wondered what on earth I could do, and today I can answer that question with my support of this legislation. As the Prime Minister said on the National Day of Mourning and Reflection: We know we cannot wind back the clock. We know the physical and emotional scars left by this disaster can never fully heal. We know, too, that we must not let our mourning turn to despair as we shoulder the mammoth task of helping those who have lost so much. The Prime Minister was right: we cannot change history, but we can shape the future, and we begin the process of reshaping the future of the tsunami affected areas today with the passage of this very important legisit is lation. This bill lets us reach out to our neighbours, it lets us save and rebuild lives, and it lets us continue our fight to ensure that the people devastated by this tragedy are not forgotten. Through this tragedy and Australia's support of the devastated region, we have forged a stronger, more secure relationship with our neighbours. Our Defence Force and civil personnel engaged in the relief effort in Indonesia, for example, are working with and alongside their Indonesian counterparts to achieve the best and quickest possible results for the people of Indonesia. It is hard to believe that any good could come of a disaster like this, but it is impossible not to recognise the good in the heart of every Australian who dug deep to donate to the various charities collecting for the victims. Australians gave all that they could, from children giving their pocket money, to those who gave their time. Australians have again, through this disaster, rallied beyond all possible expectation to show their compassion and desire to help those in need. It is in times like these that we look for Australian heroes. During this disaster, we found them. We found them on the street corners, holding collection tins. We found them in our Defence Force personnel, in our doctors and nurses, volunteers who jumped on flights to go and lend a hand, and we found them in every Australian household which donated so selflessly to help their neighbours in need. Out of this disaster has come a reminder of the true meaning of the Australian spirit and a redefinition of Australian mateship, which now recognisably extends beyond our shores. I commend this bill to the House because it is the government's extension of that mateship. It is the means by which this government can have a real impact on the nations touched by this tragedy. I commend this bill to the House because it will make a difference.",62
27,Mr DANBY,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and related legislation. As the previous speaker indicated, this bill has bipartisan support. The opposition was clear in its support for major assistance to Indonesia before, during and after discussion first arose about the issue in the area of foreign aid generally but the tsunami in particular. This bill embodies that bipartisan consensus-and, indeed, the consensus across the country-about Australia's response to the earthquake and tsunami disaster that affected the countries of our region, particularly Indonesia, on 26 December and its aftermath during the following months. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 21 Australians have now been confirmed lost in the tsunami disaster, while another six are missing, apparently lost. Although these figures are much lower than we originally feared, each one is a tragedy for an Australian family. I offer my sincere condolences to all of those affected. We can be thankful that Australia escaped with so few losses, when we reconsider that the overall death toll has now reached some 310,000. I was contacted on the first day. I went back into my office to see of what assistance I could be to citizens of Melbourne Ports who had family lost in various parts of Thailand and later Sri Lanka. I was immediately in contact with the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bruce Billson, who was on his mobile. We got the details to him of some missing Australians in Thailand, faxed from the mother of one of the missing young women. I must say that I was very pleased that the government acted so quickly and that the member for Dunkley, the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, was so accessible and so quick in acting at the request of parliamentarians on behalf of their constituents. As previous speakers have done, I want to pay tribute to all of those Australians who rallied so magnificently to bring aid and comfort to the millions of people affected by the tsunami. These include, first and foremost, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, who acted with their usual promptness, efficiency and compassion to bring aid to the affected areas, most particuthose larly to the Aceh province in Indonesia. I think the sight of the Australians with their water bottles, giving out fresh water to ple in that devastated region, will be an age that sticks in all of our minds. That praise extends to federal and state government departments, including the Australian Federal Police; the aid organisations which sent volunteers and funds; and the many Australians who stayed in the affected areas to work as volunteers. In my own electorate, as I said, many generous people gave to various appeals. I attended a tsunami benefit at the Amici Bakery Cafe in Chapel Street, Prahran, with my colleague the state member for Prahran, Mr Tony Lupton. The cafe donated all of the fees from the benefit that night-$6,500-to the tsunami relief effort. There were many similar efforts by businesses, community groups and individuals. All the Fitzroy Street and Acland Street traders took up money on behalf of the Red Cross. The tsunami victims affected in my electorate include Robbie Burke, formerly the saxophonist of the Black Sorrows, who lives in Caulfield, his wife, Atia Cader, and their two daughters, who had a narrow escape in Sri Lanka; and, on Phi Phi Island, Leonard Hamersfeld and Tanya Bensimon of East St Kilda, who huddled behind a wall and then scrambled onto a roof to escape the waters. Australians have donated $280 million to charities assisting the tsunami affected counnesian tries, which I think is the highest per capita voluntary donation for tsunami relief of any country in the world and is certainly an extraordinary outpouring of generosity from a country of 20 million people. It follows from this that Australians expect their government to be equally generous. The total aid commitments of the Australian government to the tsunami relief total nearly $1.4 billion, and commitments have the full support of the opposition. We expect those commitments to be fully honoured, and a future Lapeo- bor government would of course honour im- those commitments, which will run for many years into the future. I want to talk today about the link between Australia's tsunami relief efforts and our relationship with Indonesia. The tsunami, coming as it did soon after the inauguration of Indonesia's first directly elected president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, provides an opportunity for relations between Australia and our largest and most important regional neighbour to make a fresh start after the various stresses and strains of the past decade. As Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, our relationship with Indonesia is an extraordinarily important one, particularly in the current international climate. We have a great stake in Indonesia remaining a united, stable, democratic and increasingly prosperous country. If it does not-if it breaks up into warring provinces, if it relapses into dictatorship or succumbs to Islamist extremism or if its economic progress goes into reverse-the consequences for Australia could be immediate and severe. In the past, many people in the foreign policy establishment in this country, including members from both sides of politics, took the view that what was needed above all else in Indonesia was stability, and that Australia's interests lay in propping up the Indoauthoritarian governments and all that that entailed including, unfortunately, the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. I do not seek to make a partisan point about this, as this was the policy of successive Australian governments and was the wisdom of the time. However, Australia's support for the incorporation of East Timor not only had a morally problematic aspect to it but was also short-sighted and not in the long-term interests of either Australia or Indonesia. All authoritarian regimes eventually fall and, when they do, the people who suffered under them remember who their friends were. This lesson applies as much to Burma today as it did to Indonesia yesterday. Today we can see that Australia's interests lie in supporting and promoting Indonesian democracy as the best way of securing a stable and prosperous Indonesia into the future. We must pay tribute here to the former presidents Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri, who both courageously opposed dictatorship and worked to create a democratic Indonesia. For various reasons neither of them proved to be effective presidents, but they paved the way for the country's first direct presidential election and election of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last year. There is no great controversy in supporting democracy but I also believe that it is in Australia's interests to support a united Indonesia. That may be a more controversial proposition. This issue has been brought into sharper focus by the fact that the tsunami struck hardest in the Aceh province of Indonesia, where there has been a long-running secessionist insurgency. The behaviour of both the Indonesian military and the insurgent group, GAM, has been brought into focus by the unprecedented media attention given to events in Aceh since the tsunami struck. It may seem paradoxical that I should speak in support of Indonesian national unity so soon after expressing support for the independence of East Timor, and that is the position of a lot of members of both sides of this House. However, East Timor was a Portuguese colony, not part of the old Dutch East Indies, and its people never agreed to become part of Indonesia. The evidence was overwhelming that the people of East Timor always retained a sense of separate nationality and wanted to be independent. By contrast, it seems to me that Aceh, West Papua and the Moluccas were part of the Dutch East Indies, and the evidence is at least ambivalent that the majority of the peoples in those areas, as opposed to some minorities, desire separation from Indonesia. After all, Indonesia has recently held free legislative and presidential elections, and voters in these regions showed no sign of support for secession. It is of course true that the incorporation of the former Dutch New Guinea into Indonesia was done without the consent of the people of that territory. But that was more than 40 years ago and, since then, the territhe tory has been integrated into Indonesia and its population mix changed by large-scale settlement from other parts of Indonesia. Now that Indonesia is a democracy, and now that all the provinces of Indonesia have their own elected regional assemblies with considerable devolved powers, I do not think we in this parliament do the people of West Papua any service by encouraging secessionism. However, we in this parliament want to encourage our Indonesian friends to be sensitive to the regional interests of people in West Papua. The same is true of Aceh, which, although once an independent sultanate that was incorporated into the Dutch East Indies in 1871, has been an integral part of Indonesia since independence nearly 60 years ago. The recent trial of Abu Bakar Bashir has reminded Australians of the great stake we have in the future of Indonesia and of Indonesian Islam. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is now here, and I express my appreciation for a recent opportunity to be with him on a visit that he regularly makes to his isterial colleagues; a number of Australian parliamentarians were taken with the foreign minister on his visit to Jakarta. The Australian parliamentarians had extremely useful meetings with our colleagues in the Indonesian parliament, including with the Speaker, Amien Rais. We also had particularly useful meetings with the leadership of Indonesian youth organisations and Indonesian Muslim organisations, including scholars and youth leaders who were remarkably well informed about Australia. Many of them had been educated in Australia, and some had undertaken PhD studies at Flinders University. They expressed no great antagonism towards Australia, although they did have politely expressed policy differences in a number of areas. The Indonesian archipelago has been Islamic since the 16th century, but Indonesian Islam, influenced by the archipelago's Buddhist, Hindu and animist history, is very ferent from the Islam we see in Saudi Arabia. Indonesian Hanafi Islam was until recently unaffected by the drift towards Islamic extremism. Most Indonesian Muslims supported moderate Islamic organisations such as Mummadiyah or Nandlatul Ulama, and most still do. I am sure the minister has met with these organisations many times, and I and parliamentarians from both sides had the opportunity to meet with them for the first time a couple of years ago when we were in Jakarta. Today Indonesian Islam in undergoing far-reaching changes as part of a process that honourable member for Griffith has called ‘Middle-Easternisation'. As Indonesians have become better educated, they have become more aware of world events such as the conflicts in the Middle East. Indonesian youth in some of the poorer regional areas are attending madrassas and being inculcated with extremist ideology by preachers from minthe Wahabist sect, funded from Saudi Arabia. In recent years this ideology of Islamist extremism, including various dislikes of Americans, Australians and Jews, has been widely spread in Indonesia by extremist clerics such as the infamous Abu Bakar Bashir. Unfortunately, Indonesia's welcome but uneasy transformation from authoritarianism to democracy has given some of these foreign inspired Islamist groups new opportunities. Older Indonesian Muslim leaders, such as the former president Wahid, have been challenged by groups such as the Council of Indonesian Islamic Scholars (MUI) and Abu Bakar Bashir's Indonesian Mujahideen Council. When I was in Indonesia in early 2003 Australian parliamentarians met a number of moderate Indonesian Muslim youth leaders and scholars. They told me how they are fighting back against the militants and their imported ideologies, which they understand to be immensely harmful to the great difreligion of Islam and to the people of Indonesia. Australia can and should be doing everything it can to help moderate Indonesian Muslims, by providing funding for secular and moderate Islamic schools in the villages to counteract the insidious effects of this imported Wahabist ideology. I have spoken a number of times in this House about the need for Australia to do more to assist the forces of moderate Islam in Indonesia, particularly in the area of education. I agree with some of the initiatives of this government in this area, noting that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the here. Yet I also draw attention to the comments of the honourable member for Griffith about the importance of restoring the full operation of Radio Australia's Indonesian language broadcasting as a means of countering the anti-Western influences in Indonesia. The terrible tragedy of the tsunami provides new opportunities for strengthening Australia's relationship with Indonesia, and the fact that our generous aid was so well received is something that all Australian people, including both sides of this parliament, will be very pleased about. I do anyone on this side of this House had any partisan concerns about the Australian government's great initiative towards Indonesia at the time of the tsunami; we all welcomed it. We should use that influence and goodwill to work with Indonesian civil society groups to strengthen Indonesian democracy and the forces of religious and political moderation. This will make it harder for extremist groups like JI to recruit Indonesians to terrorist ganisations and make it easier for the Indonesian police to detect and prevent terrorist planning before we experience repeats of the Bali bombing or the Australian Embassy bombing. I welcome this bill and the generous financial commitment to reconstruction that it embodies. But that financial aid must be part of a wider policy framework to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the Indonesian people and the Australian people. This is in the long-term interests of both countries.",65
28,Mr HUNT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (12.40 p.m.)-In addressing the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 I briefly want to make two points. The first point is that these bills represent part of humanitarian response which Australia and many other nations have provided to the tragedy of 26 December. That response has really come at three levels. The first, and perhaps most important, response has been at the community level. What we have seen at the community level is an extraordinary outpouring of both common humanity and direct financial and human support. That assistance, whether it be to Sri Lanka, to Indonesia, to Thailand, to Malaysia or to other parts of the Indian Ocean region, has been of trenot think that mendous importance. The second level of the humanitarian response is direct government financial support-$1 billion is laid down in this appropriation package for the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development and $52 million to cover those costs already incurred by AusAID. I think we owe all of those members of the Australian Defence Force, the government-led by the orPrime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs-and Australians who have assisted a great deal of thanks and recognition at a national level. The third level of the humanitarian response is the international approach. The Australian government, with the support of the Australian opposition, has played a very important role in helping to broker and bring together a common approach to overcoming the terrible tragedy and the long-term needs of Indonesia in particular, of Sri Lanka, of India and of all those other countries. The other major point I want to make in brief is about the next step forward. One of the critical factors that I see as my own role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage is what we need to do about a tsunami warning system. Under the leadership of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian the Campbell, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, we are helping to put together a regional package which deals with three things: firstly, technical assistance-and that is something which we can quite readily achieve in identifying these tragedies as occur and in warning people; secondly, providing education as to what to do in the event of such a warning; and, thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, providing a last mile warning-how do you let a village know that a crisis is coming? How do you actually inform people on the ground? That is perhaps one of the great challenges, and we are looking at that aspect of a tsunami warning system. Very simply, these two appropriation bills represent an appropriate response to the humanitarian tragedy. They recognise the common humanity; they recognise our national responsibility; they do credit to the community and to the Australian government. I am delighted to commend the bills to the House.",69
29,Mr DOWNER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND,"It is with pleasure that I stand here to wind up this second reading debate on the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and AustraliaIndonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005. I want to say how much I appreciate the contributions that have been made by both government and opposition members. I listened to much of the speech of the member for Melbourne Ports and I agree with just about all of it, except his point about Radio Australia. Radio Australia does broadcast into Indonesia. I am sure where this idea that it does not came from. But it is 2005, not 1975, and people actually watch television these days. The Australian government has spent a lot of money-we spend about $19 million a year-on the ABC's Asia-Pacific TV. That has enormous reach. It goes right through Indonesia and is proving very successful. I think having a proper regional television vice, rather than the phoney sort of thing we they had before, has been a very good development. More broadly, I am very proud of the role that Australian officials and the Australian people have played in responding to the impact of the tsunami. These bills are just part of that process. We, if I can put it this way, negotiated with or explained to the Indonesian government a $1 billion package at the time of the summit organised by President Yudhoyono. There is no doubt that this five year program will have a very significant impact, and I am optimistic that it will work very successfully. We are planning to have the inaugural meeting of the joint commission next Thursday afternoon when we hold the Australia-Indonesia ministerial forum. During the course of that meeting we will really get the whole process under way. There was a report on the front of the Melbourne Age today, and I think the member for Griffith may have mentioned this. Of course, he would have jumped on it and said, ‘This shows that Australia's and Indonesia's relationship has almost completely disintegrated.' My advice to shadow ministers and members of the opposition, having been in opposition for a long time, is: don't go the hyperbole too much, because it tends not to be believed by anybody-and for good reason. This media report suggesting Australia and Indonesia are clashing over the provision of official Australian tsunami assistance is not not correct. Australia and Indonesia are in full agreement over the need to harmonise and coordinate donor efforts. In a meeting only yesterday between Australian officials and the Indonesian planning minister, who is quoted in this story-Sri Mulyani Indrawati-she did not express any concern about the $1 billion Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Develseropment. She expressed no concern about it at all, and I would not imagine that she would. In my experience in dealing with the Indonesians over this issue, they have been nothing but extremely grateful and positive about the whole program and the fact that it is a joint project. For our part, we are committed to ensuring accountability for how Australian taxpayers' money is spent. I know that members going back to their electorates-and I suppose that is particularly government members-want to be able to tell their constituents that the money is being spent properly. Australian assistance is reported, obviously, in the Indonesian budget process. As appropriate, Australia will work within and help build the capacity of Indonesia's existing administrative, financial, auditing, monitoring and evaluation systems. Indeed, we have seconded a senior Australian aid official to Indonesia's official aid coordination agency to provide assistance. So I am not quite sure how this story emerged on the front of a newspaper today, but I would not get excited about it. I think the Indonesians have been enormously grateful for the $1 billion worth of assistance and for what they know it will be able to achieve. Some people argue that we should provide the assistance multilaterally through UN and other agencies rather than doing it directly. Where we live next door to a country, as we do with Indonesia, we probably know the country a good deal better than a lot of the multilateral agencies and we are able to implement more effectively and with a greater degree of transparency and scrutiny our own aid programs on a bilateral basis. Of course, it is a bit different with Sri Lanka, which is further away and about which we know less compared to Indonesia-although we do know Sri Lanka pretty well. So we have placed more emphasis on using multilateral agencies there. But in the case of Indonesia, think it has made sense to have the bilateral project and to implement it in the way that we are. Let me conclude by saying this: during his speech the member for Griffith ranged far and wide about the horrifically bad relationship Australia has with Asia, how the Howard government hates Asia and all this sort of stuff. Again, my advice to the opposition is to try to follow what is actually going on rather than try to spin some kind of a line to the public that is just not credible. We have worked very closely with Indonesia and other countries in the region, but of course from time to time we have difficulties because our national interests do not always coincide. Make no mistake about it, on this side of the House we always stand up for Australia. So sometimes there are disagreements with other countries. The member for Griffith always comes out in support of the other country which has a disagreement with us. It is not right. He should not do that; it makes him look weak and it makes the opposition look weak. I got out of bed today and came to the parliament with a determination to try to help our opposition to look better, because they say that you have good government when you have good opposition. At the moment we have a very poor opposition, and if you were better then we might even be better ourselves-if that is at all possible. You have to think of the logic of these things. The member for Griffith should be more forensic and more credible in his attacks on the government. For example, he says that the doctrine of regional pre-emption has melted Australia's relations with the region. That is not right. But, since he attacks this notion of pre-emption, what we would like to know from the opposition is the answer to this question: in what circumstances, if the opposition became the government, would it I not take action to stop Australians being attacked? What are the circumstances that the opposition would articulate when it would not take action to protect Australians? I would like to know the answer to that question, because that is what the opposition is saying-that there are certain circumstances in which it would not act to protect Australians. Otherwise you would say that, in extremis, if the worse came to the worse, you would take pre-emptive action. But if you say that you would never take pre-emptive action, then there are some circumstances where you would not act to protect Australians. The trouble is that you have not thought this through. You are out there making these claims-they come from the Guardian, the New York Times or Robert Fisk in the Independent. Do not worry, I go through the web sites of these newspapers. I know what they are all saying. This sort of la la land leftie stuff is unfortunately picked up here in this country by our own Australian Labor Party. I could understand it if it were Bob Brown and the Green Left, but the Labor Party are supposed to be a party that one day could become the government. It is very important to think about what you are saying and what the implications are of what you are saying. The fact is that we have done an immense amount in our relationship with Indonesia and with Asia and there is no question of the government's strong commitment to Asia. The Prime Minister was up in Vientiane in November attending the historic ASEANAustralian summit. He would not have been invited to the ASEAN-Australian summit if Asia did not want to deal with Australia-as Paul Keating said they would not. We held the interfaith dialogue in December last year in Yogyakarta, where we brought together religious leaders from throughout the region to help encourage and develop a sense of tolerance and understanding between the different religious groups in the region. We have Muslim exchange programs. We provide an enormous amount of assistance to the Indonesians as well as to other countries in the region in the area of counter-terrorism. One of the things you hear from the opposition over the Iraq issue is that we should be bringing people back here and concentrating on our own region, as though Australia is a country weaker and smaller, even, than, say, New Zealand and as though we cannot actually do more than one thing at a time. If the opposition bothered to look through some of the press releases we put out and the public comments we have made, they would find that Australia does a tremendous amount in the area of counterterrorism in the region. For example, we have basically set up the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, at a cost of $36.8 million over five years. There are excellent relations between the AFP and our intelligence agencies and the Indonesians. I think it is very important for the opposition, if they want to win the confidence of the public, to make sure that they are credible in the arguments they put-and some of their arguments, I am afraid, are really not too credible. The opposition, apparently, are opposed to the Australian Maritime Identification System. The opposition are opposed to us finding out the provenance of ships coming to Australia, the content of those ships and the crew size before they get here. It is all very well to do it for aircraft before they take off to fly to Australian airports, but apparently we should not be doing it with ships. Has the member for Griffith actually thought this through? Is he opposed to the Australian Maritime Identification System? I am sure the shadow minister for transport does not agree with that. In conclusion, I am delighted to support these bills. Other than the member for Griffith, who had his usual rant about the horrific Howard fascist government, the contributions from members opposite, as well as from my colleagues on this side of the House, have been very positive and constructive. We provided this aid package not in order to buy favours in Indonesia, not in order to build up our bilateral relationship with Indonesia but because we thought it was the right thing to do. We thought there was enormous suffering in Indonesia and that, given our proximity, the strong relationship we have with Indonesia and the history of that relationship, we are a country with the capacity to act. We have lived through an era of great economic prosperity in this country and long may it last. We are a rich country. Even our poor are very rich compared with the Indonesian poor. To provide assistance to them in this terrible time is the least we could do. It is not about buying favours or about engagement with East Asia; it is about the common humanity which has been expressed by members of this parliament on both sides in this debate.

Leave granted.",73
33,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"Under section 8A of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has the responsibility to approve or reject a proposed recommendation by the Prime Minister for the appointment to the office of Auditor-General. This is the first occasion on which my committee has exercised this important statutory obligation, it having been enacted during the tenure  rett. The Auditor-General is an independent officer of the parliament, so it is both appropriate and important that my committee has the power to scrutinise and, if it deems necessary, reject a nomination to this position. I am pleased to rise on this occasion to indicate that on 7 March the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit met and gave unanimous approval to the appointment of Mr Ian MCPhee as Auditor-General. The appointment has been approved this morning by the Executive Council. Mr MCPhee is a dedicated and highly competent person who brings a wealth of experience to the position. He was formerly a long-serving employee of the Australian National Audit Office, gaining experience at the highest levels of the organisation as Deputy Auditor-General from 1998 to 2003. He left the Audit Office to become a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Finance and Administration. Mr MCPhee expressed to the committee his views on the positive role of the Audit Office as a value adder. He recognised that the most efficient way of achieving outcomes is through the provision of advice in a cooperative, rather than an oppositional, spirit. Auditors are not an enemy whose role it is to obstruct government agencies and departments. It is not merely the role of the Auditor-General and his staff to scrutinise and criticise government agencies for inefficiencies, but to educate through the publication of better practice guides. However, the primary responsibility of the Audit Office is to ensure that government agencies and departments operate efficiently and effectively, while meeting all the compliance standards that are required of publicly funded agencies. In this the Auditor-General and his staff must operate without fear or favour, and Mr MCPhee's record is a testament to his abilities in this regard. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which I have the honour to chair, and the Audit Office are complementary instruments, through which procedures in the expenditure of public funds are scrutinised and held accountable. Both organisations work best when they enjoy a close working relationship. We look forward to reinforcing and building upon the already strong lines of communication between the JCPAA and the Audit Office during Mr MCPhee's stewardship. On behalf of the committee, I congratulate Mr MCPhee on his appointment and express our complete confidence in his abilities to ensure that the Australian public gets value for its money. Finally, I wish to acknowledge the achievements of the outgoing Auditor as Commonwealth Auditor-General since May 1995. He could be said to be the first truly independent Auditor-General. It was during Mr Barrett's tenure that the Auditor General Act 1997 was enacted-following, of course, a 1996 report by my committeemarking a new era for the ANAO. The act established the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament, gave him more autonomy over the budget of the ANAO and gave him a mandate to audit all Commonwealth entities. During Mr Barrett's time, the Audit Office has proven to be a vital instrument through which government agencies and departments have been held accountable to the parliament. I wish him well for the future and again congratulate Mr MCPhee on his appointment to this important office.",73
34,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am pleased to support the chair, the member for Paterson, in his report to the House of the appointment of Ian MCPhee as the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General position is a prestigious and powerful one. It rightly attracts the respect of all members of this parliament and all those entrusted with the parliament's work in government departments, authorities and agencies. Although this respect may be linked to the legal power that attaches to the position, in the case of Mr Ian MCPhee the respect will clearly attach to the quality and competence of the man himself. Respect will also particularly be extended to Mr MCPhee because of his ability to work consultatively and in an advisory capacity to bring about shared commitment to best practice and continuous improvement. Ian MCPhee has dedicated his professional life to service of the public. He is proudly a public servant and his devotion and competence in that role have been recognised by his peers with Mr MCPhee having been awarded the Public Service Medal in 2002 for outstanding public service to public sector accounting and auditing and the development of industry accounting standards. In 2004 he also became a fellow of the Certified Practicing Accountants, receiving their meritorious service award for his significant contribution and distinguished service to CPA Australia. Internationally, Mr MCPhee is regarded as a leader of reform committed to bringing about continuous improvement in accountability, accounting standards and administrative performance in the public sector. For ordinary Australians, the Auditor-General is basically their man on the job, keeping government honest and giving the public confidence that the money they contribute to the government's purse will be spent prudently and correctly in order to maximise the opportunity for all Australians to benefit from the nation's prosperity. With that obligation in mind, the committee unanimously endorsed the appointment of Ian MCPhee as the next Auditor-General of Australia. In doing so they acknowledged their confidence that Mr MCPhee would be able to continue in the strong tradition of  act independently, impartially and without fear or favour to deliver best outcomes for the people he will serve-the men and women of Australia. I also think the committee know a good numbers man when they see one, and Ian MCPhee comes to the position after having worked in the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian National Audit Office and the Department of Finance and Administration. On behalf of opposition members of JCPAA, I sincerely congratulate Mr MCPhee on his appointment and look forward to working with him and the ANAO in performing our complementary duties. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work of  General position, knowing that he has developed the ANAO to a level of operation admired and respected internationally. The committee and I wish him a healthy and productive future. Finally, I draw attention to the challenges that face our new Auditor-General in this 21st century. Not only have the numbers got bigger, but expectations and demands have risen. Today government operates in an increasingly globalised market environment shaped by continuing technology advances. Government in this century is more complex and more intertwined with the private sector than ever before, making accountability more and more about shared standards and shared performance. Both the Auditor General and the Audit Office face the challenge of assisting government departments, exercising contracts and tenders sometimes worth billions of dollars in the marketplace, to gain the best value for money. The move to international accounting standards, compliance and regulatory frameworks also impacts on the work of the ANAO who take on our an important best-practice development role with departments and agencies. In the current information technology and data dependent work environment, the Audit Office is increasingly involved in the tracking of complex electronic management systems to gauge efficiency and effectiveness of practice. The move to shared systems and shared data also poses particular challenges for Audit, but the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit believe Mr MCPhee is up to the task ahead. Again, I congratulate Mr MCPhee on his appointment as Auditor-General and offer him the support of the committee in maximising the work of the Australian National Audit Office and the Australian government.

35,Mr HUNT,MARINE SCIENCE AMENDMENT,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (1.07 p.m.)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA NA (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 February, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (1.07 p.m.)-The Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005 is an important piece of legislation which aims to strengthen the Commonwealth powers in relation to the investigation and detention of suspected illegal fishers, particularly in the Torres Strait, ensure a seamless transfer of detainees between fisheries and immigration detention. This legislation has been made necessary by the government's past failures to curb illegal fishing activities in northern Australian waters generally. As I understand it, the legislation is a precursor to the establishment of a proposed 250-bed migration detention facility in Darwin for alleged illegal fishers. Despite the government's intense rhetoric about border security and its crass manipulation of the issue for political purposes, particularly in relation to refugees, the documents that became available in 2004 have shown that the problem of illegal fishing is out of hand and that the government's policy of administrative seizure was having little practical effect on preventing illegal fishing in Australia's fishing zone to the north. I can recall that in 2002 the minister issued a quite extraordinary press release in which he said that the government was winning the war against illegal fishing-we all know that that was nonsense. The process of administrative seizure was basically allowing foreign illegal fishers to be temporarily detained and to have some of their gear confiscated. Their boats were pointed back towards the open seas and they were told to skedaddle out of Australia's fishing zone. The government was not really serious about this issue, although its rhetoric was very intense. We on this side of the House dubbed it at the time the government's ‘tag and release' policy. That would have a particular resonance for the fisherpersons in this House and of course for the member opposite, the member for Flinders, who would be aware of that particular fishing terminology. It really was a tag and release policy: grab the boat, interview the captain, seize a bit of gear, then turn the boat around and point it out towards the open seas. Of course, that is not good enough if you are going to be fair dinkum to about the issue of border security. Despite having known of the extent of the problem for years, the government has really been tardy in tackling the problem head-on in a comprehensive way. As we say in political parlance, the government has talked the talk but it has not walked the walk. This bill forms part of several measures being introduced by the government to deal with illegal fishing and, from our point of view, some of these measures are long overdue. In the minister's second reading speech, we are informed that, firstly, extra resources are being provided to AFMA to apprehend and prosecute illegal fishers and, secondly, additional resources are also being provided to AQIS to enhance its ability to monitor and protect Australia from quarantine risks associated with apprehended vessels. Of course, in addition to that, this bill engineers processing and detention arrangements for illegal fishers in the sense that they are being standardised to provide seamless deportation arrangements for illegal fishers. The bill encompasses three pieces of legislation: the Fisheries Management Act, the Torres Strait Fisheries Act and the Migration Act. According to the government, it is aimed at making the Torres Strait Fisheries Act consistent with the Fisheries Management Act, in relation to the powers currently exercised under the latter act, to ensure that adequate time is allowed to investigate alleged offences. Another aim of the legislation, and perhaps the central focus of it, is create a fishing detention regime under both the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act that is broadly consistent with the legal requirements of immigration detention arrangements. These are objectives that the opposition certainly does not quibble about. However, it is important that, in the process of achieving administrative and legal consistency across agencies and across jurisdictions, the parliament is mindful of the need to adequately scrutinise any proposals that seek to extend the exercise of legal powers of enforcement officers. As stated previously, the overall aim of this bill is to achieve consistency between the fisheries detention regime and immigration detention arrangements. Under the Fisheries Management Act, foreign fishers are detained if they are suspected of illegally fishing in Australia's waters. They are automatically granted an enforcement visa which enables fisheries officers to bring them into the migration zone for further investigation and possibly prosecution. It is at this particular point that the provisions of authority of the Migration Act come into play. After that enforcement visa expires, a person assumes the status of an unlawful non-citizen and is then detained under the Migration Act. There are many key elements of this bill, and I want to address their implications further in my speech today. Firstly, the investigation and detention powers under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act are brought broadly into line with those of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Secondly, the bill creates a new class of officer who may exercise powers related to fisheries detention. This will allow employees and contractors of AFMA and DIMIA, who are specifically appointed by the fisheries minister, to exercise detention powers under fisheries legislation. Labor successfully opposed a similar attempt last to year to grant powers as quarantine officers to contractors and their employees. We have consulted widely on this matter with our union colleagues, and the CPSU has expressed its concern about this particular provision. The bill specifically gives fisheries officers the powers that immigration officers currently have in relation to searching and screening of people detained as unlawful non-citizens in an immigration detention facility, including the capacity to conduct searches and strip searches, and to screen persons and visitors. Also under the bill, authorised officers will be given power to collect personal identity information from detainees for the purpose of identifying repeat offenders and facilitating prosecutions. This information may be passed on to other agencies responsible for detention, welfare and the repatriation of detainees. Under this bill, the offence of obstructing an officer will be broadened, and increased penalties will apply. The power of officers to search persons on foreign fishing boats and to examine and take possession of items that may constitute evidence on foreign fishing boats will also be clarified in this piece of legislation. The opposition welcomes that. As I understand it, a new provision will be inserted into the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act to prevent certain legal actions against those assisting officers of the Commonwealth by persons on vessels that are subject to the directions of authorised officer. Also, the forfeiture provisions of the Fisheries Management Act in relation to fishing gear and boats will be extended to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. In the broad sweep of measures in this bill there is a genuine attempt by the government to bring some consistency to the fisheries management and migration detention regimes. Of course, that is welcomed. As I said previously, this problem emerged as far back as 2002, and the minister made the proud boast that the government was on top of the problem. It certainly was not on top of the legal and administrative arrangements-and achieving consistency in them-or it would have tackled those measures at that particular time. We know that the government has been tardy in a whole range of legislative areas, but no more so than in this area. I would have expected that the government would have been able to perform a little better given its rhetoric about how sincere it is about broader protection. There are a range of very good reasons why Australia needs to adequately resource its border protection arrangements in relation to illegal fishing. It is our right under international law to take all reasonable steps necessary to preserve the integrity of our national borders. In addition, we live in difficult times, with the very real threat of terrorism in our region. The Bali and Jakarta bombings were a gruesome reminder to all Australians that some fanatics simply do not respect national borders, and to secure the nation we need adequate border protection arrangements. In addition, in this era of great global mobility, there is an ever present threat that severe economic and environmental disruption and dislocation will be caused by the introduction of exotic pests and diseases that we do not have in Australia. Therefore, our quarantine protection arrangements, which an are designed to protect key rural industries and the biodiversity of Australia's unique physical environment, need to be adequately resourced and professionally administered. Similarly, we live in an unfortunate era where highly organised crime cartels engage in everything from piracy on the high seas to gun-running and trade in illicit drugs. This is a very serious problem, and in relation to politics I know of some pirates in the government ranks. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry effectively pirated many of the policies on agriculture that I put to the Australian people years out from the election. Be that as it may, the odd pirate of policies in the government ought not to deter us from the important task of securing Australia's borders. The task of detection and prosecution of these criminal elements is an extremely important but difficult task for a nation with such an extensive coastline. All of this requires a high degree of sophistication to respond adequately to these threats, and a degree of professionalism and managerial expertise in the coordination of the various agencies involved in the border security task-namely, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, Australian Customs, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian Federal Police and the immigration department. I note the presence in the House today of the honourable member for Corangamite. As I have said in previous debates, there must be something fishy going on when the honourable member for Corangamite comes into this place! I have said in this place before that the honourable member would not know the difference between a piece of flake and a fish patty-and I meant it. It is good to see the honourable member for Corangamite in the chamber. We share part of the Australian coastline in our electorates and we know that it is very important that illegal fishing dressed at both the state and federal levels. As the honourable member for Corangamite knows, illegal fishing is a problem along the Victorian coastline, particularly in relation the pirating of abalone stocks. Far be it from me to categorise the member for Corangamite as a bit of a Captain Hook-an old pirate-because he is a very independent member, but it is good to see him in the chamber taking an interest in these matters. Apart from the considerations that I have just referred to, there are sound economic reasons for Australia to ensure that we adequately protect our interests in the Australian fishing zone. All around Australia-in my electorate, in the electorate of the honourable member for Corangamite and in other electorates-the fishing industry creates employment, generates domestic and export income and is the basic block on which the sustainability of many coastal and regional communities is built. The gross value of production of the Australian fishing industry stands at around $2.3 billion, and around $1.8 billion of that is exported. The total annual catch is in the region of 250,000 tonnes and is valued at around $856 million-that includes rock lobsters, which are worth $460 million; prawns, which are worth $355 million; tuna, which is worth $305 million; and abalone, which is worth $212 million. So this is a very important industry for Australia's export effort and our standard of living. It is an economic fact that the greater part of the industry comes from the exploitation of fish stocks around our coastline and in our oceans. Australia has international legal responsibilities, under treaty and bilateral arrangements, to manage fishery resources in a responsible and sustainable way. I referred earlier to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act and the treaty arrangements that Australia has in place with the government of Papua New Guinea in managing the Torres Strait Prois adtected Zone to adequately protect the precious fish resources in that zone. We also have a community responsibility to ensure that these northern fisheries are available to to Indigenous Australians for their economic use and to sustain their cultures, their economies and the lifestyles of their communities. The incursion of illegal fishers into the fisheries in our north is creating impacts that adversely affect fish stocks in these areas. I refer the House to the Bureau of Rural Sciences Fishery Status Report 2002-03, which provides the government with an independent assessment of the status of fish stocks managed by the Australian government. This is a very important report. It says that, of the 70 principal species classified, 16 were classified as ‘over-fished', 16 as ‘fully-fished', four as ‘under-fished' and 34 as ‘uncertain'. In the Northern Prawn Fishery, banana prawns are categorised as ‘fully-fished', brown tiger prawns as ‘over-fished' and grooved tiger prawns as ‘fully-fished'. The Torres Strait lobster fishery is categorised as ‘over-fished' and the prawn fishery as ‘fullyfished'. So the balance is rather precarious in many of the fisheries, particularly in our north, and illegal fishers exacerbate the problem we have in achieving the sustainability of the resource. As the number of illegal fishing incursions has significantly increased, so has the technical sophistication of the fishers themselves. As sought-after resources become scarce, they become more valuable. When this occurs, the money and the technological effort being put into the illegal task also increases. That leads to greater efficiencies by the illegal fishers, which in turn leads to the magnified adverse impact of the activity on already stretched resources. While Labor support the general thrust of the bill, I want to raise a couple of concerns we have about the framing of this legislation. The appointment of detention officers is dealt with under schedule 1A, part 1, division 3. This provision allows the minister to appoint by instrument a person or members of a class or group of people to be detention officers. This will allow for the creation of a new class of officer with certain limited powers of detention under the Fisheries Management Act. The explanatory memorandum to this bill says: It is envisaged that employees and contractors DIMIA and AFMA will be appointed as detention officers under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 in the same way that employees and contractors are currently employed under the Migra- officers. tion Act 1958. Labor has a problem with giving contractors-that is, people who are not directly responsible to the Commonwealth as employees-the powers granted to detention officers elsewhere in this bill. These include the power to search and confiscate property. We have no problem with Commonwealth employees having these powers, as they have clear lines of responsibility, through the department, to the minister and eventually to this parliament. They can clearly be held to account for their actions and are subject to directions from senior officers and the minister. Similarly, we would have no problem giving these powers to employees of the states and territories because they also are clearly accountable and are subject to direction by their senior officers. But we have always had a problem in this portfolio area of extending police-like powers to contractors, who are certainly not trained to undertake the task. The issue came up last year when the government sought to bring in legislation that would have allowed the minister to appoint any Tom, Dick or Harry as a quarantine officer. On that occasion Labor successfully argued that it was not appropriate to appoint contactors-people who were not directly accountable to the department, the minister and this parliament-as quarantine officers. We argued at the time that if the minister needed greater flexibility in appointing quarantine officers he should only appoint those who would be subject to clear lines of public accountability such as other federal or state public servants and police officers. On that occasion the government finally saw the sense of Labor's arguments and came to of agree with us. The quarantine legislation eventually went through this parliament last year with a provision allowing the minister to appoint private contactors as quarantine The provisions of this bill are somewhat similar to those that were originally in the quarantine legislation. It is mainly for this reason that Labor arranged to refer the bill to a Senate committee to allow the issue of the granting of these wide powers to contactors, who may well be subject to a lesser level of accountability for these actions than are public servants, to be examined. We will await the outcome of that inquiry before determining Labor's position on any possible amendments to this legislation. With regard to the provision of legal assiswell. tance, Labor welcomes the fact that under the proposed new section 24 of the act a detainee must be provided with access to legal advice. However, I am concerned that there is nothing in this piece of legislation that requires officials to inform detainees that they have the right to access reasonable facilities for obtaining legal advice. I am advised that section 23G of the Crimes Act places an obligation on an investigating officer to inform suspects of their rights, and places the onus on fisheries detention officers to do the same. However, I urge the government to give consideration to amending this bill to incorporate a requirement that detainees be informed of their rights to access legal advice. I think this is sensible and it feeds into that provision in the bill which has as its aim the protection of officers who are entrusted with these tasks under law to protect these fisheries. It may be possible to do this by adding a note to the clause in the bill that deals with the rights of detainees to legal assistance. The vast majority of detainees will have little understanding of Australian law and practices, and it is important that they are informed of their rights under Australian law where practicable. I understand it is not uncommon to include such provisions in legislation, even were the rights specified under the Crimes Act also to apply. I urge the government to do the same in this bill. This is an important piece of legislation. In summing up, I reiterate what I said earlier on in this debate: the problem has not gone away; indeed, it has increased. We have had thousands of reports of illegal fishing in our waters to our north in particular. Many of those may well have been multiple sightings, but we do know that the number of vessels apprehended and detained has increased. We know also that the level of sophistication of illegal fishing has certainly improved as So the weights are really on the government, in this particular legislation and in general policy, to ensure that Australia's borders are made secure. The legislation we have before us goes a considerable way to achieving that objective. I do not have any problem with saying that. I simply say that this problem was evident in 2002, and achieving some degree of administrative and legal consistency across the various agencies and jurisdictions is a matter that this I thought would have been in this parliament before March 2005. This legislative task should have been undertaken years ago, but the government really was not serious about the issue. It was serious about the political rhetoric used for its own political advantage but it really was not serious about getting on top of this issue. At least the now infamous tag and release policy that we had in our northern fisheries has in some way been addressed by this piece of legislation. The opposition will be supporting its passage through this House. I have already indicated that we will, in the other place, refer this to a committee for further finetoothcombing. We will examine in minute detail the provisions of this legislation and we will give people interested in this the opportunity of contributing, especially on those dimensions relating to the legal rights of people when they are detained and the rights of Commonwealth officers in exercising the task of apprehension and detention. All of those particular matters will be subject to the professional scrutiny of the Senate. If there are matters arising out of that that require further legislative attention we will pursue those. We hope in good faith that the government will examine the output of that process because, at the end of the day, we want the best set of arrangements to ensure that Australia's borders are adequately protected. Let the people of Australia be in no doubt at all about the Australian Labor Party's commitment to border security. What we will not do, though, is play politics with the issue. We want good outcomes. We hope that with this legislation we can walk some way along that path.",76
36,Dr JENSEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I was somewhat bemused and amused at the member for Corio's strident speech about the government's lack of response in terms of border security. When I look at the opposition's record in terms of border security I find the amount of flip-flops, backflips, front flips and however you want to put it flips actually quite staggering. They must be chafing in some of their nether regions from sitting on the fence. I find it quite interesting that the member, in speaking about the inadequacy of the government's response in terms of illegal fishing, mentioned that the problem was identified in 2002. But what actually happened? The member was quite boastful about the fact that, when the government attempted to put in provisions to combat the illegal fishing regime, the opposition blocked the bill. He was quite proud about that. You wonder why he is now so stridently in favour of strong action as far as illegal fishing is concerned. Be that as it may, Labor has never been strong on border protection, as was in evidence in 2001 with the Tampa. But I will turn now to the bill before the House, the Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005. There have been problems with the differences in legislation with regard to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Migration Act. The point with the Torres Strait Fisheries Act was that it came about in a similar manner to an agreement with Indonesia in 1974, and the purpose of these acts and agreements was essentially to allow traditional inhabitants to fish their traditional gions without prosecution. However, what we have at the moment is illegal fishing. In many cases it is from Indonesia, and media attention has been paid recently to fishing boats coming from Papua New Guinea and illegally fishing Australian waters. Clearly, many of these are commercial operations and could not be deemed to be traditional fishing by traditional inhabitants in any way, shape or form. However, the problem has been that the Torres Strait Fisheries Act and the Fisheries Management Act have not given adequate search and seizure powers. The bill before us is to close those loopholes and to bring the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, the Fisheries Management Act and the Migration Act into accord so that there is no conflict about what specific situation applies and what specific powers apply to specific officers. Originally the fisheries acts gave powers to detain but there was no provision for imprisonment, apart from when fines that had been imposed were not paid. Clearly, the acts were inadequate in that regard. The current bill specifies the types of officers who are allowed to detain illegal fishermen. It addresses discrepancies between powers relating to the forfeiture of items, be they items on the people themselves or, indeed, the boats that they use to engage in these illegal fishing activities. When an illegal fishing activity is detected, the boat will be boarded. It will be seized, and enforcement visas will be applied to the illegal fishermen so that they can be brought into Australia and thence charged. This bill will confirm the Commonwealth's ability to restrain people caught illegally fishing. Powers that have not traditionally been given to officers who have detained these fishermen in fishing boats have been, for example, the ability to search or to check the identity of people that have been caught. reWhere there is reasonable suspicion, the bill allows the officers concerned to strip search the illegal fishermen, but only to the level deemed necessary in order to search for what is suspected. This is a very important part of the bill in that many of these fishermen potentially could carry arms. It is perfectly sonable that officers who are conducting enforcement operations should have a reasonable ability to determine how much of a threat to their personal safety these illegal fishermen could be. As I have stated, these strip searches are to be carried out only if there is reasonable suspicion that there is a potential risk. In terms of identification of illegal fishermen, the current acts do not allow for going into detailed ID checks. This bill allows provision for taking fingerprints from illegal fishermen, putting them through metal detectors, doing X-rays and getting signatures. However, it is important to note that these ID provisions do not apply to people under 15 or to people who are otherwise incapable. An important provision of this bill is that it makes exercising officers arresting illegal fishermen immune from legal action if they are acting in good faith. This is an important provision; otherwise there would probably be a great amount of litigation in this regard. It is important to note as well that part of the reason for this bill is that there has been court activity in the past concerning the apprehension of illegal fishermen. Under the current Fisheries Management Act there is no screening allowed. Clearly, this is inadequate. People who appear to be illegal fishermen may indeed be more than that-for example, under the guise of being illegal fishermen, they may be attempting to get to Australia to conduct terrorist activity. The identification provisions include the videoing of suspects. An important issue that has been brought to light in cases where mobile phones have video cameras and so on is that it is clearly an abuse of those videos. Under this legislation the ID process allows videos to be taken. However, if people do not have adequate authority to view the video or they use it for illegal viewing, a two-year reasentence could apply to them. It is important in this regard that only reasonable and explicitly stated disclosure of ID be allowed between authorised officers. We do not want the situation where videos or other ID information that may be compromising is allowed to be accessed by all and sundry. In conclusion, I would like to say that this bill has been required for a while. It brings into line the Migration Act, the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act but it still allows for traditional fishing to take place.",82
37,Mr MCCLELLAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I can confirm that the opposition does support the Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005. In general terms the legislation, as the previous speaker indicated, seeks to ensure that the investigation, detention and forfeiture provisions of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act-which I will call the Torres Strait act-and the Fisheries Management Act are in line with those in the Migration Act 1958. At present, fishing in the Torres Strait is regulated by the Torres Strait act, whereas elsewhere fishing is regulated by the Fisheries Management Act. While the provisions in these acts are similar, they are not identical, particularly in respect of some significant coercive search and seizure powers. This bill significantly enhances the powers of fisheries officers to detain and investigate suspected illegal foreign fishers and clarifies the powers fisheries officers may exercise. It is a welcome step, we believe, towards streamlining Australia's legislative response to preventing illegal foreign fishing. Australia has faced an influx of foreign fishing arrivals for literally hundreds of years. In fact when Matthew Flinders arrived in the region that was to become Darwin, he found villages where people from Indonesia were drying fish and obviously had been doing so for some considerable time. This is a particularly significant issue for Australia. We have responsibilities and rights in our exclusive economic zone, which covers some 16 million square kilometres. It is an area more than twice the size of the land mass of continental Australia. It ranges across some 60 degrees of latitude and 100 degrees of longitude. It includes some 30,000 kilometres of coastline and about 12,000 islands. This extensive area is not only a massive environmental responsibility but also an economic opportunity. We also have international responsibilities over that massive area. Under article 61 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea we have an obligation to ensure, through proper conservation and management measures, that we maintain the living resources in our exclusive economic zone and to ensure that those resources are not endangered by overexploitation. So illegal foreign fishing depleting those resources is obviously fundamentally crucial to the issue. Under that Law of the Sea convention, we are authorised as a coastal state to detain eign fishing vessels engaged in fishing in our exclusive economic zone. Article 73, which is given effect in domestic law, is reproduced in section 84 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Indeed, further justification for enforcing our fisheries laws in our exclusive economic zone against foreign-flag fishing vessels is provided in the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's code of conduct for responsible fisheries management. So we have an international responsibility to preserve the sustainability of our fish stocks and also the right to exploit those fish stocks in a responsible way so that they are both managed and sustained into the future. The bill deals with the situation where at present foreign fishers may be detained under the Fisheries Management Act and once detained are automatically granted an enforcement visa which enables fisheries officers to bring them into the migration zone for further investigation without that act triggering what might otherwise give them entitlement to rights under the Migration Act to apply for residency, asylum and so forth. There is currently no power under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act to detain a person specifically to investigate foreign fishing offences. This bill will bring the Torres Strait Fisheries Act in line with the Fisheries Management Act by enabling fisheries officers to detain and investigate persons suspected of committing an offence under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. The bill will also enable fisheries officers to search and screen detained fishers for the purpose of obtaining evidence, weapons and other things that could be used to escape from detention. Authorised officers will be empowered to collect personal information from detainees for the purpose of identifying them. This information may be passed on to other agencies responsible for the detention and perhaps repatriation of those detainees. The bill will also amend the Torres Strait forFisheries Act to provide for the automatic forfeiture of vessels and other equipment used in foreign fishing offences-obviously an important disincentive for those who would otherwise engage in illegal foreign fishing in our exclusive economic zone. Provisions of this kind are currently set out in the Fisheries Management Act but not in the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. The offence of obstructing an officer will also be broadened and increased penalties will be applied, significantly increasing the coercive elements of the provisions. The bill as it stands, however, does contain a number of provisions that do warrant close examination, including the extension of the powers of fisheries officers to independent contractors and their employees. While it is generally appropriate that officers of the Commonwealth exercising coercive powers have these extensive powers, we do have some concerns where these sorts of coercive powers are delegated on the basis of commercial contracts rather than appointment as an officer of the Commonwealth. These are issues which do require closer examination and for that reason we will be supporting a reference of this legislation for closer examiSection nation by the relevant committee of the House. For instance, under the proposed legislation a new class of officer is created who may exercise powers related to fisheries detention. This will allow not only employees of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs who are specifically appointed by the fisheries minister but also contractors and their employees, who may have these functions delegated to them, to exercise these coercive and detention powers. These officers will be authorised among other things to conduct strip searches of detainees, without the need to obtain a warrant, to find out whether the person being searched has ‘a weapon or other thing capable of being used to inflict bodily harm' or that may be used ‘to help the detainee escape from detention'. Indeed, under the bill these officers will have immunity from legal action in respect of anything done in the course of their duties, provided it is done in good faith. So these are broad coercive powers that involve also the powers of search and detention, and warrant examination particularly to the extent that these powers can be exercised by persons who are contractors or employees of contractors rather than duly appointed officers of the Commonwealth. There is also some uncertainty in the bill as to whether there is an obligation to inform detainees that they may request legal advice in relation to their detention. Under proposed section 24 the person responsible for their detention must, it is specified, ‘provide the detainee with access to reasonable facilities for obtaining legal advice or taking legal proceedings in relation to his or her detention'. Under section 24, however, there is no obligation on detaining officers to actually inform detainees that they have this right. 9 of the bill provides that the existing protections under part IC of the Crimes Act 1914 continue to apply to the detained persons and, in particular, section 23G of the act provides that an investigating official must inform a detained suspect that they can obtain legal advice regarding their detention. Given that one of the stated objects of the bill is to provide for persons in fisheries detention to be given access to facilities for obtaining legal advice, as a matter of prudence it is our opinion that it may be useful to add a note in section 24 of the bill crossreferencing the detainee's rights under section 23G of the Crimes Act 1914. We draw the Attorney-General's attention to that matter. Illegal foreign fishing is a great threat to Australia's fisheries resources and sustainability. If unchecked it could indeed pose a significant risk to our economic environment if, for instance, the circumstances of a ship arriving on our shore resulted in the release of some exotic pest or disease. That could have a devastating impact on our economy.",83
38,The SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate will be resumed at a later hour. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply",85
39,The SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I have ascertained that His Excellency the Governor General will be pleased to receive the address-in-reply at Government House next Tuesday, 15 March 2005 at 6.30 p.m. I shall be glad if the mover, the member for Greenway, and the seconder, the member for Stirling, together with other honourable members, will accompany me to present the address. NA Taxation",86
40,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware the OECD report released overnight shows that a typical two-income family with two children in Australia faces a tax grab on their extra earnings of 61.5c in the dollar? Is the Prime Minister aware that this tax grab on a family's additional earnings is higher than in every other OECD country examined? After nine long years, does the Prime Minister expect Australians to stomach his high-tax, rising interest rate double whammy?",86
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of newspaper reports on the OECD report. I am also aware that the OECD report contains some very serious errors. And I am also aware that Leaders of the Opposition who run off newspaper headlines without doing any proper analysis normally do not succeed in going any further than being a Leader of the Opposition. The Treasurer and the Treasury separately have already pointed out the flaws in the OECD analysis, and I have no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition will hear more on this subject later in question time. Taxation",86
42,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of reports regarding international rates of taxation?,86
43,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,86
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Would the member for Cowper commence his question again. There is too much noise.,86
45,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of reports regarding international rates of taxation? Would the Treasurer explain the accuracy of these reports?,86
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. My attention has been drawn to a newspaper article in the Australian today which purports to show that tax take as a percentage of earnings increased between 1996 and 2004, according to an OECD report released overnight. In particular, it purports to show that there was a spike in the tax take in 2002. Members of this House will know that there were no tax increases in 2002, so they will be interested to know how this graph could possibly show a spike. Mr Speaker, let me say to you that that graph and the story that runs off it are dead wrong. Why? Because, as the report itself shows, for the year 2002 that graph included in the tax take on those people, for the first time ever, not an income tax and not an employee contribution tax but state payroll tax. State payroll tax was not, of course, introduced in 2002. The OECD decided to change its methodology and include state payroll tax in 2002 without redoing the historical tables back to 1996 to include it as well. So the comparison between 1996 and 2004 is a comparison between tax excluding state payroll tax and tax including state payroll tax. This point was made at page 30 of the report, which reads as follows: The increase in the wedge noted for Australia and Japan in 2002 are also the result of changes in reporting practices. In the case of Australia, state payroll taxes are included for the first time. What a surprise: the OECD put a state payroll tax in for the first time in 2002 and the graph showed that tax on income went up. That is not because tax went up but because the OECD put the payroll tax in for 2002 and forgot to adjust the tables for 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996. Which member of this House do you think was out early this morning trying to mislead people? There are people in public life in Australia today who have made a career out of denying that when you are paid $600 you get $600. That is completely misleading. I will present at the end of question time the OECD comparison of Australia's position in relation to the 30 countries of the OECD on tax to GDP ratios. Of the 30 countries in the OECD, Australia is the eighth lowest. There are 22 countries above us, including Canada, France, Germany, the UK and also, if I read this table correctly, New Zealand. The countries which are below us are some countries with which we do not normally compare ourselves, such as Mexico, Korea and Turkey. In addition to that, I present a press release from the Secretary to the Treasury nailing this dishonesty and indicating that this was referred to the OECD in 2004, as a result of which they changed their press releases and made the note inside the report. If the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer had any decency, they would get up and apologise for relying on these tables and misconstruing them and for all of the falsehoods that they have been spreading this morning.",86
47,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it the case that the OECD report tables showing changes in the tax burden since 1996 leave out the addition of state payroll taxes in 2002? Government member-He just said that.,87
48,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat: leave out the payroll taxes. If this is the case, don't they show that the tax burden for a single income earner on 67 per cent of average earnings has still increased by 2.1 percentage points over the last nine years and for a sole parent on 67 per cent of average earnings has still increased by 3.4 percentage points over the last nine years? If the coalition claims to be low taxing, why has the net tax burden on these individuals and these families increased over the last nine years?",87
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member could not have listened to the answer I have already given. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting,87
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Wills!,87
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The payroll tax was excluded until 2002. I have just read this from the report itself: The increase in the wedge noted for Australia and Japan in 2002are you saying that the report is wrong?are the result of changes in reporting practices. In the case of Australia ... I am reading from the report; you say there was no change in 2002. Let me read you the report: In the case of Australia, state payroll taxes are included for the first time. That is what it says-and again on page 31. This is the old trick-the old trick of the $600. Remember the $600 that did not exist? If he says it over and over and over enough, Taxation he can get a journalist to actually repeat it. Here is the report, page 30. There it is again on page 31. He is maintaining that the report is inaccurate because it says it was not included. Mr Swan interjecting",87
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is maintaining his position. He has got egg on his face and he is maintaining his position. That is what the report says. That is what the secretary to the Treasury says. If there is going to be a contest for credibility on economic policy and it is between Wayne Swan and Ken Henry, I do not know that it will be much of a contest. Employment",88
53,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the labour force data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics this morning? What implications can be drawn from this as to the state of the Australian economy?,88
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for her question. Yes, my attention has been drawn to today's labour force statistics. These statistics are further evidence of the underlying strength and opportunities of the Australian economy. They are a reminder-particularly, in the fervid atmosphere of debate in this place, to the Leader the Opposition and those who sit behind him-that it is important that we keep a sense of perspective about reporting on the state of the Australian economy. These figures show that our unemployment rate remains at 5.1 per cent. That rate has not been lower since November 1976. In other words, you have to go back more than 28 years to find an unemployment figure that is lower than what has been recorded today. We have seen 20,000 new jobs created in the month of February; total job creations since March 1996 have now risen to more than 1.5 million. If we are talking about what is important to the men and women of Australia about the economy, it is important to remember that nothing exceeds in significance the capacity of that economy to generate jobs. Despite everything that has been said by the opposition-and notwithstanding the fact, as I acknowledged yesterday, that there were some figures last week which were seen, understandably, in a negative lightthere is no point in pretending that you can preside over an economy for nine years or more and expect that every single statistic is going to be positive. It never can be and it never will be. In the months and years ahead, there will be other statistics that will be more negative than we would like. That is all the more reasonMr Kelvin Thomson-You didn't say that before the election.",88
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills is warned!,88
56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"why we should keep a sense of perspective. The fundamentals of this economy are very strong. Unemployment is at a 28-year low. Interest rates remain at historically low levels. We have presided over significant reductions in the level of of taxation. We preside over very high levels of business investment. And, in stark contrast to the performance of those who went before us, we have one of the strongest fiscal positions of any country in the world. I emphasise those things to make the point that I made to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. It is all right to get excited about one or two figures. It is all right to opportunistically run off some newspaper headlines-which the Leader of the Opposition has done this morning, to his very great embarrassment. The Leader of the Opposition gets up this morning, grabs hold of the Australian and thinks, without going into the detail of it, that he has another point of criticism. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that 1.5 million Australians have got work as a result of the policies of this government over the last nine years. We have delivered to the workers of Australia not only more employment but also higher wages, lower taxation and lower interest rates. That is a quadrella that they could never dream of enjoying under a Labor government. Taxation",88
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister and again refers to the OECD report released overnight, which shows a typical two-income family with two children in Australia faces a tax grab on their extra earnings of 61.5c in the dollar, unaffected by any payroll taxes. Is the Prime Minister aware that this tax grab on a family's additional earnings is higher than in every other OECD country examined? After nine long years does the Prime Minister expect Australians to stomach his high tax and rising interest rate double whammy?",89
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition can say alters the fundamental fact that he has got it wrong, the OECD has got it wrong, and the explanation that the Treasurer has made demonstrates that and demonstrates that very strongly. As I hope the Leader of the Opposition would know from his former experience, whenever you have benefits to wage and salary earners that are means tested-income tested-there is a point at which the withdrawal of that benefit will create what is variously described as an effective marginal tax rate. The Leader of the Opposition, if he had any semblance of honesty in this debate, would acknowledge that during the last budget we brought down a number of measures that resulted in a very significant relief being given to families of Australia in relation to the effective marginal tax rate. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition again that the fundamental basis of the criticism that he and the shadow Treasurer have made based on the OECD report is totally flawed. As the Secretary of the Treasury points out in his press release, the OECD was told to correct the tables and the OECD failed to do that. Like those who jump in eagerly grabbing hold of any excitable headline, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley have not understood that if you introduce for the first time in 2002 the notion that state payroll tax is legitimately to be computed as part of income tax, and you do not make any adjustment for the previous years, of course you are going to end up with a higher figure in 2003 and 2004 than you have in 1996, because you are not, to use the colloquialism, comparing apples with apples. The reality is the OECD has got it wrong. That was pointed out by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley have got it wrong, just as they get so many other criticisms of the government wrong. Employment",89
59,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House the results of the February labour force survey? What do these figures reveal about not only the strength of the Australian economy but also employment growth?,89
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question and acknowledge the work that he does in that capacity. I can inform the House that in the month of February there were 20,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy. What is more, there was a decline in part-time jobs so that the number of new full-time jobs created in the month of February was 37,900. That means that here in Australia in the last year, the number of new jobs created was around 325,000. For the 19th month in a row unemployment continues below six per cent and it continues at a record 30-year low of 5.1 per cent on a very high participation rate. There has been some commentary recently in the press about shortages of labour. There has been a lot of focus on skills shortages but, as I have pointed out on numbers of occasions, Australia also has unskilled shortages. Let me make the point: one of the reasons-perhaps the major reason-why we are now seeing labour shortages in the Australian economy is that unemployment is low. You never saw labour shortage problems in 1990, when unemployment was double the rate that it is now. As far as economic problems go, the problem of too many jobs chasing too few people is a good problem to have. It is certainly a much better problem to have than too many people chasing too few jobs. Nobody ever talked about skills shortages or unskilled shortages when the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. I must congratulate him on that. The now Leader of the Opposition abolished labour shortages for a very long period of time. He abolished them by putting one million out of work. There were no shortages back then with unemployment at 10.9 per cent. Having said all of that, we should not be afraid of low unemployment in Australia. The object of economic policy is to get unemployment low-to give people the opportunity to find work. We can continue to run economic growth on low unemployment as long as we keep wages in line with productivity. The only way in which this could be disturbed by high employment and low unemployment is if people took the opportunity to try to base wage outcomes out of whack with productivity. If that were to happen then you would get inflationary pressures in the economy. But there is no reason for that. Real wages are growing in Australia. Unemployment is low. There are more people in work than ever before. The prospects for the Australian economy are for continuing jobs growth. Our goal ought to be this: a job opportunity for everyone who wants to work, with the opportunity of a decent wage in a growing economy. That is the object of economic policy. Minimum Wages",89
61,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister guarantee that no individual Australian worker's wage will be lowered as a result of the government's proposed changes to minimum wage arrangements?,90
62,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What this government is on about is higher wages and more jobs for Australians. The facts clearly speak for themselves. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pointed out in question time today, what we have had since 1996 is 1.5 million extra jobs in this country. In addition to that, we have had an increase in wages in real terms of over 12 per cent.",90
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order that goes to relevance. It was a simple question. Will the minister guarantee that no individual Australian worker's wage will be lowered as a result of the government's proposed changes to minimum wage arrangements? It is simple: yes or no?",90
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is talking about wages. I call the minister.,90
65,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying to the House, since 1996 we have seen in Australia in real terms a 12-plus per cent increase in wages. That stands in stark contrast to the appalling record of the Australian Labor Party when it was in government, when we had an increase in real wages in this country of just over one per cent. That is the reality. Any future measures that this government takes will be in line with that desire of the Australian government not only to increase jobs for Australians but to continue to increase their real wages. ANZAC Cove",90
66,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on developments in relation to the ongoing road works at ANZAC Cove?,91
67,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his interest. I know many veterans-and, indeed, the rest of the community-will be interested in this issue. There have been reports, which were referred to a couple of days ago, in the media about the Gallipoli peninsula, in particular ANZAC Cove, and there being problems there. Let me just make a couple of things pretty clear in answer to the honourable member's question. I met with the Turkish ambassador just before question time today. We had a discussion about the proposal to improve the road system around ANZAC Cove. The member for Hughes, in her capacity as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in August last year wrote to the Turkish authorities and explained that she thought there was a need for improvement in some of the road systems, for safety reasons. The Turkish authorities, quite rightly, are endeavouring to improve those roads. There has been significant erosion over the years, and the road above ANZAC Cove, in particular, requires urgent reinforcing. The ambassador, yet again, has reassured me that the historical significance of ANZAC Cove and other sites will be protected while these essential roadworks are undertaken. He has confirmed the advice that I provided to the House a couple of days ago that no remains have been uncovered during the roadworks and that soil which has been placed on ANZAC Cove beach would be removed shortly. We are grateful for that. Can I also say that we appreciate very much the work that the Turkish authorities do to preserve the Gallipoli peninsula. We all know how much it means to us as Australians, and the Turkish government and the Turkish people are very sensitive to that. There is no suggestion that the Turkish government is going to somehow politicise the Gallipoli peninsula. There is no suggestion the Turkish government is going to turn it into some symbol of Turkish triumphalism, militarism and nationalism, as has been suggested in newspapers. I think it is very important that people be reassured that the Turkish government is working very closely with us to ensure that ANZAC Cove and the Gallipoli peninsula are properly preserved and remain an enormously important commemorative memorial to our people as well as to the Turkish people, and that it will continue to look after the peninsula with appropriate dignity. ANZAC Cove",91
68,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying, on 18 December 2003: ... it seems to me ... entirely appropriate that the ANZAC site at Gallipoli should represent the first nomination for inclusion on the National Heritage List. Does the Prime Minister also remember stating: I have no doubt that the Turkish Government will give permissionfor the listing. Given it has been 15 months since you made that unequivocal commitment",91
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member will refer to the Prime Minister.,91
70,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given it has been 15 months since the Prime Minister made that unequivocal commitment and seven other sites have been listed on the National Heritage List, why hasn't ANZAC Cove already been protected by being listed on the National Heritage List?",91
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly do remember saying that. I remember making it very clear at the time that in order to follow through we would need the permission of the Turkish government. Discussions have taken place at a diplomatic level since then. In the cut and thrust of politics you can expect any question, but I think it is unfortunate tempt is being made by the member from Sydney to politicise this-I really do. But, anyway, I am very happy to acknowledge that it was on 18 December 2003. We can all work out how many months have gone by since then. I can point out that since then it has been the subject of representations, at a diplomatic level, to the Turkish government. I do not think it is unreasonable of the Turkish government thus far not to have responded fully. I echo what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, and that is that the Turkish government, in all of these matters, has exhibited a great willingness to cooperate with Australia. Any suggestion that there is any discord between the Australian governmentMs Gillard interjecting",92
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The implication behind the question is either that the Australian ernment has not pursued the matter, which is wrong, or that the Turkish government has been dilatory in responding. Both of those allegations are wrong. They are not worthy allegations to be made on such a subject by any member of the opposition. I find it interesting that this question has been asked by the member for Grayndler and not by the Leader of the Opposition. But he has asked the questionMr Albanese interjecting",92
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Grayndler has already asked his question.,92
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will simply say that we continue to be in discussion with the Turkish government. If, later next month, I see the Turkish Prime Minister in Istanbul, I will raise the matter with him. But I believe the matter is being appropriately pursued. I do not think the Australian government has lacked commitment and I do not for a moment think the Turkish government has been dilatory. I think it is regrettable that the questhat an attion has been asked. National Water Commission",92
75,Mr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House what progress has been made in establishing the National Water Commission and appointing the inaugural national water commissioners?,92
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to inform the member for Kingston, who comes from a state that will benefit massively from the Living Murray initiative, that his state will benefit massively from the initiative of the National Water Commission. I am pleased to inform the House that appointments to the National Water Commission have been approved by the Federal Executive Council and that the inaugural Chairman of the National Water Commission will be Mr Ken Matgovthews, who brings to the position relevant experience as a former secretary of the Commonwealth departments of Transport and Regional Services and Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He has been appointed also as chief executive officer of the commission. The three Commonwealth representative are Mr David Trebeck, a well-known  the National Farmers Federation; and Professor Peter Cullen, whose reputation in this area is renowned not only in Australia but around the world. The three commissioners nominated by the states and territories are Ms Chloe Munroe, Dr John Radcliffe and Dr Walter Cox. Each member of the commission has been selected for the expertise that he or she brings and the contribution they can make as individual members of the National Water Commission. There are very important, indeed historic, tasks ahead for this commission. Some $500 million will now be available for the Living Murray initiative, of which the Commonwealth has contributed $200 million. Projects from the various states that have been put forward will be considered according to the criteria of the commission. I am particularly pleased to inform the House that Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have now all reaffirmed their commitment to the National Water Initiative that they signed in June last year. I want to thank the premiers and chief ministers of those states and territories. This is an area where I believe the Commonwealth and the states can work together for the benefit of Australia. At the meeting that took place last year there was a spirit of cooperation. I welcome that and I welcome the reaffirmation of the states' commitment. I understand that discussions are progressing with Tasmania. I hope Tasmania signs the National Water Initiative. I invite Dr Gallop, re-elected as Premier of Western Australia, to reconsider his state's unwillingness so far to sign the National Water Initiative. The pastoralists of Western Australia will benefit enormously from that initiative. I hope that he and the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lennon, join with all the other states and, in response to the great conservation challenge of the age, we can have a truly cooperative response from the Commonwealth and all the state and territory governments of Australia. It is what the Australian people want, it is what the Australian people rightly expect and I hope it is what the Australian people will ultimately get. Infrastructure Development",92
77,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Is it the case that, until the Treasurer spoke in the House on 8 and 16 February about infrastructure capacity constraints, the Treasurer had not previously spoken in the parliament about infrastructure capacity constraints since becoming Treasurer in 1966?",93
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,93
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After being Treasurer since 1966! Why do I look so young? Somewhere there is an ageing photograph of me with wrinkles and lines, which is taking all of the punishment. Of course I have mentioned infrastructure in this parliament on a number of occasions. One of the obvious times that comes to mind was from last year's budget in relation to AusLink. AusLink would probably be the most major infrastructure that we have ever announced in relation to roads. I would be very surprised if I did not mention that. Australia's largest road project under consideration at the moment is a thing called the Scoresby Freeway. Memory would tell me that I have mentioned the Scoresby Freeway in this House on a number of occasions. Memory would also tell me that I have mentioned some of Australia's big mining projects and the investment that has been going on in mining. Let me make this point: infrastructure is not merely a matter for government; a lot of infrastructure in Australia is built by the private sector. Whether it be the alumina plant at Gladstone that I have spoken about on a number of occasions or whether it be other mining projects, that is real infrastructure. The other point that I have been making is that private investment, particularly in mining infrastructure, has been going up for a long time. We appreciate the question, but I will warrant you that, like many questions, it is based on a false premise. Practice Nurses",93
80,Ms PANOPOULOS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the government is increasing the number of practice nurses to provide better access to health services?,94
81,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for her question. I can inform the House that one way to address the doctor shortage is to make better use of the highly skilled thoroughly dedicated nurses of Australia. That is precisely what the Howard government has been doing. In the 2001 budget the government provided some $26 million a year to subsidise the employment of practice nurses in country areas. I can tell the House that there are now more than 1,000 nurses employed in country general practice. In Strengthening Medicare these subsidies were extended to outer metropolitan areas. I can inform the House that there are now more than 550 medical practices in outer metropolitan areas that employ a practice nurse. In a historic initiative the government tended Medicare rebates for the first time to nurse consultations. I can inform the House that in the 12 months to February there were more than 20 million practice nurse consultations, and I am sure members opposite will be pleased to know that 94 per cent of those have been bulk-billed. The nurses of Australia belong in general practice just as much as they belong in hospitals. This is more good news from the Howard government and proof positive that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Apprenticeships",94
82,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education told an engineering conference last week that the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australian had $44 billion worth of civil and mining earthworks in the pipeline but is being forced to shelve projects because of the skills shortage? Is the Prime Minister aware that according to the Skills at work report, in 2001-02 just 0.7 per cent of all Howard government training expenditure was in mining? Prime Minister, when there is a blazing skills crisis that means vital infrastructure projects have to be shelved, why is the Howard government pointing the New Apprenticeships and funding hose away from the fire?",94
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In concluding an answer to the previous question, my colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing said that the Howard government was the best friend that Medicare has ever had. I can say this: the Latham opposition before the last election was certainly not the best friend that the mining industry of Australia has ever had. The recipe for the mining industry from Mark Latham and the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition was to take hundreds of millions of dollars away from the mining industry in order to fund university education. Let me excome to the essence of the question. Mr Beazley interjecting",94
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even the Leader of the Opposition may be interested in this. The essence of this-and it is all of a piece with the question that was asked by the member yesterday-is that in some way the money we make available for apprentices and for training is firstly inadequate and secondly skewed against those in the traditional trades. That is the charge that is being made by the Australian Labor Party. The member for Jagajaga, if she listens for a moment, might in fact understand how absolutely wrong that particular charge is. The government last year spent $510 million on providing incentives to employers with apprentices. In the 2001-02 financial year employers spent an estimated $3.6 billion in net direct expenditure on structured training. This represented an increase of 52 per cent since 1996. I take the opportunityunlike the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who bags employers at every opportunity she gets-of thanking Australian employers for this commitment. Let me point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that employees in the traditional trades represent, presently, on my advice, 13 per cent of the Australian work force. Importantly, traditional trade apprenticeships currently represent 38 per cent of all new apprentices in training. In other words, you have a cohort in the work force which is 13 per cent, but the training additions to that cohort represent 38 per cent of all new apprentices. These are not rhetorical flights of fancy, grabbed from the air by somebody who has an ideological bias in this area, of which all of us are very well aware; these are fundamental facts about training in Australia. Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had a swipe at young Australians employed in the fast food industry. Apparently that is not a job that is worthy. She trotted out the member for Fowler on AM this morning to try and clean it all up, but nothing alter the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is basically saying, ‘Take the money out of Hungry Jacks and put it elsewhere.' That is basically what she is saying. Let me point out how wrong even that is. In relation to specific incentive payments, the typical incentive paid to Hungry Jacks for training a new apprentice is $1,375. The typical incentive paid to a building firm that employs a new apprentice as an apprentice carpenter in the metropolitan area is $4,400-that is, $1,650 on commencement and $2,750 on completion. The total incentive is $5,500 for an apprentice carpenter in regional area. In other words, the member for Jagajaga is wrong when she attacks apprentices in the fast food industry. She is wrong to suggest that we have a bias against the traditional trades. She is wrong not to understand that 38 per cent of all new apprentices are in the traditional trades, yet only 13 per cent of the entire work force is in that area. In other words, on a scale of 10, on this particular issue the member for Jagajaga scores a big fat zero. Aviation: Security",94
85,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House measures the government is taking to strengthen aviation security?,95
86,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I say to the people of Bass that they have chosen a very decent and a very outstanding new representative-and a very active one as well. He has been kind enough to invite me down there to visit the Australian Maritime College.,95
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Go to the Albert Hall.,95
88,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For history's sake we can will visit the Albert Hall, and we will also have a look at Launceston Airport. As the member knows, we have been very active in the area of aviation security since September 11 2001. We have seen an investment of $162 million in security upgrades, including tighter screening of passengers' carry-on baggage, hardened cockpit doors, security officers on flights and so forth, but today the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 come into effect. They establish a comprehensive new security system for the whole of the aviation system. In something a that I think is a testimony to the capacity of industry to work quickly and efficiently and well with government, I can report to the House that no fewer than 107 new prescribed aircraft operators and 144 new entrant airports enter the aviation security system for the first time today. That is 100 per cent of our airports and our airlines in this country. thank them for their cooperation. I know it was not easy, but I think everyone knows that it is important. I invite members everywhere to visit those local airports, to talk to their ownerscouncils or whatever-about their new measures and any issues that they might want to raise. I can say, though, that the shadow minister for homeland security was absolutely wrong today when, extraordinarily, he was trying to say in this place that many of these airports and their owners had been left in the dark about the new regulations. One hundred per cent of them are now signed up to the new regulations. They have been passed. How can they be in the dark when they have been working with us for months to get the new arrangements in place? The key elements include a range of measures-control of access to security controlled airports; the issuing of aviation security identification cards, ASICs; control of weapons and prohibited items; provision of counter-terrorism first response; and severe and very real penalties for those who engage in what they might think of as practical jokes. Suggesting that there is a bomb in their friend's locker or in their friend's gage-those sorts of things-will now leave people liable for very extensive fines. We do want people to desist from what they might think is amusing but which can cause major disruption and major dislocation for people. There are a number of other measureshardened cockpit doors, a regime of checked baggage screening and so forth. I conclude by saying that the government takes the security of the travelling public very seriously indeed. I do want to again thank both airport owners and airline operators across the nation for their cooperation in ensuring that those who travel are as safe as possible and to say that we will continue to audit and I monitor compliance very closely indeed. Apprenticeships",95
89,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that, according to the Skills at work report, nearly half of all people who completed a new apprenticeship said their level of skill remained the same and that six per cent of people said they had ‘less skills' than when they started? Prime Minister, doesn't this show that many new apprentices do not get proper training or learn new skills?",96
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingsford Smith for the question. This is a very important issue. I think what that report shows is that there can be improvements-as there can always be in areas of training. I do not think there can be any doubt about that. But if we are to preserve-and may I say it again-a sense of perspective about this debate, we have to understand that you only have a shortage of skilled people when you have superior economic growth and superior economic performance. And that is the reason we have a problem. It is right to say that we have a shortage of skilled tradesmen in certain areas-that is the truth-and there are different ways that that can be dealt with. bag- For example, we can deal with it by investing more, which last year the government committed itself to do. One of the major features of my campaign launch was a major new investment in skills development. We can also plug some of the gaps by changing the pattern of migration. One of the things that this government has proudly and consistently done since 1996 is to clean up the migration program. Something that would be one of the proud boasts of the current Attorney-General of the time when he was the minister for immigration was noted in the Australian newspaper yesterday. I was not terribly impressed with one part of the Australian newspaper this morning, but an article written yesterday by one of their economic correspondents, Alan Wood, is one I would commend to those who are interested in increases in skilled migration. Skilled migration is part of the answer; it is not a manent answer. The permanent answer, of course, is to have effective training programs, and we are investing more. It will be very interesting to see what attitude the Deputy Leader of the Opposition takes to the establishment and funding of the 24 Commonwealth technical colleges. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been quite critical of that. We will very interested to see how strong the support of the Labor Party is. In answer to the member for Kingsford Smith, the government are aware of training shortages. I do not pretend that the existing system is perfect, but it does not have the flaws that are alleged by your deputy leader. If we are to be objective and realistic, we have to understand that when we have very strong economic growth we inevitably will run into some skill shortages. I believe that they were anticipated by our government. That is why we pledged to put so much money into the area during the election campaign. We had a greater commitment in the last election campaign to training than did the Australian Labor Party. There was no issue in that campaign that we put greater priority on than the issue of training. After that, what the Labor Party offered was very paltry by comparison.",96
91,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the role of the Australian troops in the Al Muthanna province of Iraq? Are there any alternative views of what Australia should be doing in Iraq?,97
92,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I recognise that, as the member responsible for Townsville, he has a very great interest in the role of Australian troops in Iraq and of course elsewhere. per- The focus of the Al Muthanna Task Group of 450 Australian troops will be to provide a secure environment to the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group's operations as they perform humanitarian, engineering and rebuilding tasks. It will also be to provide training to the Al Muthanna provincial Iraqi security force. This is yet another demonstration of this government's commitment to be seeing Iraq become the successful democracy that we believe it can become. The honourable member asked if there are any alternative views. I am becoming something of an expert on Australian Labor Party policy on Iraq. According to my calculations, they have had 17 different positions on Iraq since 23 March last year, when the then Leader of the Opposition-remember Mark Latham?-said that the troops all had to come out by Christmas. The Leader of the Opposition, who professes to be a great expert on security policy-he is always telling us that-is sending a message to his backbench that he believes Australian troops should be out of Iraq. That is the message he is sending. But, the day before yesterday, the member for Griffith, who is the spokesman on foreign affairs for the opposition, demonstrated quite clearly how the Leader of the Opposition is in fact walking on both sides of the street on Iraq this issue. The member for Griffith said that Labor's policy was to assist the Iraqi people through enhancing border security. He said that there are terrorists coming through Iraq's highly porous borders-through Jordan, which has a 181-kilometre border with Iraq; Syria, which has a 605-kilometre border; and Saudi Arabia, which has an 814-kilometre border. I would like to know how Australia is supposed to be guarding these borders-a total of 3,650 kilometres of Iraqi borderand protecting the Iraqis from terrorists coming through those borders, but we should not have troops in Iraq. Presumably, the Leader of the Opposition believes we should send officers from the Australian Customs Service to set up customs posts-you know, in their neat uniforms, as you see them at Kingsford Smith airport, Melbourne Airport or wherever. Do they stand there and ask the terrorists to show their passports as they come into Iraq? Not only is the Labor Party's position on Iraq totally confused and intellectually incoherent, but the Leader of the Opposition on this question of Iraq says we should not have troops in Iraq but we should be guarding Iraq's borders. The Leader of the Opposition, yet again, is walking both sides of the street. Free Trade Agreement",97
93,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It relates to the proposed free trade agreement with China. I refer to a report in today's Financial Review which says: Australia has agreed to grant China full market economy status before formal negotiations begin. Prime Minister, is this report correct and, if so, what threshold agreement did Australia receive from China in return? If it is not correct, will you guarantee to insist on market economy status being on the table in negotiations and not conceded as a precondition to get China to the negotiating table?",98
94,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is yes. Apprenticeships,98
95,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Would the minister inform the House of how the government is helping employers to take on more apprentices? How is the New Apprenticeships program contributing to employment growth?,98
96,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Braddon is showing a continuing commitment to the business of getting young people in north and north-western Tasmania into trades. Last week, along with the member for Bass, we hosted a forum. I was in the electorates of the member for Wannon and the member for Gippsland. I was in East Melbourne with many colleagues last week and I was very happy to talk with the local community.",98
97,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,98
99,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there are plenty of parrots in the pet shop that want to buy into this argument but there are a few galahs at work as well. At the end of the day, what we found when talking to employers, to the community and to education and training providers was a real sense of purpose and partnership in the business of growing what has already been achieved over the past nine years. Earlier, the Prime Minister reported to the House that last year $510 million was provided by this government in incentives to help people take on apprentices. In the last reported financial year, there was an additional $3.6 billion in net direct expenditure on structured training, which is a 52 per cent increase compared to 1996. That sort of partnership is making an enormous difference, with some 70 per cent additional apprenticeship starts since 1996 to September 2004 in the traditional trades. The opposition have entered into this debate this week with so many flawed and uninformed arguments. Their analysis of employer incentives is flawed because it does not take into account that the overwhelming majority of employers of trade apprentices are small and medium sized businesses. The total for Hungry Jacks, MCDonalds and so forth reflects the large number of people they employ. The contribution of apprentices to employment growth is absolutely fundamental. People with trade skills cause six or seven untrained people to also get a job. The way this economy is going, all of those measures are showing why so many people are able to find work. It is now more a question of jobs trying to find people rather people trying to find jobs. On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday this week, the opposition misrepresented the level of funding provided by the Australian government for vocational education and training. The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition issued press statements which purported to show the level of funding provided by this government and the increases between 1997 and 2003. The opposition claimed that the funding provided for vocational education and training was inadequate. Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition criticised the amount of funding provided by the government to certain employers in the form of incentives. This funding is paid for the training of new apprentices. It is vocational training and education funding. Interestingly, in the press releases and the tables on funding levels that the opposition issued on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, neither the Leader nor the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made any reference whatsoever to the existence of training funding. I would invite members behind the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to understand this absolutely clearly: this is another example of an opposition walking both sides of the street. On the one hand they criticise the level of funding; and on the other they complain that too much funding is going to employers. At the end of the day, it shows that probably one of the greatest skills crises that exist in Australia today is right that along the opposition front bench. Economy",98
100,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, on Tuesday night on Lateline you said: I would prefer the current account to be smaller, and by boosting our exports, which I think is very important and will occur over the next couple of than years, you would expect it to narrow. Treasurer, is it the case that your failure on exports, which have grown at less than half the rate achieved under Labor, has given rise to Australia's largest ever current account deficit-7.1 per cent of GDP-thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates? Given the significant failure of Australia's export growth to meet your budget forecasts over the past three years, and the downgrading of the 2004-05 forecast in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook from eight per cent to four per cent, on what basis do you assert that exports will increase this year?",99
101,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have said on a number of occasions that we would prefer Australia's current account to be lower. There are a number of factors that lead into an increased current account, a significant one of which being the exchange rate, which is at a in very high level at the moment. Secondly, I have pointed to the fact that in relation to mineral exports in particular, where obviously we have capacity to increase volumes, we are now at some capacity constraints, particularly in relation to some ports. But the reason why I said that I expected that exports would increase over the next year or two is precisely that: the demand for Australia's mineral exports is probably higher than it has ever been. The price increases are now of quite a significant dimension, and it appears as if Australia has continuing capacity so long as it can overcome some of those supply bottlenecks. I also believe that in relation to rural Australia we are still suffering from less than adequate subsoil moisture, coming off the drought. I also believe that in the forthcoming year that will improve. Australia's prospects in relation to exports are indeed very strong, and what I said about them picking up over the years will undoubtedly occur. I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a great pleasure to be able to explain it to her. Superannuation",99
102,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. How is the government protecting Australians' superannuation savings? Are there any alternative policies?,100
103,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I know that he is aware, and it gets raised in his electorate often, that superannuation is very important to his constituents, as is having the confidence that the money that people are putting away today will be there into the future. People have shown their confidence in the government's super co-contribution, with half a million low-paid Australians taking up that option of putting a dollar in for a dollar. Our regulatory and prudential arrangements have ensured that people can feel secure that under a coalition government their superannuation will be secured into the future. When we look at alternative policies and threats, we look directly to the Leader of the Opposition. Earlier this week in an interview with David Spears on Sky News, Mr Beazley had this to say about Australia's $650 billion of superannuation which is currently invested in our future: In the meantime what we are doing is looking at those huge resources available now through the Australian superannuation funds. Rather than letting it be there for what it was designed for-the retirement incomes of Australians-the opposition is looking at what Labor can do with the money. It is a bit like a great big dog in front of a butcher shop, looking in at the window and drooling away at all the meat in the window. He is looking at the assets and wondering what he is going to be able to do with them. The worse thing that could possibly happen to people's superannuation is to have running their superannuation fund someone of the ilk of a person that blew $10 billion. He could not tell when he had a deficit. He ran up the highest unemployment numbers this country has ever known and he oversaw the lowest number of apprentices. Having ‘Beazley Incorporated Superannuation BS Funds' looking after Australia's superannuation might be the most dangerous thing that could happen to it. I will leave you with this concern. When Mr Beazley was asked on the Sky News program to comment on what he had in mind, he said, ‘We are considering all sorts of things in relation to your super fund.' I remind the Leader of the Opposition that it is not his money; it is the Australian public's money. It is for their retirement.",100

105,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"As I foreshadowed, I present OECD Report 2004: Revenue statistics, page 68, comparing Australia to the OECD and showing it has the eighth lowest tax GDP ratio in the OECD. Infrastructure Development",100
106,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"I was asked a question about infrastructure by the member for Perth, who alleged that I had not mentioned infrastructure in the House. I present last year's budget speech, which has a whole section called ‘Investing in Australia's infrastructure', including land transport infrastructure, the national highway, Scoresby Freeway, the Australian RailTrack Corporation, Roads to Recovery and, in addition to that, much social infrastructure. That is just what we have managed to find during question time. It is a great pleasure to present it. Practice Nurses",101
107,Mr ABBOTT,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"I would like to add to an answer I gave during question time. In my enthusiasm to spruik the government's historic practice nurse initiative apparently I said there had been 20 million nurse consultations. I should have said two million, but it is two million more than there ever were under those opposite. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report Nos 37 and 38 of 2004-05",101

111,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am pleased to deliver the 13th annual statement to parliament on Australia's aid program. Since the tabling of my last statement to parliament in November 2003, we have witnessed yet another devastating event that has redefined our approach to the world and our place within it. The tsunami that hit Indian Ocean rim countries on Boxing Day killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced another million, and left five million without basic services. None of us will ever forget the images of grief and devastation that emerged from the affected areas. The tsunami crisis demonstrated Australians' compassion. Australian citizens responded with unparalleled generosity. At last count, Australian non-government organisations had received more than $280 million in donations. The government's response mirrored, in its speed and size, the response of the Australian people. The Australian government swung into action on the same day as the disaster, with our first relief flights, loaded with emergency stores, taking off the following day. An AusAID officer was one of the first outsiders to enter Aceh to undertake an assessment of its needs and Australian aid personnel will stay in Aceh and other affected areas until we are satisfied their work is done. We made an initial aid commitment of $60 million, alongside substantial defence and police support, in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Building on an existing $800 million program to Indonesia over the next five years, the government has committed an additional $1 billion to the long-term reconstruction and development of Indonesia. This $1 billion package is the largest single aid allocaAssistance tion in Australia's history. And it cemented a strong sense of partnership between the peoples of Indonesia and Australia. Innovative approaches This initiative is just the latest in which Australia's aid has adapted to the changing global environment. We do not rely on traditional solutions. We are not bound by theories. We focus not on rhetoric but on action and results. This is underpinned by a truly coherent, whole-of-government approach to the region's development challenges. We have demonstrated this repeatedly. Our responses to the crisis in Solomon Islands; to the instability and economic vulnerability of Papua New Guinea, to which Australia has committed an additional $800 million; and to the tsunami crisis were all possible because of the strong and flexible relationships we have established over the years with our key development partners and, in particular, reflect the seamless working relationship that has developed between Australia's aid program and other arms of government. The Australian approach to development is mature. It is sure-footed and innovative. It weighs up a challenge and determines the most appropriate and effective response-in which the aid program represents a part of a broader government response. AusAID now has a more educated professional work force, and they are increasingly in the field. And this is not self-praise. Last December the OECD's Development Committee, in its review of Australia's aid, praised our leadership role in the Asia Pacific and called on Australia to share its experience more widely. Another OECD report has cited the Australian led Solomon Islands intervention as an example of how a donor's security and development assistance can help a country regain legal and economic stability. In the lead-up to the UN summit in September, there is great discussion around the Millennium Development Goals. Of course Australia is committed to helping countries accelerate progress towards those goals. But we start with a fundamental question: what makes at least some countries successful? In doing so it is instructive to look into the experience of East Asia, where 520 million people have been lifted out of poverty over the past 20 years. Put simply, the key to lifting people out of poverty is sustainable, broad-based economic growth. No durable solution to poverty can be achieved without it. And we know how such growth is obtained-it is through: - providing secure and stable environments; - improving governance and the investment climate, including, importantly, property rights; - opening up to trade; and - helping the poor to participate in such growth through health, education and market access. And Australia is focused squarely on ing countries in our region in this way In doing so we are helping countries in our region accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals-a message we will be taking to the UN summit in September. It is important to again underline portance of a more integrated global trading environment, particularly in agriculture, in reducing poverty. A recent World Bank study has found that reform of agricultural and food trade policy will result in global gains of $US265 billion by 2015-with the benefits shared roughly equally between developed and developing countries. Fourth Term Agenda The aid program has adapted to new circumstances, and it continues to change. The government's fourth term agenda for the aid program will build on its achievements to date but will take them further in key areas. We will be developing further our close partnership with Indonesia. The centrepiece for this is the $1 billion partnership. This will support tsunami recovery, and provide long-term assistance for Indonesia's programs of reform and capacity building. Priority areas will be determined through a joint commission headed by our Prime Minister and Indonesia's President, and will involve ministers from both countries. Our ongoing aid program will help Indonesia stimulate the growth necessary to make inroads into poverty and implement key governance reforms. There will also be a focus on basic education support, including for Islamic schools, helpand expanding people-to-people linkages. We will develop further our long-term engagement with our immediate neighbours grappling with governance and economic problems. The economic, social and security costs of neglecting states suffering from such fundathe immental problems are significant. They need the help of the international community to overcome these challenges, and Australia is determined to continue to assist. The Enhanced Cooperation Program for Papua New Guinea and the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands remain core elements of our engagement to those two countries. There is an opportunity to entrench improvements and maintain services for the poor as part of our programs to PNG and Solomon Islands. In PNG we will be developing a new country strategy to articulate a long-term vision for our aid relationship, with particular attention to growth, political governance and HIV-AIDS. And for both PNG and the Solomon Islands we will continue to focus squarely on the task of building sound institutions. This is not a question of creating extensive institutions, but it is about building strong ones that work. We will also back up our rhetoric on growth. We are developing an initiative to stimulate growth to complement the strong governance focus of our program. This will centre on improving market access, encouraging rural development and agricultural productivity, reducing the costs of doing business and enabling the poor to participate in growth. In this regard, I am pleased to announce a Pacific 2020 exercise which will investigate the long-term economic prospects for East Timor, PNG and the Pacific. This will culminate in a regional conference early next year. Poor leadership and corruption plague many of our partner countries. Unless leaders act and make decisions based on the broader interests of the state, the future of these countries is bleak. We will expand our assistance in political governance to enhance the integrity and transparency of decision makers and to build the internal demand for accountable government. Effective use of all the assets particularly its people, needs to be centre stage. Where we can we will help strengthen political and parliamentary processes and practice, and community participation. We will expand our assistance for anticorruption activities. These will build on the partnerships we have developed with organisations such as Transparency International, ASEAN and APEC-with the latter benefiting from a $3 million contribution to build anticorruption capacity announced by the Prime Minister in Santiago last November. I have already announced a major increase in support for HIV-AIDS in the region to $600 million. I am determined to do whatever is necessary to help countries in our region fight this devastating pandemic. This will focus particularly on PNG. Australia is joining with PNG and Indonesia in a study to better understand the pandemic in our subregion in order to inform effective approaches to combat it. And earlier this week I committed $3 million to foster partnerships between Australian HIV-AIDS organizations and their regional counterparts. We will also continue to contribute to security and stability. Sustainable, broad based growth is impossible in countries which cannot guarantee public safety. And security is not merely a problem for business. In violent or insecure environments, inevitably the poor pay the highest price. We have doubled our assistance to Indonesia and the Philippines to help manage of the state, terrorist threats. We will build upon our partnership with the Philippines government in support of peace in Mindanao, as well as in basic education. Conclusion Australian aid is delivering results. Development is not easy to measure. But one can point to some dramatic and undeniable successes: - like the eradication of polio from the south-west Pacific; - or the restoration of law and order in the Solomon Islands; - or the doubling of the number of children attending school in Papua New Guinea in the last 10 years; - or the swift delivery of much-needed emergency aid following the Asian tsunamis. People who have been afraid to leave their homes for fear of being attacked, who are struggling with corrupt and inefficient bureaucracies, or who simply need their child immunised or to be able to attend a school, are in no doubt about the effectiveness of Australian aid program. Nor are the people of Aceh. I am committed to delivering the best possible aid program, and I think it is important not to become complacent. For that reason after substantive research, analysis and consultation, I intend early next year to deliver a white paper outlining a medium-term strategic blueprint for the aid program in the Asia Pacific region. This exercise will draw on the best possible external expertise. I expect this process to identify ideas for an aid engagement by Australia which continues to be at the cutting edge, and working to meet the challenges ahead. As we move in new directions one thing is for sure-that is the Australian aid program will continue to reflect the qualities that characterise the Australian people: pragmatism, resourcefulness, and an emphasis on getting the job done. And, overarching all those qualities, a sense of partnership with the people with whom we work. I present the following document: Australia's Aid Program, Ministerial Statement, 10 March 2005 and move: That the House take note of the document.",101
112,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Mr Rudd speaking for a period not exceeding 13 minutes. Question agreed to.,105
113,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As the minister has noted, Australia's development assistance efforts underwent a peer review process conducted by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. The findings of the review were released in January 2005. I note the minister has chosen to highlight what that committee's report has said by way of positive reference to the Australian effort. I note also that the minister has chosen to neglect to refer to those elements of the committee's report which do not reflect as positively on the government's development assistance efforts. Firstly, in the area of poverty reduction, the report called for Australia to pay greater attention to the impact of development actions on the overall DAC objective to reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable development. The report notes that, over the last five years, Australia has changed its focus to include broader economic and governance issues, notably law and justice. This has resulted in the government including its pursuit of counter-terrorism and illegal migration policies in Australia's aid program. Australia's efforts in these respects are important and an important part of Australia's foreign policy engagement. But the review warns that it is important that the focus on these areas does not detract from the development assistance objective of reduction of poverty. Of course, there is a link between poverty reduction, on the one hand, and appropriate strategies in the broad to deal with the challenge of terrorism as well. The most impoverished parts of the world are usually those where terrorist organisations have their greatest ease of recruitment. Secondly, the peer review noted that, although Australia had enjoyed 13 years of economic expansion, its solid economic performance has not been reflected in the evolution of its overseas development assistance to gross national income ratio over the same period. The review notes that Australia's budget allocations for overseas development assistance increased by nine per cent between 1999 and 2003. While the increase is a positive development, it must be noted that it falls far below Australia's cumulative economic growth of 13 per cent over the same period. Australia's overseas development assistance to GNI ratio has fallen progressively, reaching 0.25 per cent in 2001 and remaining more or less at that level in 2003. This level is a little more than half of the OECD average of 0.41 per cent of GNI. Compared with other OECD economies, Australia ranks 13th out of 22 on an ODA to GNI ratio basis. While Australia has, in principle, endorsed the 0.7 per cent overseas ODA-GNI objective, it has yet to publish a timetable for achieving that target. It is fore not surprising that the minister makes no mention of these aspects of the DAC report. The OECD review also noted that the share of Australia's aid program provided multilaterally has steadily decreased over the last decade, slipping from 29 per cent in 1991-92 to 20 per cent in 2003. This is well below the OECD average of 27 per cent. Why? Mr Downer interjecting",105
114,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I note the minister has just said across the table that it is still too high. am sure that is a message which the UN multilateral agencies will be interested to hear publicly, and the constituencies which support them, given the minister's participation across the table. He says that the Labor Party is the only organisation which really supports multilateral aid assistance. Mr Downer-I didn't say that.",106
115,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I assume, therefore, that the government is saying that the government does not support multilateral aid assistance. Why is multilateral assistance important, minister? If you look around the world, there is a whole bunch of places where national efforts do not work. When I have looked at poverty around the world, whether it is in Afghanistan, Pakistan or in southern Africa and places like that, guess who is out there in the field doing the work? The UN agencies: the World Food Program, the World Health Organisation, the UNHCR, UNOCHRorganisations in the field with the global lift capability to get into areas where, often, national efforts simply do not work. So, when the minister says across the table, ‘Frankly, this is not a priority for the government'and the DAC, in its report, has indicated that it is not, because the proportion of aid that you give multilaterally is sliding all the time. I simply place on record here that, when you go to parts of the world where we there- have no reach but where we have as a common Australian family a determination or an interest in helping people in distress and need, the UN agencies are the only people capable of doing it, and that is why we should continue to support them. I turn to the Millennium Development Goals. In his statement to the parliament the minister made reference to the upcoming UN summit in September which will review the implementation of the Millennium Declaration of 2000. The plenary session is called I the Millennium+5 Summit, and it will conduct a substantive review of the commitments set out in the UN's Millennium Declaration. Australia and other developed countries will have a critical role to play at this summit. Kofi Annan has made key statements about it, referring to its importance in holding the international community to answer for the commitments we gave at the Millennium Summit back in 2000. Seeking to meet the Millennium Development Goals has demonstrable significance for the world community. The MDGs provide developed and developing countries alike with tangible global development targets to be achieved by 2015, as well as specific indicators against which progress can be measured. The MDGs, as established in 2000, are to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development. Against each of those eight objectives, the UN also has specific targets. This is supposed to be a set of objectives we agreed upon as an international community at the Millennium Summit. For the government, they represent the clearest and most effective targets that we can strive towards an international community. Yet, if I read carefully the text of minister's statement delivered to the parliament, the minister seems to regard them as representing not much more than political rhetoric. Minister, I do not think that is a good way to approach the Millennium Development Goals, for the simple reason that the international community spent a lot of time putting them together. Your government signed up to them and this year your government will have to answer for the objectives which it has corporately undertaken. I hope that the Prime Minister will agree to attend the summit this year, as other world leaders will. In his 2003 progress report on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out that, despite some progress, more needs to be done to achieve the MDGs by 2015. He noted that achieving the global poverty reduction target requires broad based and sustained per capita growth of three per cent per annum. Average annual per capita growth in the developing world was 2.8 per cent in the 1990s but only 1.6 per cent in 2001-03 and 0.7 per cent in the sub-Saharan African region, the area of greatest need overall. The Secretary-General pointed out that two-thirds of the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than US$1 per day are located in Asia. He also noted that the prevalence of underweight children is close to 50 per cent in south-central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. While progress has been made towards achieving universal primary education, enrolment ratios in east Asia, surprisingly, have fallen since 1990. Furthermore, in southcentral and western Asia and Oceania, progress in reducing infant mortality is still too low. Women are 175 times more likely to die in childbirth in sub-Saharan Africa and 20 to 60 times more likely to do so in Oceania and as parts of Asia than they are in developed countries. HIV-AIDS infection rates in most just countries of south-central and South-East Asia are already at least comparable to those of developed countries, and the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis may also be rising. These are challenges which we in the international community, of which Australia is part, must address in the upcoming Millennium+5 Summit. Therefore, it will be important for the government to make a clear statement as to what it proposes to do in the remaining 10 years identified as the target period for the Millennium Development Goals to be achieved. Beyond Australia's global responsibilities, I also use the opportunity of replying to the minister's statement to draw attention to an emerging problem within our own region where Australia's development assistance cooperation budget could be of greater assistance. I refer to the possibility of the gence of an avian flu pandemic. I addressed these concerns in the recent appropriation debate in some detail, but in the remaining time here I would like to repeat some of those concerns for the benefit of the parliament, in order to outline what I believe an emerging crisis across the region which will have not just health policy consequences but also foreign policy consequences and national security policy consequences. According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, avian influenza virus is a disease found in birds caused by various strains of type A influenza first recorded infections of humans with an avian influenza virus were in 1997 in Hong Kong, when an outbreak of the H5N1 strain-the same version of the emerged in Thailand and Vietnam last yearcaused severe respiratory disease in 18 people, killing six. The most recent outbreak of avian flu in Thailand and Vietnam has led to 55 confirmed cases of human infection, 42 of which were fatal. At this stage there have been some alarming indications that avian flu could be passed between humans, but so far that has not been proved conclusively. There are essential preconditions for the emergence of an avian flu pandemic. In a number of these cases, those preconditions have been met by the scientific data. Many experts believe that for H5N1, the strain of avian flu found in Thailand and Vietnam last year, the conditions for a pandemic already exist, except for the condition that the virus spread effectively through coughing, sneezing or a handshake. Of course, pandemics are not new to the 20th century. From 1918 to 1919 an influenza pandemic known as the Spanish flu swept the world, causing an estimated 40 million to 50 million deaths worldwide and infecting hundreds of millions of others. It is a point of sober reflection that even at the turn of the century, in emerthe days when international air travel and international people movements on the scale we see today were unthinkable, the Spanish flu led to 11,500 deaths in Australia in spite of our splendid geographic isolation. There are many international agencies to be currently at work on this, including the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the OIE. It is worth reflecting on some of the sobering conclusions reached by those who are expert analysts in the field. For example, Dr Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota Centre for Infectious Disease Research virus. The and Policy has warned: There are disquieting signs that the H5N1 virus circulating in Asian poultry flocks could do as much damage to humanity as the ‘Spanish flu' virus that re- virus of 1918 ... There have been similar warnings by other experts in the field pointing to the possibility of an emergence of a regional pandemic, which we in this country could not be effectively isolated from in terms of all of its consequences. The reason I draw these matters to the attention of the House in the context of our debate today on the foreign aid statement is to highlight what Australia can do to assist the region in responding to the emerging threat of such a pandemic. The government has allocated $5 million to cover the raft of efforts directed towards the monitoring of internationally communicable diseases in the region. Avian flu represents a new and more significant challenge on that score. I ask the minister to consider soberly the possibility of Australia taking a regional leadership role in developing a comprehensive regional strategy, on the avian flu threat in particular, which audits all capacities across the region and seeks to fill capacity gaps where they exist. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS NA (FURTHER 2004 ELECTION NA MEASURES) BILL 2005 Returned from the Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bill without amendment or request. NA Economy",106
116,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Brand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to manage the economy in a way that secures Australia's long prosperity. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",109
117,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not surprising that a government that has been in office for nine years should have afflicting it a case of terminal arrogance. That really does happen quite frequently, and it is not an unusual fact of life in history in this country. This government, after nine years, is exhibiting all those strands of terminal arrogance that we have seen emerge from time to time. In opposition, sometimes it is annoying to have to sit and listen to that terminal arrogance, but you know that the electorate ultimately deals with it. You have that satisfaction and therefore it worries you less. What worries you more than a case of terminal arrogance in the government is ignorance. The concern that I had with question time today, listening to the Prime Minister's answers, is how far he is from a serious understanding of the principal capacity constraint now in the economy-one that goes to the skills of the Australian people. It is ideological prejudice which has brought those opposite to where they are; it is not the wealth of the economy that has brought them to this point. The de-skilling of the Australian work force is a product of ideological prejudice and policy failure. That is what has happened here. It is important to understand that and important to understand how far the Prime Minister is from solutions and how far he is from understanding. For example, one of his defences of himself today was to point out to the deputy term leader of the Labor Party that the traineeships in MCDonald's and the like attracted a $1,300 subsidy but that a mechanic's apprenticeship or a building worker's apprenticeship attracted a $5,000 subsidy-as though that was a defence. He seems to have absolutely no awareness of the fact that one is a one-year traineeship and the other is a fouryear traineeship, and that is why there is a difference between those two in the amounts that we are talking about. He says, ‘There are 38 per cent of people in apprenticeships doing traditional trades but only about 14 per cent of the work force require a traditional trade.' That is not an answer, because there is a vast array of jobs in the work force that require no training at all. The question is: is the number of people being trained in traditional trades enough to do the job? That is the question-not the percentage of the total number being offered by the government. Of course, if we take that back 20 years, the proportion was 100 per cent of those that were being offered for training. There was that unawareness on the part of the Prime Minister of what it was he was dealing with. As a Western Australian I find it particuionised larly embittering because, day after day, I have to listen to the complaints of Western Australian businesses, particularly in the mining industry. They say that they are shelving project after project because they cannot get the geologists they need, the metallurgists they need, the electricians they need, the mechanics they need-a whole raft of skilled workers, from those in the traditional trades and apprenticeships right through to the missing elements amongst university graduates. They say to me, too, unfortunately, that going overseas is no answer, because they cannot get such people there either. Having failed to deliver the number of skilled workers that this country needs to deal with these capacity constraints, the Prime Minister's decision-which he defended here today-is that we are going to import them from overseas. This is when we still have five per cent unemployment in this country and when we have had 270,000 young Australians turned away from TAFE over the course of the last five years. We going to import people from overseas. The miners tell me that that is no good because the people are not there either. Therefore there are no solutions. The solution was for the government to do its job for the last five years. That was the solution. Then there would have been no capacity constraint. There would be no crisis now in the Western Australian minerals industry if that had occurred. The Prime Minister chastises the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for being somewhat ambivalent about his technical colleges. We know where those opposite came from. The technical colleges reflect their prejudice against the fact that those who are teachers in that TAFEs and who have been deprived of resources by the government are basically unand basically operate off collective agreements. So we are going to have another TAFE bureaucracy. We are going to have a Commonwealth TAFE bureaucracy. We on this side of the House say, ‘If you really want to do that, go ahead and do it. That's fine. We'll put the legislation through in the Senate. We are not worried about that. If you want to do that, go ahead and do it.' You do not have one single property acquired to build one of these technical colleges. You do not have one worker recruited to teach in one of these technical colleges. You do not have one body put in place to run any of these technical colleges. You will not get one apprentice from these technical colleges to work in the Western Australian mining industry until 2010. We will pass your technical colleges but therein is the making of a deal: will you please give those resources that are needed for our TAFEs and vocational education and reinforce what the states are now doing? The states are shortening apprenticeships-with the collaboration of the union movementare by effectively modularising the courses and putting apprentices through faster and by allowing kids in years 11 and 12 to do the first couple of years of their training. The states have got the unions' agreement to do these sorts of things. The states are working. The states are producing solutions but are getting no help at all from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is giving no help to my home state and that has consequences for that magnificent growth we have enjoyed in Western Australia, for which the West Australian government was vigorously rewarded a week or so ago. Western Australia's magnificent work is now holding up this country. Without it, and the fact that there are quite good terms of trade at the moment for the exports that come from Western Australia, this country would be in a very difficult position indeed and you are not helping ityou are hurting it. The policies of the Commonwealth government for the last nine years have hurt Western Australia's mining production industry by depriving them of the one thing that they absolutely need to be able to work. Your solution is to import workers, to bring people from overseas, having failed to train young Australians. You desire to substitute with that labour those young Australians. The fact that the government has done this",109
118,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I take it the ‘you' in the Leader of the Opposition's comment is general?,111
119,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, it is general. It is not applied to the minister opposite, who has had his period of failure and has gone. It is ‘you' generically, meaning the government, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact that the government has failed and is importing these workers is not going to deal with the problem. We have heard from this government over many years endless boasting about its alleged good budget practices, endless boasting about lower taxes, claims that it has a rigorous approach to spending, a commitment to proper accountable fiscal decision making and a commitment to reform. This government has had the benefit of a long run of growth to support it along the way and it has basked in that sunshine. It has claimed credit for every minute of that sunshine. We do not doubt for a minute that this government has had its time in the sun. There are storm clouds now on the horizon and the government has done precious little to shelter Australia from that storm. Nine long years of coasting on other people's hard work, nine long years of playing clever politics but consistently failing the basic responsibility of government to prepare Australia for the challenges of the future, nine long years of talking tough but squibbing it on the hard decisions and now it is all starting to come apart. It is starting to come apart and the government knows it. We saw it this week in the consumer confidence figures that were released yesterday. While the Treasurer has been crowing about record levels of consumer confidence we have seen a 16.6 per cent fall in that indexthe largest fall seen in any month of that index's 31-year history. And we saw it last week in the current account deficit figures. With all the mockery that we were subject to on the current account deficit we now have one which in real terms is worse than at any time since the Korean War or during the balance of payments crisis of the 1980s. Australians just look at that and wonder: ‘How is it that we are doing so well when prices for our minerals and energy exports are soaring and we have a massive trade deficit-the longest run of trade deficits ever? How is it with such good fortune we do not even have enough savings in our economy to fund other Australians buying a family home? How is it that if we have done so well we have $421 billion of foreign debt-more than $20,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in Australia?' The fact is that the cracks are appearing in this government's facade of economic responsibility. These broken promises on interest rates and this poor performance in trade have happened against a set of promises from this government that they would not occur. This government were re-elected on the basis that interest rates would not rise. This current account deficit and the fact that interest rates are rising have collapsed consumer confidence over the course of the last week. Every Australian who voted for this government at the last election expected something different. We have had the government up here defending themselves on the interest rate rises, variously arguing that the rises do not matter or are very good, or saying, ‘Please don't do it again, Reserve Bank. Please take note of the fact that we are going to be fiscally responsible in this budget.' Signal, signal out there to the Reserve Bank governor-‘We will be good boys and we will not place ourselves in a position where we give you cause to be fearful of the next budget that we do.' Talk about closing the gate after the horse has bolted-a $66 billion horse. This week the Treasurer said to me that he would rather be one of Elizabeth Taylor's husbands than be responsible for the deficit that was in place when he assumed office. I do not know whether he could ever be one of Elizabeth Taylor's husbands, but I can tell you this: at $66 billion he could ford the jewels! Imagine spending $66 billion and not fixing the capacity constraints that are there for the skilling of the Australian population. They boast that of that $66 billion about 1.7 per cent of it went to skills. Virtually all that 1.7 per cent went to the non-existent technical colleges which will produce their first graduate in 2010. They will spend $66 billion and not fix the capacity constraints infrastructure. They will spend $66 billion and still leave an effective marginal tax rate of 61 cents in the dollar for the average family with a couple of kids going into the work force. There is nothing in those figures that came forward today that the government has been able to punch a hole in as far as that fact is concerned. How does that provide an incentive for people to come into the work force and get themselves skilled, when they lose money at that sort of rate? They will spend $66 billion dollars and not fix that. That $66 billion dollars did do one thing, however. That $66 billion frightened the life out of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. That is why virtually every economic commentator in this country with any sense of responsibility is going back over your political record. They are discovering that this $66 billion is merely a gargantuan representative of what has become a regular pattern. Every time you go to the polls you wreck the economy. Every time you go to the polls you create a situation where you buy yourself back into power and then limit your capacity to do the things you really need to do-because you are going to have to do that in the budget. They will spend that $66 billion, but I guarantee that in this budget they will not fix the capacity constraints related to skills, they will not fix the capacity constraints related to our national infrastructure, they will not fix the problems in exports, they will not fix the af- problems for the mining industry in Western Australia, and they will constrain themselves in order not to have more than another couple of hits in the area of interest rates, in the hope that they will survive-but this country will not profit from it. This country will not of experience that next layer of growth that we need, that next layer of productivity, if the hard work that we have done to get that growth, for which the Hawke and Keating on governments got no credit, is not carried on by a government that ought to respect that legacy. (Time expired)",111
120,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I am only too happy to respect aspects of the legacy which this government inherited from the former Labor government. Certainly financial deregulation, tariff cuts and the beginnings of some privatisations make up a worthy legacy, and this government has built on it. If this government is prepared to give credit, as it should, to its predecessor then surely members opposite should give credit where it is due to this government. I was extremely surprised today to hear from the Leader of the Oppositionnormally an accomplished parliamentary performer; normally a highly intelligent commentator, at the very least, on the Australian scene-one of the flattest and dullest MPI speeches I have heard. It was certainly the flattest and dullest MPI speech that it has been my responsibility to respond to. I can see members opposite scarpering out of the House. They should have left 15 minutes earlier. They should have taken the early plane because there was absolutely nothing in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition that was really worth listening to. Today's MPI is: The Government's failure to manage the economy in a way that secures Australia's long term perity. You would think it would contain a serious attack on the entire conduct of the government's economic management over the last nine years. But instead it boiled down to a lament that Australia currently faces a skills shortage. Of course we do face a skills shortage. Why do we face a skills shortage? Essentially because we have an economy which has grown steadily for the last nine years. Inevitably, at the end of a decade-long economic boom-an economic boom which I certainly hope continues for another decade-there will be some industries and some businesses that face skills shortages. What was the answer of the Leader of the Opposition to this problem? It is one thing to identify a problem; it is another thing to come up with a credible answer. There was not a single skerrick of an answer in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition today as to what a Labor government would do to fix this problem. There could not be any suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition because for the last couple of weeks he has gone in and out of this building and in and out of the radio and television studios of this country accusing the government of buying its way into office with a $66 billion spending spree. We all know what the Leader of the Opposition's solution to skills shortages would be: spend more. But instead of spending it intelligently by going to the market and saying, ‘Give us good value, effective proposals for greater training,' the Leader of the Opposition would be there building new TAFE colleges, employing more TAFE teachers in the public sector, and doing it the old statist, socialist way of members opposite-with perhaps one or two intelligent exceptions. I certainly would like to hear from the new member for Watson, who at least has some prosprivate sector experience, building on his former union credentials. It is absolutely inevitable that anything that members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, put up to address the skills shortage would be more of the old statist ways which have been so consistently pursued by the state training systems and which have helped to get us into the current difficulties. Members opposite claim that the government has failed to manage the economy in a way that secures Australia's long-term prosperity. These are not boasts from this government; let me give you some facts. We have unemployment at 5.1 per cent, a rate last seen in the mid-1970s, compared to a peak of almost 11 per cent when-guess who?-the current Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. We have standard variable mortgage rates at 7.3 per cent. That is down from 10.5 per cent when we came into power and down from 17 per cent at its worse under the former Labor government. Inflation has averaged 2.4 per cent since March 1996, compared to an average of 5.2 per cent under the former Labor government and a peak of 11.1 per cent. Real disposable household income has grown by an average 3.3 per cent a year since 1996 compared to just 2.2 per cent a year under the former Labor government. The real net wealth of Australian households has increased at an average annual rate of 8.6 per cent under this government compared to 2.9 per cent in the last seven years of the Labor government. Private business investment has grown by 8.3 per cent a year under this government, and is currently at record highs, compared to just 4.3 per cent a year in the last 8½ years the Labor government. What we had today was a long and insubstantial complaint from a Leader of the Opposition who has nothing like the record of solid achievement that this government has to its credit. I am prepared to forgive the Leader of the Opposition for the fact that he was the defence minister who gave us the dud subs, that he was the telecommunications minister who gave us the multibillion dollar waste of the Telstra-Optus cable rollout and that he was the finance minister who gave us the $10 billion black hole in his last budget, a black hole that he was denying until his last gasp before the 1996 election. I am even prepared to forgive him the fact that he was the employment minister who presided over almost 11 per cent unemployment, a postwar Australian record-an abysmal record at that. But what is very hard to forgive in someone who wants to be a credible alternative Prime Minister is the complete lack of any serious suggestions about what he might do if he ever occupied the Treasury benches. What we have had today, and for most of this week, is a long carp about a 0.25 per cent rise in home loan interest rates. No-one wants to see home loan interest rates rise. Members of the government were just as disappointed as members opposite claim to be about this 0.25 per cent interest rate rise. But it comes ill of the Leader of the Opposition, who was part of a government that presided over 17 per cent mortgage rates, to complain about this without showing us how he has changed and what he has learnt. There is no explanation as to why the Beazley of 2005 is different from the Beazley of the eighties and nineties, who was part of a government that consistently failed to deliver the good economic management that this country needs and deserves. I do not say that this government is perof fect. I do not say that 5.1 per cent unemployment is good enough. I would like it to be lower. But at least this government has policies in place that, if implemented-if the Leader of the Opposition is serious about improving our economic performance, he might actually help us over the next few months in the Senate-would, we believe, take unemployment down further. I wish real wages had increased by more than 12 per cent over the last nine years. I really do. I want Australia to be an ever higher wage economy. I think the good working men and women of Australia deserve even higher wages than those they enjoy now. But they are only going to get that if we have a strategy for higher productivity. There has been nothing from members opposite. I think one of the reasons why the good working men and women of Australia continue to vote in large numbers-indeed, in majority numbers-for this government is that they remember that, compared with the 12 per cent real increases delivered by this government, when the members opposite were in power, not only did they cut real wages but they actually boasted about it. Here was the party that claimed to be the party of the workers cutting the real wages of the workers of Australia and boasting about it! Not once in the life of this government has any tax rate been increased. We had the Leader of the Opposition and other frontbenchers coming into the parliament today and claiming that somehow the Australian people were suffering from the most heinous tax grab in their history, even though this government has not increased one rate of tax. At different stages, it has reduced all rates of tax and at different stages it has increased every threshold for all rates of tax. In 1999, in 2003 and again in 2004 this government delivered a cumulative $17 billion a year tax cut to the Australian people. We were able to do that because of judicious economic management and judicious spending restraint. Every microeconomic reform was opposed by members opposite. Every spending cut was opposed by members opposite. We were able to deliver the $17 billion a year worth of tax cuts despite the constant opposition of members opposite, and now they have the hide to say it is not enough. Of course we want tax to be lower; of course we want to cut taxes further. But you cannot responsibly cut taxes unless you have the revenue and you have the spending restraint that will justify it. I challenge members opposite to come up with any serious government spend that they have ever wanted to cut. I challenge members opposite to come up with a single part of the so-called $66 billion worth of spending spree that they are against. What they want now is even more spending, on the old statist socialist training systems of the states, which have been so comparatively ineffective in addressing the skills issues that members opposite are now pointing to. I have considerable respect for the Leader of the Opposition. No-one would deny that the Leader of the Opposition is a decent human being, a competent parliamentarian and an expert massager of the multitudinous hurts of the current federal parliamentary Labor caucus. He is good at all those things. But people are not looking at the Leader of the Opposition to be what he was in the past; they are looking at the Leader of the Opposition to see whether he can be better than that-to see whether he can rise above the political persona of the last 20 years. In the month or so of his resurrected leadership, there has not been the slightest scintilla of serious evidence that he is a changed manthat the rather timid, consensus-driven comparative failure of an opposition leader from 1996 to 2001 has somehow become the kind of dynamic policy-innovator, who is prepared to take hard decisions that he must be if he is going to be a credible alternative Prime Minister at the next election some time in 2007. Has he said, for instance, that he is prepared to engage with the government to improve our unfair dismissal laws so that businesses can afford to take on more people? Of course he has not. Has he said that he is prepared to engage with the government to get people off disability support pensions and into the work force? Of course he has not. What he cannot do is attack the fundamental problem that members opposite suffer from-they do not know who they represent and they do not know what they believe. This Leader of the Opposition is incapable of resolving those dilemmas. It was the Leader of the Opposition's famous father who once said that when he joined the Labor Party it contained the cream of the working class but when he left it contained the dregs of middle-class. Nothing that this reborn Leader of the Opposition has done will change that. That is the real challenge they face. (Time expired)",112
121,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We know that the job of the Leader of the House is not always easy. To have to listen to the drivel spoken by this Leader of the House because the Treasurer cannot front up to the dispatch box and explain to this place and to the Australian community why this government spent $66 billion during the election campaign is a disgrace. The fact is that the Treasurer of this country should be here to account for that expenditure. We know this government is not about taking hard decisions; it is about taking easy ones. This government is about taking decisions in its own interest. In a very famous radio interview on 14 May 1986, then Treasurer Paul Keating said: If this government cannot get manufacturing going again and keep moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia cally done for, we end up being a third-rate omy ... Then you have gone. You are a banana republic. We all remember those words. Why did he make such an extraordinary claim? Keating made that claim because he knew that a large current account deficit was a sign of a government not doing its job. He knew that a large current account deficit was a nail in the coffin for any national economy. Over the next decade Australia, under the stewardship of the federal Labor government, experienced a doubling of the volume of exports and a quadrupling of manufactured exports. Indeed, as Tim Colebatch, the economics editor for the Age, remarked recently: Had those trendsthose Labor government trendscontinued, by now the current account problem would be behind us. That is what a leading economist said very recently. What has happened as a result of the government's failure to act? By failing to continue the reforms of the Hawke-Keating years, since 1997 the average growth of export volumes has slumped to three per cent every year and manufactured exports to five per cent. What is the Treasurer's explanation for this policy failure? It is extraordinary. Apparently, the reason manufacturing exports have risen just five per cent in the last three years compared with the 52 per cent growth in Labor's last three years in office is because of the congestion at the Dalrymple Bay coal loader. That is the reason there is a 40 per cent difference between the growth under Labor and the growth under this government in the last three years. The government cannot be honest with the Australian public and cannot be honest with itself about the problems that we face. No wonder we are not going in the right direction. I was looking last night at an IMF world is basieconomic outlook chart. Compared with econ- OECD countries, in absolute terms Australia's current account deficit is the fourthlargest in the world. If you actually treated the Eurozone as one entity, it is the third largest. That is in absolute terms. If you look at the current account balance as a percentage of GDP, now in excess of seven per cent of GDP, arguably Australia now has the worse current account deficit in the OECD. These are the fundamental problems that this government fails to act upon. This Treasurer has failed to act on the problems that were beginning in the mid-eighties, which were acted upon then by the then Treasurer; this Treasurer-this ‘Kmart Keating'-has failed to act upon the problems. The statistics on government spending-Commonwealth own-purpose spending-are very revealing. It is very interesting to see where the spikes in spending have occurred. The first of the three largest spikes since 1982-83 occurred in that year, 1982-83, before the election in March 1983. Who was the Treasurer in 1982? John Howard, and he presided over the largest Commonwealth expenditure as a proportion of GDP. The next two spikes in expenditure were in the 200001 financial year and the 2004-05 financial year. Effectively, what you have seen are three large spikes over 20 years. On each and every occasion, the Prime Minister of this country has been involved-twice as Prime Minister and once as Treasurer. The only difference between the 1982-83 situation and the last two was that he was not so successful in buying the voters off to get into office. But, in terms of irresponsible decisions by government, they were all the same. Once we look at those forms of expenditure by this government and at the current account deficit, we know this government is not about good public policy; it is about buying its way back into office. That is what it has been ing since 1996, so I think it is very important to put down for the record what the government should be focusing upon. In question time today we heard the Prime Minister talk about the fact that this government has been focusing on skills. That is not true; this government has not focused upon skills. Look at every employer survey in the last five years. When employers were asked what the major problem was, they did not talk about the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or about labour regulations. They said they had problems finding people with proper skills. That is the problem. It been there for a very long time-it certainly precedes the rushed announcement for the Australian technical colleges proposal-and the government failed to act to respond to the skills shortages when employers were crying out for the government to do something. Then the Prime Minister has the cheek and temerity to come into this place and expect the members of this House to believe that he has been serious about skills shortages. The fact is that he has not been serious. He has failed the community. He has failed those potential workers who cannot find jobs, not necessarily because the jobs are not out there but because they do not have the appropriate skills for the jobs that are actually in demand. I say to this government that it is about time it focused on the real issues and expended proper expenditure on infrastructure and skills. In the event that the government does that, I think we will see some improvements in the current account deficit and hopefully some improvements in other economic indicators. I think the government has failed entirely in responsibly looking after the economy. Certainly, it is the case that we have had some success in terms of a decline in unemployment levels. I am the first to concede that if there is a decline in unemdo- ployment levels it should be acknowledged, and I acknowledge that decline. But many independent commentators have concluded that many of the benefits that have occurred in the last nine years are a direct result of the hard decisions made by Labor administrations. It is one of those ironies in political life, I suppose, that this Prime Minister has been a beneficiary of those decisions. What the Prime Minister should be doing is taking a leaf out of the book of those administrations and bringing about serious economic reform, but he has no interest in that. First and foremost, this Prime Minister has has a self-interest. He wants to stay in the Lodge and in Kirribilli House-and wherever else he stays; he might go for a third house soon. The fact is that he will want to stay for as long as he can. There are a number of points of distinction between the current Treasurer and the Treasurer back in the 1980s. We know that the Prime Minister may have many challenges in this country but I do not think he is going to be challenged by the Treasurer, because the Treasurer of this country has a heart the size of a split pea. He does not make hard economic decisions and he will not make politically hard decisions. I have to say that both of them have failed the Australian people and failed to make the right decisions to deliver the outcomes required for this country. I stand today to say that it is about time this government started focusing on the real issues that have been affecting the people in this country. It is about time the government started focusing on people who need to get jobs. It is about time the government started to focus on the skills required for those people to get into jobs. Instead of blaming everybody else, instead of finding other culprits, this government should make the necessary hard decisions now. (Time expired)",115
122,Ms PANOPOULOS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I never thought I would see a C-grade re-run of Back to the Future. It was a very interesting performance from the member for Gorton. Fancy being so desperate that the member had to resort to quoting and harking back to glorifying Paul Keating. He also said that perhaps the current government should take a leaf out of the previous Labor administration's book. As a member who has a rural electorate, I do remember Paul Keating being quoted as saying that Australia was the ‘arse end of the earth' and that if you are not in Sydney you are just camping out. I am certainly not going to take a leaf out of Mr Keating's book, and thank God that this government has not. I was very interested to listen to the ber for Brand. I have occasionally observed well-delivered speeches and commendable performances from this member of the opposition. But today, alas, I was dismally disappointed, as it was one of his most vacuous and disappointing contributions to public debate. The paucity in the quality of members in the opposition is damning in itself and is at the root of all their problems. You can change leaders, you can reshuffle the front-bench, but they have learnt nothing from the last few years in opposition. The bloody factional wars within the Labor Party have only delivered the faceless men and women from the ranks of the trade union movement-not the real workers but Labor Party hacks, just like the previous speaker, the member for Gorton, who was a union official for 15 years before he was elected to this House. And this is the fundamental problem facing the Labor Party. They are incapable of fulfilling their very important role as an opposition because they are incapable of empathising with the values and concerns of mainstream Australia, as they do not even claim to come from their ranks. Mr Bowen interjecting",118
123,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Prospect might find himself initiated fairly early if he is not careful.,118
124,Ms PANOPOULOS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Ask anyone in the Labor caucus: the word ‘mainstream' is blasphemy within the Labor caucus. It matters not that the current Labor leader is the member for Brand-or again, at some stage, the member for Hotham or, if the opposition gets really down and out and desperate, the member for Lilley or someone else. Until they purge themselves of the ideological dinosaurs that are keeping that green leather warm, they will resent and mock, sneer at memand belittle mainstream Australia and the concerns that many Australian families and individuals have. People's economic concerns revolve around financial security-making sure that their children can have a job. Australians well remember when youth unemployment rates peaked under Labor at 34.5 per cent. Labor had a $500 million New Work Opportunities program which had a four per cent success rate, costing Australian taxpayers $143,000 for every job created-and there were not very many of those. The government's Work for the Dole program has given over 370,000 Australians the opportunity to learn real skills, interact with their community and reintegrate within their local environment. It has given them an opportunity to give something back to the society that supports them. Many have gone on to find jobs, and others have attained the confidence to pursue further qualifications. When the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent. This is a figure that sticks in my mind. It will be burnt in my mind for as long as he is in this place. And he has the gall, the gance-perhaps, as the member for Gorton is trying to do, he is trying to mimic former Treasurer and former Prime Minister Keating-to come in here and lecture the government on managing the economy. When Labor left office, this nation faced an unemployment rate of 8.3 per cent. Under this government, economic management and the hard decisions of reform have been undertaken. I am pleased to say that in my electorate of Indi the unemployment rate is at 3.7 per cent. Apprenticeships festered away under the Labor Party. Only 141,000 apprentices and trainees existed in 1995. This government understands the need to provide choice in education and training. Unlike the Labor Party, it does not turn its nose up at those who do not have a university education. Now almost 400,000 apprentices are learning trades and skills to secure their economic future and that of this nation. In my electorate of Indi we have had a fourfold increase in apprentices, and long may they continue. This government has invested record amounts in vocational education and training. During the recent election, it added another $1.06 billion into vocational education and training and apprentices. Satisfaction with the New Apprenticeships centres is at 90.2 per cent for employers and 92.6 per cent amongst new apprentices. Unemployment has not been as low since 1976, when Abba had the hit single Fernando and the Datsun 280 was released. Further freeing up the industrial relations system is fundamental to maintaining this jobs growth and critical to laying the foundations of economic prosperity and economic security for all Australians. But what have we seen from the Labor Party? They have refused on over 40 occasions to support the government's reform to unfair dismissal arrolaws. The opposition leader is on record as saying that the Labor Party do not really represent small business, but the small business sector is critical for employing people. It is critical in providing opportunities, not only jobs but training and apprenticeships as well. This is what we have come to expect, though, from the Labor Party. They are a slave to the spivs who run most trade unions. The Labor Party cannot stand up to the thugs and bullies in the trade union movement. How can they look small business in the face? When they enter this chamber and bleat about economic management, they have no credibility whatsoever. Just like their state colleagues, especially their counterparts from my home state of Victoria, the federal Labor Party is held political hostage by the disgraceful and often criminal behaviour of parts of the union movement. What better example than Craig Johnston, who wilfully engaged in criminal damage but was lauded as a political prisoner by some elements of the Labor Party? The cost of Federation Square, where workers were allowed a 36hour week, blew out from $100 million to $450 million. In another deal to keep the unions happy, Steve Bracks refused Commonwealth funding of $90 million towards the $425 million redevelopment of the MCG because the conditions attached to the funding were unacceptable to the building union. The unions run the state Labor governments, and the unions still pull the strings in the federal Labor Party. Labor governments do not hold these union thugs accountable for their extortion of the business and government sectors. How can they, when they are beholden to them for campaign funds? How can they, when they are beholden to them for preselection votes? When this government was first elected, it faced extremely serious economic challenges. It faced a waterfront that was an international embarrassment. When this government was first elected, only an average of 16.9 containers per hour were being unloaded at our five major ports, and the Labor Party and the unions bleated that it was impossible to increase the container rate at these ports. But, under reforms that were at times very difficult but were undertaken by this government, the figure has jumped to 28.2. The single greatest investment for most Australians is purchasing their own home. Any government activity that jeopardises this investment destroys the very financial security of many Australian families. We all remember the 17 per cent home interest rates and the 21 per cent farm interest rates. Businesses shut down, families had to sell up their homes, jobs were lost, and families were devastated. The Labor Party also decided when they left government that it was good enough to leave this government with a $96 billion debt. Australians are now paying $550 less per month on the average mortgage, and this government has paid back $73 billion of Labor's debt. But then again, those were the days when the Labor Treasurer said it was the recession we had to have-the worse recession in 60 years. When the Labor Party talk about securing Australia's long-term future, this is the record they should tattoo their foreheads: the devastation caused by that recession. One day they say the Australian economy is being managed badly; the next they say that positive economic figures are attributable to their past record. It is typical member for Brand fashion: try and walk both sides of the fence. If the figures are good, of course they must be attributable to the previous Labor government. But if they are bad, just blame it on the current government. That is what happens when Labor have no shame about their economic record. Unfortunately, the Labor Party have not changed much. Only four short months ago, the rising star, the member for Chisholm said: ‘In some ways it is the best thing that could happen to the Labor Party if interest rates'- (Time expired)",118

128,Ms GILLARD,ADJOURNMENT,"I am on pleased to report tonight on a new innovation from the opposition. In the Thursday afternoon adjournment, we will be conducting the weekly rap-the week that was in federal parliament. It will be inclusive of an awards ceremony, for the edification of members. We are not expecting it to be completely Academy Award style-frocks and tuxedos are not required-but every week we will nominate some of our parliamentarians in the House, or maybe some of the government's parliamentarians, for an award of the week. I will start with the first ever award of the week ceremony. The winner of ‘the silliest stunt of the week' has to be the Treasurerthe member for Higgins, Peter Costello. It has been a long time since we have seen anybody dancing around federal parliament, and dancing badly he was. There was the Treasurer, doing a little jig. Of course, what prompted this from the Treasurer was that he was desperate for a distraction. The Treasurer said: ‘Interest rates are up. I think I'll a jig.' ‘Private health insurance premiums are up. It must be macarena time.' ‘Growth is slowing in the economy. Did someone say Village People?' ‘There's a skills and infrastructure crisis. Let's boogie.' ‘The OECD has revealed today that there is a tax take against Australians. Well, I'm kicking up my heels because the money's in my pocket, not in yours.' Overall, this award is well deserved because the Treasurer, when faced with bad news all round on the economy, thinks it is better if he says, ‘I'll dance now.' He tries to distract people and then lets them feel the full pain of what the Howard government is bringing to Australians. The best thing about this photograph, which immortalises the moment, is that John Howard is laughing. The Prime Minister is laughing, and laugh he may, because he knows that with stunts like this the Treasurer will never be Prime Minister.",120
129,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I think the member has made her point with that picture.,121
130,Ms GILLARD,ADJOURNMENT,"The ‘silliest stunt of the week' was the first award. The next award is the ‘you've got to be joking' award. This week the ‘you've got to be joking award' goes to the Prime Minister. He has qualified on two grounds. The first is that he tried to suggest that it was Labor running a scare campaign on Monday. The master of all scare campaigns is lecturing Labor on the political efficacy of scare campaigns! A deserved award, the ‘you've got to be joking award', goes to the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister managed to get the ‘you've got to be joking award' for two performances. The other one was his complete failure to answer the question as to why Australia's interest rates were higher than 13 other countries. At first he claimed it was growth. Then, faced with the fact that growth in nine do of those countries was more than Australia's, he resorted to year 2000 statistics as if this would answer the point. The ‘you've got to be joking award' of the week is well deserved by the Prime Minister. Then we have the ‘own goal of the week' award. It goes to the Minister for Health and Ageing, who managed today to need to add to an answer to a dorothy dixer. Wasn'the expecting it? Good Lord, the man is Leader of the House as well. He wins the ‘own goal of the week' award. Then we have the ‘I'm as cute as a python award', which goes to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, none other than Dr Brendan Nelson. On Tuesday he managed to take a question about skills shortages. Half of the answer was in response to his saying rhetorically, ‘I'm also asked about alternative policies.' Well, he wasn't! But he managed to damn with faint praise the member for Braddon by saying: ‘I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is working very hard and sits up very straight and pays attention.' Dr Nelson wins the ‘I'm as cute as a python' award. Then we have the ‘all puff, no answers' award, which goes to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. He managed on eight occasions in the past fortnight to take dorothy dixers on industrial relations but, when simply asked whether the Howard government was going to let the minimum wage fall, he could not manage an answer. Then we have ‘accountability watch', which will be another feature of these reports. We have three unanswered questions from this fortnight. Three times Howard government ministers walked away and said that they would report back to the House but they did not. Finally, Mr Speaker, I will you with the ‘mystery of the week'. If the Howard government spent $66 billion in getting re-elected and John Howard is 66 on his next birthday, does that mean that, if Treasurer Costello is Prime Minister by the next election, they will only spend $51 billion at the next election because that will be his age on his next birthday?

133,Mr TICEHURST,ADJOURNMENT,"We are not talking about jokes here; we are talking about something very serious. The Wyong Shire community is living in fear as violence and vandalism in The Entrance area escalates to the point of being out of control. More than 100 anxious and angry residents and shopkeepers attended a public meeting in my electorate this week to discuss the need for urgent measures to address the increasing incidence of crime. They are furious that the state member for The Entrance and new Minister for the Central Coast, Grant MCBride, is not doing enough to reduce crime in the area, and I must say, so am I. The Entrance flower shop was robbed at gunpoint last year, a nightmare that owner Jennifer Wilde says she will relive for the rest of her life. And it is not the first incident of antisocial behaviour that she has experienced. A naked man being lewd outside her shop window is something she will never forget. A hairdresser, a sewing centre, a bakery, a shoe store, a Centrelink branch and a pie shop-just to name a few-have all been subjected to criminal activity in The Entrance in recent months. In fact, on the eve of the public forum the town suffered three broken windows and a robbery. One broken leave window was the second attack on my own office in recent months. A survey of businesses in the area conducted by members of The Entrance Chamber of Commerce revealed that in the last 18 months to two years there have been well over 100 attacks against businesses in The Entrance area, including at least 47 break and enters, 56 broken windows, six armed hold-ups and numerous daytime thefts and underage drinking-and this is just the crime that gets reported. The guest speaker at the meeting, shadow police minister Peter Debnam, pointed out that a huge amount of crime, particularly juvenile crime, does not get reported. Mr Debnam encouraged meeting attendees to report minor crimes to the police assistance line so that government policy makers can make decisions based on accurate statistics. Despite these exorbitant figures, my state colleague revealed that police numbers in the Tuggerah Lakes command have fallen from 198 in 2003 to 194 at the end of last year. So crime is on the increase in our local area, and the New South Wales Carr Labor government is addressing the issue by employing fewer police officers. This is not good enough. The community want action on this serious crime problem in Wyong shire. They want to feel safe at home, at work and when they are buying their groceries. I have had meetings with local business owners in recent weeks and phone calls from elderly residents who are fearful that they going to be the next victims of crime. They are frustrated that nothing is being done. The Town Centre Management Board provides council rangers who operate at various hours between 1 p.m. and 1 a.m., but they are restricted in what they can do. This issue of our local police force being overworked and under-resourced was raised at a similar forum that I held last year, as was the need for more police on the beat in The Entrance between the hours of 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., when the bulk of crime seems to be occurring. This is not about attacking the local force, who are doing a great job, but about getting the message to the Minister for the Central Coast, Mr Grant MCBride, that greater police presence is needed in the town. Yet, while the local community were getting together to voice their concerns, the member for The Entrance thought it was more important that he attend a function at a local country club. The Central Coast community needs and wants a state member of parliament who speaks up for them, not someone who shirks his responsibility and avoids local problems, going so far as to ask residents to call off the public meeting. I am so disappointed by Mr MCBride's lack of response to this important issue and can only hope that, as a result of the meeting and our continued pressure for a resolution to this serious problem, he will demand his government, the New South Wales Carr Labor government, to increase police presence in our area. It is vital that we take a stand now for the future of our local area. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank The Entrance and District Chamber of Commerce for taking the initiative to organise the forum; Mr Debnam for his involvement; and local MLA, Mike Gallacher, and representatives from The Entrance police for their attendance. At Mr Debnam's suggestion, the residents and are business owners who were in attendance have agreed to form an action committee to lobby the Carr government to do their bit to increase police presence and restore safety and confidence to our community. MRI Machines",122
134,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, you will doubtless recall my long standing campaign to acquire a Medicare licence for an MRI machine for Concord hospital. Tonight I stand proudly in this House to celebrate a great victory for my constituents in the electorate of Lowe and for police the people of the Sydney's inner west. Fran Bailey interjecting",123
135,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"It was like pulling teeth, Minister. On 24 February this year, following a hard fought, three-year campaign on behalf of Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Sydney's veteran community and the people of the inner west, the very hard working local state member for Drummoyne, Angela D'Amore and I were delighted to join with the Executive Director of Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Mr Danny O'Connor; the Director of Radiology, Dr Lloyd Ridley; and senior hospital staff and volunteers to welcome, at long last, the announcement that the government would extend Medicare access to the soon to be installed MRI service at Concord hospital. Our campaign for an MRI licence began in early 2002 when the then chief executive officer of the hospital, Mr Matthew Daly; the head of the Department of Radiology, Dr Lloyd Ridley; and the Director (Medical Administration), Dr Margaret Sanger, invited me to a meeting at Concord Hospital, seeking help to obtain a Medicare eligible magnetic resonance imaging machine for the hospital. Following that meeting I took the matter up here in the HouseMr MCArthur interjecting",123
136,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"for the benefit of the member for Corangamite, as he as one of the whips well knows. Since then I have asked numerous questions of the ministers for health, requesting Commonwealth funding for an MRI machine and a Medicare licence for Concord hospital. From that time, federal health ministers have provided a variety of spurious reasons why the licence could not be granted. I also made numerous speeches and tabled 11 petitions in this chamber. As I said back in 2002 and throughout this campaign, Concord hospital is critical to my electorate and tens of thousands of residents of the inner west. Importantly, it also has a proud and distinguished history serving the veteran community and, significantly, it is a teaching hospiing tal of the University of Sydney. The granting of the MRI licence means that not only will patients and residents of the inner west have easy access to this important medical technology but, critically, the hard won Medicare licence will ensure people will not suffer the substantial out-of-pocket costs when they need an MRI scan. In April 2003 I was delighted to learn that, following the excellent work done by the local state member, Ms Angela D'Amore, the Carr government committed $2.8 million to the cost of installing the MRI machine with an expectation that this commitment would be matched by the Commonwealth in providing the Medicare licence. In February 2004, the federal ALP matched that commitment by guaranteeing that the licence would be granted by a federal Labor government. The shadow minister, the member for Lalor, who spoke in the previous debate, gave a commitment outside the hospitalMr MCArthur interjecting",124

Now at long last, and with Medicare eligibility, the 3T MRI machine-the largest and most advanced of its kind-will soon be available for the benefit of all the patients. This is a victory for everyone who worked so hard throughout the campaign and the 10,337 people who signed one of the 11 MRI petitions I have tabled in this House over nearly three years. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Danny O'Connor, Dr Lloyd Ridley, and Director of Medical Services, Dr Margaret Sanger. I also want to thank the Chief Radiographer, Mr John Pasqua; Mary Venchiarutti; and all the radiology staff for supporting the campaign. I give special thanks to Mrs Milka Valdivia, who collected thousands of signatures for the MRI petitions-and I am glad the member for Corangamite is takall this in. I also congratulate Veteran Liaison Services Coordinator, Ms Alice Kang; the distinguished former NSW state president of the RSL, Mr Rusty Priest; and the entire veteran community, who have also been vital to our campaign for the MRI licence. This issue has been a priority for my electorate for nearly three years.

(Time expired) Cook Electorate: Kurnell Peninsula",124
139,Mr BAIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"To tonight's nominations for awards may I add the member for Lalor for her role as best supporting actress in a comedy film, ‘Medicare Gold'. I wish to advise the House of the Commonwealth protection of the landing site of Captain James Cook at Kurnell, the easternmost part of my electorate. This area continues to be under significant threat from sandmining and inappropriate development. Under the NSW Labor government, sandmining operations have continued to expand to a point where parts of the peninsula have been ruined. Anybody flying in an aircraft over the Kurnell Peninsula will see that it has become a series of lakes, as the greedy sandminers continue to rape and pillage the area. As the federal member for the area-and given that the NSW Labor government generally and the local Labor state member Barry Collier particularly have been loath to take any action to save Kurnell-I decided to seek the protection of this area under the Australian government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act by seeking inclusion of the entire peninsula on the National Heritage List. When I learnt of plans by Rocla Quarry Products to seek rights to mine a new area, stripping another 4.5 million tonnes of sand from the fragile neck of the Kurnell Peninsula, I immediately sought emergency Commonwealth protection under section 324F of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This remains the only successful application for such emergency protection. On 28 February last I was advised by the Commonwealth Department of the Environment and Heritage that the Australian Heritage Council had decided on my original application and subsequent emergency application to protect this unique and beautiful area. Unfortunately, only the areas directly associated with the landing of Captain Cook and the meeting of Indigenous and European cultures were listed for protection. While I am disappointed by this decision not to list the entire peninsula, I do understand the reason for it. Put simply, the framing of the act and the constitutional power of this parliament is extremely limited in terms of planning powers. In the words of Mr Tom Harley, the Chair of the independent Australian Heritage Council: The National Heritage List includes places which help define what it means to be Australian. The Council must therefore set a very high standard when assessing nominations. ... the National Heritage List will be highly selective. This ... does not mean that other areas of the Kurnell Peninsula do not have ... value. Put simply, the Australian Heritage Council cannot, under the act, protect areas that do not have outstanding heritage value to the nation. In this case they cannot protect areas that are removed from Cook's landing site and have been degraded by the NSW government's penchant for development and sandmining. The reason I sought National Heritage List protection was to try to protect this area which has been so badly devastated by continual sandmining. I again quote Mr Tom Harley, the Chair of the Australian Heritage Council. He wrote: The NSW Government is responsible for ensuring that places with State or local heritage are protected. Mr Harley continued: Similarly, it is the NSW Government that presides over the sand mining ... They took away the rights from the local council several years ago and took total control themselves. They have talked about putting in a major housing development alongside the dunes of some 500 houses. They allow the sandmining to go on. Mr Collier has tried to pillory me in the local media, as has the NSW minister for planning-the man who approves the landfills, the development, the heavy industry and the sandminingCraig Knowles. In fact, Mr Knowles, the kingpin of the development at Kurnell, even compared my efforts and the efforts of others in the electorate to save this important and irreplaceable area as being ‘a bit like wetting yourself in a dark suit-it gives you a warm feeling but nobody notices'. That is comes from the minister for planning, so much care does he take. I say this to the minister, and more so to Barry Collier: you can try to shift the blame for Kurnell all you like. I have said from the outset that the national heritage listing was about all I can constitutionally do from Canberra. It is up to you and your government to stop all the mining. The national heritage listing, had it covered the sand dunes, would have only acted prospectively. It remains you, Mr Collier, who can end all the sandmining once and for all. This has been my statement from the outset. The national heritage list application is not something that be done just because I, or the Commonwealth government, want this area protected. It is assessed by an independent statutory body and must stand up to scrutiny within the ambit of the act. Because of you and your government, Mr Collier, the area which contains the sandhills is all but destroyed and cannot be construed by the Heritage Council to meet the stringent guidelines of the act. (Time expired) Aeropelican Air Services",125
140,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Shortland) (4.50 p.m.)Tonight I raise an issue of great concern to the people of the Shortland electorate and surrounding areas, particularly the people of Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast. At the same time, I am seeking the support of the House. The issue that I am raising is the shifting of the Aeropelican service that operates out of Belmont in my electorate to Williamtown by the current owner and the proposal to rezone the land as residential in spite of the fact that that zoning is not appropriate. Aeropelican was operated by Ansett at the time of the Ansett collapse and it was one of the few services they operated that actually made a profit. The current owner, International Air Parts Pty Ltd, purchased Aeropelican from the administrator. Aeropelican first came into operation in 1967. It was the brainchild of Keith Hilder, who realised his dream when he established a commuter service between Belmont and Sydney. Since the new owner has taken over, he has, I believe, systematically run down the service. He has sold off two of the planes. He has reduced the service from 13 to six flights a day and he is in the process-if he has not alreadyof selling the two remaining twin otters and the service is due to cease operating from Belmont on 1 April. I am so concerned about this that I am can placing a motion on the Notice Paper for next week. This motion will emphasise the vital importance of the Aeropelican air service to the people of the area and, at the same time, express my concern and the concern of the people in the area at the owner's decision to cease operation out of Belmont. I will be pointing out that there is no other commercial air service operating out of Lake Macquarie or the Central Coast of New South Wales-and what a vital service it is for the people of that area. I will be emphasising that this will increase the traffic on the F3 between Newcastle and Sydney, and I will also highlight the fact that there will be staff losses. Whilst the current owner of IAP says that all the staff will be moved to Williamtown, barring two or three who do not want to go, I contradict this as all the ground staff at Belmont will lose their jobs. In addition, some other employees will not have the same number of hours available to work, and one employee who cannot drive will be forced to give up her job. To give you an idea of the level of support in my community for maintaining this air service, I will read briefly from a fax which I received from a constituent. This is one of many approaches I have received in my office. It says: Both my partner and I use this service regularly and will now be forced to travel to Williamtown (45 minutes) or travel directly to Sydney. This is a built. major service for the people who live between the Central coast and Newcastle. It goes on to point out that it is an area where there is a growing population, that it is on the eastern side of Lake Macquarie and that there is absolutely no doubt that it is a vital infrastructure for the area. The owner has stated that moves by the federal government in relation to security and the upgrades that he will be required to undertake are the reason for him having to transfer the service. I have put some questions on the Notice Paper to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services about this and I have also written to him about this. I suspect that the minister will advise me that there are funds available to assist with it. I am so concerned about this that I am launching a petition to all levels of government asking for their support. On Sunday 20 March at 10 o'clock, at a venue to be advised, I will be holding a public meeting within the electorate, and people will be able to come along, pledge their support and work with me to ensure that we maintain this vital service. We hear in this place all the time about how important it is to have viable transport infrastructure and transport services like Aeropelican, a service which has the support of the community and which, in most circumstances, travels with near to capacity, or capacity, loads. (Time expired) Tugun Bypass",126
141,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I have risen in this chamber on many occasions to put on record my concerns regarding the Tugun bypass, the most important piece of infrastructure that is under planning for the southern Gold Coast-a piece of infrastructure that has been discussed and debated for close on 20 years. In fact, it has been discussed and debated to death, and residents of the Gold Coast now just want to see this road The proposed bypass has been the subject of numerous public meetings and intense media scrutiny for many years. In fact, at one stage a proposed route for the bypass by the Beattie state government included the resumption of 14 residential homes and a major highway running along the fence line of many other homes-in other words, the road was going to destroy the amenity of southern Gold Coast residents. After months of negotiation-and I mean months-and a state election, a final route was decided on by the Queensland state government and agreed to by the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth. It was a route called the C4, to the west of the Gold Coast Airport, which would not impact on the homes of the residents living in Adina Avenue, parallel to the airport. We did not reach this decision without a lot of finger pointing and political grandstanding. To this day, the New South Wales government have not committed one cent to the construction of the Tugun bypass. The road is being funded with a Commonwealth contribution of $120 million, a huge commitment by the Commonwealth for a road that is essentially not our responsibility. But the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson, recognised the importance of this road to the southern Gold Coast and put the dollars on the table. The Queensland government also committed to the project-$240 millionbut no assistance in funding from the New South Wales government has been received, even though more than half the road is in New South Wales. But I digress. Once we had locked down the route and locked down the funding for the route, you would have thought we could have moved forward with the planning and the environmental impact study, but we now have more problems. The project is moving forward. The planning process has continued and that planning process is on schedule, but we now have the Gold Coast and Hinterland Environment Council, Gecko, demanding that the New South Wales government stop the building of the bypass by the Queensland government. Gecko have cited environmental concerns for stopping the bypass. I want to assure the House and the people of the southern Gold Coast that the Tugun bypass will be subject to rigorous environmental and planning approvals by state and federal authorities. The EIS process will amine all of the social, environmental and economic impacts of the planned bypass. An environmental impact statement, or EIS, a species impact statement, or SIS, and a draft major development plan have all been released for public comment. That consultation period began on 13 December last year and will close on 14 March. The process assesses potential impacts, proposes ways to manage them, discusses the likely benefits and establishes a basis for future monitoring when the project proceeds. The EIS is made up of a series of documents including a number of detailed technical papers which include papers on flora and fauna, traffic and transport, noise and vibration, engineering design, urban design and visual impact, and air, soil and water assessments. There are also papers on the animal species found in the study area, the potential impacts and the measures to mitigate and monitor them. The EIS process is thorough, detailed and gives all those interested the opportunity to voice their concerns or, indeed, their support for the bypass. It is my understanding that Gecko will make a submission to the EIS process. This is the responsible procedure. In that way their concerns can and will be addressed. I refute their claims that the ‘community has been brainwashed into believing that the C4 route was the only viable route and that the problems with this route have been deliberately underestimated year after year'. The Tugun bypass has been done to death. It is my belief that the road can be built and the environmental issues can be addressed. I do not often pat the Queensland state government on the back but, on this occasion, I believe they have put a lot of thought and planning into the route. I have continued to speak with their planning authorities on a regular basis and raised issues with them ex- myself. The authorities have been nothing short of cooperative.",127
