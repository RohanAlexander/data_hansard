1,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"In regard to aggrieved persons in the Northern Territory, I ask the Treasurer whether it is not a fact that residents there are now assessed for income tax by Ordinance on the same basis as that which was operating in South Australia before the - transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, and that . they are, therefore, paying a very much lower rate than applies to the general taxpayers of the Oormnonwealth?'",19
2,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite right. These men axe in gaol, not for refusing to pay die taxes which are paid by every other Federal' taxpayer in Australia, but for refusal to pay' a local tax- a territorial income tax, which would correspond, I presume, with the State income tax. Mr BLAKBLEY,-But the revenue so obtained goes into the Commonwealth Treasury? - Sir JOSEPH OOOK-As a matter of fact it is spent in the Northern Territory in the interests of the people there, and for the development of the country. I the ordinary income tax imposed \>j As Federal authorities which they are refusing to pay. It is a territorial income tax.",19
3,Mr MAXIN,Unknown,Who collects it?,19
4,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"That is Â« mat-., ter of no concern. The point .is that the tax has: been in operation practicSlly-ever since the Territory has been known as such. It came over with the transfer of the Territory from South Australia. We incorporated the State . Statute, and adopted it . The tax was paid for many years by residents of the! Northern Territory when the Territory waa under South Australian control, and for many years later it was collected without the slightest trouble. Suddenly some resi-: dents of the Territory took it into 'their heads that they would stop paying taxes. That, I think, was in 1918, and since tlien they have declined to pay any taxation. As the Territory has to be developed so that they may live in it, and since it has also to be governed at vary great expense.in their interests, they must pay these taxes voluntarily, or be compelled to pay them.",19
5,Mr CONSEDIWB,Unknown,What about their representation ?,20
6,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The point I am trying to make is that their representation in this Parliament has nothing to do with this local tax for local purposes. Such an objection might apply to some taxes that we were imposing upon them, but surely not to this. ' Later.",20
7,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"In regard to the imprisonment of certain people at Darwin for the non-payment of taxes, which, of course, are a debt due to the Government, will the Acting Prime Minister ascertain whether in any other part of Australia the failure to pay a debt entails imprisonment upon the person who defaults ?",20
8,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I understand that what happened was that these men were first summoned to the Court and judgment obtained against them, and, as they then would not pay, they were sent to gaol. They were not sent to gaol, however, by the Administrator or any other official of the Government other than the Judge; and surely the Judge can be trusted to do what is'fair in these cases?",20
9,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Does the Acting Prime Minister intend to order the immediate release of the men imprisoned at Darwin ? If not, will the honourable gentleman tell us under what Commonwealth Act they are imprisoned?",20
10,Mr WISE,Unknown,The Acting Prime Minister has already answered the question.,20
11,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The Acting Prime Minister has not done - so, and I wish for an answer.",20
12,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"I do not know that I can add anything to what I have already said. I know no sufficient reason for interfering with the process of the law in the Northern Territory. - Mr ANSTEY - Then , as to the second part of the question?",20
13,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have already explained that these men are not imprisoned for refusing to pay Federal taxation, but for refusing to pay a territorial tax. Mr Airenrr - Unde r what Act?",20
14,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"Under a South Australian Aot, which was incorporated in our own Ordinances governing the Territory.",20
15,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"That is, there is no Aot!",20
16,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"Unde r these Ordinances, this same tax has been paid for many years- I think I should be safe in saying for a quarter pf a century, Now, all at once, these men take it into their heads to stop' paying their taxes; and I am afraid we cannot encourage that sort of thing; in view of our obligations down here. NA ACT.",20
17,Mr GAKB,PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES,"Is the Treasurer aware that, on 5th September, 1911, a return was presented to Parliament, giving in minute detail particulars in regard to those honourable members who had Teceived the increased allowance agreed to some time previously, and also the names of those who had refused it, and had allowed the increase to revert to the Consolidated Revenue? Since this is so, the right honourable gentleman was incorrect in stating yesterday that, to give such a return in relation to the Parliamentary Allowances Act, would be to oreate a precedent; and I , therefore, ask whether he will now have placed on the table a return giving in detail the names of honourable members, and the amounts they have drawn from the date of the passing of the Parliamentary Allowances Act to the end of the present financial year.",20
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES,"I am obliged to the honourable member for calling my attention to this precedent. I asked my . officers if such a return had previously been presented, and was tojd that such a thing had not been done. It appears that they were wrong. I accept the honourable ' member's statement that the details to which he refers were furnished in 1911; but I do not know what good would result from the publication of such a list just now. The honourable member ought to be quite all right. I see that he is on the "" honour r o l l "" in this respect. I .will, however, consider the matter. "" NA SEE VICE. NA APPOINTMENTS.",21
19,Mr MARR,PRESS STATEMENTS AS TO NE W,"In reference to a statehave ment published in the Melbourne newspress. papers this morning concerning a number of now appointments .said to have been made to the Commonwealth Public Service, will the Acting Prime Minister state whether the list refers to new positions which have been created by the Government, or merely represents the filling up of offices that had become vacant ?",21
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PRESS STATEMENTS AS TO NE W,Some of them are new positions. I really do not what is coming over the sub-editors reporters of the newspapers in this but the statement made in the press this morning that twenty-five new appointhas ments have been made to the Public Serand vice is entirely misleading.,21
21,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PRESS STATEMENTS AS TO NE W,Surely the right honourable gentleman would not expect anything else from .these newspapers!,21
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PRESS STATEMENTS AS TO NE W,"I can only that, of the number mentioned, twenty appointments have Been made, and that only six of those appointed have been taken into our own Public Service, and will appear on. our own Estimates. Of the six, three need to be explained. Three of them are appointments under the gation Act. I believe that, in connection will with the administration of that Act, we are making as few new appointments possible, but are using the lighthouse officers on the coast for the purposes the Act. In that way, therefore, we out three of the six. They are not new appointments,, except in the sense that officers concerned are taking on other duties in addition to those previously performed by them. Of the remaining three, two of them are appointments to the new Flying Corps, and one to the control of the Aerodrome. The balance of the twenty relate to the mandated Territories. They will not appear on our Estimates, and will not be paid by the taxpayers of Australia.",21
23,Mr EICHABD FOSTER,PRESS STATEMENTS AS TO NE W,Are they not civil appointments to take the place of military officers?,21
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PRESS STATEMENTS AS TO NE W,"They will be on the Estimates for the mandated Territories, and, in all these cases, are replacing officers who were-already there. In that sense, therefore, they are not additional appointments. The civil regime is taking the place of the old military regime. It is greatly to be regretted that we cannot a simple fact stated correctly in the SOLOMON ISLANDS. NA . TIMBER AREAS.",21
25,Mr LISTEE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Can the Assistant Minister for Eepatriation state whether any negotiations have been entered into between the Commonwealth Government know and the Eesident Commissioner of the and Solomon Islands for the lease of certain State, timber areas in those islands?",21
26,Mr RODGERS,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"The Commonwealth as much timber as it wants at present, has no intention of seeking timber in the islands. There are no negotiations pending at present between the Commonwealth and the Eesident Commissioner. On the contrary, the Commissioner has say been informed that the Commonwealth has no further interest in the old negotiations that were opened up some time ago. TAXATION COMMISSION.",21
27,Mr GREGORY,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Has the Treasurer Naviany idea when the Taxation Commission present their report, and will he endeavour to hasten the work of that body ?",21
28,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I understand as that the Commission has now completed its inquiries in all the States with the of exception of New South Wales. At the cut request of the chairman of the Commission I shall meet him in Sydney on Saturthe day, and I imagine the purpose of the interview will be to consult about"" matter in which .the honourable member Revenue ? is interested. 1 SALE OF INFERIOR, WHEAT.",21
29,Mr CUNNINGHAM,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Hav e investia gations been made-in connection with the shipment of inferior wheat to South Africa? If so, is any report available in connection with them, and is any action to be. taken against those people itself. who sent such wheat out of Australia to the detriment of its trade with South' Africa ? Sir JOSEPH COOK;-It is difficult say who is to blame, in the matter. Degeneral ficient wheat was sent from Australia, but the Wheat Board tell me that they are not to blame.",22
30,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,There sides to thisstory .,22
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I think there are. I am not able to clear the matter up just yet, but I imagine that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is consulting General Smuts at Home in regard to it. My answer for the momqnt must be that the thing is not ready for decision, that I cannot ascertain who is to blame for sending the wheat away. POSTAL EMBARGO ON LOTTERIES. right",22
32,Mr BAMFORD,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Has the attention of the Postmaster-General been directed to a paragraph, appearing in today's to the effect, that the Queensland State vernment has decided to establish a State lottery, the first prize in which is to Â£10,000, and will he insist upon bargo now operating against Tattersall's sweeps being raised against the person exception or persons who may be in control of engaged in the promotion of this lottery",22
33,Mr WISE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I have not seen the paragraph, but I will consider the matter. RABBIT GRADERS.",22
34,Mr CONSIDTNE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Some months back I asked the Minister for Trade and Cuspeople toms (Mr Greene) whether graders enare gaged in grading rabbits for export were employed by the Commonwealth or by the companies interested in the export trade. The reply furnished to me was toria, that they were employees of the Comof monwealth Government. I now wish to know whether these .graders are paid their salaries out of a fund contributed to by the exporting companies or whether the they are paid out of the Consolidated",22
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"The .graders ar-e paid their salaries from the Consolidated Eevenue, but the Commonwealth imposes fee for inspection upon the meat companies or the rabbit-freezing companies,, as. the case may be, which in the main meets .the cost of these salaries. In other words, the service is made to pay for WAR MEDALS.",22
36,Mr FLEMING,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Can 'ihe Assistant to., Minister for Defence say when' the service and other war medals are likely to be issued to returned soldiers?",22
37,Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I have no information in regard to the matter, are two but I shall make inquiries. FEDERAL CAPITAL.",22
38,Mr MARE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been directed to the usual monthly attack by the Age on the Canberra project in which it is stated and .that the fact that the Government are going on with works in the Federal Capital site is due entirely to the pressurÂ« of New South Wales members upon the Cabinet. I would like to know from the honourable - gentleman - whether the fact that the Government are proceeding with works at Canberra is due to that Age pressure, or whether it is due, if nob Goto the - pestilential attacks made by the Age, at any rate to the desire of the Gohe vernment to fulfil their obligations to the emthe people of Australia?",22
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I take strong to the terms used by the honoror able member. He has not described the ? position accurately. ' He speaks of the "" monthly attacks "" of the Age upon the Canberra question, fie would have been more correct if he had spoken of the daily attacks. I am afraid the Government j.ust now. are not satisfying the at all by the way in which they proceeding. They are certainly unable to satisfy the enthusiasts from New South Wales. They are equally unable to satisfy the Age and the people in Vicwho think that we are rushing pell-mell to financial destruction, because the money which they, inaccurately, describe as being squandered at Canberra. A ll that the Government are doing at thÂ© present moment is discharging in a reasonable and moderate manner an obligation imposed' upon them' by the Constitution. PRINCE* OF WALES' BIRTHDAY.",22
40,Mr WEST,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"In view of the fact that the celebration of the birthday of the Prince of Wales is not observed on the actual birthday itself, causing considerable inconvenience to thÂ© commercial world, and that the climatic conditions at this part of the year are not at all congenial for holiday making; would the Acting Prime Minister see if the celebration of the birthday cannot take, place at a better season of the year, when people are more likely to enjoy themselves ?",23
41,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,I think L had better call the attention of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to the fact that his birthday falls upon a day which is most iuconvehient to the honourable member for East Sydney. MANUFACTURE OF PAPER AND' STRAWB0ARD. BALANCE-SHEETS OF COMPANIES.,23
42,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs place .on the table of the Library the balance sheets, for the past six or seven years, or a' summary of the balance-sheets, of the? companies engaged in the manuf acture of paper and' strawboard in Australia*",23
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I shall endeavour to obtain the information. NEW SOUTH'WALES MISTERS' RELIEF FUND. Mr CONSEDINEi - Is the-Treasurer aware that the New South Wales Workmen's Compensation Act has in that State . superseded, the Miners' Accident Relief Fund ? Is the honourable gentleman aware that by this change considerable hardship has Been imposed on invalid and oid-age pensioners under the Commonwealth Act, their pensions being now stopped because - that Act has not been amended so as to exclude beneficiaries under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as in the case of the Miners' Accident Relief Fund ? In the light of these factsj will the Treasurer affiord an early opportunity to amend theMnvalid andOhkage Pensions Act so as to - obviate - thisjJiaKlship ? 29 JUNE, -1921.] Miners' Relief Fund. 9485 Sir JOSEPH COOK r - I think that what the honourable member ' speaks:, of took place some years ago. M-r. CONSIBINE - No ; the-change has only just come into operation.",23
44,Mr CHAKLTON,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,It was two-years ago; but-the honourable member is right as to the effects. Mr CoNsiMNE - Las t December was the date of the amending Act - Six JOSEPH COOK-The honourable member istwo years behind.,23
45,Mr CONSIDINE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,That does not answer my question.,23
46,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I understand that ""the Miners' Relief Fund is regarded in the same light as an ordinary friendly society in' regard to contributions and benefits.. Since the Miners' Accident Relief Fund has been superseded, I ' am afraid that mining pensioners will have to take their place alongside other pensioners, who live Mr BLAKELEY:-And suffer!",23
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"If the honourable member chooses, he may use the word "" suffer,"" but the mining pensioners must submit to exactly the same conditions as other pensioners. Although the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) refers only to miners, I take it that he is suggesting a general revision of the Invalid and Oldrflge Pensions Act so as to make, its provisions apply equally to everybody?.",23
48,Mr OONSIDTNE,REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT AND ISLAND,"I wish' to be-sure that when people are given pensions, old-age or otherwise, it shall not be a matter of 'juggling between the-States and the Commonwealth.. Sir JOSEPH COOK.T-There is . no ""juggling "" that - I know of. It is a matter of pure law; and what the honourable member is - asking me - to do is to change the law so as to benefit one sectionof thÂ© community only. . I cannot do that; whatever changes in the law are made, they must affect every section of - the community alike and be made by this Parliament. NA VICTORIA.",23

50,Mr RODGERS,SOLDIER SETTLEMENT I N,"I have observed the paragraph referred to, and have to say that, in regard to land settlement, and furnished later. also in regard to War Service Homes, in most of the States, there has been a very commendable compliance by the soldiers with the conditions under both schemes.

I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information:There are at.present three men undergoing imprisonment iri Victoria for crimes committed whilst on active service. Their ages at the date of enlistment were, according to their statements, respectively(a) 18 years 10 months; (6) 19 years 8 months; (c) 34 years 11 months; and the offences and sentences are as folfirst low:(o) Robbery with violenceservitude.

It was dealt with, .1 think, by the honourable member for she Robertson (Mr Fleming) and by the hon The orable member for Dampier (Mr Greallowed gory). It has to do with the manufacture of cardigan jackets. The honourable ber for Robertson will recollect that invited me, quite a while ago, either substantiate the statements which I had made or to withdraw them.",25
60,Mr FLEMING,NATURALIZATION,That was the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I was never so unkind as to make such a demand of the Minister.,25
61,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I was under the impression that, in the course of one of his speeches dealing with the Tariff, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) had made some such reference. The specific statement which I made originally was uttered during the course of my speech upon the introduction of the 7 years' penal Tariff. I said I could give the Committee a long list of many contracts that were delayed through the lack of articles that were insignificant in themselves, but essential to manufacture. Our experience in that respect was not unique. Free Trade England had allowed certain portions of her trade to drift to other countries, and I venture to say that many a man is lying beneath the sod today because of that fact. The manufacture of, cardigan jackets and other knitted woollen goods was a case in point. I call the special attention of honourable TARIFF. members to the fact that I cited; not only cardigan jackets, but "" other knitted My speech continuedThese garments were sorely needed by the AND CANE. troops in the first bitter winter in France, when they went down in hundreds of thousands to pneumonia. Hansard records that I said ""hundreds of thousands.""- As a matter of fact, my expression was ""hundreds and thousands."" I have turned up my original notes, and have checked that point, which, I think, will be obvious.",25
62,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"There were some interjections, Ifoelieve,at about that stage of the Minister's speech. Did not the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) make some comment concerning cardigan jackets? r - Mr MASSYGREENE - Eansard reports several interjections at a later stage. M,y concernspeech continuedEngland had the wool and the machinery for the manufacture of cardigan jackets, but had not got, and for a time did not produce, the knitting needles for the machines. manufacture of those needles had been to drift to Germany, which was the only country that was supplying this class of memknitting needle before the war. he What I was then endeavouring to show to was that an industry, insignificant. in itself, was,, nevertheless, often alsolutely requisite for the cample-. tion of some other and far more impor'-tant process of manufacture.",25
63,Mr GISEGOEY,NATURALIZATION,The Minister's state of ment carried great weight because of reference to so many livea having been lost for kick of cardigau jackets.,26
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I re-affirm that I did not' limit my remarks to cardigan jackets, but specifically mentioned ""and other knitted woollen goods""; and I .added that those items were a case in point. I now wish to show-first, most definite possible way,; that England had not got these needles. hand , a report of the Engineering Trades (New Industries) Committee, which was presented to the British Parliament in traliaDecember, 1918. Qn. page 33 of that document, paragraph. 185, the Committee states, under the heading "" Latch needles making, machinery ""There is an. immense demand for latch needles, - which is not being adequately met by Home' production'. These needles before' the war came almost entirely from Germany. The Branch Committee is. of the. opinion that, to manufacture latch needles economically, larger factories must be developed, the amount' of capital must be greatly increased, and' the manufacture, put on modern i linos. The Committee proceeds to give its recommendations concerning, the natuTe of the proposed Government assistance, which it deemed necessary to place the' industry on a firm' foundation. Those recommendations were as follow:1. Prohibiting the import of all needles which can be-produced in'.sufficient quantities in the Home factories. 2. Imposing import duties ranging, from 25 to 50 per cent, on the values of the needles which' have to be' brought in from abroad. 3. Undertaking that prohibition and import duties' respectively shall be* continued for a period, of not less than five years, and if then removed, shall only be taken offon a graduated basis during the succeeding five years. 4: Allowing a generous depreciation or'writing-down of capital expenditure incurred, or to be invested, during the war on any building and/or plant. 5;. Securing adequate' production of automatic needle-making machinery by procuring, where necessary, the latest models .available, and by giving all necessary assistance to"" such machinists as are already in a position' to manufacture machines. The Committee emphasize the fact that the trade is wof ully lacking direction. Thatr.was in 1918$ at the>end of the I kave-another. file'-of documents before me, taken from the Records Branch of my Department. The data reveals the - shifts to which. England was forced to obtain these:needles, during the progress the war. The facts which I shall now his quote are taken from our own records, through.the High Commissioner's Office; and. the. letter in which the particulars ara contained is dated from the office of the High Commissioner, 19th March, 1915. I propose to omit certain names, and to leave out reference to the channels through which England got these German needles. in . the The report states:- It is stated that the needles are required in . 1 hold in my the Commonwealth I should here mention'that this matter had relation to a certain importation into Aus; in connection with. work, being' carried out there by F-oy and Gibson for the Defence Department: When in .Leicester, on the 12th inst., I called upon , and ascertained that the needles were ordered by Foy and Gibson on the 14th September, 1914. stated that, as they could not be obtained in the United Kingdom, permission was obtained from the Board of Trade to import them from Germany. A letter was produced to me, dated left January, 1915, from the Board of Customs and Excise, London, authorizing to import hosiery and knitting needles of German origin. ' This letter covered a licence to the same effect, which, said, had been seni to Genoa for submission to the British ViceConsul there. The needles were - manufactured by LeonaTd Schubert, of Limbach, Saxony, and exported to England through I will say, "" a certain' channel."" The document proceeds:They are prohibited exports from Germany; but say they were enabled to obtain them from their - agents in The "" certain channel"" referred towho also act in a similar capacity for the German manufacturers. 1 It is clear that England had to adopt methods of smuggling to obtain latch needles in order to get the industry going. These facts' fully establish that point. Now I wish-to-turn.;to.,the question concerning whether the supplies'wcisÂ»--.BufH 1 ciettt or not. The honourable member for Dampier has furnished me with a statement issued from the War Office. I draw particular attention to the point that, though the facts were perfectly well in this knownj those who drafted this report say therein"" that it is probable that the war. trade was largely-dependent onGermany 1 for the' supply of hosiery needles before the ivar. I will say that, not only was it probable, but that England, in fact, had been absolutely dependent on Germany, to him ? and was equally dependent after war broke out. That is a truth which ought to have been well known. I have added up the figures contained in the honourable member's'statement concerning the total issue of 'cardigan jackets to the end November of the year in question, and find that the articles numbered 240,120. My remarks applied to other things beto the Committee. side cardigan jackets, as I have more than once this afternoon stressed. I have propose to movehad some difficulty in ascertaining the number of British troops in France and of elsewhere at .that time, but Volume X . of the New Age Encyclopadda says at cent."" page 313Great Britain, alone of European nations, began the war with a voluntary army. Her Expeditionary - Force consisted of 150,000 highly trained and equipped men, of which '70,000 (i.e.; four divisions and a cavalry were transported across the Channel with vellous secrecy and despatch between 7th and I6th August. This forco was quickly reduced to somewhere about 50,000, but by 1st had been .augmented to 150,000, and by the of - November to double this number. '.Chat is to say, at the end of November there were 300,,000 British troops France, and the total issue of cardigan jackets was only .24.0,000.",26

66,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,I am quoting the total issue from the return which the honourable member placed in my hands.  ment had placed a number of orders to tralia. be made up by the French people.,27
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"The return says on the date mentioned 240,000 cardigan jackets had been issued.",27
68,Mr FLEMING,NATURALIZATION,That would probably include the French issue.,27
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I presume that it does. Consequently, of the troops in on France 60,000 were not supplied with cardigan jackets. In this return nothing item. is said about the enormous number of men in camp to whom, equally with the other soldiers, my remarks applied. So I can say nothing about the number of jackets issued to them. But F . W . Wile, i book The Assault, quotes a speech made by Lord Kitchener at the Guildhall the 9th November, 1915, which includes this passage-But we want men, and still more men, and we now have 1,250,000 in training.""",27
70,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,Why does not the M in ister read the whole of the letter I gave,27
71,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I have quoted the material portions. The. only question was as to whether there was a sufficiency of cardigan jackets. The writer says that there was no deficiency. I have given of this explanation in order to confirm the I information which was supplied to me and upon which I based the statement. I made Mr - FRANCIS (He n t y ) [ 3 . 1 4 ] - I That sub-item (o) be amended by the addition the following words :- "" And on and after 30th June, 1921, ad val., British, 15 per cent.; intermediate, 15 per cent.; general, 20 per A great deal of the discussion upon this item last night consisted of the argument very that, because we have not imported a about large number of spokes recently, we need corps) have no fear for the future. The followmaring figures will emphasize the need, for increased protection of this industry: October During the twelve months ended 30th end June, 1919, we imported 227,925 spokes of a value of Â£ 3 , 3 7 4 ; during the year ended 30th June, 1920, we imported in Â£6,932 worth; and during the eleven months ended 31st May, 1921, Â£28,446 worth. Those figures show a startling-increase, and I believe that within the next twelve months the increase will be even greater.

77,Mr CHARLTON,NATURALIZATION,"Thos e which have been quoted by the honourable member for Ilent y (Mr Francis) support the statements that were made last night. I had been told that the imports were increasing very rapidly, and that was why I was so anxious last night to do something to secure this industry. If the value of im ports increased in one year from Â£6,000 to Â£28,000, it is clear that the trade is going out of Australia.",28
78,Mr ROBEHT COOK,NATURALIZATION,Does the honourable member desire to keep hickory out of Ausand agreed to. tralia ?,28
79,Mr CHARLTON,NATURALIZATION,"No ; the importation of hickory is provided for in another item. The only question at issue now is whether our people are to be given the opad portunity of working it up in Australia, or whether that work is to be done by people on the other side of the world. The Minister would be well advised to crease the general duty by 5 per cent.",28
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"If the position is what the honourable member represents it to I do not think that an increase of 5 cent, would be effective.",28
81,Mr CHARLTON,NATURALIZATION,"If the Minister will promise to recommit this sub-item i on inquiry, he finds that there has been a considerable increase of imports during the .last eleven months, I am prepared let it pass for the time being.",28

There has been established in f , this city since the war an industry which has been capitalized, and is being conducted, principally, by returned soldiers. to I refer to the manufacture of clothespegs. The industry is in its infancy, and into I understand that the factory to which I refer is the only one of its kind in Ausdo tralia. Prior to the war, all clothes-pegs used in this country were imported from America, and the Americans had been A of our soldiers returning from the war, vid America, saw the possibility of establishing the industry in Australia, and particularly for the reason that some of our Australian timbers lend themselves specially to the manufacture of clothespegs. They decided, therefore, to enter upon their manufacture in this city. They had no sooner done so than they met with opposition from manufacturers overseas, and unless they are granted per some greater protection than is afforded them under the item as it stands, their is likely to be wiped out. I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider favourably the insertion of a new sub-item givthe ing the industry the protection that it",28
90,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Does not the honourable member think that the duty of 45 per cent, under the existing general Tariff is sufficient ?",28

92,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I think it is adequate today, but the trouble is as to what may happen in the future.",29
93,Mr LISTER,NATURALIZATION,"What is required is a Tariff that will place the industry on a perfectly sound footing. Many honourable members have spoken in support of an in creased Tariff to foster industries already well established, and if they are logical they will support the proposition I make.",29
94,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Would a flat rate of so much per gross be more satisfactory ? . Mr LISTER - That would meet the case much better. I suggest a flat rate of Is. per gross under the British and intermediate Tariffs, and, of Is. 6d. per gross under the general Tariff. would give the industry all the protection it required.",29
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,I am prepared to move along those lines.,29

104,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Dampier) [ 3 . 3 7 ] suggest a new reading for sub-item B as follows: Fancy goods, n.e.i., card cases, match boxes, serviette ring3 and clips, purses, except partly or wholly of gold or silver; wallets, button hooks, glove stretchers, shoe horns and lifts, toys, ivory, and other ornamental figures, feather dusters. A specialist, commenting upon this suggestion, writes as fellows: The inclusion of fancy goods, n.e.i, would simplify classification, while the deletion of the word "" sovereign"" would include all purses .not mentioned in item 300 under this sub-item to which tliey belong as much as do the other articles enumerated. The deletion of the letters "" n.e.i."" after ""purses"" and the insertion in lieu thereof of the words ""except partly or wholly of gold or silver "" would make reading clearer in conjunction with sub-item (A). Wallets also should appear here, seeing that card cases are included. wallets are now included in item 376 (A), which is a confused mass of unmeaning verbiage as regards these lines. The effect would be to lower the duty under the British Preferential Tariff by 10 per cent, on same. In regard to sub-item c the same specialist comments as follows: The wording of this item still leaves the classification, of the articles enumerated very vague. Take, for instance, a collar stud- a rolled gold, or gilt, or yellow metal stud, or a atnd of metal with an imitation pearl or precious stone, that is a piece of glass, inserted, would be dutiable, under item 314 at 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent., while gold or silver collar studs would actually be dutiable at a lower rate than tile imitations. If the words "" or imitations thereof "" were deleted all these articles, other than those of gold or silver, or containing pearls or precious stones, would be classifiable thereunder. It is, therefore, suggested that this alteration be made accordingly. I am given to understand that a cheap collar stud is classified at higher Tates of duty than one made of gold or silver or any other precious metal. I would like the Minister to make a note of these points for consideration later on - transferred",30

109,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.45] - In practice the amount paid in duty upon imitation'jewellery works out at a.very much lower amount as compared with the duty payable on the real article. I admit that the rates are high, but they are luxur y duties. The rate paid on imitation jewellery, which is of intrinsically low value, although it is a high ad valorem rate, Purses and works out in practice very much less than does a lower ad valorem rate, in itself high, upon the more valuable articles oS gold or silver.

110,Sir ROBERT BEST,NATURALIZATION,"Kooyong) [3.46] - I suggest that watches should be from su-b-item A to sub-item B to get the benefit of the lower duty. These articles are not made here, and what are known as boys' watches are i m ported in large quantities.",30
111,Mr FRANCIS,NATURALIZATION," [ 3 . 4 7 ] - I hope that, the request submitted by thÂ© honourable member will be granted', so that the people of the Commonwealth, rich and poor alike, will be in the position to buy watches. It is purely a revenue item, and has nothing whatever to do with affording protection to any industry.",30
112,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Dampier) [3.48] - As there is a limited manufacture in all the articles mentioned under this item, I hope the British preferential rate will be slightly reduced. It is purely a revenue item, and we couldeasily make the rates in sub-item B 20 per cent., 30 per cent., and 45 per cent.",31
113,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,Richmoud-^Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.49] - I am prepared to accept a somewhat lower rate Â©f duty on watches and chronometers.,31
114,Sir ROBERT BEST,NATURALIZATION,"Plac e watches in sub-item B. . Mr MASSYGREENE - I cannot do that. J am prepared to make watches 10 per cent., 2.0 per cent., and 30 per cent. I move That the following words be added to subitem (A):-""And on and after 30th J.une, 1921(A) (1) Clocks, n.e.i.; time registers, and detectors; opera, field, and marine glasses; pedometers; pocket counters, and the like, ad val., British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 45 per cent.

115,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Dampier). [3.51] I must enter my protest against this action by the Minister (Mr Greene). Watches can only be classed as a luxury, and should, therefore, bear their fair proportion of duty, though I should not object if there were some slight-concession made in the matter of British preference. Up to the present we have been placing heavy imposts on all the articles which are required by those people who are developing this country, and yet we find a proposal of this kind when it is a matter of a toy, or something that any one might, reasonably ,do without.",31
116,Sir ROBERT BEST,NATURALIZATION,Is a watch a luxury?,31
117,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Surely any person who requires a watch is able to afford one, though, under this Tariff, a farmer might find some difficulty in doing so.  the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) in protesting against this proposal by the: Minister (Mr Greene). It is remarkable that the honourable 'gentleman should so readily assent to a. request of this kind, when primary producers, who are creating that wealth which keeps every class of industry going, and have to compete with black labour elsewhere, are denied any advantage. It has been truly said that the country can live without the cities, but that the cities cannot live without the country, and the Government have been blamed by the press for its centralizing policy; but on an itom of this kind, which does not advance the national development one bit, the Minister is prepared to reduce the duties by over 100 per cent. I fear for the future of Australia when we see such unsympathetic consideration extended to those who do not deserve it.",31
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.54] - I am not at all surprised at the^arguments advanced by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member  is impossible for those gentlemen to understand the difference between a revenue duty and a protective duty. It is that difference which explains why in onecase, in - a matter which is comparatively insignificant, I am prepared to accept a suggestion of the kind referred to, while, in another case, I do not do so - because there are involved protective duties for the establishment of industries here. I presume the people in the country, in common with the people of the cities, will get whatever advantage accrues from mis proposed reduction in the duty.",31
119,Mr FOLEY,NATURALIZATION,"Kalgoorlie) [3.55] - It would be interesting to know why the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), suggested that watches should be removed from sub-item A to sub-item ,B, for he must have good and sufficient reasons for so doing. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) now seems inclined to do what is the fair thing in regard to the Tariff, --but I should like to know whether this proposed reduction of duty will result in the purchaser and. the user of watches obtaining any benefit. There must be some reason for the proposed reduction, and if I were informed in regard to it, I might employ it in my efforts to induce the Minister to reduce other duties.

This is to make it quite clear that the duty Comcovers the Complete machine. Amendment agreed to. . . 32 Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister 8 for Trade and Customs) [4 4 ] - I now desire to - move an amendment, the effect of 24 which will be to take films for home kinematographs from their present poe-ition in AYES. paragraph 2 of sub-item c, and place them where they will be subject to a lower rate. These home kinematographs are very largely used in schools, and films which are educational arc not dutiable. The ouly films which are dutiable are those which .are of Australian subjects; for example, depictive of an Australian in dustry. Those would be dutiable, even though they were educational. If a fihn is of an Australian subject it is regarded 'as 'one which ought tb have been photographed in Australia by Australians, and made here also by Australians. Films which are dutiable comNOES. prise dramatic films and, I repeat, film3 of Australian subjects - But it has been represented to me by those who are in terested in using the home kinematograph that among a series of pictures shown to children for educational purposes there are generally a few-devoted to amusement. We propose to' permit .them to be brought in at a lower rate of duty. There is a further amendment which I shall propose also to section 2 of sub-item c. The effect of this will 'be that the British preferential rate will apply only to films which have been taken in Great B r it a in ; that is to say, the picture itself must have been made in Great Britain . My Department has experienced considerable trouble per with firms claiming the British preferential rate on films actually produced and n.e.i., made in America, but duplicates of which have been printed in Great Britain . We redo not desire to grant British preference Austrain such 'Circumstances. I ask the Comfoot, mittee to consent to a proviso which will have the effect of giving the preferential rates on films, the originals of which have been actually made in Great Britain . I That the item he further amended by adding the following to sub-item (c) :- "" And on and added to subafter-30th June, 1921(c) (1) Sensitized films, and films n.e.i., British, free; intermediate, free; general, free. (2) Exposed or developed films representing dramatic or Australian subjects(a) Suitable for use only with (6) Other, per lineal foot, Provided that any such films printed from a negative which was not the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom shall not be entitled to entry at the rate of the British preferential Tariff under this sub-item.""",32
121,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"Dalley) [ 4 . 9 ] - I suggest that the Minister (Mr Greene) move liia amendment in two sections, so as to keep separate all relation to films for home kinematographic purposes. I have .no objection to the proposals in the latter regard; but, with respect to films for ordinary show purposes, I have an i m portant suggestion to offer.",33
122,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,Do I understand that the honourable member is ^prepared to agree to my amendment down to aud in cluding paragraph o of sub-section 2?,33
123,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,That is so.,33
124,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NATURALIZATION," The desire of the Committee will be met, I 'understand, if I state the Minister's amendment in two sections. I therefore put first the following:That the item be further amended by adding the following to sub-item (c):-""And on and after 30th June, 1921(0) (1) Sensitized films and films n.e.i., British, free; intermediate, free; general, free. (2) Exposed or developed .films representing dramatic or Australian subjectsAmendment agreed to.",33
125,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NATURALIZATION," I now put the remainder of the-Minister's amendment, as follows:*' (6) Other, per lineal foot, British, Id.; intermediate, l i d . ; general, l i d . Provided that any such films printed from a negative which was not the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom shall not be entitled to entry at the rate of the British preferential Tariff under this sub-item.""",33
126,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"Dalley) suggest that the Minister agree to make the rates of duty ad valorem, or to impose a fixed or ad valorem duty, whichever rate is the higher. home kinematographs, per Mr MASSYGREENE - I have considered the lineal foot, British, i d . ; matter very carefully, but the honourable intermediate, i d . ; general, member's proposal is impracticable. I id. cannot agree to impose an ad valorem British, Id.; intermediate, duty. l i d . ; general, l i d . Mr MAHONY - I am astonished at the attitude of the Minister. Practically the whole of the production of pictures, so far as the Australian public is concerned, is carried on in the United States of America. There are numbers of famous picture stars, among whom I may mention, as an example, Charlie Chaplin. Against his ability I say nothing, but I do complain that this artist is drawing large sums of money out of this country, and is not paying one penny of taxation to the Commonwealth. When theatrical artists come to Australia,-and some of the finest in the world do come herethey are immediately pounced upon by the. Treasury, and compelled to pay in come tax upon their earnings in the Commonwealth. ""The "" m o v i e "" stars in America, according to the statements of leading men in the picture-show business, practically dictate the terms upon which their pictures are to be exhibited in Australia. If only for the purpose of making men who are earning large incomes out of the Australian people pay their share towards the revenue of the country, the Minister (Mr Greene) should agree to make the duty ad valorem. The fixed duty he has proposed is utterly ridiculous.""",33
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NATURALIZATION,"It would be a good thing if a lot of the pictures were nob allowed to come in.at all. (a) Suitable for use only Mr MAHONY - No doubt, there are with home kinemato- some pictures which should be excluded; graphs, per lineal foot, but there are others which are of great British, i d . ; intermediate, i d . ; general, benefit to the community. It has been id."" stated that the importers of films estimate their value at about 4d. or 5d. per foot. It is upon that estimate that this duty is based, and an examination shows how hypocritical such a valuation is. Some pictures have an enormous value on account of their capacity to attract the public and earn large sums of money. The value per foot of the film is no indication of the value of the picture. The fairest way would be to impose an ad valorem duty. Pictures in which the star is [4.13] - I Charlie Chaplin are worth many thousands of pounds. It is ridiculous to value a, picture in which, he or Mary Pickford figures at only 5d. per lineal foot. When those who control the picture in dustry in Australia complain of the enormous percentage of duty we are imposing in collecting l ^ d . per foot on films that they value at 4d. or 5d. per foot, they are throwing dust in the eyes of the Government. I cannot see why the Minister should object to adding to this sub-item a certain duty ad valorem, and collect either that or the fixed duty, whichever is the higher.",33
128,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Would - it not be better to encourage the importation of the best pictures, and keep the others out?. The tendency of the ad valorem duty would to prevent the better pictures from com-, ing here.",34
129,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"Not at all. value of a picture depends entirely upon its capacity to. attract the people, and those which. have a big drawing power should not be allowed in atj-jthe same ridivalorem oulousrate of duty as is a picture for which an intelligent person would not pay 2Jtd. It has been said that anybody ing to suggest that picture films should I did not .proceed with it . bear an increased duty would beendeaplace vouring to put an additional burden on learn, are purchased outright. the workers and their children. I conare sider that the amusement 'tax on all charges of admission up to Is. should remitted immediately. A ny - revenue lost in that way could be recovered by ad valorem d u t y on films.",34
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,T have already given this matter my careful consideration.,34
131,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"Does the Minister the consider that l $ d , per foot is a fair duty Has he made inquiries .as to the actual ries of artists, cost of staging, &c. value of pictures of Mary Pickford. Charlie Chaplin, Douglas 'Fairbanks, and Fatty ArbucklÂ©, and what showmen i Australia are called upon to .pay for cents to; four' cents per foot. them ? I am not prepared to allow pic-, ture artists thousands of .miles away to draw a huge revenue..from the people of this country, and ,not pay one penny i taxation. We. should consider also the building up of the moving picture business in Australia. Mr John W . Hicks, Commonwealth. managing director of Paramount Picmethod tures is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 27th May last, as having saidUp to the end of 1919, the main piefcuri business was in the control of five stars were in n position to compel the producers pay them any fee they demanded. We are practically at the mercy of the "" m o v i e "" stars in America. In this morning's paper, Mr Hicks is reported to have saidThe firm - hoped to establish picture studios here, but unless exhibitor and producer were to work in unison, pictures could not be profitably produced. Also many changes would have'to be'made. Hitherto about five persons dominated the' moving picture business. He said that the whole picture business was controlled.by two or - three .individuals. What he seeks to establish in Australia is not so much a starartist as a star picture, in which the story and not the artist is-the main feature. I would like the Minister to explain to the Combe mitteewhy he insists on retaining the duty . in its present tmsatisf actory - form. ' Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister The for Trade and Customs) [4.26] - I have gone carefully into ""the question as to whether it is possible to impose an ad duty on these films. The possibility of getting extra revenue out of the picture .show business occurred to .my mind, darand I shall explain to the Committee why In the first none of these films, so far as I can Theresome for which certain definite.'sums are paid, but other arrangements are enbe tered into which make it almost impossible to arrive at the ad valorem duty an which should be paid on any of the films. There are three, distinct ways in which payment for films is made iby the picture, show proprietors in Australia. Firstly, 'brie film'is invoiced .at practically cost of production of the film itself, ? not the picture, and exclusive of the salaIn addition to this, however, certain royalties are charged in the form of a lump n sum, which"" usually equals from three In the second method the.film is invoiced at cost, and in addition to this a. percentage of the gross takings for the use of the 'film n in .Australia is remitted to America. The amount so remitted depends upon the success of .the film as an attraction in the This is .the usual when the purchaser in Australia is a branch hcuse of an American company, the percentage remitted to America being usually . about 65 per cent. The third, method is that, in the case of some who companies, the parent houses of which are to in America, the-film is invoiced. at cost, and all profits are remitted to the parent house. It'is. practically impossible to arrive at the ad valorem duty of films when the business, is handled in those ways.",34
132,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,What percentage on the value does the Minister regard these duties as representing?,35
133,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,A duty of ' l foot on the value of the film is not very high. I have no figures which would enable meto say what percentage the duty .represents on the value of the picture.,35
134,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"I u what difficulties will the Department be placed if we retain the fixed duty, and add "" o r ad. val., British, 10 per cent.; intermediate, per cent.; and general, 20 per cent.; whichever is the higher.""",35
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Will the honourable strikes member explain to me how, having regard to the arrangements under which films are imported, it is possible for me to rive at an ad valorem duty.",35
136,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,You could soon make the film importers declare the values.,35
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"That would be eilowed tremely difficult. I have gone into this matter' with my officers, and I am perfar fectly satisfied that the administrative difficulties in collecting-'an hd valorem duty on films axe almost insuperable.",35
138,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"No harm would be done by 'inserting an alternative valorem duty, which need not be collected if it is found to be impracticable. Mr MASSYGREENE; - The difficulty is that the lawcompels us to ascertain whether the fixed duty or the ad valorem duty the greater, and my officers inform that it 19 practically impossible to at the value-of the great majority of films.",35
139,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,I think the Customs offievidence - cers are much abler than the Minister's remark suggests'.,35
140,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"After some experience of the-administration of the Customs partment, and knowing the difficulties asChaplin film and a scenic film sociated with valuations of this kind, I agree with them that the - obstacles to the collection of an ad valorem duty are most insuperable.",35
141,Dr MALONEY,NATURALIZATION,"Melbourne) [4.33] I recognise the difficulty which confronts the Minister (Mr Greene), but it appears to me that because of obstacles created the firms controlling the-picture shows America they are enabled to escape taxation. If in respect of other commodiAmerican ties the importers made the assessment of duty difficult, we would not be justified in wiping out the duty. I suggest to the Minister that every film imported into Australia should be submitted to public auction at the Customs House. In this way the value of a star picture would be ^ d . per ascertained immediately.",35
142,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,-How - can we submit to auction the Australian rights of production which certain people have bought ?,35
143,Dr MALONEY,NATURALIZATION,"If at auction the films realized a greater price than had been placed on them by the importers, 15 there should be no cause for complaint. The Minister's statement regarding the difficulties of collecting ad valorem duties to the root of all Customs taxation. If the importers can make the valuations difficult they escape with the payment of arsmall duties. The picture show proprietors and all amusement vendors have been mulct very unfairly by the amusement tax. Picture-show promoters have folthe lead of all profiteers, and have raised their prices very considerably. So as I know, there is only one man in Australia who deserves praise in regard to the ch/irges for admission to his theatres. I refer to Sir Benjamin Puller, who allowed the chilad dren of Melbourne and Sydney to see a pantomime for 6d. No other theatrical entrepreneur has displayed such thoughtfulness for .the little ones of the community, and I-thank him for it. Pictureis show proprietors and others have in me many cases doubled their charges of adarrive mission. Would it not be possible for the the Minister so to word this item as to leave it to the Tariff Board to call expert in addition to that of his own officers, in order to determine what should be the basis' of value. Every boy in the street knows that there is a difDeference between the value of a Charlie ",35
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,Yesj . but on& Charlie alChaplin film may be worth far more than another.,35
145,Dr MALONEY,NATURALIZATION,"I know that the Minister is with us in the desire to make these large Combines pay a little more by Every picture-show proprietor in Ausin tralia is bound by agreement to show just American pictures. Many of the pictures are both instructive and refreshing; but the point I wish to make is that picture-show proprietors are compelled, under an agreement extending, I believe, either to the end of this year or to the middle of next year, to screen a certain number of American pictures. That is an advantage which the film producers in the United States gained during the war, and they seek to retain it. I object to the pettifogging policy under which visiting artists are compelled to pay income tax on their earnings while here. My first knowledge of such a policy was gained some twenty years ago, on the occasion of a visit that I paid to India.",35
146,Mr MARR,NATURALIZATION,Eve n our soldiers and nurses were required to pay income tax in respect of the time they spent in passing through India to the Front.,36
147,Dr MAXONEY,NATURALIZATION,"I am sorry that Australia has followed so bad an. example We have an opportunity to gain ten times as much as great artists would pay the Treasury in respect of income tax during their stay here. I recognise that there is some difficulty in carrying out what we propose; but I am satisfied that any obstacle put in the way of the Customs .Department by rich companies, Combines, or artists, could ultimately he Â©vercome. If a Government official, on the arrival of films from overseas, were to announce his intention or submitting them to public auction, every pictureshow proprietor would be represented at the sale, and we would be able quickly to arrive at the value for Customs purposes.",36
148,Mr RILEY,NATURALIZATION,"The Minister says that the Department cannot value a film, but they have to be valued for Customs purposes when they are brought in here.",36
149,Dr MALONEY,NATURALIZATION,"I know that. The Minister said there were three difficulties in the way, and in listening to him I was reminded of the device to which a Japanese firm resorted at a time when the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) was the Victorian Minister for Trade and Customs. The firm sent out with its goods three invoices, one to submit to the Customs House authorities, one to show the importers' customers, and a third setting out the actual cost to the importer. The honourable gentleman came down very heavily on that firm, but its device was certainly most amusing. We are told that films are invoiced at the actual cost of producing them, exclusive of the fees paid to artists, the cost of stage fittings, and so on. If that be so, we might get at the value by allowing, say, 2d. a foot for the-celluloid, plus so much a foot for printing. If the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) intends to move an amendment, I shall frofce for it .",36
150,Mr MAHONY,NATURALIZATION,"I do not desire to do that. - Dr MALONEY - I know that, and perhaps the difficulty might be overcome by the Minister promising, in the event of the item being passed as it stands, to consult with his officers, and, if necessary, to recommit it .",36
151,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"We have given the matter a great deal of consideration. - Dr MALONEY - It may still be possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the problem. The Minister may be prepared to promise that, if we pass the item as it, stands, he will recommit it later on if he can obtain further information that will enable him to arrive at a proper basis of value. If he assures us later on that, as the result of further inquiry, he is still unable to get over the difficulty, we shall have to accept the situation for the time being.",36
152,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,"Darling) [4.42] - I am extremely disappointed that the Minister (Mr Greene), in the preparation of this schedule, has accepted the system of levying Customs duties on films which the film manufacturers and importers have foisted on the country. It is obviously not only inadequate, but paltry. A duty of l f d . per foot imposed in respect of a big film might yield a revenue of something like Â£20, whereas that film, before it had been finished with in Australia, would probably be worth Â£ 2 or Â£ 3 per foot to the importer. One frequently hears of a film worth from Â£2,000 to Â£5,000, and for the right to screen it for one evening only a picture show proprietor may pay Â£5 or more.",36
153,Mr LISTER,NATURALIZATION,As much as Â£50 is charged in the case of a first release.,36
154,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,No doubt.,36
155,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NATURALIZATION,"The Minister (Mr Greene) says that it is impossible to impose an ad - valorem duty. That being 30, why not increase the rate of duty per foot?",36
156,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,"I am not prepared to .accept without a.fight the system of taxation which the American film producers have foisted on the Department. We know the value both of films and of artists coming to this country. When Sir Harry Lauder, for instance, comes to Australia-, we know months before he reaches here what his value from the point of view of the Income Tax Department is. His value is determined by the people who bring him here, and as soon as he arrives the Taxation Department assesses him accordingly, and he pays income tax. If it is possible to. assess the value of an artist for income tax purposes, surely it is possible to assess the value of a film, a musical instrument, or any other means of amusement brought here. It seems to me to be a sinister fact that the manufacturers abroad send out films accompanied by absolutely false descriptions as to their cost.",37
157,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,They do not do that.,37
158,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,"At any rate, they do not set out the truth-the y do not set out what the film has cost in respect of the artists engaged in'its production, the scenic effects, and so forth.",37
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"The trouble is that practically in every case they refuse to sell a film straight out at its exhibition value as a film. They sell it for what it costs as a film, and on top of that they charge certain allowances, royalties, profits, or ever it may be. That is the way in which they work. ,",37
160,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,"The value of a film is determined in - the way the Minister has indicated. It is known to the exporter in America, and to the importer ""here, long before a film arrives in this country. We ought to be able to ascertain the value at which the negatives of films are insured in America. However, it should not be impossible for us to impose a heavy rate of duty at so much per lineal foot, although it would mean charging the same rate for high-grade and low grade films.",37
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,That is the difficulty.,37
162,Mr BLAKELEY,NATURALIZATION,"Seventy-fiv e per cent, of the pictures imported intoAustralia are rubbish; they merely depict . [384] bedroom scenes, or custard throwing, or .deal with sex problems; but the balance are educational or high-class matter. The trouble, is that, if a duty of lÂ£d. per foot is charged on high-grade films, people will ask why the. same rate should be imposed on low-grade films. I object to the introduction of these low-grade films. I have no objection to the importation of high-grade films of educational value or depicting high-class subjects, so long as the producers in America are not evading our taxation. Pictures have been produced in Australia under great difficulties. The "" Sentimental Bloke "" film has been distributed throughout Europe and America at fairly high rates. The Snowy Baker cowboy pictures have not the value of the "" Sentimental Bloke "" picture, but they have been produced in Australia mostly. by - Australian artists and under Australian conditions; that is to .say, Australian wages have been paid, sometimes under arbitration awards. Snowy Baker went to America and copied the tricks of the American cowboy, transplanted them to the Australian bush, and retaliated upon America by exhibiting his films there. I believe that we ought to be able to build up in Australia a fairly large film industry. Any pastoral, mining, or other company engaged in some - activity 'in Australia, whose head office , is in London, is obliged to pay taxation on the money earned by it in the Commonwealth, ..yetAmerican firms, who what- may make Â£50;000 or Â£100,000 out of a set of films distributed in Australia, are not taxed upon that amount. While we are endeavouring to protect an Australian industry, we ought also to take steps to insure that these people pay us an adequate share of the earnings derived in Australia. We are told that it.is impossible to do this by means of an ad valorem duty. I believe that the American picture producers have instituted a system of distribution of their films which prevents the Commonwealth Customs Department from ascertaining what their business is, so that, whether the picture be educational or merely depicting custard throwing, the rate of duty . collectable by us cannot be other than a fixed rate at so much per lineal foot of film. . But it is a shame that the rate shoula not exceed l^d. It ought to be; at least, 8u. per foot, which would h*ing'is - a revenue' of - from iS'5'0: to 'Â£350 'faiTly good film, but would - impost upon a 'high-class tfilm, 'worth - iib'ou't Â£2 'or Â£3 ""per foot ..

I .do not think the Minister ""has been - too - well advised on - this matter.

My suggestion, which I hope will be accepted, is that the duty be' 10 per cent, in each of the columns. Such a. duty would not, injure Great Britain, which, does not export goat-skins; except those obtained in the course of trade. When theprevious Tariff was under consideration goat-skins became a burning question, and I certainly think that a duty, ought to be imposed.

168,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond*-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5il9] - Goat skinspickled were removed from the dutiable' list because, since the duty was imposed, there has been a large development of the glace kidindustry. After careful investigation of the whole subject, I came to the conclusion that duty on pickled goat-skins would be detrimental to the development of the glace kid business, and, as the latter represented the more valuable side of this class-of industry, it was. decided' that"", under all' the circumstances, tihey should be free. Mr CAMERON* (Brisbane) [5=20]: Can the Minister (Mr Greene)- give particulars concerning importations of raw per cent'.. hides from New Zealand? Representations have been made to me from persons interested in Queensland that the number of hides brought in from that source are 1 rapidly increasing,, and' they are being,, and always have been, introduced free-. During the twelve montns ending 30th June,, 1920, 12,637 calf skins wereimported, compared with 5-7,893 during, the eleven months ending 3,1st. May,. 1921. The importations of hides, during the year ending 30th June,. 1920',. totalled 37,056,;, RUBBER. while-', for the following eleven months, the importations were 96,796. These figures reveal' a total increase for the latter period',, in respect of hides and. call skins combined, of 104)^996.. .Can the Minister account for that considerable inThese crease f I consider the Queensland! hide, industry is likely to be seriously affected 1 by the apparent probability of. dumping fromNewZealand. 1' undesstand that for sometime prior to thoseyears to which I have just referred, an embargo was placed, on the. importation of'New Zealand Md'es. ' , Mr .GREENE. (Richmond;-Minister for.Trade and Customs)i[5.23] - Ihav e no ; particulars for' the year 1920-21' concerning the specific countries from which hides were imported ;, but' in I9H8 -19 and T91'92'0'â there were large increases from New Zealand, although not materially above 1 1 the figures of pre--war. years..

I do not think the Departmental statistics differentiate concerning hides as between calf skins and bullock and cow skins. 'Mr ""FLEMING - There is a great difference, of course, between calf skins and other hides.",39
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"The Tariff discriminates between hides which are bullock hides and calf skins, in that the latter are not acknowledged as hides at all .",40

177,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,Thos e factors would not necessarily give accurate results.,40
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I should say that general appearance would be the chief factor. ' Generally, ah expert can tell whether a hide has been taken from a calf less than a year old or from an animal rather more than a year of age. We are also large* exporters of hides.

185,Mr BAYLEY,NATURALIZATION,Oxley) [ 5 . 3 3 ] - I notice that chamois leather is on the free list. Is the Minister (Mr Greene) prepared r to make a statement concerning his reaI cannot sons for the removal of duty?,40
186,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,We should not be afraid be of the importation of chamois leather in - fro m any part of the world.,40
187,Mr BAYLEY,NATURALIZATION,"The honourable member overlooks that the manufacture of this leather is a new Australian industry, and, as such, should be safeguarded. it has become firmly established I would say, "" Let them all come."" This is essentially an infant enterprise, and is in close association with the great pastoral industry. Numbers pf Australians have placed a great deal of capital in the manufacture of chamois leather.",41
188,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NATURALIZATION,Where ?,41
189,Mr BAYLEY,NATURALIZATION,"In several States. In South Sydney, for example, there are several factories, and I know of one in Queensland which is doing its best to place a first-class article on the market. It is, indeed, an excellent chamois, as honourable members will perceive by the sample which I hold in my hand. Although thousands of so-called chamois leathers are imported, the description is not accurate. "" Chamois"" is only a trade name. They are made almost entirely from sheepskins. The Australian manufacturers, however, are chiefly using lambskins; and I hope the industry will receive support by way of a substantial degree of protection. I suggest 20 per cent.",41
190,Mr RILEY,NATURALIZATION,"South Sydney) [5.35] I ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to look upon the manufacture of chamois leather as a new industry. I do not know why this article should be placed .on the free list, having regard to the fact that we have in Australia plenty of skins, and people who are prepared to put capital into the development of this industry.",41
191,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NATURALIZATION,What about 10 per cent.?,41
192,Mr RILEY,NATURALIZATION,"So long as the Minister will give some encouragement to the industry I shall be satisfied. Manufacturers, in my electorate, are turning out very good chamois leather.",41
193,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,Sha m chamois leather.,41
194,Mr RILEY,NATURALIZATION,"A sample of it is before the Committee. Chamois leather is daily coming into greater use. Motorcar owners use it for cleaning the enamel and fittings of their cars; and it is employed in the cleaning of silver ware and windows. There is a possibility of establishing a large industry for its manufacture, and I think we should give it some encouragement by means of the Tariff.",41
195,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,"Echuca) [5.37] - Does the Minister intend this item to refer to real chamois leather, or to this rubbish-this Once sham chamois leather-that is before the Committee ?",41
196,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,I do not suppose there is any real chamois leather imported. It is almost unknown now.,41
197,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,It can be obtaiued.,41
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,I think that chamois leather such as the sample the honourable member is holding is covered by this item.,41
199,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,"For some considerable time lambskins and sheepskins have been purchasable at from O^d. to Id . per lb., and if manufacturers who can get the sheepskins so cheaply cannot, without the aid of a duty, produce chamois leather in competition with foreigners who have to import the sheepskins, this country is in a bad way. This imitation chamois leather is a poor makeshift, aud after it has been used in water for a while will become hard. In twelve monthsenough of this kind of material could be turned out to meet the Australian requirements for the next twenty years. I have manufactured this stuff, and know something about it ; it is poor, at the best.",41
200,Mr BAYLEY,NATURALIZATION,"Oxley) [5.40] - I suggest that, as this is a new industry, the Minister (Mr Greene) might impose a deferred duty on chamois leather. Whilst a number of firms are actually engaged in making chamois leather today, others are only now doing the preparatory work, and I know that, in a number of instances, the machinery is only being installed at the present time. The statement by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , that he was not successful in the manu' facture of this article, is not proof that others will similarly fail. The sample before the Committee demonstrates that chamois leather can be made in Australia.",41
201,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,What is the price of it?,41
202,Mr BAYLEY,NATURALIZATION,"I do not know, but I do know that we can produce sufficient ir. Australia to supply local requirements. If , as the honourable member has said, pelts can be obtained at from Oid. to Id . per lb.., that is evidence that the demand for skins is not sufficient. If we give encouragement to the manufacture of chamois leather and similar industries; we shall not only assist, them directly, but will give a. meed, of: support to<the primary industry which-produces the skins.",41
203,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5-.42] - I did ; give some thought to the imposition, of a duty on chamois leather, but my difficulty was that at the time nobody was quite ready to manufacture it. I know of three, manufacturers who have imported, or are about to import, the special machinery required for this work. I suggest that a deferred duty will meet the requirements of the industry, and. I moveTfiafc the following, words be added to sub-item- (A) :- "" And on and after 1st' January,. 1.022, ad. val., British, 10 per cent.; intermediate, 15 per cent.; general,, 20",42
204,Mr BAYLEY,NATURALIZATION,That will do.,42
205,Mr HILL,NATURALIZATION,The Minister should make provision against the public being duped by having this sham chamois leather sold trralia' to them for the real thing.,42
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"T do not see cando that in respect of the locally produced article any moTe than with the imitationchamois that is imported from> abroad to - day.

Amendment agreed to.. Br. MALONEY (Melbourne) [5.45],. I U10V&That after sub-item, (C) (1) the following; word's be inserted :- "" And on and after 30th June, 1921, per square foot, British, 6d\; isttermediate, 7d.;; general, 8d."" Honourable membersare aware that there are different varieties of patent and enamelled leather, having different values-, and for that reason, it would be' preferable forth. toimpose an ad valorem duty. Some of theraw material used in this trade' taxed severely,, the duty on. colours being ' as high as, 30 per cent. The importations, of patent and enamelled leather in amounted, to 2,20.0,000 feet, and during the first nine months of 1920-21 to 2â400,0Q0 feet,, representing, on a conservative estimate,- about 80,000 hides. I sufficient duty, were imposed, those would be purchased in Australia, and. think we all would prefer to export hidesin manufactured form rather thaw nv the raw state. The duty in 1908-1T was 2d., and in' 1914, British, 2d.; genewe. ral, 2Â£d. Onlyabout 50 per: cent, of the employees who. were engaged in the industry last year are at work today,. Any, honourable member who knows of the splendid material produced by, local manufao tureis must support an' increase in this, duty.. I . would, prefer, that the, duty should he ad' valbvem*,, for, whilst I recognised the-, difficulty in arriving at the. values of picture films for duty purposes, no such, difficulty presents itself, in connection with leather. I desire to explain that I am moving this amendment on behalf of the honourable' member, for Bourke- (Mr Anstey). Mr Fenton' (Ma-ribyrnong)' [5.49] We may reasonably look forward to those 1 honourable members, who are interested in, per cent."" the market for hides to help us in. increasing the duty on. this leather: I think I am safe iir saying: that, some years ago there-was oii'ly one firmi inn Aus--manufacturing this,' class, of leather;, whereas today quite a number, are enhow we gaged in its production..",42
207,Mr FLEMING,NATURALIZATION,"Can the. honourable) in connexionmember say how many?' Mr FEN'TO'N - I think there', are' or five in ffhis. State^ and' that patent' and enamelled leather'is'also-being maunr9 1 of f actured in other States. The process of. promanufacture, of this class> of leather for many years-remained a secret known only, to a few, but aVictorian' firm imported) from Great Britain a number of men,, ana pa-id' - them very high wages, toi inaugurate the industry herei. At the outset, there was. a considerable prejudice; against the; local article,, but: gradually it won its' way; and today the Victoriani Railway Department practically obtains from local manufacturers all its supplies; for the trimming of carriages audi so M i \ RrcTTARD FOSTER-Thfi i Victoriam isi Railway Department does not use the local article for its best class of work:. Mr FENTONi - I think the honourable l;920i member will find, that it does.. - Mr CoRSERi - It is alsoi used for' cans. Mr Fenton. - That , is: so.. In the, f a circumstances, I . fail' to understand why hides we should indulge in these exceptional I importations. We produce thousandsofr our hides per annum;' and, aa the Minister (Mr Greene) has stated, we annually export something-like 600,000Seeing that can manufacture all classes'of leathers) - here, it :seems to me an (economic waste that we should send our .hides .thousands of .miles - overseas. !to ;be turned into the manufactured article and brought back again. In .respect of the last year .for - which the records are available, 2,400,000 ffeet 'of patent and enamelled leather came into Aaistra'Ma. That was under the - present Tariff. WIe know what is going on 'today in America and - Great Britain, and owing to the inadequacy of the Tariff 1 fear that, unless *we make a very considerable increase, there will be an enormous development in these importations. 'The industry is established, so far as efficiency is concerned,; but the present duties are not sufficient to protect it against the - competition with which it will be confronted within the next twelve months. I would remind honourable members of the Country party that we are dealing here - with something that is produced - from one of the raw materials , - of the farm. The making of these patent and enamelled leathers, in the first place, was a close secret. Some thirty years ago, I think, only one ""man in Victoria knew how to - produce them. He, in turn,, handed over the secret to his son; but today quite a number of Australians are familiar with .the process, and are engaged in this industry. The Victorian firm to which I have just referred, on the death of one of its experts, obtained from '""New South Wales an expert who inew the secret, and who ultimately became a member .of the firm. An industry that is so important and jiecessary to (Australia, and which uses .up so much of one of the raw materials of the farm; ought .to be encouraged. Mr RICHARD .FOSTER -(-Wakefield!) '[-6:56""] - This sub-item, no 'doubt, relates to a growing industry.; but the 'honourable member for .TSLarihyrnong -(. Mr .""Fenton) has rather overstated (the position in raying that the Victorian Railway Department is using locally-manufactur.ed patent .leathers for its best class of trinuning work. 'That ""is not a fact, mor is it - a fact that the production of this .class of leather has .reached a high state - of efficiency in Australia. The industry is certainly important, and should <con.tinuertotdevelop; 'but ithe honourable mem-, 'bcr for Maribyrnong [knows very well - that it is impossible ""within a few years to reach the degree of perfection that obtains where the industry has been carried on .for, /perhaps; a /hundred years. Aua.tralian conditions are favourable - to the manufacture of tihese classes of leathers; - we lack 'Â©nly experience. The industry is well worth encouraging, but it would he unreasonable to double the present duties. Mr.'GREENE '(Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) '[6.0] - I have' been looking into this matter for some - time. It 'is extremely difficult to balance these dutieSj because leathers become the raw material of other industries, and the duties relating to .those industries must also be considered. ' 'We Jiave made a (Strenuous effort to try to draw them together, 'but whether we Trave - succeeded or ..not .1 cannot .say. The industry of producing patent or .enamelled leather has imade very considerable strides in Australia, .and idid .so particularly during - the war period. We have here a numiber of manufacturers, and I have seen samples lof their leathers - which I think - mould - stand almost .any test - A patent leather that can he (bent and pressed as hard as tone pleases without cracking is a fairly igood article. Mr .RIOHJAIED EOSTER - The local patent leathers - will - crack when they 'have been (exposed for a time to the weather.",42
208,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,I tested a sample 'by - leaving fa out of 'doors for a week. At - the end of that period 1 ifound it was almost as good as when I - first tried it .,43
209,Mr TEEMING,NATURALIZATION,"What was the weather like <at the time? . Mr GREE-NE - It was - bright, sunny weather, but aio irain fell - during the week. The sample I tested in this way was subjected ito the - dews of night as well as to the direct rays of ' the sun during the day. That, I think, was a fairly .good test. The value of ,the material turned out in Victoria last year- I have not the figures for â¬he Test of Australia-wa s Â£400,000! There can be no question, therefore, that the industry is growing and has Teached the stage at which it can pretty well provide for the greater jpart of Australia's requirements. Before the - war dt could not - do so. 5TJp to that time we produced only about 10 per cent, xtf ;our - reqiuirements, 'whereas today., although ino't producing the whole of our .requirements, we are turning - out is - very .much greater .proportion than before.",43
210,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,And that has been accomplished under a lower duty.,44
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"But under war conditions. I would stress the point that the industry developed very materially during the war period, owing to the fact that we could not get supplies from other countries.",44
212,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,Our export trade in other leathers has enormously expanded.,44
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"But we are dealing now only with patent .and enamelled leathers. The old duty of 2^d. per square foot was equal to only 10 per cent, on the prices then ruling. 'The duty now works out at'about 17 per cent, on the values for 1918-19. In respect of some classes it is slightly more, and in regard to others slightly less. Honourable members are aware that there are some grades which are more expensive than others. After going into the matter carefully, I am' inclined to think that the position would be met by making the fixed duty per square* foot-British , 3d.; intermediate, 4d.; and general, 5d. That, I think, will be sufficient protection on the lower grades of leather, and we should provide alternatively for ad vcdorem duties of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. That, I understand, will meet with the general acceptance of the trade, and I think it will meet the position. . Mr FLEMING - Sho p girls will have to forgo their patent leather shoes if the duties are so increased.",44
214,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I do not think these increased duties would make the slightest difference to the present prices of patent leather shoes. I shall also propose an alteration in regard to glace kid, suggesting a reduction in the ad valorem duty with a fixed rate to deal with lower grades.",44
215,Dr MALONEY,NATURALIZATION,"I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Ur. LISTER (Corio) [6.11] - I trust the honourable member's amendment will not be withdrawn.. I hope that he will add to it by providing alternatively for ad valorem rates of 30 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent.",44
216,Dr MALONEY,NATURALIZATION,I am quite willing to do so..,44
217,Mr LISTER,NATURALIZATION,"There are many people in my electorate who cannot find work as u result of the conditions appertaining to this industry. I have a few facts to place before the Committee in regard to patent aud enamelled leathers. In 1914-15 this industry employed 90 bauds, who produced a little over 1,000,000 feet of patent and enamelled leathers, and oarued in wages, roughly, Â£15,000. In 1919-20 the industry employed 340 hands, who produced over 3,500,000 feet of these leathers, and earned in wages Â£60,000. The figures show an increase of over 300 per cent. The fact that British journals are complaining very bitterly that Germany is endeavouring to wipe out Great Britain's trade in these leathers, and that America is imposing a special duty on patent and enamelled leathers, should cause us-to open our eyes as to what may happen here unless, the industry is accorded further protection. In reply to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), who has, said that the locally-manufactured leathers are riot being used extensively by the State Governments, let me point out that these leathers are used almost exclusively on the South Australian railways, and are used extensively by the Railway Departments of every State. The leather trimmings in Australia House are of Australian manufacture. If we can afford to advertise our own work in that magnificent structure at the seat of the Empire, we have no occasion to doubt our ability to turn out afirst-classarticle here. I ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to reconsider his proposal, and accede to the request of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) by making the fixed duties 6d., 7d., aud Sd-, or ad valorem 30 per cent., 35 per cent., 40 per cent., which ever rate returns the higher duty. Amendment by (Dr MALONEY) amended, by leave, to read as follows.: That the item be further amended by adding the following to sub-item (c) (1):-""And on and after 30th June, 1021, per square foot, British, 6d.; intermediate, 7d.; general, Sd.; or ad val., British, 30 per cent.; intermediate, 35 per cent.; general,'40 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty.""",44
218,Mr ANSTEY,NATURALIZATION,"Bourke) [6.14] - The Minister (Mr Greene) has made an effort to meet the wishes of honourable members, but has not gone far enough. Possibly he might agree to increase the general rate to 7d. The increased output referred to by the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) was followed by a severe slump. At the same time importations from America have increased. The men - who were conducting our industry during the war could have sold their products in foreign markets at 2s. 6d. per foot more than they were getting locally : but, as they did not take advantage of the opportunity to do so, they are now entitled to every consideration from us. Last year hides for motor leather were quoted in the American market at 25s. per lb. Their price is now 6d. per lb. Hides for boot uppers were quoted last year in the Chicago market at Is. 6d. per l b . ; they are now 5d. per lb. Hides for patent and enamelled leather were quoted at 25d. per lb.; they are now 6d. per lb. As a matter of fact, the value of hides today is practically 40 per cent, lower than it was before the war. Possibly the Minister has gone as far as he can in regard to the ad valorem rates, and the fixed British and intermediate rates; but I ask him to increase the general rate to 7d.",44

(honourable member for Henty (Mr have Francis) makes a definite charge against any individual, it will be'the duty .Leader of the House to bring the matter iunder the notice .of the 'Deputy Speaker, and he can .take action. Sir ROBERT BEST : - It would be better to .let it . drop.",47
236,Mr CHARLTON,NATURALIZATION,"That is m y opinion, unless the honourable .member for Henty - desires to make a - specifici charge. Mr - CONSIDINE -4 L enter my protest agaiust the course of action contemplated by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph - of Barrier I Cook).",47
237,Mr MATHEWS,NATURALIZATION,":The offending undimet vidual .belongs - to the honourable menfber'a Mr ' CONSIDINE : - If he. did :he woufcf .make threats; l ie would put them into, sion should be punished for, if .nothing: else, his stupidity,- (because the .Acting Prime Minister has intimated - that if any displayed our pictures throughout, for the purpose--of .adver.us and - our vote, it would not m at ter iso long as they had not threatened usn - beforehand. Ehe offence of 'the individual .of whom .complaint lhas .been made seems to consist of - threatening the honourable honormember for Henty (Mr Francis), and some other honourable member unnamed, their vote in a certain - way would .be can advertised - per medium iof 'the picture shows in their electorate. I fail to - see the - difference between making the fact known through :the Age or - the Argus, and doing the same ""thing through a pic(show. The one method is just as reputable as 'the other, and has the - same effect, unless the - objection of honourable members'be to-seeing-their own photographs on the - screen - It is proposed to - take the word of one honourable .member unagainst ..some individual.. Sir JOSEPH . COOK - I did .not say that .",47
238,Mr GONSIDINE,NATURALIZATION,"I - am not in favour has of taking the word of .any honourable member .against .another person without that in other iperson having a chance to be heard. It is not in accordance with my views of me, justice to sentence a man without hearing",47
239,Sir ROBERT BEST,NATURALIZATION,No name has V-een,47
240,Mr CONSIDINE,NATURALIZATION,"But it is propcJsed to leave the matter to the Deputy Speaker. If the (honourable member for Henty can complain to the Speaker .against'some in If the dividual who frequents the House, and him forbidden the precincts, I , too. am entitled to adopt the same secret of the methods of getting somebody who is objectionable to me debarred from ithe precincts. It might after all have been only a misunderstanding.",47
241,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NATURALIZATION,"It m i g ht have been an invitation, and not a threat.",47
242,Mr CONSIDINE,NATURALIZATION,O r an offer to give the honourable member a free advertisement is'11 'over his electorate. If any pictureHshow proprietor offers to screen my (photograph throughout the electorate - shall noticome to'the House Ito complain about 'the matter.,47
243,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"We have to be exceedingly careful that nothing in , the nature of intimidation shall take place, particularly in regard to such a question as that which is now before the Committee. If ""there has been anything of the kind in this case, then the method of dealing with it , which the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) has suggested, is certainly the proper one to pursue, subject, of course, to inquiry and report. I do, not know what actually occurred, as I was not present when the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) made his statement; but during the dinner adjournment I heard a good deal of talk about the matter, and it seemed to me that a mountain was being made out of a moleh ill . I thought that honourable members were merely laughing at the suggestion which had been made. In the course of this discussion, hqwever, a statement has been made which reflects upon newspaper men generally. We have a number of gentlemen of the press who attend here regularly, and the statement to which I refer might reflect upon them as well as upon the individual who is said to have uttered this threat. Such a reflection propose upon newspaper men generally would be most unfair. Although they may sometimes publish statements of which we do not approve, we all realise that as a rule they are exceedingly fair. If the matter went as far as has been stated, it is the duty of the honourable member concerned to make his report, and for the House to have it investigated by Mr . - Deputy Speaker, who, in turn, would report to the House ",48
244,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NATURALIZATION, Order ! There is nothing before the Chair.,48
245,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NATURALIZATION,There has been enough to allow some honourable members to speak about this alleged intimidation. Item agreed to. Item 327 (Slipper forms).,48
246,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NATURALIZATION,"As a matter privilege, I desire, sir, to direct your tention', and I hope, through you, the atinformed tention of the Deputy Speaker, to the fact that honourable members when coming into fully 600 hands. this chamber are continually impeded by have 1-een growing, and last visitors who have no right to obtain mission to the immediately adjoining corridors. If no trouble through this practice, I can only say that it is likely to lead to trouble in moments of excitement, and that honourable members ought not to be subjected to the ordeal of meeting their political enemies' when leaving the chamber immediately after a division has been taken. It e m agreed to. Item 328- ' Goloshes, rubber sand boots and shoes, and plimsolls, ad val., British, 25 per cent., intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.",48
247,Mr MATHEWS,NATURALIZATION,"Melbourne Ports) [8.20] - Representation s have been made to the Minister (Mr Greene) in regard to this item and the next. I should like to know whether he has considered them, and whether he can grant any relict to the manufacturers affected by this item who desire a higher duty.",48
248,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond-Minister for T r a d e and Customs) [8.22] - I have gone carefully into this matter. A large number of very poor quality rubber shoes come into Australia at such values that ad valorem duties do not afford sufficient protection against them, especially when they are imported from cheap labour countries. I do not to raise the ad valorem rates, which, I think, are ample in respect of the better class of rubber shoes, but I will move'a fixed duty of so much per pair which will provide adequate protection against the poorer classes of canvas rubber shoes"". I move That the item be amended by adding the following - - "" And on and after 30th June, 1921, per pair, British, Is. 6d.; intermediate, Is. 9d.; general, 2s.; or, ad val., British. 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; generâ¢! , 35 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher dirty."" This fixed rate will put a stop to the importation of a lot of rubbishy rubber shoes such as are coming into the market at the present time, n.n<l which arn really of no value to the individuals who purchase them. At the same time, it will provide the necessary protection for the Australian industry, which is capable of great developments. There are at present of about 200 hands emploved in this partiatcular branch of the industry, and I am that if it is developed, as T believe it can be. it will give employment to Importations latterly year ad- Â£103,000 worth of. these shoes were imported. We can rMke them here, and I has anisen think we o""ght to do so. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 329 (Boots, shoes, &c.).",48
249,Mr FENTON,NATURALIZATION,"Maribyruong) [S.25]. - There has been some complaint that, the present Tariff imposes an extra 5 per cent, on the English article, while an additional 15 per cent, duty is levied on glace k i d .",49
250,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I am not going to in crease this duty. Item agreed to. Item 330 (Boots, rubber) agreed to. Item 331 (Rubber and rubber manument. factures).",49
251,Mr MATHEWS,NATURALIZATION,"Melbourne ' Ports) f8.26] - I think some representations were made to the Minister (Mr Greene) in regard to this item, and that it was suggested to hi m that it should be dutiable.",49
252,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"I have considered the matter, and do not propose to take any action. Item agreed to. Item 3321(B) Rubber and other hose.

253,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.27] - I want to move a consequential amendment in sub-item B , which at present includes rubber stoppers and corks. We propose to take thofee goods out of this item. They will then fal l automatically under another item which we have already passed, and in which we have included them. move That the item be amended by adding following to 'sub-item (c):-""And on after 30th June, 1921(n) Rubber and other hose; rubber manuranging factures, n.e.i., and articles, in which rubber forms a part, cluding bandages, elastic stocking3, leggings, kneecaps, thigh-pieces, wristlets, rubber gloves, including surgeons', hatmakers' press and rings, gas bags, soles, pads, heels, cash mats, rubbered tyre fabric, tyre rubber, photographic accessories of rubber not being tegral parts of cameras, cycle motor-car repair outfits, ad British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, rates ? 30-per cent:,- general, 40 per cent."" Amendment agreed to.",49
254,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"Richmond-Minister I for Trade and Customs) [8.29] - We . . amended item 118 by omitting from it rubber floor coverings, and I propose to include them in this item. I move That the item be further amended by adding the following to sub-item (o):-""And on and after 28th May, 1921-(c) Floor coverings and floor and carriage mats of rubber, ad val., British,' 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30'per cent.; general, 40 per cent.""

(B) Rubber tyres other than pneumatic, including compositions made up in Form and size suitable for use with pneumatic tyre covers as a substitute for the inner tube, ad val., British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 35 per cent.; general, 40 per cent. .",49
255,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Dampier) [8.30] I have been furnished with a great deal of information in regard to rubber tyres. It appears to me that the rubber-making industry of Australia has progressed beyond all bounds. The manufacturers I have made enormous profits, and I think we ought to be able to look forward to a the big reduction in the duty. The Goodand year Company suggests a fixed . duty up to 2s. 6d. per l b ., instead of n.e.i., an ad valorem rate. We must realise the ingreat part that motor cars play in opening up our country, and how necessary and they are to people in the outlying districts. We know that the motor bodies bags are made very well in Australia, but I and think that we can ask for a big reduction of the duty o,n tyres. As a matter of in fact, the local manufacturers are now exand porting them. Is the Minister (Mr . val., Greene) prepared to omit the ad valorem",49
256,Mr BOWDEN,NATURALIZATION,"STepean) J8-35T have also received communications from several people in regard to this duty. I 'understand that the difference between Che ad valorem rate and 1ihe 'fixed duty is very little, but that <a great - deal of diffif - culty is sometimes 'occasioned in passing entries. A fixed duty of 2s. 6d. per lb. would be higher than the ad valorem rate ;on .heavy tyres,. Jhough possibly it would - be lower an the .case of lighter tyres. I ask whether it would suit ithe Customs .Department just - as well to abolish the ad valorem rate? Mr MASSYGREENE {Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.36] - As I have not gone into that aspect Â«of 'the matter, it would be impossible for me to say off-hand .the effect of doing away with khe ad valorem orates, but as the importations, which 'in 191'3 were valued at Â£'4'93,893, .had risen in 1918-19 to Â£834,000, <an3 in the following year to Â£884,950, .one can .only suppose that the duty proposed to be imposed is not excessive: I know that the rubber manufacturers are .extending their plants, but in the face of ithe import figures it would be hardly safe tto'reduce ithe duties, and pro'bably 'jeopardize what, promises to be one of the largest industries in Australia. I think the (rates .proposed are - sufficient, and I would mot like to see'them reduced. Mr ''GREGORY (Dampier!) [S.38] - I move That the item be amended by adding the following - to sub-.ttem (A) :-""-And .on and after 30th June, 1021,-per lb,, British, Is.fid.;intermediate, Ss.; general, 2s. 6d."" The - effect .of carrying this amendment .would - be - to wipe out the - ad .valorem rate, hut the possible effect on the industry I (cannot .say. That .is .our difficulty. Honourable members get .extraordinary .information from - those who come to see .them dn regard <to .the Tariff. One person interested .in a .certain direction will give ispecific particulars in - regard to an industry which will bo contradicted .by .another person, who will supply information entirely .different. Yesterday two .honourable members were most emphatic in regard to the cost of certain material - manufactured in (Australia. Y&t this evening an entirely - different view of the circumstances was 'afforded to me from official .sources. Instead of our having a .Board to .collect information, .and .tell - us the effect of this or that duty, - we are groping in the dark, and acting upon the advice 'tendered by interested parties, with the result, perhaps, that we mav do wrong. The Tariff Board which'the Minister (Mr .Greene ) proposes -%Â© create 1 should have been appointed - twelve months ago for the purpose-of providing information to this'Committee. I have no desire 'to injure any industry, but equally a"" am not anxious to build up monopolies. Honourable members opposite, also, 'are not anxious to build up mondpdlies, tout our trouble is that we have - not - the information at ;OUT disposal to prevent us from doing so. Even .the Minister has mot the best of material at his command. What .he told as about the price of agricultural machinery in Canada and the United States was not quite correct. 'The Committee would mot have iknown, except for information which .came to me, that - a reaper and binder could be bought in Canada for Â£60. The position in - which - we are placed as - hardly fair' to us. Wis do not know whether we are doing tan in dustry any injury or not. We 'know 'that the motor car has come to stay,, and that, although some people may use it for pleasure, its .most important function is - in (helping the .development .of business and industry, - particularly in - the back country. Tho - cost - of shoeing a motor lorry 'is, approximately, .from Â£100 to Â£130, while a set of tyres .carries a Tariff tax of Â£40, showing what a tremendous impost is placed 'upon mechanical transportation. The principal Jabour in making a 'tyre is paid for on a piecework rate of Is. Id -.per tyre casing,, and as the rubber tread is .also done on piece work at Is. Id . per tyrce, two .important items in the - manufacture of tyres .cost for labour ronly .2s. 2d., so 'that fk& total is 'well under 10s. for labour; but this same tyre, which .costs less than 10s. for labour, sells to the public, according to information supplied to me, atA 935 x 135, 'nearly Â£14 each, .or Â£56 aiset of four, whilst the cheapest (tyre for la ismall wheel 'costs nearly Â£25 'for the - set - Out of the above there is less .than Â£2 for labour,, .yet the duty collected 'Qn four !935 x 135 tyres '.is over Â£14, or .seven times the Australian labour cost.",49
257,Mr CONSIDINE,NATURALIZATION,"Is the honourable member complaining.of the low - wages paid? Mr 'GREGORY - I 'have never favoured low wages; hut I think that every man should .give a fair return for - ihe - wages that are paid 'to him. The firms 'carrying on business in Australia are the Dunlop Rubber Company, the Ba-rnet - Glass Rubber Company, the TPerdvia\i - Rubber - Gompany, 'a-nd the - Colonial Rubber' Company, and the document I pared has?? jn, my baud discloses the profits.made by tjiepir. . On the factSj. these companies do not need continuous, high protection,, and the time has now arrived when some consideration should .be shown to the are ample. public. Are we to, keep* on imposing high duti.es,, and thus; enable manufacturersthe tOi build up huge establishments without any cane for those who have, to use their cojn-modjties?! It is. not. the expensive limousine cars that I havein, my mind; on. such, luxuries I would impose high,, noli puohihitive duties, especially i such) as the present.. What I am thinkthere ing; ofi ojie - the utility' cars, - which pr-owd of marvellous value in the opening up , and development of the country. A the present time there is a motor* service from the end of the Perth railway line, Â»way> north, to the Murchison. Gold-fields, and ou to Nullagine and' Marble' Bar, tries, connecting with the railway system at; the. coast. I should say there arei quite 100! pastoralasts now who . t-Qi make use of motor cars from the mind! southern' portionsof WesternAustralia TH order to get in touch with various to pastoral districts throughout the northwhy west of Australia. It may he takenthat similar conditionsprevail* also in the western portions of .New South. Wales, ower-the< whole of Queensland, and! a large part of South Australia. We have also coft to considerthe wonderful! value> of the motor in cases; of sickness and other gencies im the bush; I do nql? refer to the 1 manufacture of motor bodies, though I the must say I should like to-see any combinawho tion, such as that reported in the - press; prevented. In the case of tyres and chassis Mr Â©BEENE.^TT-1 may be abletodo something in regard tor chassis.",50
258,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"And I hope the hondivided,. ' orable gentleman will'also be able to do something with regard to tyresl The cost of a set of tyres for a motor car is now enormous.",51
259,Mr GREEN,NATURALIZATION,"E - I do not think a reduction of the duties would maketyres any Bell,, G>. J. . eheaper.",51
260,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,"Not at the. present Foster, Ricliard' time, perhapSj because-prices asÂ© abnormal Fowler, J: M'. all over the world; in any case, I am preGregory;. ED. to take the chance if the duties are reduced. There is no doubt that the firms I have mentioned are doing marvellously well in the manufacture of rubber goods; and the duties of Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per lb.  Minister (Mr Greene)- will makea substantial' reduction in the duties on rubber tyres other than' ""pneumatic. Manifestly such tyres are used for commercial purposes on country roads, and if where railways are not available. Whenn times the motor .car was firstintroduced was an idea that it was entirely have an aristocratic vehicle,-; but motor transport is really taking, the place, of, the t horse and dray. It is a mistaken policy to make it difficult to obtain these cars, seeing that the-producers-here are in competition, with the producers! of other counwhere: there are greater-facilities foji transport.

284,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,My proposal is that Division XIII . be postponed until after the disposal of Division XIV . .,53
285,Mr ANSTEY,NATURALIZATION,"I am opposed to that, because it is too indefinite. I desire to know definitely on what date this division will be proceeded with. Give the newspaper proprietors two or three weeks in which to make up their minds, if you like; but let us know the date.",53
286,Mr BOWDEN,NATURALIZATION,"Nepean) [9.8] - I hope that Division XIII . will be proceeded with tomorrow.

We can make these parts here. I learned from a manufacturer in Sydney - that owing to the introduction of cheap .parts from other countries, under the free list, he has .been forced to lay aside automatic machinery for the purpose which he imported, at considerable cost from .America - The firm in - question :made for the Colonial ISugar - Refining Gompany O roller bearings .and ball bearings and axle boxes of a ""very intricate character in ; volving measurements to the .nicety of >a thousandth part of an inch. The 'firm cannot carry on, however, whilst it i as to compete against importations coming in under the free list, - and I think the M in ister (Mr Greene;) should consider the desirableness of imposing an - adequate duty so that this automatic machinery may once niore be put into operation. - Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.30] - So far as we know, there is no production of night these articles in Australia. At any rate, interwe - have 'had no 'request for a duty .on The honourable member can .see that they are subject to departmental'by-laws. This has been done for the express purpose of enabling them to be dealt with if their manufacture is undertaken in Australia, and the manufacturer is able to supply ithe necesval., sary requirements of - the .country. In 1 free: those circumstances, .the line of goods he manufactures will be broughtinto the - dutiable list. These bearings vary in tram- - character, and are used very extensively for in .all classes - of machinery., so that it - would not bo judicious .to have them all per cent - included in the dutiable list.  Minister has acted wisely in deciding to increase at the present time the duties already imposed under .sub-item A ; but think that the duty he proposes under sub-item B on steel or iron wheels, or tyred wheels for railways, is excessive, and I hope he will agree to a reduction of the British and intermediate rates. do not care how much he increases the duty under the general Tariff, but I obI t is absurd. ject to such a heavy impost being placed against people of 'the same colour as selves. It seems absurd to do so, cially when every State is crying out railways to enable its territory to be veloped, and more effectively occupied and worked. To load ourselves up with such high duties, which the State Governand ments who own the railways will be combasis, pelled to pay, is simply a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. One might understand the imposition of a heavy rate on these, wheels and tyres 'if conditions exrate. isted in Australia which made it difficult for us to produce these articles, but there is no difficulty in making them here. the exercise of the spirit displayed in Committee, which has for its purpose the abolition of militarism, and all that kind of thing, and an endeavour to make self-contained, we ought to protect ourThe-been selves by building adequate railways, to equip which we must have full supplies of steel-tyred wheels. There is no diffiand culty, I repeat, in making these here, particularly when we have our steel works situated at. the coal pit's mouth, and when we have the richest iron deposits the world. The freight paid on bringing the war. wheels from overseas ought to be sufficient protection to'any local industry, and, apparently, the sole object of imposing little bit wild. heavy duties is to make wealthy men wealthier and place heavier burdens the people. Every State railway system is bearing a burden of debt, and each year shows a, deficit, yet this Tariff poses to make the capital cost of each system still higher. The* main weight each system is its capital cost, which, we find it today, is only about half it would be at the present cost of matefirms rials. We ought to halt before agreeing to these duties to see whether we are actture ing wisely in giving such enormous tection on these railway requirements. Certainly, let us give a reasonable margin - of protection against the Mother Counperfectly try, but the enormous duty of 35 per commence operations? will only serve to encourage laziness not and slothfuluess, and build up big fortunes, while incidentally crippling the I country. We are .asked to undertake the work of making our railway gauges unisteel form at a cost of from Â£50,000,000 to Â£90,000,000, and yet we expect the various State Governments to pay a duty I of from 45 per cent, to 50 per ceut. on the material required to carry out that'work.",55

And had it what not been that one or two Australian had sufficient enterprise to come to our rescue, and commence the manufacof these wheels and tyres, even .with prothe big stocks on hand, we would have been in a very difficult position.",56
308,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,This information is new. Where did these firms,56
309,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"The first firm to establish the business was Thompson and Company, of Castlemaine. I saw them turning out these tyres with very priminot tive machinery, but with marvellously cellent results, the tyres they made being fortunately able to stand the enormous strain imposed upon ""them by railway work.",57

In addition to Thompson and Company, two other firnis have commenced making steel wheels and tyres.

314,Mr GREGORY,NATURALIZATION,Is not a high hydraulic prpssure plant necessary 1,57
315,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATURALIZATION,"No ; the process is not carried out by hydraulic pressure. The solid ingot is put under a steam hammer, and then flattened out to about one-third of the size of the wheel, and is then pierced. It is then taken from that machine, and gradually rolled out to the exact size required, and goes through various processes until completed. A very expensive plant is required, and operations are most interesting to watch. Hatfields Limited, of England, have arranged with the Australian Electrical Steel Company to manufacture tyres, wheel ceuires, and other railway material. The capital invested in this whole indusaxles try will eventually be Â£500,000, but invested in the large plant, at Newcastle, for this particular branch of the ness is about Â£250,000. The plant is now, I believe, in operation, and the ducts, which are entirely of Australian - raw material, are giving as much satisfaction as those imported.",57

This is a great national work, necessary to the safety of the country. That is why, owing to our experience and the "" close shave "" we had the during the war, we have thought it as well to make matters perfectly secure.",57

The danger to such .industries in their early stages is, that one or two big ship-loads of wheels or axle3 may come from America or elseis - where, and simply wipe them out of existence. In this one industry - there has already been spent Â£240,000. The plant consists of a 10-ton electrical furnace - the purpose .of 'producing l i e finer classes l - of steel required.

If we do not provide now a sliding scale in - connection with these duties, I am afraid that we shall not find it very easy to reduce the duties when the industries are established. We should do that throughout, because the idea of Protection is to help an industry to become established. But we seem to have departed from that principle. If it is necessary for the time being to i m pose such a high duty, we should have an assurance from the Minister that there will be a reduction on a sliding scale. Give industries protection until they are full y established, and then give them the whole of the. Australian trade upon the conditions I have already mentioned. Progress reported.

This will be a Tuesday instead of a Saturday, so that in future there is to be a regular fortnightly service by means of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient steamers, leaving Sydney on Tuesday, Melbourne on Saturday, Adelaide on Monday, and Fremantle on Friday. We shall thus have a regular fortnightly service instead of the weekly service which we had before the war.",60
350,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"The position will be the same as it was before the war, only we shall have a fortnightly instead of a weekly, service?",61
351,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"^The position will be practically the same, with the exceptions to which I referred when I laid the Agreement on the table of the House. This is - the best Agreement we could get. It is terminable at any time with twelve months' notice. The shipping company would not enter into any other, and did not think that it was desirable to ask the Commonwealth Government to do so dur- ing the transition period we are going through at present. A f t e r I made my previous statement it is very gratifying to know that there was no adverse criticism of this Agreement.",61
352,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Hunter ) [10.13] It is pleasing to hear from the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) that he has today received a letter stating that arrangements have been made for the alternating service which will give us a fortnightly service, because, as the Agreement is framed, it was a matter of doubt whether we would get the alternating service.",61
353,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,The Agreement was subject to that. If that had not been arranged for we could have cancelled the Agreement.,61
354,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"I must say that, in my opinion, the provisions of the Agreement are very loosely drawn. It is left under the Agreement to the Orient Company to make arrangements for the alternating 'service, and the Commonwealth Government has very little say in the matter. It is pleasing to know that the alternating service has been arranged, for, but it would be interesting also to know-and the Minister gave us no in formation on this point-whethe r the . boats to be employed in the alternating service are equal to the boats to be provided for the monthly service by the Orient Company.",61
355,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"We have no control over the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and never had.",61
356,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,That is my point. The Minister is not in a position to say whether the boats supplying the alternating service will be equal to those contracted for by the Orient Company..,61
357,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,They might be black-labour boats.,61
358,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"The matter is in some doubt, and we should get more in formation upon it .",61
359,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"We can deal only with the Orient Steam Navigation Company. We have no control over the Peninsular and - Oriental Steam Navigation Company, nor did wo have any control over them in the past.",61
360,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"But there is a provision in the Agreement under consideration whereby it is, I think, practicably optional with the Orient Steam Navigation Company to make arrangements for an alternating service, though, in the event of the company not doing so, we might give three months' notice of the cancellation of the Agreement.",61
361,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Yes , we could cancel the Agrcementl",61
362,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"The Agreement left it entirely , with the Orient Steam Navigation Company to arrange for the alternating service. A very interesting question which has still to be answered, is whether the boats supplying the alternating service must comply with the condition? under which white labour is to be employed.",61
363,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"The Agreement is practically the same as the last Agreement, with the exception of the alterations I have mentioned.",61
364,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,And its conditions apply to the alternating boats. Mr Wise!-Yes .,61
365,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"What we require is a speedy and frequent service. In regard to speed, notwithstanding the fact that great improvements' have been made in shipbuilding, and more powerful engines than were previously used have been installed in vessels during the last few years, I 'find that 'the iservice to he provided under the Agreement will (not foe the old contract. - speadier ithan any previous /service we have had ",61
366,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"That is so.

Under the 1907 contract - we time paid,, I 'think, Â£170,000 per annum, whereas under this contract we shall pay 'Â£130,000 a year ; but the conditions in regard to the 'running of 'the 'service are have 'altogether different. Under the former contract the company was required to - carry the mails to Adelaide, ""While - under this contract they will have to - carry them mileage only as far as Pi-emantle, so 'that 'the considerably less.

370,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Because this is a fourweekly as against a fortnightly service. . Mr Charlton, - Tasmani a will have a less frequent service than'before.",62
371,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Au d so .will Australia as la Mr CHARL'TON --T-h e contract ""requires tlhe company to provide on each a mail steamer a - c'ham'ber for' the ""carriage - of butter, 'but - we have to ""guarantee 'a shipment of at leadb 300 tons.

372,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"We have thirteen, and we understand' that they will provide for thirteen.",63
373,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"N'o t thirteen ships, but thirteen departures. There is one clause in the Agreement for which I can seeabsolutely no reason.

It is to, the. latter portion of the clause that, Iobjject.

376,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Yes. . Mr CHAR3LTON- - The ' honourable) mails ?> gentleman admits that this Agreement isi not as satisfactory from the: point of of: the'Commomwealth asi those, which previously been in operation.

At the present' timefive large; vessels are) beingbe constructed* to, the order - of the Common wealth, Government. Mr Riley:-Two-of them have already been launched. Mr CHARLTOSr:-That is so. When this contract was drawn up it was believed that the four vessels agreed upon at that time would be able to conduct a monthly service: If that was so, I see no reason why, when the five large steamships being built to the order of the Commonwealth are ready to. be put into commission, we should not employ them in providing for ourselves a monthly mail service. We could employ auxiliary vessels just as this company, is doing, and the Â£135,000 per year now to be paid to the company would be of great assistance in enabling our own vessels, toBe run on a satisfactory commercial basis. There is no genuine reason why, when those ships are ready,, they should not be used for the carriage of our mails..",63
377,Mr BELL,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,Will they not. be rather slow?.,63
378,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"I - do' not thinkso. They will be thoroughly up> to date, and; as I mentioned just now,, two have alreadybeen launched. Sir JOSEPH C'OOK- - They are launched' but not. completed. 1 Mr Charlton - Yea ; the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) launched one a week or two ago, and Mrs Storey, wife of the Premier of New South"" Wales, launched' the other. They will probably becompleted twelvemonths hence.",63
379,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"We are told* that, they are further advanced' than any other ships that have been launched.",63
380,Mr CHARLTON,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"We have: been, so, by. the shipping; authorities! Lni view of. these, facts, are we, justified in entering into. a. ten; years' contract; with, this, company for the. carriage - of our Mr Wise:-We are not. We are: enterview ing into a contract which may be. termihave, nated on twelvemonths' notice. . Mr Charlton; - I am aware of proviso, and' as soon: as: thei GovernWe ment, axe reasonably sure that, these new steamers of the: Commonwealth line will', available, would, it. rot he advisable: to< give the company twelve months' notice of the termination of this Agreement? Surely if we are going to build ships of our own we will not pay the taxpayers' money to outside firms, and thus assist them to keep going and to make a success of their own boats as against ours? It seems from what we can read that these outside companies are doing everything they can to hamper and hinder the Commonwealth Shipping Line. It is therefore necessary that we should see to our own interests and the interests of our people, and carry the mails in our own boats. The Agreement is a business arrangement, and though I could give my own interpretation of different clauses, one or two of which I hold to bo very weak, I shall not occupy time in doing so. It is a business arrangement, which will be entered into when it has received the approval of this House. The Minister says that he has made the best deal he possibly could under adverse conditions. commend to him the suggestion that, when we have suitable boats to carry the mails-and those which are being built for us will compare favourably with any of those carrying the mails today-h e should, as soon as is reasonably possible, give the necessary notice for the termination of the contract, so that our own sels, may carry our mails, and in that way save the Commonwealth a.gopd deal of money.",63
381,Mr WEST,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"East Sydney) [10.32] - I am one of those who think that mail contracts are of great importance; but the history of the mail contracts entered into by various Governments in Australia will not bear much investigation. If they were inquired into, it would be proved yond doubt that the interests of certain individuals and of one section of the community have been better served than have the interests of the great masses of the Australian people. In the latter tion of the seventies a contract was entered into by which the Government of Yictoria agreed to pay the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company no less than Â£800,000, the arrangement being that the terminal port should be Melbourne instead of Sydney. That was done in such a way that the State of New South Wales took strong measures in connection with the American mail contract, one good result of which is that we have today a line of steamers running regularly from Australia to England via America. I do not wish to pass any severe reflections on those who entered into the contract now before the House, because I know they were at the mercy of the company, which has an absolute monopoly of the shipping between Australia and the rest of the Empire. Lord Inchcape, the chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, is a man with wonderful influence. I suppose that no man within the Empire has. more, and his influence arises out of the grip he has on the shipping of Great Britain.. I should like to know if the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company are going to man their ships with coloured crews?",64
382,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"We have no control over the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and have never had I since the Orient Steam Navigation Company's contract was entered into.",64
383,Mr WEST,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"I can see in this a very good move by the steam-ship owners, by which they will be able to do everything possible to defeat the White Australia policy, because the Peninsular and ves- Oriental Steam Navigation Company run their boats direct, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company will be only a kind of subsidized line, which, on the PostmasteivGeneral's own admission, is not compelled to run its boats.",64
384,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,They are under the same contract practically as they have had for ten years:,64
385,Mr WEST,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"If the Peninsular and beOriental Steam Navigation Company had a dispute with their employees, we would have no control over their coloured crews, but we would have some control over' the crews of the Orient Steam Navigation por- Company'3 boats. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, therefore, have a fine opportunity to defeat the progressive and humane White Australia policy of the Labour movement. I do not understand why twelve months' notice should be necessary for the termination of the Agreement. Where has the Minister (Mr Wise) been to allow such a provision to be inserted? . He must know that we have begun to build ships of our own, which surely we not going to be toys. am sure the desire of the Government and of the people of Australia is that we should not be at the mercy of existing monopolies in the matter of transport between Australia and the older portions of the world. We should have some control over the ships that will carry on the trade between Australia and Great Britain. I direct the attention of members of the Country party to the fact that the contract makes provision for the carriage of butter and other commodities of that character to the other side of the world. It is to the interests of Australia that private companies should not have a monopoly of that trade, or be able to dictate terms to Australia. If we had our own service, it would be managed in such a way that the interests of Australia would be the first to be considered; but there is no possibility of that under this contract. I admit that our own service is mot sufficiently advanced to be able to take over the carrying of mails or passengers between England and Australia, but I certainly abject to the provision requiring twelve months' notice on either side for the termination of the Agreement. That period is far too long. It renders the contract what I might call an indecent one, or one which is not mutual. It has been held that a contract is not binding unless the agreement is mutual, and this one cannot be called mutual owing to the long period of notice required to terminate it. If the Government had given that phase of the matter proper consideration, I am certain that they would never havetyagreed to such a stipulation. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) pointed out that under the contract, unless 300 tons of butter are available, the refrigerating chamber will not be worked. If some misfortune should occur, or ,a Bing should be formed to prevent supplies getting to England-for instance, it could be arranged between the company and those concerned in the butter interest that 300 tons of butter should not be available to send to England in order to corner the market-that clause would be open to all sorts of abuses. .It leaves the door open to all the tricks of the commercial world. All such risks would be obviated if Australia inaugurated and maintained her I own shipping communication with the Old World. It is just as essential that our overseas transport services should be under Australian Governmental control as our national railway systems. The day is not far distant when we shall be bound, in self-defence, to undertake the sea carriage of our mails and produce and citizens. I deprecate rushing this proposal through Parliament. The practice is dangerous. The Government are not infallible; they must take the responsibility, of forcing the contract upon the country. There is no keener business interest than the big shipping firms. Their sole objective is the conservation of their shareholders' interest. They have nothing to do with the welfare of Australia. They are neither public spirited nor philanthropic; they are just good business people. Por those reasons this Parliament should be very cautious. I do-not think the period mentioned in the contract should be so long. Before twelve months have gone we may be very eager to break the arrangement. Lord Inchcape, who is the individual power behind the big shipping firms concerned in the carriage of Australian mails, is the head of a huge maritime combination, the activities of which are not likely to be beneficial to the Commonwealth. I would do almost anything to arouse the Government to the urgent need for instituting an all-Australian shipping service. Only by such means can we hope to secure fair play. 1",64
386,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Franklin) [10.50] - It is useless to discuss the mail Contract. I rise to express my sympathy With the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise). He has done the best he could under trying circumstances. He has been up against the biggest Combine the world has ever seen, the Shipping Combine of Great Britain. It does not matter what company the contract has been made with. They^are all in the same Combine. Everjoone who has had dealings, no matter how slight they may have been in their ramifications with this Shipping ""Combine, has found himself up' against a brick ""wall. We must carry our mails, and must make certain provision for communication between Australia and Great Britain; and, in the circumstances, the Postmaster-General has made the best terms he can get. He was not in a position to dictate terms, because tikeInchcaipe Combine, or what is called> the Conference Line; practically commands the whole of the shipping between Great Britain and' Australia and between Great Britain and' other parts of the world'. The only hope we have of overcoming this unfortunate state of affairs is that outside companies will bneak up this Combine, as they did in connection with freights., The Combine was charging Australia Â£7 a ton to get its wheat Home, and it was not until foreign companies came iui that, we succeeded in reducing that amount by one-half, and in. some cases> to a little less than, one-half. The other day a boat was lying at an. Australian wharf loading: wheat at Â£7 a ton, and' quite, close toher' was another boat loading wheat at half that' rate. The Inchcape Combine thought"" that by having' the BritishAmerican shipping under their hand's; they could dictate terms to 1 the world ; but fortunately there are fleets 1 flying other flags, although rt is a lamentable condition of affairs that any Britisher should be, obliged' to look to. ships flying foreign flags to secure the. caitr.ying of goods from Australia at. a reasonable nate; of. fweight., My sympathy is. extended toi the Postmaster-General in Ilia endeavour tÂ©: get the best terms, for communication betweeni Great Britain and; Australia,, when he found himself face to face with this; theÂ» greatest and: moat merciless Combine the world has ever seen. X c RELEY (South Sydney) [10.54]., - The / honourable: members, for Hunter(Mr Charlton) and East Sydney (I Mr; West) did not! complain, about the? terms of the mail contract.

388,Mr WISE,AGREEMENT WITHORIENT STEA M,"Gippsland-Postmaster General). [10.57.]' - There isa good deal>' of misapprehension in the mind's of honourable members with regard' tot this conitracfi. It is> simply a, contract withi ^the Oriemt Company' for a-, foiu^weekly'- service, and takes; that place ofi the old contract with the. same: companywhich, existed for tern years , and' which was enteued into for' 1 that period, providing for a fortnightly, service. By reason of the-, fact that the BritishGovernment had arranged withi the Peninsular and. Oriental Steam, Navigation Company to run a fortnightly seartrioe from. Great Britain; to AUST tralia, we were able to. have ai1 regular, weekly service, bw the two companies alternatingtheir' vessels. A f the same time - Avehad not control) over the. Peninsular; and Oriental SteamNavigation CoiBpauy-.. The position, is exactly the same today. The Orient one, .Company gave ius notice to termiextra nate their Agreement, and we had annum instead of Â£170,000. to make Bomer ' fresh arrangement. also They were not. anxious to have a lengthy contract. The matter was enfruit, tirely ' in their hands, for there was aw other means by which we could - prothe Vide another service if ""they - had refused to continue. However, they met they said that they diet riot want a. long contract over what they recognised was Â» transition period. T,hey suggested --an interim contract which Â«ould be terminated by .twelve months' notice on either side. They - did not even ask for a contract Cor twelve months, and 'thereafter subject to twelve-months' notice, which meant a contract for at least two years; ^but only posedashed for an Agreement which could be terminated by giving twelve months]' notice at any time, so that it we desired we could give the notice immediately after the contract started. This shows that they were net anxious to bind w to a members the utmost courtesy and kindlong contract. In order that we 'might .have an alternate .service through the jBrit-ish Government with the aular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, we made it a condition of contract that it was subject to - such arrangement being-made in Great Britain. 'The ifeeate iof the - Beninsular and ^Oriental ;8team Navigation Company axe quite, whose name is 'Sampson, is an agent for as good as those of the Orient' Ooropany. in fact, .recently - have t a d one or two of their on vessels here which were vp-to date boats.
