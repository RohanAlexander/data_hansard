1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Q. I . Bell) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA OOMMISSION. PUBLICATION OF JOURNAL.",10
2,Mr JENNINGS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"A week ago, I asked for particulars of the estimated cost of the proposed journal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Postmaster-General stated yesterday that it waa neither customary nor desirable to give details of the commission's financial transactions, other than are disclosed is the accounts prescribed by Parliament, and added that the journal would not be run at a loss. I now ask the honourable gentleman whether, in the public interest, and in the interest of 1,122,250 holders of listeners' licences in Australia, who are supplying the revenue for this journal, it is not essential that the details asked for should be supplied? Will the Minister make further inquiries to this end?",10
3,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I .shall approach the commission, to see whether I can obtain the information.",10
4,Mr ROSEVEAR,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that certain proprietors of newspapers and journals hare made representations to him with the object of preventing the Australian Broadcasting Commission from publishing advertisements in its proposed journal? If so, were any of those proprietors able to assure him'that a journal could be conducted successfully without advertising revenue?",10
5,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is ""Yes"", and to the second part, "" No "". DISPUTE IN METAL TRADES.",10
6,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Is the Minister foT Defence willing to make inquiries iir respect of the persistent refusal of the trades' employers' organization to meet the engine drivers and firemen in a conference to discuss conditions arising out of their employment? If such inquiries disclose the attitude of this employers' organization to bo as I have stated, is the honourable gentleman willing to make representations to the lessees of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, where a large number of metal trade workers aTe involved, with a view to a conference being arranged between the unions concerned and the dockyard management, and thus counteract the defiant attitude of the employers' organization in resisting discussion of industrial problems, even to the extent of hindering the work of his department?",10
7,Mr STREET,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"A conference has been called to deal with this particular matter tomorrow. Consequently it would be wrong of me to make now any statement in regard to the position. However, after the conference has been held, whatever the decision may be, I hope that I shall be able to meet the wishes of the honourable member. I trust that there will be no cause for a further meeting. NEW ZEALAND POTATOES. EMBARGO ON IMPORTATION.",10
8,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce if it is a fact that the period for which the potato embargo was lifted expires today? If so, is the honourable gentleman in a position to inform the House as to whether or not the embargo is to be lifted for a further period, or is to be re-imposed ?",10
9,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The Prime Minister will, it is expected, make tomorrow a statement which will embody an answer to the honourable member's question. MICROPHONES IN CHAMBER. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",10
10,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"B y way of personal explanation, I desire to make some reference to the matter of microphones in the chamber, which was raised in this House yesterday, because some misunderstanding may have arisen from what I then said. The receivers to which the honourable  metal other honourable members have taken exception, were installed by a technician from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, who was of the opinion that tliey would be helpful to me. The matter was first mentioned to Mr. Speaker, and his permission to install them was obtained. I understood from the technician that he had approached the Opposition with a view to ascertaining whether or not it would offer any objection. There is, I think, considerable misunderstanding as to what these receivers do, and are intended to do; there would appear to be the impression that private conversations between honourable members may be overhead. I give the House the most positive assurance that that is not so. 1 confirmed my previous impression by an experiment this morning, when, beyond a confused and wholly unintelligible murmur, I was unable to distinguish anything. There is one other point that must be touched on; it is, that these receivers do not in any way help any person other than one wearing headphones. Consequently, the advantage, if any, derived from the amplification of sound in the chamber, is confined to me, honourable members of normal hearing being left in an unaltered position. Last night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, reference was made to a connection between the microphone at Mr Speaker's end. of the table and the Prime Minister's room. I need only say that I was not consulted or even informed about such a connection, nor did I know that one existed until I read of it this morning. The receiver at the far end of the table, which is the one through which sounds pass to my headphones, has been on the table since 1931. So far as private conversations of honourable members are concerned, they are in exactly the same position as they have been for the last eiglyears. I have only to add that the financial responsibility for the installation entirely mine.",10
11,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Hon. G. J. Bell) The matter referred to by the Attorney General (Mr Hughes) was raised yesterday at question time, and further references were made to it on the motion for the adjournment last night. I stated last night that, in view of what had been said by the Attorney-General to me, I would make a personal investigation. I did so, and some tests were conducted this morning. Some of the omcers of the House were present, as well as the. Attorney General. It had been objected that the Attorney-General might hear private conversations carried on in a low voice. Of that I was not really in a position to judge, but the right honourable gentleman assured me himself that he could hear nothing of such conversations, and"" never had been able to. The chief engineer attached to the staff of Parliament has supplied me with the following report:Reporting on the microphones installed in the chamber for the use of Mr Hughes, I have to advise, after careful tests, that ordinary conversation on the benches is only audible as a murmur, and the words cannot be distinguished. When, however, a member is addressing the House, and pitches his voice accordingly, the Minister will hear him clearly. I am of opinion that there is no danger of Mr. Hughes overhearing any conversation on the benches conducted in ordinary tones. Another point was raised by the honourable member for Boothby, who stated that the installation was responsible for certain noises which he found objectionable. This morning I sat in his seat, and had some of the officers of the House speak from the opposite side of the chamber, and I was unable to detect any objectionable sounds in the microphone. In view of what has been said, I think we might allow the microphones to remain for the time being, but if any honourable member finds them objectionable in any way I hope he will inform me. MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR CARS. ' Mr HUTOHINSON - Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether any firms have approached him with an offer to engage in the manufacture of motor car chassis in Australia? If not, what steps are to be taken to establish is this industry, and will the Government, before it commits the country to anything definite, allow the matter to be debated in Parliament ?",11
12,Mr JOHN LAWSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Some time ago, the Prime Minister made the position of the Government in that respect quite clear to the House. The Government has already received a number of proposals, and it is prepared to consider any others that may be received, for the manufacture of cars in Australia. SWEATING IN CLOTHING TRADE.",11
13,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Will the Prime Minister take steps to provide Judge Drake-Brockman with the extra power required to deal with cases of sweating in the clothing trade?,12
14,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I am at present investigating the possibility of dealing with this matter by amending legislation. If that is found to be feasible, I hope to introduce such amending legislation next week. CEMENT DUTIES. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",12
15,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"My attention has been drawn to the Hansard report of a speech made by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) on Friday last during the debate on the Supply and Development Bill. According to the report, the honourable member stated that the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) did not supportthe proposal which he, as Minister for Trade and Customs, had submitted to the House for the reduction of duties on imported cement. If the honourable member for Balaclava will refer to Hansard of - the 27th March and the 21st May, 1936, he will find that on both occasions I supported the proposal which he, as Minister, submitted.",12
16,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"On the occasion referred to by the Minister for Social Services, I mentioned a number of Ministers, and his name was inadvertently included. I now recall that it was he who helped to defeat the duties on sanitary ware. WHEAT INDUSTRY.",12
17,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"In view of the very low price of wheat, and the unprofitable nature of the industry even with the assisinvestigated tance afforded by the flour tax, will the Treasurer give favourable consideraon tion to a request for some further finanother cial assistance to growers during the coming year?",12
18,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The position of the wheat industry has been the subject of prolonged examination by expert oflicers representing the States and the Commonwealth, who met in Canberra last week. The result of their discussion has not come before the - Government, but no doubt 1 it will. Further, there will be a conference of State Ministers with representatives of the Commonwealth to discuss the same subject, probably the week after next. The purpose of these conferences is to make an attack on the important problem referred to by the honourable member.",12
19,Mr MCHUGH,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce whether the Government has been invited to attend a world conference on wheat? If so, when will the conference take place? Is the Minister aware of the disparity between the prices obtained for, wheat in the various States? Why is it that the price in South Australia is, generally speaking, about 4d. a bushel below that ruling in the eastern States? Sir' FREDERICK STEWART There is a Standing International Wheat Committee which was in session quite recently. It is not sitting at the moment. I know of no suggested conference other than that. With regard to the disparity between wheat prices throughout the Commonwealth, I am not aware of the facts related by the honourable member, but I shall bring his question under the notice of the Minister for Commerce. SYDNEY GENERAL POST OFFICE.",12
20,Mr CURTIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Is the Prime Minister in a position to answer question No. 8 on the notice-paper?,12
21,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That question relates to the matter which was discussed here the other day regarding the acceptance of a tender for certain additions to the General Post Office, Sydney. A ll I can say at the present time is that the matter is under consideration by the Government. The possibility of some speedy investigation of the matters raised in relation to the tenders is now being by me. I have had the advantage of some tentative conversations the subject with the leaders of the two parties in this House, and I shall make a statement tomorrow. In the meantime, I assure honourable members that no contract will be signed. PENSIONS FOR MINERS.",12
22,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Is there any truth in the statement that the Government of yet New South Wales has agreed, or proposes, to appoint a commission to inquire into the question of pensions to coal miners on their reaching the age of 60 years, with the object of replacing them by the unemployed youth on the various coal-fields? Ls it a fact that the Queensland and Victorian Governments have indicated their intention to participate in such inquiry, for the purpose of bringing about more harmony on the coal-fields ? If this is a fact, will the Government co-operate with the governments mentioned for the purpose of giving such inquiry Gommonwealth-wide scope? Is it a fact that at a conference held by the late Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) in Canberra about fifteen months ago with the miners' executive oflicers regarding the financing of this pensions scheme, Sir George Knowles, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, suggested it could be financed by the Federal Government placing an excise of 3d. or 4d. a ton on all coal produced? Was the late Prime Minister sympathetic to ""such an excise as a contribution to a settlement of the then impending coal dispute? If tliese are facts, will the Prime Minister indicate to the House his preparedness to co-operate with the States in the setting up of a commission for the purpose of covering the whole of Australian coal-fields, and also state if he will be prepared to impose an excise duty on coal as suggested, thereby bringing about a settlement of one of the miners' major claims, in addition to absorbing many unemployed youths in the distressed coalfields areas?",12
23,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The question is extraordinarily long. I remind honourable members that lengthy questions should not be asked without notice.,13
24,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) was good enough to supply me with a copy of the question.,13
25,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,It is important. That is why I did so.,13
26,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I am not blaming the honourable gentleman, I assure him. He was good enough to inform me of the question so that I should have it before me when answering it. The first question implies that there is a proposal hy the Government of New South Wales to appoint a commission to inquire into the question of pensions to coalminers, but I regret that I have no information to that effect. I made an inquiry but could not substantiate the statement. The same is true of the second question, which asks whether the Victorian and Queensland Governments have indicated their intention to participate. The third question asks whether the Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles, suggested that such a pensions scheme could be financed by the Commonwealth Government's placing an excise of 3d. or 4d. a ton on all coal produced. I have inquired from Sir George Knowles. He informs me that he offered no view as to what the excise should be. The amount referred to by the honourable gentleman was, in fact, the amount put forward by the miners' representatives when Sir George Knowles was asked to advise as to whether there was any constitutional difficulty about imposing such an excise. He advised that there was not.",13
27,Mr EEEWNAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,That is more in his line.,13
28,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Yes . As to whether the late Prime Minister was sympathetic to such an excise I am unable to say. There is no record of the matter. The fourth question asks whether I shall indicate to the House my preparedness to co-operate with the States in the proposed commission. It follows that I cannot answer that yet, because, so far as I know, there is no proposed commission. But I would point out that the suggestion about a special excise duty on coal, in order to produce a specially accelerated pension for coalminers, while it is one which, of course, I shall consider, has obvious difficulties attached to it, because it would involve discrimination between coalminers and other miners and other industrial workers. Therefore, while I say to the honourable gentleman that I shall take his suggestion into consideration, it would be unwise for me to encourage him to believe that the suggestion can be accepted. INTERSTAT E TELEGRA M RATES .",13
29,Mr JENNINGS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Has Cabinet reached a decision regarding a revision of telegram rates ? Mr HARRISO]Sr --Cabinet has decided to re-affirm the decision of the previous Government. DIVORCE DOMICIL.,13
30,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"In view of the fact that the greatest right of any citizen is the right to vote, will the Attorney General consider that, in any amendment of the Divorce Act or improvement in the difficulty of domicil, any citizen could claim the right of domicil where he or she has the right of voting.",14
31,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The only satisfactory solution of the difficulties that at present exist with regard to domicil in relation to divorce is the creation of an Australia wide domicil instead of the separate State and territorial domicils at present existing. The question whether a bill providing for such a domicil should be introduced is a matter of policy upon which I am not in a position to make a pronouncement at the moment. BUTTER SUBSTITUTES.,14
32,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce. By way of explanation, I have a product which in its natural state is pure white. It has been artificially coloured and resembles butter, and tastes like butter, but is not butter.",14
33,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The honourable member is giving information rather than asking a question.,14
34,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Will the Government give consideration to suitable action in conjunction with the State governments to prevent the public from being deceived by this product which is undermining the dairying industry and is largely manufactured from coco - nut oil, fish oils and other things, which have not the same health content as butter?",14
35,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,It is hardly necessary for me to indicate that every member of this Government is opposed to deception of any sort. subject-matter of the question is to be considered by the Agricultural Council which is to meet shortly. FLYING BOATS.,14
36,Mr CLARK,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Has the attention of the Minister for Givil Aviation been drawn to an article by the aviation correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald which contains tie following extract:-The announcement in the Herald that the British Air Ministry plans to supplement the flying-boat service to Australia with "" express "" londplanes . . . . If that report be correct, does the Government propose to expend further money on the preparation of bases for flying boats on the Australian coast, and what compensation, if any, is the Government likely to receive if the present service is discontinued? ' Mr FAIRBAIRN - I have not seen the article referred to and the Government has received no information from the Government of the. United Kingdom of any such proposal. NATIVE AFFAIRS BRANCH.",14
37,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior to a newspaper report that Dr Donald Thompson, the Australian anthropologist, has been awarded the Wellcome Foundation Gold Medal for anthropological research, in recognition of his work in Arnheim Land, and has also been appointed Australian representative on the permanent International Committee for the study of the conservation of native races. Dr Donald Thompson's work has been acclaimed in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Will the Minister for the Interior place Dr Thompson in an appropriate position in the Native Affairs Branch when it is established, in view of the fact that that branch will be largely based on reports made by Dr Thompson, who, at great risk to himself, spent two years among the aborigines in Arnheim Land? Dr Thompson - will shortly return to Australia and I think that a responsible appointment in this new department would be a recognition of his valuable services. Mr .PERKINS - I believe from statements in the press that the first part of The the question is correct. I shall refer the second part to the Minister for the Interior. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",14
38,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"In view of the considerable increase of prices of commodities which constitute the general purchases of pensioners, will the Prime Minister take immediate steps to increase the payment granted to these deserving members of the community?",14
39,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I regret to say that the answer must be in the negative. TAEIFF SCHEDULE.,15
40,Mr JENNINGS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Does the Minister for Trade and Customs propose to table a tariff schedule before the close of session, with a view to implementing commendations made by the Tariff Board as from the beginning of this financial year?",15
41,Mr JOHN LAWSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I am unable for Commerce. to say definitely whether a tariff schedule will be tabled prior to the recess. Tentatively, my opinion is that no such schedule will be tabled this session unless the House continues to sit until about the end of July. SERVICES OF MR. INIGO JONES. the",15
42,Mr SCULLY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior as to whether any decision has been reached by the Government with a view reform ? to securing the services of the Queensland astronomer, Mr Inigo Jones, who has specialized in long-range weather forecasts for many years, and ""whose forecasts over recent months have been very accurate and, consequently, are much appreciated by men on the land throughout Australia? When I asked a initio stage. question of the Minister's predecessor on this matter, I was informed that an investigation would be made. Has that investigation been completed?  mation on the subject, but I shall ascerlishing tain the position, and inform the honorGeneral able member tomorrow. SWEATING IN FACTORIES.",15
43,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Has the Prime Minister yet made any inquiry into alleged sweating in back-yard I mentioned this matter some time ago, and the right honourable gentleman rewith plied that he would make such inquiries. What is the result of those inquiries?",15
44,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I did make inquiries on that matter, but in order that I may be enabled to give the honourable member a full reply, I prefer to answer his tion tomorrow. NA INDUSTRY.",15
45,Mr ROSEVEAR,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce if he will have prepared statements showing the amounts of financial assistance that have been given to the dairying and butter-making industry, and the margarine industry, over the last ten years? Will he also prepare a statement showing this the average wage paid in each of those reindustries during that period?",15
46,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,I shall bring the honourable member's request under the notice of the Minister AIR FORCE RESERVE.,15
47,Mr WHITE,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,"Wit h reference to the press reports that the Minister for Civil Aviation is favourably considering the creation of a larger Air Eorce Reserve, as result of representations made by aero clubs and individuals, will the honourable gentleman make an early statement dealing with the extent of this desirable",15
48,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY,I have not made any statement to the press on the lines indicated by the honourable gentleman. I informed the press that inquiries are being made into the potentiality of civil aviation for training pilots at the ab NA ACT.,15
49,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OE COPYRIGHT,"In view of the difwhich authors experience in pubtheir books, does not the Attorneyconsider that the Government can afford to pay the published price of all books which unfortunate authors are obliged to supply free of cost to the Commonwealth Library? If so, will he consider an amendment of the Copyright factories? Act in this respect?",15
50,Mr HUGHES,AMENDMENT OE COPYRIGHT,"In order to comply the honourable gentleman's suggestion, it would be necessary for the Government to amend section 40,1 think, of the Copyright Act. I have not had time to consider the matter at length, but I am of opinion that it is not desirable that questhe amendment he suggests should be made. INNER CABINET .",15
51,Mr GANDER,AMENDMENT OE COPYRIGHT,"I ask tie Prime Minister ""whether his Government retains the inner executive, or inner-cabinet group? If so, what Ministers have heen appointed to that group to fill the positions vacated 'by the riglit honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby)?",16

53,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL INSURANCE,"Can the Minister for Social Services inform the House whether the monthly magazine on national insurance, which was being published with the authority and under the patronage of the National Insurance Oommission, is still being published ? If so, does it still enjoy the patronage of the National Insurance Commission?",16
54,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATION AL INSURANCE,"It is quite incorrect to say that the journal, to which I presume the honourable member refers, was published with the authority and under the patronage of my department. I understand that the journal has ceased publication. LYONS ANNUITIES.",16
55,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,"Will the Prime Minister furnish to this House a statement, giving his reasons why he requested' newspapers throughout the Commonwealth to refrain from publishing any of the many thousands of letters which they received protesting against the excessive amount of the annuities granted to the widow ancl family of the late - Prime Minister?",16

57,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,"Will the Prime Minister inform me whether he has received a number of protests from branches of the Invalid and Old-age Pensioners Association regarding the excessive annuities granted to the family of the late Prime Minister, while pensioners are' expected to exist on a miserable £ 1 a week",16
58,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL INSURANCE,"Order ! The honourable member must be well aware, in the first place, that it is improper for him to refer as he has done to a measure passed by this Parliament, and in the second place, that it is distinctly out of order for him to refer to an amount provided by the Parliament as a "" miserable "" sum.",16
59,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,I was referring to statements made in the protests.,16
60,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL INSURANCE,It is fairly clear that the honourable member was expressing his own view.,16
61,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,I ask the Prime Minister whether he has received a number of such protests containing statements similar to those I have mentioned?,16
62,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL INSURANCE,The honourable member must pay regard to the direction of the Chair. He must not try to evade the ruling.,16

65,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,That is exactly what it does refer to. I wish to know whether in putting a question to the Prime Minister I am in order in making reference to words contained in the letters of protest to which I wish to direct attention ?,16
66,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL INSURANCE,"It is not in order, in asking a question, to refer to improper statements that other people may have made. In my opinion that would even be more disorderly than for an honourable member to express ""his own opinion in a way not I am permitted by the Standing Orders. It appears to me that the object of the question is to direct attention to what is described as the ""excessive annuity"". I can see no other reason why he should frame his question as he has done.",16
67,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,I ask the Prime Minister whether he has received a number of protests from branches of the Invalid and Old-age Pensioners Association concerning the annuity of £20 a week,16
68,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL INSURANCE,"I shall not allow the honourable member to make any further references to that matter which has already been considered and determined, by the House. Mr ""WARD - Wel l we shall have something to say on the subject on the motion for the adjournment of the House. Later:",17
69,Mr WARD,NATION AL INSURANCE,I ask the Prime Minister whether he has received from various branches of the Invalid and Old-age Pensioners Association a number of letters of protest against a recent action of the Government and whether it is proposed to furnish those organizations with a considered reply to their representations? I also wish to know whether the Government intends to give favourable consideration to the requests of these organizations for like consideration: in regard to their own rates of pension?,17
70,Mr MENZIES,NATION AL INSURANCE,"I have received a number of letters relating to the subject matter which I understand the honourable member has referred to, and no doubt some of them have come from branches of the Invalid and Old-age Pensioners Association, although I cannot say positively that that is so. The reply to those - ^presentations was made by the Government at the time a certain measure was considered and approved by a majority of honourable members. WOEKS PROGRAMME.",17

Has any decision been made on this subject ?  able member's question to the Minister for the Interior who has, no doubt, since referred it to his department.

Aircraft on one or two lines have been fitted with receivers. I shall obtain exact information on the subject and furnish it to the honourable member. INVALID AND OLD-AGE NA BILL 1939. Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr SPENDER) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of ft bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for invalid and old-age pensions. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Spender and Sir Frederick Stewart do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill brought up by Mr SPENDER and read a first time. SECOND READING.",17
73,Mr SPENDER,PENSIONS APPROPRIATIO N,"Warringah-Assistant Treasurer) [3.19] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide £15,000,000 out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. This is the usual measure submitted to Parliament for the purpose of appropriating an amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for payment into a trust fund to enable pensions to be paid at rates already approved by Parliament. The total amount appropriated by Parliament to date for this purpose is £225,000,000, and the balance of the appropriation now remaining is only sufficient to meet pension payments to the 30th June, 1939. Although Parliament is being asked to appropriate £15,000,000, which is the usual amount appropriated, the whole sum will not be withdrawn from revenue immediately. Revenue is drawn upon only as required to enable pension payments to be made as they become due. This measure has no relation whatsoever to the rates or conditions under which invalid and old-age pensions are paid, and is intended merely to provide funds for the purpose. Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (YOUT H EMPLOYMENT ) BILL 1939. Message recommending appropriation reported.

Assispare tant Minister (Mr Spender) as to the going resolution. purpose for which this appropriation is to be made. He has moved that it read a first time. is expedient that a sum of money should be voted for assistance to the States, but before we deem it desirable that this money should be voted, orable gentleman owes to the committee an explanation of the purpose for which this money is to be given to the States. There is a great variety of uses which the States could put it, think that a definite statement of the purpose of this measure should be given.",18
75,Mr SPENDER,PENSIONS APPROPRIATIO N,"Warringah-Assistant Treasurer) [3.24] - The purpose of this measure is to appropriate £200,000 to' assist the States to overcome the problem of unemployed youths, both male and female. It completes a sum of £400,000 which was promised in 1937 by the then Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), to' the States, for the purpose of assisting in the vocational employment of youths and their technical training.

78,Mr JENNINGS,PENSIONS APPROPRIATIO N,"Watson) [3.25] - 1 believe that so far as New South Wales is concerned the youth employment scheme was cancelled on the 1st January last. I raised this matter a few weeks ago, and was informed that new arrangements were being made with regard to New South Wales. Five months have now elapsed and it is desirable that honourable members should know what has been done in New South Wales. Several honourable members who represent New Wales electorates have received letters from youths who are seeking employment under the scheme which they undera bill stand to be in operation. They should the be made aware of the actual position. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution Ordered and bring in a bill to carry out the foreBill brought up by Mr SPENDER and SECOND READING.",18
79,Mr SPENDER,PENSIONS APPROPRIATIO N,"Warringah-Assistant the honTreasurer) [3.27] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. In September, 1937, following proposals made to the States by the then to Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), Parliabut I ment appropriated an amount of £200,000 toassist the States to overcome the problem of youths, male or female, who were unemployed through missing sum included in the Estimates. the opportunity for industrial training during the depression. When the bill making that appropriation was introduced, the Minister explained the negotiations with the States, and it is, therefore, only necessary for me to mention briefly the circumstances under which the grant was made. All States were invited to put forward proposals for dealing with the problems follows:as they presented themselves to the respective governments. A survey was made of the extent of youith unemployment in each State, and the direction in which the expenditure of the money would afford the greatest relief to those concerned. The schemes submitted by the States were all approved by the Commonwealth. No hard and fast rules were laid down, and they differ in detail, but the principal features are along the following lines:(a) Supplementation of wages pending complete efficiency of the trainees. (6) Training for technical trades. (c) Training for agricultural and mining pursuits. (d) Additions to buildings and purchase plant and equipment where necessary. Generally speaking, efforts have been made by the States to train individuals for those pursuits which are most suitable to their capacity and circumstances. Owing to the amount of work entailed in making the requisite survey and completing arrangements for training, the schemes did not come into operation so early as had been anticipated, and the New South Wales . . 2,538 £200,000 voted by the last Parliament Victoria was not fully expended in 1937-38. The Queensland balance has been used during the curWestern South Australia rent year. The present position is that three States have exhausted the money made available by the Commonwealth and their own Parliaments, and their funds will be substantially overdrawn on the 30th June next. It is, therefore, necessary make available the remainder of the grant promised by the Commonwealth. The additional £200,000 to be proeach State. vided by this bill was included in the 1938-39 Estimates. In November last it appeared that about half of that amount would be sumcient for this financial year, but it is now clear that some States Commonwealth. require their f u ll quota. Parliament is, therefore, asked to appropriate the full adjourned. The money vvill be paid to the States as required to meet their expenditure. The allocation of the proposed vote of £200,000 is the same as that of the similar sum voted in 1937-38. It is based on population, with a slight variation allowed for the degree of unemployment among youths in the various States, as £ New Soutli Wales . . 79,000 Victoria . . 55,000 Queensland 25,000 South Australia 19,000 Western Australia 14,000 Tasmania 8,000 Most of the States are contributing approximately £1 for £1 with the Commonwealth, and the total expenditure, Commonwealth and State, will be in the vicinity of £800,000. This scheme, inaugurated by the Commonwealth, has undoubtedly proved of great value to the community, and in particular to those youths whose training of was interrupted or prevented altogether by the depression. As a very rough indication of the number of individuals benefited and to be benefited, the following figures, furnished at the 31st December, 1938, may be of interest:Number On State. Bene* Waiting Total. flted.

80,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Corio-Minister for Supply and Development) [3.32] - This is the first clause of any consequence in this bill. I believe that what I may describe, without exaggeration, as an inordinate time has so far been occupied in the committee stage. I venture to point out to' the committee, and in BILL 1939. particular to honourable members of the Opposition, that this may well be regarded as an urgent defence measure. It would not have been introduced, and the Government would not even have considered the establishment of a Department by of Supply and Development, had not the international situation been what we all airknow it to be. In other words, the bill Comis a reflection of the gravity of the times of the in which we live. Although the Government has no desire to limit legitimate for purdiscussion, I appeal to honourable members, and particularly to those of the maintenance and disOpposition  Order! The committee has before it an amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde).",20

The first proposal of the honourable gentleman is that one of the matters to be administered by the Department of Supply and Development shall relate to the construction and extension of roads and railways. Speaking both for myself and for members of the Country party generally, while we are not antagonistic to other proposals contained in the amendment, we are opposed to the inclusion of this provision in the clause. I believe that it should be our duty to cultivate good relations with the States. The construction and extension of roads and railways is a matter which comes within their province and their legislative domain; the Commonwealth can construct roads and railways only with their consent. What is their attitude towards the Commonwealth in this connection? Has it been to block anything that the Commonwealth might desire to do for purposes of defence ? Quite to the contrary, all of the States have indicated extreme willingness to co-operate witli..the Commonwealth in the carrying out of any works which may be regarded as having a defence value, such as, presumably, the construction and extension of roads and railways. It seems to me, and to other members of the Country party, that we should be prepared to work with the States on this helpful basis of co-operation which they have agreed to give rather than to say bluntly that we shall undertake these works ourselves. If we say that, we shall not only ignore the constitutional limitations involved, but also show a lack of appreciation of the most helpful attitude of the States in this connection. 'The honourable gentleman next suggests that the search for additional oil resources shall be a matter to be administered by the new department. I believe that a useful purpose would be served if the committee indicated its desire that this work should in the future be carried out by the Department of Supply and Development. At the present time, there is a rather extraordinary division of departmental responsibility in this matter. The Department of the Interior deals with the seareh for oil, while the Minister for Supply and Development deals with such matters as the inquiry into power alcohol, the extraction of oil from coal, and the like. These matters have previously been kept in separate watertight compartments, whilst obviously all of them really belong to one department, and that the new Department of Supply and Development. I consider that that department should take over from the Department of the Interior the responsibility in connection with the search for oil. I understand that there is no objection on the part of the Department of the Interior to this responsibility being taken from it and given to"" the 'new department. The suggested new paragraphs i and » deal with the production of power alcohol from sugar or other vegetable crops, and the production of oil from coal or shale. These matters are already being handled by the Department of Supply and Development, and I see no objection to their being explicitly mentioned in the bill. That would not necessarily mean that the department must immediately proceed to produce power alcohol or oil from shale, . because the wording at the beginning of the clause indicates that the department "" m a y "" administer matters relating to the production of one thing and another, and that it need not necessarily commence producing. The production of power alcohol and of oil from coal or shale, in my opinion, is very closely related to the search for additional oil resources, and if it be good to have a definite reference to the latter, it sliould be equally good to refer specifically to the former. The Country party, of course, has long had as an objective the decentralization of secondary industries, particularly those related to defence. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) desires assistance in the passage of his amendment, I ask him to withdraw the paragraph relating to the construction and extension of roans and railways for the reasons I have stated. The Country party would then be prepared to assist in the passage of the other paragraphs.",20
82,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"It was not intended that the Commonwealth should undertake those works. The idea was that the department should convene a conference of Premiers or, if necessary, of Ministers for Transport, to discuss the matter, so that it might be lifted from the waste paper basket of unconcern and placed on the table of action.  gentleman would receive some support for his amendment if he were prepared to withdraw that particular provision; otherwise, I can only indicate that I propose to move at the appropriate time for the amendment of his amendment by the omission of those words.",21
83,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Is the honourable member speaking for the whole of the Country party when he says that he will vote for my amendment?  which we object are omitted, I shall be prepared to support the remainder of the amendment, and so will members of the party generally.",21
84,Mr DRAKEFORD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Maribyrnong) [3.43] - I regret that the honourable mem indicated that his party will support the amendment only if the proposed new paragraph g is omitted from it. That paragraph, I consider, relates to one of the most important matters with which this new department should deal. I should not like to see the succeeding graphs which cover other important matters lost if some compromise in that direction could not be reached; but would the Country party-for which the honourable member appears to be speaking - support action from this side designed to have railway and road facilities placed on a proper basis ? Without that, it would seem to be dimcult for the Opposition to accept the suggestion. If the subject has been analysed by honourable members, it will be admitted that there are few, if any, roads in Australia over which heavy mechanized traffic could operate in the event of the need arising to move large numbers of troops from one point to another. It is obvious that some department must do what other departments have, so far failed to do, and this new department should, if created, undertake the task. have no doubt that the honourable member for Gippsland, ' and other honourable members of his party, have read in press organs such as the Melbourne Herald, the Melbourne Age, and the Melbourne Argus, the statement apparently founded on reports by experts that our roads would not stand up to the traffic they would have to carry in an emergency, necessitating extensive military operations. If that be the case, can we hope for any greater activity in the future from the departments which so far have been handling the matter? I say emphatically to the Minister in charge of the bill (Mr Oasey) that this Government, and previous administrations in which the honourable member for Gippsland was included, have failed to tapkle the problem, although the promise was - made during election campaigns that they would do so. Having that in mind, we should hardly feel justified in accepting the suggestion of the honourable member, even though it goes four-fifths of the way towards meeting the desires of the Opposition. I hope that he will reconsider his attitude on that matter. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) covers important activities which should come within the province of the new department. That department is to be clothed Mr Drakeford. with certain powers which the Government thinks it should possess in order to para- ensure the proper defence of the country, but other powers which it ought to possess are not - to be conferred upon it. As a railwayman, connected with railway operations for a long period, I know, and in this I am supported by eminent authorities, that in the event of an emergency the railways would not be able to meet the demands of the Defence Department. As far back as 1923, the Inspector General of the Australian Military Eorces, saidThe linking up of our capital cities by railways, beyond striking distance from the coast, and the establishment of a uniform gauge throughout the Commonwealth are matters of paramount importance. It is beyond question that a uniform gauge will avoid many of the disadvantages of possible troop movements caused by breaks of gauge with the necessary transfer from one system to another. Apart from the delay, inI convenience and the. wastage of man-power at transfer stations, the disorganization of units due to the varying capacity of trains of different gauge is serious, and may mean considerable delay at a critical time. And again, in 1925, he made this statementThe disabilities under which Australia is suffering on account of the breaks of gauge in its civil transportation, and the difficulties which would be imposed upon military transportation in war, are generally recognized, and it is regrettable that the production of a practical scheme to remedy this matter has been so long delayed. But there is more in it than that. At the present time, it would be impossible to handle more than eight or nine trains a day across the breaks of gauge at Albury and Tocumwal. It has been estimated that it would require 49 standard trains to move a division of troops. This does not include the supply column and ammunition companies, &c, which would require another 26 trains. The total number of trains, therefore, which would be required to move a complete division on 4-ft. 8^-inand 5-ft. 3-in. gauges is 75. It is doubtful whether Albury, under present conditions, can handle more than eight to ten trains a day. The first member of the Naval Board, Sir Ragnar Colvin, said recently that for every ton of goods carried interstate by train, 16 tons were carried by coastal shipping services. If that be so, our position in the event of a coastal blockade would be desperate. At the present time, Albury handles about 300 tons of freight a day. Perhaps that quantity could be doubled if necessary, but in wartime the demands upon it would be much greater than that, and could not be met successfully. The Government seems to envisage the probability in time of war of a raid from overseas or, possibly, an invasion, and if that were to take place, it is almost certain that the coasts would be blockaded. The Government professes to be satisfied with the reports of experts that the position is amply safeguarded. We should know the names and positions of these persons who have advised the Government, so that the responsibility for their advice may be fixed upon them. On the 7th November, 1938, the Minister for Defence (Mr Street) stated, in answer to a question, that defence requirements on the railways could be met byDevelopment of transfer facilities at breakof-gauge stations. The duplication of certain sections of our railway lines. The ballasting o! lines which may be required for heavy material traffic. The provision of certain new railway lines, and, finally, the standardization of certain lines. Nothing, however, has been done in that direction. I doubt whether plans have even been prepared. The Melbourne munitions. Argus, in its issue of the 19th May, 1939, statedMen, munitions, and formal defences are, of course, the primary needs of Australia in these days of alarms and excursions; but equally indispensable are these economic, industrial, and developmental assets which are the solid background of a nation's strength I agree with that, and I believe that the necessary powers should be conferred in this bill, and that that principle should be applied to transport facilities.  it .be to put in the bill powers that we do not possess? Why not get the States to exercise the powers which they do possess, and which they are willing to exercise? . Mr DRAKEFORD - I suggest that, for defence purposes, the Commonwealth Government can take whatever power it desires, particularly if war were declared. The Government, however, is not even makingany preparations to meet an [36] emergency. It is obviously neglecting its duty. I am certain that supporters of the Government and members of the Country party feel on this matter as I do, but do not declare themselves because of Government policy. The Government is simply ignoring the problem of standardization of railway gauges because it is costly. The job appears to be beyond its capacity. If it desires the co-operation of the States in its work, it. is bound to find some of the money necessary. In August, 1936, the honourable member for Gippsland, who was then Minister for the Interior, stated at a conference in AdelaideIn view of the progress which has been made in road and air transport, this committee considers that, before any decision is arrived at with respect to standardization of railway gauges, a further inquiry by a competent body should be made, having special reference to the economic and defence aspects. Though that was in 1936, the committee has never met yet. Promises have been made time and time again, and I have repeatedly asked questions of Ministers, but nothing has been done. I maintain that the powers asked for in the amendment are essential and should be incorporated in the act if the bill is passed, and I hope that members of the Country party will support the amendment. The Melbourne Argus, on the 18th October, 1938, statedWe are making small arms and all kinds of The Government is co-operating with manufacturers, and there is, it must be conceded, a good deal of activity in this direction. But the kind of co-ordination which ensures a level progress, so that supply of munitions keeps abreast with efficient manpower, which embraces increased population, which ensures rapid transport, which ^contemplates the abolition of coastal sea-borne trade, - is entirely lacking. A broader vision and a bolder policy are immediate needs. In its issue of the 19th October, the Melbourne Age statedI n view of the great practical value of unification to Australia, it is not unreasonable to suggest that half the cost be met by the Commonwealth, which would leave £1,500,000 a year divided between the five mainland States. From a defence point of view the value of the railway network cannot be overemphasized. The main highways have not been built to carry heavy military load's and even now require continual maintenance. In the last six years Victoria has spent in unemployed relief works sufficient money to have converted the gauges in Australia to the standard 4 f t . 8 i in. I do not know whether members of the Country party are aware that, during the ten years from 1927-28 to 1937-38, no less than £285,000,000 was expended on land settlement and works for the relief of unemployed, and on sustenance. Those are astounding figures, and yet we have not even started on the standardization of railway gauges, an undertaking estimated to cost only £21,000,000. The figures are taken from the records in the Commonwealth Statistician's Department. I again quote the Argus on this subject as follows:This one aspect alone has several phases. First, a half-completed unified gauge would ment. be of no use. ior the rapid transport of men and material between points most likely to be attacked if war came to Australia. Secondly, however eager the authorities might be to push the work to completion after hostilities had actually begun, the man-power could not then be spared. Thirdly, while pects for a continuance of peace are more favourable at the moment than they have within recent months, the facts cannot blinked that Europe continues to be an inflammable mass, with hands ready to apply the match, that Great Britain would be into any world war, and that Australia would automatically come within the ambit of trouble . . . An enemy powerful enough to effect a landing on Australian soil have to be supported by naval forces ciently strong to dislocate coastal Thus an enormously increased burden of transport would be thrown upon the railways at a time when the conveyance of troops and munitions would be making heavy demands upon them. Even with a unified gauge the problem would be formidable enough; with a broken gauge the state of affairs would chaotic . . . The authorities' who decided in November last that the work, considered as a defence adjunct, 'was not sufficiently urgent to be put on the priority list should now be convinced that that decision must reversed immediately. I support that, and I ask the honourable member for Gippsland and his colleagues to support it also.",21
85,Mr WILSON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Wimmera) [3.58] The amendment is such that we might all support it. Indeed, I am at a loss understand the argument of the honorby  son), who took exception to the proposal dealing with roads and railways. I fully paragraphappreciate the necessity for this amendment being inserted, because even a layand railways, man can appreciate that roads and ways are of vital importance for defence purposes. It is suggested that the acceptance of this amendment might involve an encroachment upon matters in which the States have supreme rights, but there is no obligation on the Commonwealth to take any action in that regard other than to supply the States with the necessary funds. There is a need for better roads and for better railways, the provision of which would serve the dual purpose of furthering our defence preparations and, if they were not needed for an emergency - as we hope they will not be-of providing a permanent benefit to the community. I can see no argument against the amendAs for the proposal regarding the search for oil, this again, is something to which-1 can give my blessing. It is unfortunate that the attempts that have been prosmade up to the present to discover flow oil in Australia have had negative results, been although much money has been expended. be It might be worthwhile to try out the new department to see what it can do in drawn this way. The production of power alcohol is another matter .to which we can the all give approval. There are many prowould ducts and by-products from which power suffialcohol can be produced, particularly shipping. wheat and sugar. The decentralization of secondary industries, particularly defence industries, is mentioned in ithe amendment. Experience will prove that the Government be has shown very short vision in undertaking defence expenditure and works in coastal areas, particularly the great cities of Melbourne and Sydney, which are most be vulnerable to attack. Despite arguments about increased costs, it would be wiser in the long run if industries were established in more inland districts. That would also be of advantage in bringing about a more even distribution of our population.",24
86,Mr GEOEGE LAWSON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Brisbane) to [4.2J - I support the amendment moved the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde). In voicing the Country party's objection to the proposed new {g) The construction and extension of roads railthe honourable member for Gippsland  opinion of the Country party that it involved an encroachment on the preserves of the State governments; but that is not the case, because what the honourable member for Capricornia has in mind is not only the construction of railways, but also their standardization, which is of vital importance in the defence of the country. The Lyons Government, at the elections of 1934 and 1937, pledged itself to undertake the standardization of railway gauges. That matter has been thrashed out many times in this chamber, particularly by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), and I do not intend fully to traverse it, but I believe that the work would have been tackled long before now if 'the Government were in earnest in its expressed desire to protect Australia, particularly the northern State of Queensland. Honourable members must realise the position in which Queensland would be placed in the event of its being attacked. The transport of goods, munitions and troops from the southern States to Queensland would be impossible under the existing breaks of gauge. It is vital ' that the proposed new paragraph be placed in this bill if it is to be worth anything as a measure for the defence of the country. The Queensland Government has given attention to this particular aspect of defence, and I understand that it has submitted to the Commonwealth Government two schemes for roads and railways. It must be remembered that the State Government cannot be expected to undertake work of national character without the support of the Commonwealth Government. The Queensland Government has submitted a proposal under which it will construct a railway from Dajarra to Camooweal, if the Commonwealth Government will extend the line to Darwin. That is a necessary work which should be taken up by this Government. The Queensland Government also has under consideration the building of what is to be known as the Great Northern Highway, west of the Great Dividing Eange. Its construction would require a considerable amount of money, and I understand that it has been submitted by the Queensland Government as part of its scheme to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in the defence programme. The honourable member for Gippsland objects to what I claim is the most important part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia. In saying that I do not wish to lessen the importance of the other parts; all are essential. I whole-heartedly support the amendment, and I hope that the Country party will change its views and support it also. The amendment also contains a proposed new paragraph(ft) the search for additional-oil resources. I am one of those who believe that up to the present the Commonwealth Government has not given sufficient assistance in the search for flow oil in Australia, and that there is oil to be found in payable quantities in Queensland if only sufficient money is made available to allow of tests of possible oil-bearing country. A week or two ago I discussed this question with certain people who are deeply interestedinterested from a national point of view - and they claim that oil will be found in Queensland in the near future if the Commonwealth Government makes sufficient financial assistance available to those who are conducting the search. The production of power alcohol from sugar and other vegetable crops is a national matter which should be taken up by the Commonwealth Government. The Queensland Government has given noteworthy assistance to the power alcohol industry in the northern canefields, but its activities are limited by a decision of the High Court, which, however, could not hamper the Commonwealth Government if it decided to follow the lead given by the State Government. In the absence of indigenous oil, power alcohol would play a vital part in our transport, industries and defence if Australia were involved in war. The amendment also contains a provision for the decentralization of secondary industries, particularly defence industries, in which Queensland is particularly interested. It is essential if the bill is to be complete that this provision sliould be embodied in it. I endorse the complaint by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) against the centralization of industries, particularly defence industries, in two small areas on the coast of Australia, namely, Melbourne and Sydney. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN  time has expired.",24
87,Mr KANKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Bendigo) [4.14] I support the amendment moved by theam Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), and I do not see any reason it should not be accepted by the Governhave ment. The objection voiced by the honorthat able member for Gippsland (Mr Development Paterson) would be met if the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) discovering inserted in the proposed new paragraph(g) the construction and extension of and railways the words "" in co-operation with States "". If we are to make any progress in defence it is essential that the railway gauges be standardized. If we should attacked by a force of any size, the breaks of gauge would imperil our safety. I has been stated officially that at Albury twelve trains could be handled daily. doubt that estimate. The greatest test to be placed on a break of gauge would probably arise in circumstances in which a defeated force, in the last stages exhaustion, and handling guns and munition tions, would require to make the quickest progress possible. It is not likely to severely tested in ordinary circumstances. From a defence point of view it is imperaof tive that we standardize our railway gauges. I , personally, have seen disaster caused by difficulties arising from of gauge in a railway system. Because, of the improvements which have been effected in transport generally, many people, today, are inclined to think that breaks of gauge are no longer a serious sideration impediment to transport. However, should we have the misfortune to require rapid transport over sections of road system in wet seasons, might experience difficulties similar - to those experienced by the British forces in the attack on Jerusalem. In the course of those operations a metal road, which was quite as good as the Hume Highway, except that it was not sealed, completely disappeared in mud on the Yebna Flat, on the Philistine Plain, under heavy military transport. No serious attempt has yet been made to discover flow oil in payable quantities in Australia. In my opinion certain influences have militated against such a discovery. From what I saw on a visit which I paid recently to the Gippsland East area, I confident that vast quantities of oil exist in that district. If we ever hope why to make a success of defence, we must fuel, and it is in this direction the new Department of Supply and can do very valuable work. I trust that it will take up the matter of flow oil from a national point ^ of view, and refuse to allow anything Toads to stand in its way. It would be absolutely disastrous should we run short the of fuel in a time of emergency. In Gippsland I saw oil coming up under gas pressure in quantities much larger than is being recovered from many oil wells be in the United States of America today. Por a long time. I , personally, have t been dissatisfied with the activities of the Defence Department with regard to I the decentralization of secondary industries, particularly defence industries. Most of these industries are situated in coastal areas, where they are vulnerable of to attack from the air. With the excepof the industries in Melbourne, all of them are within range of gun-fire from be the sea. Such a position is very undesirable and I consider that a fair proportion these industries should be established in inland cities and towns. The tanks in which the bulk of our oil is a break stored are situated in vulnerable positions, and practically invite bombing. In such circumstances we might easily lose the greater part of - our supplies of fuel very soon after war is declared. I urge the new department to give serious conto the construction inland of underground reservoirs which will not be easily discovered and bombed by an our enemy. I agree with the honourable we member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson) that we should, as soon as possible, establish connection between Darwin and the southern railway systems, because we might easily lose command of the seas in the event of war. Should war break out in Europe, for instance, the British navy would be tied up in European waters for a considerable period.",26

Should a war occur in such circumlectures, stances, we might temporarily lose conline trol of the seas around Australia, and, in that case, Darwin would be isolated, particularly should such an eventuality occur in the wet season, when the roads to Darwin are impassable for four five months.

I am prepared to admit that a glacier might be considered a speed hog, pared with what has happened on this bill. Certain statements appear in press today which virtually charge Country party as the culprit in this gard. That is not a fair statement, and I hoped that the Minister would have taken the opportunity when he was speakties ing on this aspect to put the matter right.",27
95,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I have not seen the reports to which the honourable member refers.,27
96,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The Minister would be well advised to have a look at the press. That sort of thing to produce hostility and friction various parties; it is not helpful. I think that the Minister will concede that this is a very important bill, notwithstanding what has been said by some of his colleagues, and that he has little to complain about concerning the co-operation of the Country party on",27
97,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Who made those state,27
98,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Thos e statements are being made, and, obviously, they are emanating from some one here. If this debate is to become merely a matter of delivering curtain there are many experts in that here. I myself, for instance, could throw off the mask of humility which I have worn since I became a member of tiiis chamber, and say one or two things in connection with the absolute lack of or any directing energy on the treasury the Gobench since Parliament met.",27
99,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,  must confine his remarks to the.amend,27
100,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"If this bill is the important measure that the has said it is, and which I , and, I think, most honourable members, believe it to be, then there ought to be of that speed and business-like in the conduct of public affairs of exhibited from the treasury bench which and we were led to believe some months ago would be the distinguishing feature of this Government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) has moved an comamendment on which there has been a certain amount of debate. There is a lot the of force in the arguments put forward the by the honourable members for Bendigo re- (Mr Rankin) and Maribyrnong (Mr. Drakeford), but I point out that this is not merely a question of transport facilibeing incorporated in the Department of Supply and Development; it is rather a question as to whether the Commonwealth is to be empowered to assume certain obligations and liabilities in regard to the extension of services which, under the constitutional distribution of duties today, are essentia, ly the responsibility of the States. If th.'s Government, through the Department of Supply and Development, intends to make a move towards a greater degree of unification than we have achieved hitherto, then let us make it consciously, and with our eyes open.",27
101,Mr RANKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The main roads boards have moved in that direction.,28
102,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"That may be, but this proposal seeks to give greater power to the Commonwealth in regard to two matters which are State matters, than has been hitherto contemplated by the Commonwealth, and I have very grave doubts as to whether some of the States would be prepared to go so far as to accept what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, consciously or unconsciously, contemplates in his amendment. Every State government, and local governing body, is interested in this proposal, and we are entitled to some expression of opinion from them. Until such time-as that point has been cleared up, one way or the other, wisdom dictates that we should support the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Gippsland this afternoon. Some time ago, there was constituted, for what useful purpose God only knows, some sort of council of State and Federal authorities which was supposed to go into the problem of transport now and again. I may be a Doubting Thomas with regard to the future and usefulness of that body, but in connection with a bill of this description, taking into consideration the existence of that council, and the limited powers already vested in this matter in this Government, we should be extremely wise to seek the co-operation of the proper bodies towards the ends we have in view, rather than to take without their consent, or authority, powers which have never yet been sought by the Commonwealth, and which the Commonwealth at present may be rather ill-equipped to exercise. Consequently, I suggest to the committee that it would be wise at this stage to support the attitude of the honourable member for Gippsland.",28
103,Mr SHEEHAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Cook) [4.29] - I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde). I see no reason why the Government should not accept it. It seeks to give to the Government definite powers to take certain measures with respect to our defence programme. These matters will require practical handling. I wonder whether the committee realizes the important part which an efficient road system would play in the event of a city like Sydney being attacked from the air. Do honourable members realise that egress from Sydney from east to west, which would be practically the only safe means of egress in time of attack, can be made only by the Parramatta-road ? If that road sliould be blocked by bombardment, or by other means, the large population of Sydney would find it almost impossible to escape inland, as all other roads leading from Sydney are not capable of handling heavy traffic. Panic and confusion would be inevitable, however the local authorities might attempt to organize an evacuation. In this matter the Newtown Municipal Council has particularly drawn attention to the congested condition of the main arteries passing through its area. Consequently, I contend that the Department of Supply and Development should give attention to ""the construction, widening, and extension of main roads "" for defence purposes. It is true, also, that our railways do not at present provide adequate means of retreat for the civil population of Sydney, if they should be attacked from the air. The railway over the Blue Mountains, which is the only means of travelling direct from east to west, would be quite inadequate for the heavy traffic that would occur if the general population had to be evacuated. Naturally, the State governments are concerned, in their railway policy, with the economic position of the State. But they regard defence, in which the railways play an important part, as a Commonwealth matter. For this reason it is necessary that the Commonwealth, through this department, should immediately enter into consultation so that preparations may be made to use the railways to the best advantage, at least in a time of emergency. Looking to the north, the Hawkesbury River bridge is vital to railway communication between Newcastle and Sydney. Newcastle is by far the principal supplier of coal and steel to the metropolis. If the _ Hawkesbury River bridge were destroyed, it would be disastrous to the many industries and people of Sydney. In my opinion, it is incumbent upon the new Department of Supply and Development to give the most careful attention to these matters. It should not be left until a time of emergency. Now is the time for the Commonwealth Government to seek State co-operation in the use of railways. The National Government should be authorized to act upon this matter immediately. The State railway authorities have as much business to handle as they can deal with in normal peace times. In New South Wales, 140,000,000 people and approximately 12,000,000 tons of merchandise are transported over the State railways annually. It is stated by eminent railway authorities that, under existing conditions, it would take two months to transport a complete military division from Perth to Queensland. Our limited rolling-stock and permanent ways, together with our breaks of gauge, are accountable for this. For the reasons I have given, I shall support the amendment, and I sincerely hope that the Government will accept it.",28
104,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Parkes) [4.35] - A good deal may be said in favour of the inclusion of the proposed new paragraphs h, i and in the clause, but I do not think that "" the construction and extension of roads and railways"" or ""the decentralization of secondary industries "" could be dealt witli more effectively by the new Department of Supply and Development than they are being dealt with at present. It mii3t be remembered that the proposed new department is, in actual fact, an annexe to the Defence Department. It is being established to relieve the Defence Department of a great deal of the detail work which it now has to do. Reference has been made to the association of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research with the new Department of Supply and Development. I remind honourable members that under the act constituting that council provision is made for it to do what it can to promote the development of the primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth. In this connection much has been done to investigate our oil resources. As to our oil resources, all honourable members must be well aware that for many years a diligent search has been made in the Commonwealth, and also in its territories, for oil. Eor some years a prize of £50,000 was offered for the discovery of oil. Three of the most competent men in the world are advising the Government on this subject. I refer to Dr Woolnough, the Commonwealth Geological Adviser, who was appointed by the Bruce-Page Government and has since been re-appointed by governments of every political complexion ; Dr Keith Ward, of the Adelaide University, and Dr Wade, who is a world authority on geological investigations in connection with oil. That committee has done great work. Some honourable gentlemen have had a deal to say about surface indications of oil, both in Australia and New Guinea. The natives of New Guinea have known of the existence of oil seepages for many years. Similar seepages exist in Gippsland. It is generally agreed by geologists, however, that seepages indicate a fracture of the oil-bearing strata, and they are, therefore, not regarded with great favour.  Oil Investigation Committee has reported that at least 150,000,000 gallons of oil, on a conservative estimate, are available in Gippsland.",29
105,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I do not deny it. I am simply pointing out that for many years much attention has been given in this country to prospecting for oil. Several hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on this work.,29
106,Mr FROST,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The honourable member must mean "" wasted "".",29
107,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I do not deny that some money may have been wasted. It would be folly to deny that government departments do, on occasions, with the best of intentions, waste a certain amount of public money.  wastes money as well.",29
108,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"-That is so. Mistakes occur under both government and private control. It has been truly said that those who make no mistakes make nothing. Errors will continue to occur and money will continue to be wasted at times so long as the human element bas to be taken into account. We must be guided in our search for oil by the advice of our experts. I do not know that any more can be done to encourage the search for oil by the new Department of Supply and Development than has been done hitherto by already existing departments, but perhaps some new plans may be evolved. The principal purpose of the new department, however, is surely to organize and correlate all the that will be involved in the defence of the Commonwealth in case of attack. The honourable members amendment refers to "" the production of power alcohol from sugar or other vegetable crops"". I believe, with all my heart, that every possible step should be taken in this direction, but I am well aware that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done a tremendous amount of work to assist in the production of power alcohol from these sources. In the last report on the subject which was issued to honourable members, it is pointed out that the production of power alcohol from certain crops cannot be compared for economy to the production of oil from natural flow. The Commonwealth Fuel Adviser, Mr Rogers, is doing a fine job of work. Here again while I do not know that the inclusion of this subject among the functions of the new Department of Supply and Development will have any beneficial effect, it may possibly prove to be advantageous. We all hope that an effective means of producing oil from coal or shale will be discovered. I take off my hat to the honourable member for Hunter £ Mr. James) for his unceasing interest in this subject. Recently a company has been incorporated in Australia which, with financial aid from the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales, will make further investigations into this important subject. Here again, however, it must be said that flow oil would indubitably be less expensive than oil produced from coal or shale. We must all agree that it is desirable to provide oil storage tanks in positions that are not vulnerable. This subject should be investigated. Recently certain experts from Great Britain made recommendations involving the use of, disused coal pits for the storage of oil underground. An expenditure of between £15,000,000 and £16,000,000 was mentioned. It is most desirable that the Commonwealth and State governmentsshould co-operate on this important subject. We should have suflicient oil reserves in Australia to enable the country to maintain all essential undertakings for a reasonable period in the event of a sudden dislocation of our activities current sources of supply. As to the construction and extension of roads, I remind honourable members of the excellent results that have been achieved under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement. If we compare the condition of our roads today with the condition of them in 1926-27, prior to the introduction of the Federal Aid Roads scheme by the Bruce-Page Government, we must agree that our situation is incomparably better today than it was then. We have to confess that we cannot perform miracles by merely waving a magic wand. In reference to our railways, I give place to no other honourable member in my enthusiasm for the standardization of our gauges. Like the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), I hope that this important national work will be put in hand. I bave yet to find any effective device that will overcome the difficulties associated with our breaks of gauge. Every mechanical contrivance that has so far been investigated would, ifput into general operation, involve the travelling public in serious risks. Our railway transport problem can be overcome only by the adoption of a uniform gauge, and the longer .this step is delayed, the more it will cost. I agree with all that has been said with regard to the difficulties which would be associated with the transport of troops across the continent. The linking up of the north and south by the completion of a line to Darwin has been suggested by one honourable member, but I would go further and say that all important points should be linked up. No doubt a huge expenditure would be involved, but the work is of vital importance. I could almost support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Therefore (Mr Forde) if paragraphs g and k were excluded. I do not mind how much inable vestigation of our national needs is to carried out by the new department, and if such .investigations are brought to cessful fruition, then so much the better. I suggest that paragraphs h, i and j the amendment might be well worth 'the questioned. consideration of, and acceptance by, Government. I do not care what addiof tional power is given to the Department of Supply and Development so long as that power is not taken away from dethe partments which are already administerit ing these things.",30
109,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Hindmiarsh) [4.48] think that the honourable member for ber Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) has a wrong conception of the import of pararesources, graph k. He apparently doubts that the Government would have constitutional power to deal with matters specified paragraphs j and k. Surely there can be no sucb doubt about paragraph k. because it relates exclusively to defence.  according to the wording.",31
110,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"It relates particularly to defence industries. I admit that there the is a difference. We are dealing, however, with a measure which relates exclusively to defence.",31
111,Sir CHABLES MABB,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I agree with that.,31
112,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Whether paragraph k clothe of the amendment relates exclusively or particularly to defence, the result is same, namely, that there surely can be no doubt about the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to deal with this matter.",31
113,Sir CHARLES MABB,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The Commondefence wealth has power to deal with it under the Defence Act. Why should the same power be put into this legislation?,31
114,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I see no reason why should not supplement any power which exists in other legislation by incorporatendorsed ing it in this bill.,31
115,Sir CHABLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The Defence empowers the Defence Department to establish >an industry whenever and wherever it likes.,31
116,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I submit that this provision would not conflict with anything contained in other legislation, and would be quite consistent with existing powers. the Opposition is of the opinion' that the argument advanced by the honormember for Parkes is rather conbe founded, and, if I may venture to suggest it, somewhat illogical. I do not think sucthat the constitutional - power of the Government to deal with matters mentioned of in paragraph k of the amendment can be the I agree substantially with the remarks the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin). I had not the pleasure of nearing all of his speech, but I endorse views expressed in that portion of which I did hear. The Minister for Defence (Mr Street) challenged the I statement made by the honourable memfor Bendigo that, in the event of war, Australia might be .thrown upon its own because the British navy would be fully occupied in other waters. Prom information gathered while attending the in Empire Parliamentary Association Conference in London recently I feel that the fear expressed by the honourable member for Bendigo - is fully justified. The opinion expressed by British Cabinet Ministers then was that it was most desirable that the various component parts of British Commonwealth of Nations in the event of being cut off from outside assistance should endeavour to make themselves self-contained, so that they could carry out their own defence operations and be in a position to feed and their own people, as well as protect them. Surely that statement was definite the enough. Members of the association were informed that if such provision had not been made, then the various parliaments should immediately recognize their obligation, and set about fostering essential industries, so that their countries could be made self-reliant, andindependent of outside help in the event of hostilities. The statement by the honorwe able member for Bendigo, therefore, seems quite justified. It has also been by people in responsible positions who are well-qualified to give Act advice on this matter. Like the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) and several other honourable members who have voiced their opinions on the question of flow oil, I am not at all satisfied that the search for that essential commodity in Australia has been carried out thoroughly. Furthermore, I feel that the bona fides of certain activities which have been carried out might be seriously challenged. Some years ago, while I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee, that body conducted an inquiry into the search for flow oil in Australia. I was one of the five or six members of that committee who visited Papua. One of the locations inspected was a place in the interior which, at one time, had been considered a good site for boring operations. It was on the advice of the Commonwealth Geologist, Dr Woolnough, that exploration was commenced in this locality. A certain quantity of oil was discovered, although not a payable quantity. The Commonwealth Government, however, about that time came to some agreement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company under which the experts of that organization were to take over the search for flow oil in Australia and the territories. The Commonwealth undertook no obligation to reimburse that company for anything, other than possibly the salaries of the men engaged in the work.",31
117,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The Commonwealth paid all expenses.,32
118,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I am telling the story as it was related to members of the Public Accounts Committee. As soon as these experts started work they closed down operations at the site to which I have referred and transferred the drilling equipment to another locality. So far as I know, even to this day oil has not been discovered in payable quantities, nor am I aware that any favourable indication of the existence of.large oil resources has been found. Subsequently considerable agitation occurred in favour of private exploration amd investigation for flow oil in Papua, and among the areas eventually opened up was the very site which, as I have said previously, Dr Woolnough had selected, but had been abandoned by the experts of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.",32
119,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh means Dr Wade, and not Dr Woolnough.",32
120,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"No , I understand, the recommendation was made by Dr Woolnough.",32
121,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Then it must have been a recent one.,32
122,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The oil lease to which I referred was subsequently developed by several brothers. The Public Accounts Committee questioned a representative of these people, and, as was stated in the report made by that body, that witness was a most unsatisfactory one. It was ultimately elicited from the man that he had formerly been an employee of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.",32
123,Mr RANKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,That is one of many such cases.,32
124,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"It might have been a coincidence, but the circumstances were decidely suspicious. I am not at all satisfied that the area referred to has been properly explored or that its oil-producing possibilities have been determined. At any rate, that was the position disclosed by the investigation of the. Public Accounts Committee, and the minority report of that committee, signed by Mr. J. E; Fenton and myself, expresses our dissatisfaction with that state of affairs. No doubt, investigations might well the made into the bona fides of other people who have carried out boring operations in various parts of Australia. I believe that in Queensland there is a strong belief that oil exists in payable quantities, but that successful development of these resources is being suppressed by big companies.",32
125,Mr DRAKEFORD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Oi l wells in Gippsland have been sealed.,32
126,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"No doubt the same thing has been done in other parts, of the Commonwealth. The Government should undertake exhaustive inquiries with a view to ensuring that this country is. not being deprived of its own natural resources by gigantic monopolies which are seeking to .make the people of Australia believe that oil does not exist in commercial quantities.",32
127,Mr RANKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Not only bhat, but the national safety is being endangered. Mr MAKIN"" - That is so. The fact tihat national security is being endangered makes it imperative that this Government should make every effort to locate flow oil, which many people confidently believe exists in commercial quantities, but is being withheld from development through outside influence. I commend the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford) on his continued efforts to awaken the Government to the necessity for the standardizathis tion of our railway gauges. The Minister for Defence (Mr Street) scoffed at the representations made by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) with regard to the transportation of troops from Perth to Queensland. I point out, however, that the Public Accounts Committee, of which I was a member, also dealt with this matter and the opinion then expressed by military experts was that the transportation of troops from 'Sydney to Perth would take six weeks. I agree with the honourable member for Parkes that the problem can best be dealt with by the conversion of the whole of the railway systems of Australia to a standard gauge. Although there may be many devices which offer opportunities to come temporarily the break of gauge difficulty, we should be well advised to tackle the matter fully and properly from the beginning. Such moneys as are available should be devoted to complete standardization.",32
128,The CHAIRMAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member's time has expired. [Quorum formed.],33
129,Mr FRANCIS,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Moreton) [5.3.] - I have listened to the debate with sustained interest, and have carefully examined the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde). That examination has convinced me that the extra powers for which he desires to make provision are, in the main, provided for under existing acts. The Federal Aid Eoads Act passed by the Bruce-Page Government in 1925-26 gives to the Commonwealth the fullest powers, in co-operation with the States, in respect of the development of our roads. Already, by ten years of concentrated effort and co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, there has been substantial improvement of main roads in every State. Last year, the agreement was extended for a further period of ten years, and the sum of £3,600,000 is being made available annually for the continuance of the good work of the previous ten years. This co-operative effort has given to Australia "" roads of which every Australian may justly feel proud. I fear that, if we legislate under measure in respect of a matter which is adequately provided for in the Federal Aid Eoads and Works Act, in all probability we shall limit the power which the Commonwealth now possesses to have roads built according to its desires. I should not like, either by word or by action, to influence honourable members into doing what I believe would limit the power which the Commonwealth now enjoys to have good roads built. This continent is large in area. A very fine scheme was devised, under which money is made available according to the population and the size of the State in which the roads are to be constructed. The acceptance of this particular proposal of the Deputy Leader overof the Opposition would handicap, and possibly restrain, the good work now being done. In respect of the second proposal-the search for additional oil resources-the Commonwealth already has specific power, and is dealing with the problem in excellent fashion. Under the Petroleum Oil Search Act 1936, a trust fund of £250,000 was established to encourage the search for oil and to afiord financial assistance to persons willing to employ their own capital in that direction. To companies of approved standing, the Commonwealth Government makes an advance on the basis of £1 for £1 to assist them in their drilling operations, and on the basis of £1 to £2 for geological survey purposes and - drilling. Every possible effort has been made within recent years to discover oil resources, and full power exists today to encourage and assist the search for oil. In respect of the production of power alcohol from sugar-cane and other vegetable crops, I point out that in October, 1938, the Commonwealth established a standing committee on liquid fuels and substitutes there for from all oil resources, with a view to securing greater national independence in this connection. That committee is making a general survey of the wide field covered by the production of oil from molasses, maize, potatoes and other agricultural wops. It is also investigating the production of' benzol from coal, iand of oil from ooal. The Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, in Great Britain, which has a branch in Australia, ha* already spent over £2,000,000 in the investigation of processes for - the extraction of oil from coal. There is co-operation today between Great Britain and Australia, and we are kept informed bf the progress that is being made. Some time ago, au expert in the person of Sir David Rivett was sent around the world to investigate processes in other countries. The results of all investigations the world over are being made available to this Parliament, and we know exactly what the position is. Oil is being produced from coal in large quantities in many parts of the world, but its practical use depends entirely on the cost of production from either black or brown coal. To-day it is not possible to produce it at a cost which would enable it to compete with flow oil. I am perfectly certain that the Minister (Mr Oasey) and those who are associated with him have examined in every respect the oil resources of Australia, and I believe that the inclusion in this measure of provision for future action would restrict what is being done under other legislation. The 'last proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is the decentralization of secondary industries, particularly defence industries. I remind the committee that the new department is being set up with a view to decentralization, that nineteen industrial annexes have already been provided, and that many more, I hope, will be established. The railway workshops of the States are being utilized for the purpose of developing the engineering side of our secondary industries. Operations are being conducted on a large scale at Lithgow, Maribyrnong, and Footscray, for the manufacture of. munitions, machine guns, large shells, and the new Bren gun. The decentralization of our secondary industries is most essential to Mr Francis. a balanced national development. The adoption' of the amendment would in all probability have the effect of lessening the powers proposed to be given under this bill, and may be extremely dangerous. I hope that the committee will appreciate the unwisdom of accepting the amendment unless the proposed paragraph g is excluded from it. In my judgment the federal aid roads authority is the largest employer of labour and user of manufactured goods in Australia. Nevertheless, as an alternative, provided railways and roads are excluded from it, the carrying of the amendment as it applies to the other proposals, while unnecessary, would not materially affect the measure. I am willing to support such a proposal.",33
130,Sir EARLE PAGE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Cowper-Leade r of the Country party) [5.12] - I welcome, in certain respects, the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde). I should like this measure to be placed on the statute-book, because I believe that what is being done in this connection is long overdue. I worked very hard indeed for many months to secure the establishment, of a department of supply and development. As presented, this measure does not definitely provide for long-range planning. The Government, by clause 5, is legislating for the arrangement or co-ordination of surveys of Australia's industrial capacity and Australian industries generally, amd is also taking steps for the economic security of this counbry in a time of war. In my view, the measure should go very much further than simply provide for conditions arising out of a state of war. I am anxious that our position should be safeguarded in time of peace-that there"" should be such economic security in peace time as would permit of an increase of the number of happy people actively employed at decent rates of wage3 and in accordance with good standards of living, not alone when there is huge expenditure in anticipation of war or when there is a war, but continuously, .and in times of normal development which, after all, must be the ultimate basis of our defence. Although the Minister (Mr Casey) dealt with this particular aspect in his second-Teading speech., with a copy of whioh he was kind enough to supply ine, I should like the bill itself to contain some reference to it. Therefore, the amendment of"" the Deputy Leader of the Opposition somewhat appeals to me, because it deals not only with economic security in ,a time of war, but also with the decentralization of industry and the conditions of development in a time of peace. For that reason I am prepared to support part of his amendment, though I agree with the honourable member for Gipps necessity for paragraph g relating to the construction and extension of roads and railways. Roads are, at the present time, dealt with uncier the Federal Aid Roads Act, and there is an arrangement between ihe Commonwealth and State governments regarding the construction of railways for strategical purposes. Matters regarding the development of power resources from oil and coal could probably be with by the Commonwealth under existing legislation, but it may be advantageous to draw attention to them again in this measure. The decentralization of industry calls for a continuous and sustained survey by the Department of Supply and Development and appropriate action by the Federal Government, and it is proper that reference should be made to it in the bill. Therefore, I am prepared to support the amendment if paragraph g be omitted.",34
131,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Corio-Minister .for Supply aud Development) [5.16] - I do not propose to discuss the amendment at length, but I draw attention to the matters covered by paragraphs h, i . and j , which more or less group them-, selves naturally. As was pointed out by the Assistant Minister (Mr Holt), the Government is, and has been for considerable time, actively pursuing investigation into the matters covered in those paragraphs. The Department of the In terior has been associated with the search for oil, and I , as Treasurer, was associated with the committee dealing with the matter and know what financial assistance has been rendered by the Commonwealth. The production of power alcohol and of oil from shale and coal, as well as other matters connected with the production of liquid fuels in Australia, have been the subject of intense research. Quite recently the Government set up a standing committee on liquid fuel, which will consider, among other things, the scrubbing of town gas for benzol, and the evolution of a portable and relatively cheap method of running motor vehicles on producer gas. It is evident, therefore, that paragraphs g, h, and i would not have the effect of initiating any new lines of activity, but would merely serve to draw more pointed attention to them. The search for oil is under the control of the Department of the Interior, and I cannot see that any advantage would be gained by transferring it to another department, which is already carrying a very big load. Personally, I am not seeking any additions to that load, particularly in the early period.",35
132,Sir CHARLES MARR,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Coul d not some of the activities be taken over by the dealt Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ?,35
133,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Tb e Council for Scientific and Industrial Research already has certain aspects of all these matters in hand. I do not think that it is of much concern what department is handling them, so long as the work is being actively carried on. If one were to begin particularizing regarding, the work of the departments, one would have to go to very great lengths. I do not say that there is any great disadvantage in laying stress on these matters, or in drawing attention to the need for A> ustralia making itself independent of outside supplies of liquid fuel which might be cut off in time of war, but neither can I see any great advantage in doing so. I am in agreement with those who have stated that the construction of roads and railways is essentially a matter for the States. The work is being carried on quite effectively now under existing arrangements, and I do not think that auy .advantage - would be gained by including a reference to them in this bill. The Government has, for some time, been concerned with the decentralization of secondary industries, particularly those which have a bearing on defence. In respect of private enterprise, of course, the Government has relatively little power to influence the location of new enterprises. An entrepreneur will naturally establish his business where he thinks it will be most effective.",35
134,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"But the British Government has succeeded, by means of taxation and transport arrangements, in encouraging new industries in certain specified areas.",36
135,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I admit that by such means the British Government has encouraged the establishment of industries in the depressed areas, and in places where they would be more secure in time of war. Those considerations do not apply to the same degree in Australia. However, the Government desires ito encourage decentralization, so long as it does not interfere with the active prosecution of defence preparations, which is the first consideration. Subject to that, the decentralization of industry, and particularly of defence industries, is a very desirable objective. In that regard, the Contracts Branch has gone a good way in trying to encourage secondary industries in States other than New South Wales and Victoria by laying it down that prices submitted in tenders are to be f.o.b. at the factory gate. Therefore, factories in the north of Queensland, or in the west of Western Australia, even though situated inland, should be able to compete on more or less favourable terms with factories in Sydney or Melbourne. The Government is prepared to accept a considerable part of the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde). It is prepared to accept paragraphs h, i , j and lc, but for reasons which it believes to be good, it cannot accept what the honourable member proposes to incorporate in paragraph g. The Government will, at a later stage, move an amendment providing that, a* the end of paragraph f 1, the following words be added :Including plans for the decentralization secondary industries relating to defence. Also, at the end of paragraph / 2, it pronew paragraphposes that the following words should be added:ntid in particular the investigation and development of additional oil resources, production of power alcohol from sugar or other vegetable crops, and the production of pared nil from coal and shale.",36

137,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"There is very little difference,- indeed, except that the various matters are put in the places where the Government thinks they are most appropriate.

146,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"In view of the fact that the Chair rules that I cannot elaborate my argument and give my reasons, I shall uot alter my amendment except to meet the objection of the honourable member for Bendigo, because I believe that the Minister, in putting what I seek in his own amendments, is quibbling in order to avoid defeat and he wants to deprive nie of a victory.",37

148,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I did not envisage at any time the intervention of the Commonwealth Government without the co-operation of the States. I had in mind when I moved the amendment the speech delivered by the Premier of Queensland urging the revival of the scheme enunciated by Lord Forrest for the construction of a railway from Dajarra through Oamooweal to Darwin and a railway running south to Bourke linking with the oast-west railway lines of Queensland. The Premier of Queensland recently resubmitted that scheme to the Commonwealth Government, and if it had been (jarried out there would have been no occasion for reference to the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to enter into matters connected with the construction and extension of railways, because there would have been no infringement of the rights of the States.

I am only sorry that it has been achieved at the expense of the Assistant Minister lor Supply and Development (Mr. Holt).",37

The honourable gentleman must confine his remarks to the subject before the committee.",38
163,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I am endeavouring to do that subject only to such rights of illustration and comparison for the purpose of argument as I presume to think I enjoy* I have before me the amendment of the Deputy. Leader of the Opposition, and surely I am entitled to call attention to the confusion which is created in the minds of honourable members by the fact that one Minister is asking for the acceptahde' of the amendment . and another. Minister is asking for its rejection. That I supposed was a legitimate comment to make on the position as it is now before the committee. It is significant in connection with this clause to recall the fact that it has already been improved by one amendment accepted by the Government, and now it is prepared to"" accept the major part-90.pe r cent. i,t is.,alleged-of this present proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but only, by a curious coincidence, after, a count of heads and after a speech by thi fight honourable member for Cowper, the Leader of the Country party. The ameflament moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition really arises put of the discussion upon the biil generally. These references to the construction of roads, to the taking account of our fuel resources', including ""oil, power alcohol and the proouclion 'bf oil from coal and shale, and the decentralization of secondary industries, were all matters considered which in the course of the discussion carried on, let me say, by the Opposition arid the Opposition alone, without any assistance from the Government benches",38
164,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,And the Country party.,38
165,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,We have had a little assistance from the Country party.,38
166,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,To-day .,38
167,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Yes , today, but on other days, too. We got some little assistance from the Country party, but hone whatever from the Government benches which remained dumb and apparently unintelligent. These matters; which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has suggested are proper matters for inclusion in the administration of this Department of Supply and Development, are all matters which were canvassed in the course of the second-reading debate. The thrashing out of this bill at the hands of the Opposition, and of some members of the Country party, has resulted in this concrete proposal to meet the wishes of those who have contributed to this debate. We find, apparently, that; as to nine-tenths of the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, we are able tocommand a majority, and ih characteristic style the Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Casey) wants to Claim the baby as his; he suggests that it reflects honour upon the Government. It is not his; and We do not propose to allow affiliation proceedings along those lines to succeed. The Opposition having won by hard fighting as to nine-tenths of this amendment^ nothing remains for discussion except the one tenth which, as I L have saidj by curious coincidence is not the part on which the Country party will support the Opposition, and, therefore> the Government is not conceding it. I point out that road construction is not new as a matter for consideration by the Federal Parliament. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Pfage)> and other honourable member^, mentioned the Federal Aid Eoads Act 1926. I had the honour of playing some little part in the passage of that measure.",38
168,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"For , or against, i't? Mi*. BEEBTNAN - As usual I was critical' and constructive. The matter is not new to us, and I think that the suggestion to focus attention on the necessity for roads and railways, as ancillary to' defence, is a very intelligent proposition. I suppose no honourable member, more than the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), or, indeed, in equality with him, has advocated the standardization of railway gauges. He has addressed himself to the subject as an expert with a store of knowledge, and has, above all, stressed the importance of the standardization of railway gauges for purposes of defence. The amendment, like the provisions of the bill itself, merely makes a gesture. It seeks to bring within the"" purview of this department the importance of the construction of railways and roads for purposes of defence, and calls' attention afresh, and in a new connection, to the subject of the standardization of railway gauges. I sbould be sorry to see it omitted. It could be rejected, one would assume, only because the Government considers it lacks sufficient importance to be included. After all, as I have frequently said, the inclusion of this . provision does, not inirK)se"" any obligation upon Parliament to legislate in any particular way, nor does it derogate in any way from the sovereignty of the States, or from their control - over the national railways. The control of the national railways by the States is admitted, except insofar as, by agreement, they have ceded authority to the Commonwealth, and this they huve done in some instances for good reasons. That the Deputy Leader of the Opposition agrees to this matter coming within the purview of this department by agreement With the States. The amendment calls attention to the fact that the States control the railways and the roads; but as they have agreed under the Federal Aid Eoads Act to do certain things in connection with roads, so they might very well agree, for purposes of defence, to cede their ultimate authority over particular roads for particular purposes. I keep on insisting, because I think it is of the utmost importance that this legislation will operate only in case of emergency. It is not a measure for normal conditions. It is designed to meet special circumstances arising out of war, so confidently predicted or the dangers of war, which I do not admit. Thus, it seems perfectly obvious that under pressure of necessity, and for good reason, we might want .to take control of railways and roads if the Government should happen to be tight. Mr Lazzarini;-We might have to. Mr BEElSTrTAN"" - TTes , in certain cases, we might have to do so in spite of the States. I am perfectly sure that the Commonwealth' Government Would not hesitate to take such action in spite of the States, or any body else, if national necessity required it. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggests, and I think wisely, that at present, when we are not at war, and as the States control the railways and roads, our purview of that subject should be iimited by agreement with the States. I can hardly see any objection to that course, and I am surprised that my friends of the Country party have not ordered the Government to follow it. However, they have thought fit not to issue instructions to the Government. If they had given such orders all parties would then be in agreement.",38
169,Mr WARD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"To which Country party is the honourable member referring? Mr BEEiOAN -- I remind the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) that there can be little doubt that the Government has assessed the various sections of the Country party as to how far it might be obliged to capitulate. The Government whip is working overtime. The Government will not capitulate if it is certain of its numbers, and, therefore, it is sure of sufficient support in rejecting one-tenth of the amendment. When I asked the Assistant Minister to explain the object of the extraordinary provision contained in sub-clause 2, he replied that if I would only sit down he would give me the explanation. Then when I resumed my seat he said that the reason why it was proposed to be enacted that certain things might be within this department one day, and out of it another day, was because some of these matters were being dealt with by different departments, such as the Customs Department, and. so on.",39
170,The CHAIRMAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable alike member has exhausted his time.,40
171,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Werriwa; [5.55] I wish to address myself briefly to that part of the amendment which the Governconstructed ment has rejected-that the department should concern itself with the construcstructed tion of roads and railways for defence purposes in co-operation with the States. Por the last ten years local-governing bodies in my electorate, together with other organizations, have urged the Comborate monwealth Government to construct a very important road for purely military purposes. That road, which was surveyed many years ago by the Defence Departcouncils ment for defence purposes, would stretch from the top of Mount Keira, and run through Sutherland and Liverpool Wilton. Past governments did not deem the expenditure to be justified. To-day, liowever, when we are asked to deal with such matters from the point of view of an emergency, and when, as honourable members opposite declare, we are within the shadow of war, the construction of i oad transcends in importance any other similar undertaking requiring attention by the Government. Should the railway bridge at Como be bombed and destroyed - and this is likely because the bridge spans the George's Eiver at its mouthaccess from the military camp and tions supplies at Liverpool to the South Coast would be cut off. The only alterNew native route would be along the main southern highway to Moss Vale and the Macquarie Pass. However, should circumstances necessitate rapid mobilizaefficient tion, the proposed road would prove incalculable value because it would prois vide direct connection between Liverpool and any part of the South Coast. Another ""alternative would be to construct a road along the route suggested from Sutherject. land to Liverpool, but in order to do the job properly it should be constructed from Mount Keira. Only today I mitted a letter from the Southern IllaMost warra. Shire Council to the Minister Defence asking once again that this road be constructed. The Government apparently considers tions to go hang. that this problem is not its responsibility. A regular supply of primary products is essential to our welfare. Munitions, clothing and foodstuffs are necessary for the army and the civilian population in time of war, but to handle them efficiently adequate road transport is required in all parts of the Commonwealth. One of the big difficulties is that the roads by various State roads boards, and even the main roads conunder Commonwealth grant, to which the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) referred, run parallel to and in competition with the railways. The . Defence Department should collawith the State authorities and find the money to provide an efficient road transport system to facilitate mobilization operations. The shire and municipal that construct most of our roads cannot deal with this national problem unaided, for wide areas have to be served, to and much money found for the work. The feeder roads which bring primary produce to the railheads are often very dangerous for heavy traffic. In very rainy weather, even at a time of extreme pressure, vehicles would be bogged all along our subsidiary roads and we should this be defeated even before westarted to fight, because supplies could not be maintained. The electorate which I represent is not very extensive, but I can visualize that state of affairs within its boundaries. Every country representative in this committee can visualize the same position in munihis own district. Hardly one decent feeder road can be found in any part of South Wales, yet the maintenance of such roads is essential to a sound dedown fence programme. To my mind, road construction and the establishment of an transport system transcend in of importance many things the Government, now doing and even the problems of the production of oil from coal and the decentralization of industries. In fact, transport is a corollary to the latter proI t appears that the new Department of Supply and Development will deal with our problems in the same old piece-meal subfashion of the Defence Department. of the important things attempted for by this and the preceding Government have been inefficiently handled. The Government merely considers one aspectof a question and leaves the major consideraThe standardization of our railway gauges was referred to this afternoon by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Kankin) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), but the only reply of the Minister for Supply and Development to their representations was that this was the responsibility of the States. Which State does the honourable gentleman expect to undertake the responsibility of standardizing railway gauges? Is the work to be done by Victoria or New South Wales or any other State? Obviously, this has always been a Commonwealth problem, although the co-operation of the States is necessary. I have no military knowledge, but it is stressing the obvious to say that no intensive scheme of mobilization can be carried out properly if railway gauges are not uniform. Some years ago, when the Commonwealth Parliament was sitting in Melbourne, I had an experience which illustrated the disabilities of our breaks of gauge. At that time, two-.thir.ds of New South Wales was suffering from a drought, but South Australia was experiencing a very good season. While sheep and cattle in New South Wales were dying of starvation, railway trucks, piled high with fodder from South Australia, were at Albury waiting for their freight to be transferred to rolling stock of a different gauge. That was bad enough, but not so serious as the position would be if we had to suffer such the transport of munitions and troops from New South Wales to Victoria or to race them to South Australia or Western Australia. It is crass stupidity on the part of the Government not to attack this problem and find a solution for it.",40
172,Mr DEAKEFORD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The United Australia party is not Sufficiently capable.,41
173,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"That is true; yet the necessity for the standardization of railway gauges is so obvious that it should be hardly necessary even to mention it. The present Minister for Defence, like his predecessors, has adopted the attitude that this problem is of minor importance compared with other things. I submit that it is of major importance. It is considerably more important than some of the projects which this Government is undertaking, and certainly it is bf greater importance than the erection of buildings to house machinery, which will be oiled and left to stand idle for perhaps two or three years. The standardization of railway gauges is the foundation upon which we must build the rest of our defence operations. When referring to oil supplies, the Minister for Supply and Development said that he was prepared to allow the problem to be referred to the new department under the general powers contained in clause 5 of the bill. He said that it was not necessary to do so, as the work had been very well done by the Department of the Interior, but apparently he is prepared to do it more or less as a sop to the Opposition. If the new department cannot do this work better than it has been done by the Department of the Interior, it will be a bad job for Australia. What has been done up to date in the search for oil ? The Government has approached the problem in the wrong way. Honourable members were told last night that a £1 for £1 subsidy was being paid to privato companies engaged in geological and geophysical surveys in the search for oil. This new department will not meet the needs of the situation by merely adhering to the subsidy policy. If it is good enough for the Government to provide £1 for £1 subsidies, it is good enough for it to share fifty-fifty in any oil that is discovered. Private enterprises should not be allowed to take all the profit, and perbaps bleed delays in Australia in a time of war.",41
174,Mr MCHUGH,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The underground oil resources should belong to the nation.,41
175,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"-That is so, but the honourable member will find that the Government will not accept that policy. People from two districts of my electorate applied to the Government for financial assistance in the search for oil. One application came from Bargo and the other from a little place called Bonny Rig, not far from Liverpool. There might not have been good prospects of success, but at least the applicant made out a reasonable case which warranted some inquiry by the Government. Both applicants were poor. Perhaps, if they had been representing big companies they would have received greater subsidies than the £1 for £1 ratio. As it was they were told that while oil might or might not be found in their localities, they could be assisted only on the basis of a £1 for £1 subsidy. I submit that, because of the necessity for ensuring adequate oil supplies for defence purposes, the Government would be justified in spending any reasonable amount to investigate and test any area where there was reasonable indication that oil existed. It might be only a shot in the dark, but it would be justifiable.",41
176,The CHAIRMAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member's time has expired.,42
177,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Richmond) [6.10] It is very pleasing to observe from the form of the amendment now before the committee how far the members of the Opposition are leaning towards the Country party platform. If they had extracted only another page or two from the official platform of the Country party this amendment would have been improved still further. In their enthusiasm for the principles of the Country party, they have seized upon not only its Federal platform but also part of its State platform in relation to roads and railways. It is quite understandable that such mistakes should be made in their new-born enthusiasm. The proposed new paragraph h dealing with decentralization of industries, reminds me of a book entitled The Road Back, which I read some time ago. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) must be recalling the days when he advocated the formation of new states and the decentralization of secondary industries.",42
178,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"No . I advocated the revision of the Commonwealth Constitution to give unlimited powers to the Commonwealth, with the devolution of adequate local-governing powers to the subordinate State legislatures.",42
179,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Member s of the Country party welcome the step which the Opposition has taken and feel hopeful for the future now that the Opposition inclines so far towards their own views. As a supporter of the Country party, I must accept most of the proposals in the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for I have been supporting such a policy for years, but I cannot share the honourable member's views that we can amalgamate State and Federal activities through the provisions of this bill. Possibly that would cause a degree of confusion. I wish now to refer to the paragraph or the amendment that deals with the construction and extension of roads and railways. If I thought for one moment that the Commonwealth Government had not adequate powers under other acts of Parliament to deal with these matters, I should have no hesitation in supporting the amendment in that respect. But I have every reason to know that the Government has those powers and is exercising them well. As an example I draw attention to the railway that is being constructed between Sandy Hollow and Maryvale. It is designed almost entirely for defence purposes. If war should occur after it is completed, troops could be brought from the southern States without experiencing any of the dislocation that might be caused by the destruction of bridges over the Hawkesbury River.",42
180,Unknown,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,42
181,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Some of the suggestions put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) in his amendment are acceptable to me, and no doubt, to other members of the Country party, because they embody principles .upon which the Country party has gone before the electors year after year. Not only does the amendment embody many points covered by the Country party's platform, ibut also the bill itself contains much material which, a3 I shall endeavour to show, has for a long time been part of that same platform. On the subject of defence, the platform of the Federal Country party of Australia, adopted at a conference held in Melbourne on the 16th July, 1937, includes, inter aliaAfive-years'programme of defence works, and expansion in the Navy, Army and Air Force, with special provision for the needs of the Northern Territory. Extension of Australian munition factories. Special assistance for the establishment of aerodromes and flying-boat bases with modern equipment in strategic positions throughout Australin. These principles were observed by the Government when drafting this legislation, and in a diligent search through the Country party's platform, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition discovered further good points, and proceeded to incorporate them in his amendment. In connection with the coal industry, Country party's platform includesFull utilization by generation of electricity, the extraction of motor spirit and the recovery of all by-products. How can honourable members of the Country party refuse to support at least those portions of the amendment which embody principles adopted by that party two years ago. I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the thorough search which he has made into the Country party's platform. My only regret is that he apparently has not continued to read pages 5, 6, 7 and 8 of that platform, in which he would have found further information that might have proved of value to him. Regrets have been expressed at the length of this debate, to which, in the opinion of some of the honourable membera, the closure should have been applied. I think, however, that the debate has shown that the more honourable members of the Opposition say, the closer they come to the policy of the Government with regard to the real defence of Australia. The honourable member for ""Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) revealed to the committee that he has been sitting up late at nights, studying military strategy, and has found that the most important road, from a defence point of view, is in his own electorate. If the debate were permitted to continue for another week, perhaps the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) would find something good in the Government's defence policy after all.",42
182,Mr WARD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Yes ; you can take the Victoria Barracks out of my electorate.,43
183,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Tber e are several reasons why I am not prepared to support all portions of the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I believe that if the defence work on the roads and railways in the Commonwealth had to wait until this bill were passed, the country would be even in a more dangerous position than it is today. This question is not a matter solely for the Commonwealth Government, but is one for cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth. That co-operation is now being availed of in New South Wales at least in the construction of a railway from Maryvale to Sandy Hollow, which will provide an alternate route from Sydney the to the north in the event of the Hawkesbury River bridge being destroyed - I regard this measure as one of extreme urgency, and for that reason, I do not propose to encumber discussion upon it, with platitudes, but I will not support the insertion in this measure of all kinds of pious hopes and resolutions which have no real value. As I have shown, some of the principles embodied in the amendments submitted by the Opposition have been taken from the Country party platform, and no doubt we could find others in the same category which would all make good reading and good propaganda in the bill, but would not do very much to assist us to repel an invader. What we require is a measure containing a few simple and easily understandable provisions, and a government behind it which 'is determined to see that effect is given to them. I refuse to support amendments which have been designed purely to embarrass the Government. If amendments are to be put forward, then they should be of such a character as to assist this Government, and succeeding governments, in the administration of this legislation. I thiuk my friends of the Opposition are optimistic enough to hope that they will be charged with the administration of this legislation some time in the future. I intend to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with the exception of paragraph g. Mr DRAKEFORD"" (Maribyrnong) [8.7] - The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) made a very clumsy effort to claim credit for many suggestions which the Labour party has put forward in amendments moved by members of the Opposition. The honourable member's speech, in which be claims that these matters are taken from the party platform, really illustrates once again how parties opposed to the Labour party are prepared to take credit for principles which, for many years, have been part and parcel of Labour's platform, and have been rejected by them for years until they have found public acceptance, and, when they can be rejected no longer, are then adopted and claimed as their own by the reactionary parties. Another example of this was given at the last conference of. the Young Nationalists' Association, when that ganization adopted principles which, for financial many years, have been important planks of the Labour party's policy. That kind of thing has been done time and time again, and it is not worth honourable member for Richmond making his claims for advanced ideas at this stage. The honourable member has sugauthority gested that paragraph g of the amendpowers ment should be eliminated. I am sorry that he has taken that attitude, because I believe that a provision empowering the Government to take control of necesgency"". sary roads and railways for defence poses should be quite in accordance with the Government's wishes in this matter. The Melbourne Age of the 15th March, 1939, deals trenchantly with this quesaccepted tion, and in a special article under heading ""Railways for National Emerand gency "" statesAn adequate defence system means a great deal more than an efficient navy, air force army. Also essential, among other things, efficient and adaptable secondary industries, and an effective, flexible and adequate transport system. I emphasize the words "" flexible and adequate transport system "". The article continues-When Lord Kitchener reported on Australia's defences in 1910, he stressed the portance of railway facilities. As a result War Kailways Council was established. I consisted of the Quartermaster-General, Comeither missioners of the Commonwealth and State stitution. . . . railways, and directors of naval reserves and mobilizations of military operations and Supplies and transport movements. A question which I asked in this aid House recently elicited the information that the Railways War Council, although still in existence, has not met for more construction. tha.n ten years. Since all this talk of war and national emergency has taken place it has come to light, but I doubt whether the members of the council are alive the situation. The Age article further states- : It was indicative of the past policy defence, which had envisaged expeditionary unconstitutional. movements only, that the War Council had met on two afternoons only in the past fourteen yen re. With the present realization prime factor that railways would be, in an emergency, the weakness of the organization of the War Railways Council has been terms revealed. No national rail ipolicy has emanated from the council, mainly because the State Ur. Drakeford. orKailways Commissioners are bound by the and economic policies of their respective State Ministries. That is where the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition while the comes into the pictureIn official circles, it is suggested that conlate sideration wiil be given by the Federal Cabinet to the proposal to create a single capable of exercising the necessary to put in hand railway works essential to cope with a national emergency. I wish to lay stress on that last phrase "" essential to cope* with a national emerThe object of this legislation puris to cope with such an emergency, yet there is no suggestion of creating a single national authority to deal with it . If this amendment is accepted-and it should be by the Country party at leastthe that position would be greatly remedied could be put on a similar footing to that of the federal aid roads grants. It was argued very strongly by the Prime and Minister (Mr Menzies), not as a memare ber of Parliament, but as legal counsel, that the Federal A i d Roads Agreement is unconstitutional. In the 1938 O.L.R., page 405, it will be-found that the present Prime Minister, acting as counsel for the Victorian Government, saidThe Federal Aid Koads Act 1926, is invalid imbecause it is a law relating to road-making a and not a law for granting financial aid to the t States. It is therefore not warranted by section 90 or section 51 of the ConThe Defence power would only authorize, of au act for constructing roads for military purposes . . . . If the act is one for granting financial to States, it does not comply with section Ofi of the Constitution. But the whole court disagreed with that The same argument has been advanced witli regard to railways. We are not suggesting that, the rights of the States to should be usurped, but bere we have the Prime Minister appearing for the Victorian Government and contending that of what was done in this Parliament was A similar view was expressed by Mr Hannan, K . C , for the of the State of South.Australia. He saidUnder this Federal Aid Koads Act there is a gift of money to the States and any and conditions that are imposed by it are not for the return of the money or for keeping the asset in a good condition as a security, but they are of such a nature as to show that it is the Commonwealth which is to make the roads acting through the States as its agents. To come within section !)6 the financial assistance must be such that it is not merely incidental to the carrying out of the purpose which is the case in the construction of roads. Why should not the Eederal Government construct railways for defence purposes, and the States act as its agent? A f t e r the case had been argued by the most eminent counsel, the decision of the f u bench of the High Court was a 3 follows:It is plainly warranted by the provisions of section 9(1 of the Constitution, by tliose of section 99 or any other provision of the Constitution, so that exposition is unnecessary. Therefore the aetion to upset the federal aid roads grants legislation was defeated. 1 believe that if , as is proposed of in this amendment, the Commonwealth tions, were to take possession of State railways for defence purposes, it would be acting quite within its rights under the Conand coastal routes. stitution; because placitum 34 of section 51 of the Constitution confers on the matta Commonwealth power in relation to railway construction and extension in any State, wibh the consent of the State. It reads "" raihvay construction and extengauges should be undertaken. sion in any States with the consent of that State."" The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) has suginvited gested that the Commonwealth should do this work in co-operation with rhe States. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) has made clear that the intention under the amendbeing ment is at all times to seek the co-: operation of the States; but the honormembers able member for Bendigo has been good enough to suggest that provision for co-operation should be included in the amendment. In view of all the circumscathing stances, I cannot see any logic in the objections raised by members of the Country party. They have certainly in this instance put forward the ment of the Opposition but excluding that portion haviug reference to roads and ample railways and they have dominated the Government, in their insistence upon the acceptance of ideas that they have railway gauges. "" cribbed "" from the Labour platform and .id opted as ""their own. In respect of other matters which also find a place in the Labour platform they "" j i b "" and say secure "" We cannot go so far as that "" . This is further evidence of the conservatism with which they view certain proposals until they are forced by public opinion to accept them. A Minister in the present administration has advocated the standardization of the railway gauges for defence purposes. I make the following quotation from all letter addressed to the West Australian of the 27th February last, by Senator Collett, now an Assistant Minister, under the heading "" Co-operation in and not affected Defence "" : In respect to railways, it is tacitly agreed that the construction of the standard gauge lines connecting with the States is an essential factor to be accounted for in any strategical plan. Without it there may be critical delays in communications, and, possibly, tragic loss time in transporting reinforcements, muniraw materials and foodstuffs from point to point. The situation would become especially acute should there lie a loss, even temporarily, of freedom in the use of oversea The honourable member for Parra(Sir Frederick Stewart) has also supported the idea that the standardization of the railway Everywhere there are those who cry out that this ouglit to be done, but wben they are to convert their professions into realities .and they have the .power to do so, they shirk that responsibility. I trust that, in view of the provisions of it the Constitution which permit this work undertaken by the Commionwealth in co-operation with the States, the wiser of tihe Country party will support the polioy of the Laibour party. such Many more quotations could be made from press articles, some of them in most terms. The press of Victoria, at. all events, has no illusions regarding the eapaciby of this Government. The Melbourne Herald of the 18th October, amend193S. published the following: In a vast territory like that of Australia, provision for rail, road and air transport on a war footing is imperative. Many questions arise, including that of unifying Here is a momentous inspiring work of the first magnitude that will give us safety and more than safety-that will hasten a democratic organization offering ultimately a more a.nd a better life to all who work. Australia looks for the inspiring leadership. It looks in v a in; there is no inspiring leadership on the other side of this chamber.  Order! Inspirin g leadership is not involved in the amendment.",43
184,Mr DRAKEFORD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I am quoting an article which relates to the subject under review. I want to show what view the press holds in regard to the undertaking of works of this character by the Commonwealth. Under the amendment, the Government has the chance to display inspiring leadership; but, unfortunately, it is incapable of doing so because of the absence of such leadership in its ranks. An article published in the Melbourne Argus of the 2nd November, 1938, contained the following passage:It goes without saying that the most useful step in such an expansion is to undertake public works of a character that will facilitate national defence, such as the unification of railway gauges. To embark on such projects requires a far sighted and courageous financial policy- a policy of casting bread upon the waters in the confidence that it will return after many days. Many big problems are interwoven in the one transcendent problem of making Australia safe from external aggression. For their solution they call for big men with big ideas. Unfortunately, the Government has 'been devoid of big ideas for a long period. On the 11th November, 1938, the Argus returned to the attack in an article in which the following passage appeared:The seeming inability of Federal Ministers to see the relation of developmental works to defence preparations is very disconcerting. It docs not even appear that any serious congideration has been given to the question of railway gauges. That is a sentiment that I have been voicing for many years. It has found a place in the programmes placed before the people at general elections. The late Prime Minister put it in his policy speech on several occasions. The Country party, through its leader, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) advocated it , yet when placed in a position to do so has taken no action to bring it to f r u it i o n and honourable members of his party are now objecting to its being incorporated in this legislation. The article went on to sayYet the relation of rail transport to military measures is close and obvious. Mobility is not in the motto of the Ministry. To make railway communication efficient and rapid is a real military measure, and one of the highest importance. I stress the next pointThe bitumen-surfaced highways worild break like pie-crust beneath the loads of military material which it would be necessary to move from point to point if we were at war. Such changes in the railway system as are most obviously necessary should be undertaken at the earliest moment. If the altered system never carries a gun the work will remain as something permanently useful- a national asset, as Mr Dunstan would call it. Here is an opportunity to do something. Even the great press organizations of the country are calling aloud for the Ministry to undertake this work; but the Ministry has no constructive ideas. I have endeavoured to show, and I believe that I have shown, that placitum 34 of section 51 of the Constitution provides means whereby this Government could, if it wished, extend the railway systems. I say quite frankly that the States have not sumcient funds to undertake this work, which must be regarded as principally a defence work, and that the responsibility for that portion of it rests on the Commonwealth Government. What proportion of the cost the Commonwealth sbould defray is a matter for discussion, but it should certainly be not less proportionately than is devoted to the making of roads leading to works operated for defence purposes. Can the Government not see that something of this kind is i m plicit in any defence preparations? Does h not realise that it is necessary to view the matter in a broad Australian spirit? If there be any Australian spirit left in Ministers, I appeal to them to take some notice of a man with the vast m i l i tary experience of the 'honourable member for Bendigo, who has said that with the existing breaks of gauge it would be impossible in the event of Australia being attacked for the situation to be adequately met. The honourable member  military experience, and I know that he and others with such experience support me in this matter. Here is a proposition which might involve an expenditure of £21,000,000. Well, we have spent £285,000,000 upon land settlement, works for the relief of unemployment, and sustenance, in a period of ten years. To neglect the matter further seems nothing short of a crime. I am unable to understand why this allegedly young, virile, Nationalist Ministry, which set out to show how things ought to be done, sbould neglect such a proposition, and should resist the attempt by the Opposition to have a paragraph inserted in the bill providing the authority to undertake work of this kind. It is amazing to me, and I believe also to many honourable members who sit behind the Government, who should join with the Labour party in seeing that the Government gets on with the job.",46

I have five minutes under this extraordinary process! One would think that the emergency was in this Parliament and that the subject before honourable members did not concern national security.",49
200,Mr LANE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The Opposition asked for it.,49
201,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"We did nothing of the kind. Despite all said previously on this side of the House as a contribution to the understanding of this problem, the fact remains that ten members sitting as Government supporters on the "" guillotine "" have felt disposed to offer contributions to the elucidation of the circumstances and have endeavoured to persuade the Treasurer to accept either wholly or in part the suggestions which had come from the Opposition. The time-table submitted by the Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Casey) contemplates the complete passage of this bill by tomorrow evening with all its important clauses still to be discussed,.and the Minister proposes that the discussion to-night shall terminate an hour earlier than the discussion terminated last night. I propose alternatively that the discussion of the bill should terminate at the usual closing hour of 4 o'clock on Friday. That would enable the House to be assured that there shall be a reasonable discussion of the remaining very important and significant features of this legislation. I suggest that we discuss this measure for as long tonight as we did last night. The discushas been away. sion of clauses 9 to 14 until 5 p.m. tomorrow would double the time proposed by the Minister, because, whereas he proposes one hour, I propose two hours. For the committee stage to the end of clause 17 I propose that the time be until 11.45 p.m. tomorrow whereas the Treasurer proposes till 5 p.m. tomorrow. The three clauses include the important clauses which deal with the regulations about which the Country party has said so much. The Minister for Supply and Development proposes that the "" guillotine "" shall fall finally at 6.15 p.m. tomorrow whereas I suggest that the discussion of postponed clauses and new clauses shall last till 12 noon on Friday and of the remaining stages until 4 p.m. The difference between us is merely a difference as to whether there shall be a rigid adherence to the impossible plan of discussion contemplated by the Minister or acceptance of the best alternative that I can put forward to ensure at least that there shall be for the remaining stages of this discussion some approach to deliberate discussion and examination. My plan cannot be said to be one which delays consideration of this measure in the Senate because the Senate will not meet again this week and under it this bill will be completed on Friday in time for it to be ready for the Senate when it assembles. I ask the Minister to accept my time-table. I put it to the right honourable gentleman that the discussion that has taken place has been an important, and valuable contribution; no allegations can be made to the contrary. My timetable bears on its face the readiness of the Opposition to give to this measure reasonable consideration. There can be no other judgment entertained towards what we are doing. The difference between us is only Friday. The way in which this time-table has been thrown down is not fair. Previously in the history of this Parliament, when it has been anxious to impose the "" guillotine "", the Government has consulted the Opposition, but, on this occasion, no such courtesy has been extended to us. I , at any rate, had not contributed to any protraction of this discussion.",49
202,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable gentleman,49
203,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I have been here all this week, and I have taken less time in committee than honourable members sitting on the Government side. I say to the country that the organization of this nation for the purpose of national defence should be dealt with on the democratic principle of open discussion, and a fair consideration of amendments which have emanated from the Opposition. Under this procedure our amendments will not be submitted to the vote. If the Minister does not accept my alternative time-table lie will show that he is afraid to allow a vote to be taken on the Opposition's amendments.",49

205,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Capricornia) [8.55] - I second the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ourtin). The action of the Government cannot be justified on any grounds. Parliament, after a long adjournment, has been sitting for only a few weeks. The Minister for Supply and Development (Mr. Casey), when introducing this measure, said that it was one of the most important measures ever introduced into this Parliament. Members of the Opposition have rights, and it is very evident that they have not been wasting the time of Parliament, because the only constructive amendments that have been offered have come from it. That can be proved, as the Government has accepted, or practically accepted, two of its amendments.",50

207,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The Minister for Supply and Development referred to the numbers of speakers on each side of the chamber. I have taken the trouble to ascertain the facts, and I find that today ten honourable gentlemen opposite and only eight on this side have spoken. Surely we are justified in discussing at great length the amendment that I have moved, on which the Minister has somersaulted.",50
208,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order ! The honourable gentleman must discuss the matter before the Chair.,50
209,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment extending the time for the consideration of this bill until 4 p.m. on Friday. Whereas under paragraph c of the motion moved by.the Minister for Supply and Development the discussion of clauses 15, 16 and 17 would cease at 5 p.m. tomorrow, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition extends until 11.45 p.m. tomorrow the time for the discussion of those clauses which embody important Labour principles, in respect of which the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) has circulated an amendment of great importance. The 74 honourable members of this House could not discuss the measure in the time allotted by the Minister. The Minister does not want discussion. This time-table provides ample evidence that the Government is adverting to the inner dictatorship of Cabinet, over not only its own party, but also the chamber. I am amazed at the Country party supporting the ""guillotine"".",50
210,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order ! The honourable gentleman must not reflect on a vote of the House.,50
211,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) so early in the life of this new Government not to' stand for the system of "" guillotining "" legislation through Parliament, but to extend the time so that the important amendments moved and foreshadowed by the Opposition shall be discussed. The Government does not want them to be discussed, because it realizes that they might embarrass its supporters and members of the Country party. The Opposition realizes its responsibilities in dealing with a measure like this, and bas submitted these amendments, not with a view to obstruction, but in order to improve the measure. How can we improve it if we are not given the time to do so? No one can say that the amendments are foolish, because the Government has already accepted one and promised to accept another.",50
212,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order ! The honourable gentleman must not discuss any happening in committee.,50

The time allotted in the motion for consideration of the remainder of the measure will bring the - total number of hours spent in t h j discussion of this bill to 42, spread over 12 sitting days, whilst the time already occupied in this debate works out to an average of about 40 minutes for every honourable member on both sides of the chamber.",51
216,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I rise to a point of order. The honourable gentleman is not discussing whether the time allotted in the resolution is adequate or inadequate; he i j discussing something which took place earlier.,51
217,Mr THOEBY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The Country party is always prepared to take every action needed' to secure full discussion on any matter meriting such consideration. We are. satisfied in this case that the time provided is suflicient to consider the issues involved. It is a principle of the Country party to consider any business before the House on its merits.,51
218,Mr CLARK,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Darling) [9.2] - I protest against the curtailment of this debate. The proposed allotment of time allows one hour for the discussion of the very important clauses of the bill including that dealing with regulations. That period is totally inadequate for this purpose, particularly in view of the fact that, in addition to the numerous amendments circulated previously, a further batch of amendments in the name of the. Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Casey) have just been handed to honourable members. I notice that some of tbese amendments include proposals which were embodied in the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde). ' It cannot be said, therefore, that the Opposition has simply been holding up the measure. The fact that the Government is prepared to accept some of .the proposals of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition justifies the request of the Opposition for more time than is allotted in the motion. Probably, if our request were granted we might be able to persuade the Government to accept further amendments. The clauses dealing with regulations is one of the most important of any bill. Apparently the Government's idea is torestrict debate on this aspect, and then to bring down regulations which will not bear full and frank examination. I have no doubt that the electors will take the first opportunity to condemn such action.",51
219,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Oorio-Minister for Supply and Development) [9.6] - In moving his amendment, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) stated that the record of speakers showed that today ten honourable members on the Government side spoke as against eight honourable members of the Opposition, in respect of which I direct the attention of the honourable member to the record yesterday which shows that thirteen speeches were made by honourable members on this side, compared with 32 speeches made by honourable members opposite. The figure in respect of the Opposition clearly indicates the endless repetition indulged in by honourable members opposite. This matter has been continuously before the House and the committee for over a fortnight. The second-reading stage occupied; fourteen hours, and the committee stage 26 hours.",51
220,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Does not the right honourable gentleman think that the measure deserves that consideration?,51
221,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Yes , it certainly deserves full consideration, but the plain fact remains, and no honourable gentleman has any reason to doubt it, that the Opposition has deliberately obstructed the measure.",51
222,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order !,51
223,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I rise to a point of order. I direct your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the gross reflection on the Opposition, and on the Chairman ol Committees, implicit in the observation of the Minister. He said that we had deliberately obstructed the measure. That is offensive to me, personally, and distinctly unparliamentary. Therefore, the expression should be withdrawn.",51

225,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"""Werriwa) [9.9] The necessity for full discussion on this measure was proved this afternoon when it took us many hours to drive into the heads of honourable members opposite the necessity for putting into the bill the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde). We know now that the reason for the ""guillotine"" is because members of the Country party refuse to sit all night, or even after 11 o'clock, not because, the Government wants them to do so, but because they will not do their job as members of this Parliament as it should be done. The object of the ""guillotine"" is to allow these honourable gentleman to go slow on the job, and that is the reason why, after taking up as much time in speaking on the measure as honourable members on this side, they now support the "" guillotine "". They are too lazy and too indolent to do their job as members of this Parliament.",52
226,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) is distinctly out of order. - Mr THOKBY - I ask member to withdraw his remark concerning the Country party. .,52
227,Mr LAZZAEINL,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I ' withdraw but I bave explained the reason for the application of the "" guillotine "". The sheaf of amendments circulated by the Minister covers two and a half pages, and is almost as big as the bill itself. The bill covers only about four pages, yet it has been so badly drafted that the Government has beenobliged to propose so many amendments, not one of which, I point out, can be discussed, or explained, under the time-table proposed in the motion The Government is using the forms of the House to jamb through this legislation.",52
228,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I shall be able to explain every one of the amendments.,52
229,Mr LAZZAEINL,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I should like know how - the rigbt honourable gentleman will be able to do so in the time allotted in' the motion. When legislation is rushed through in this way, honourable members are not given an opportunity to give full consideration to important measures, and consequently, ""numerous"" amending bills must be introduced each session. We are not given sufficient opportunity to analyse the principles of measures, or fb test them from a drafting point of view. This practice is an insult to the House and to the committee. It is certainly a reflection on the democracy of this country, and does not square with the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) a few weeks ago, that he intended to restore the deliberative character of this chamber in keeping with democratic principles. The Minister said that there was obstruction yesterday.",52
230,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I said "" for a fortnight"".",52
231,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member has exhausted his time. ',52
232,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Barker) [9.14] - It is usually said that time marches on, but in this chamber during the last two or three weeks, if it has moved at all, it has been at a. very slow dead march, particularly so far as this bill is concerned. The Government is not altogether blameless in this regard.",52
233,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"This is the honourable gentleman wbo loves to wound, but is the honourable afraid to strike.",52
234,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"We have had speeches made from the treasury it, bench which, on reconsideration by Ministers, would not bave been made.",52
235,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order ! I ask the honourable member to refrain from discussing happenings in committee.,52
236,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"As to the opportunity which will be afforded by the allotment of time embodied in the motion .for the proper consideration of this measure, and the amendments thereto, might I suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) that, having paid us the compliment of annexing a fair slice of the Country party's policy in his amendment, it was hardly necessary to for him to go into great labours in order to convince us of the necessity for voting for it. One thing that would have distinguished the-conduct of the Opposition in other circumstances would have been that it would have had the opportunity to seek a decision which it seemed anxious to avoid.",52
237,The SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order ! The honourable member must discuss the motion.,52
238,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Person ally I have always been a believer in providing adequate opportunity for the discussion of the measures submitted to honourable members, but a l i m it must be put somewhere.",53
239,Mr WARD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,What about the discussion of the licence of station 2 KY ?,53
240,Mr AECHIECAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"If the honourable member wishes to debate that subject. I am sure that some interesting speeches would be made, but they would not be very pleasing to honourable gentlemen opposite.",53
241,Mr AVABD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member is running away.,53
242,Mr AECHIEOAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Not at all.,53
243,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The honourable.member for Barker must discuss the motion before the Chair, and nothing else.",53
244,Mr AECHIECAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"If I may say so, Mr Speaker, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) is discussing something else.",53
245,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member for East Sydney is not addressing tis Chair.,53
246,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Al though I am a believer in providing adequate time for the discussion of the business of the House, it is sometimes necessary to arrange a time table in order reasonably to expedite debate.",53
247,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member should vote for my amendment if he believes in adequate discussion.,53
248,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The strongest criticism that can be levelled at the Government on this occasion is that it did not seek a conference with the leaders of the other parties in order to arrange a timetable that would be acceptable to all concerned. I hope that the Prime Minister Menzies), having had some experience of what it means to lead a minority party, will in the future see the wisdom of taking the leaders of the other parties into his confidence, so that timetables acceptable to all parties may be arranged. I have no doubt that if that practice were inaugurated, business would proceed more satisfactorily.",53
249,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Order l The honourable member is again not discussing the niotion.,53
250,Mr CURTIN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Evidentl y the Ministry will have to pay a heavy price for the vote of the honourable member for Barker.,53
251,Mr AECHIE OAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Possibl y it may not have the wherewithal to pay it . The object of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) in moving his amendment is to extend the time for the consideration of the remaining clauses of this bill. I believe that every honourable member, even those wbo have been doing some electioneering in various distant electorates recently, have had ample time to consider the principles upon which the bill is founded.",53
252,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,I sball not allow the honourable member to continue his remarks unless he confines them to the motion.,53
253,Mr AECHIECAMEEON,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The extension of time desired by the Leader of the Opposition would not afford honourable members any better opportunity to consider the principles of the bill than they have already had.

255,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Corio-^Minister for Supply and Development) [9.33]-by leave - I move That after the word "" w a r "" , paragraph /, sub-paragraph (i ) , the following ""words be inserted:-""includin g plans for the decentralization of secondary industries and particularly those relating to defence "", and that after the word "" w a r "" , paragraph f, sub-paragraph (i i ) , the following words be inserted.:-""and , in particular, the investigation and development of additional oil resources, the production of power alcohol from sugar or other vegetable crops, and the production of oil from coal or shale"".",54
256,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Capricornia) [9.35] These amendments will be supported by the Opposition, because they represent a belated recognition by the Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Oasey) 26 of the principles embodied in an amend33 ment which stood in my name.. The right honourable gentleman only saw the 7 light after the Government whip had informed him that a majority of honorAYES. able members would support my amendment. The Assistant Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Holt) who is a member of a learned profession, j examined my amendment last night and, after consultation with the Minister, said that be could see no merit in it at all. He went to great pains to point out that the amendment was quite unnecessary, and would - only hinder the bill - by curtailing - Tellers: provisions already in the measure. His arguments, however, apparently carried little weight with honourable members because, as I have said, it was ascertained by the Government whip that my amendment would be supported by a majority in the committee. In order, however, to deprive me of a victory by having my amendment carried, the Minister set out to extract from it all those provisions which honourable members of the Country party said they would support, so that these honourable members would not have occasion to votewith the Opposition and thus bring about the defeat of the Government.  Order! These aspects of the question are not involved in the clause under discussion.",54
257,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"The Opposition can at any rate assume credit for having brought forcibly before the Government the importance of including plans for the decentralization of secondary industries, particularly those relating to defence, and also the necessity for investigating and developing our oil resources, including the production of power alcohol from sugar or other vegetable crops, and the extraction of oil from coal and shale. The Government said that all of these matters were already being fully investigated and that there was no need for provision for such investigation to be included in this measure. It was not until the Opposition brought forward a constructive amendment incorporating paragraphs dealing with all of these matters that the Government, realizing it was in danger of defeat, decided that it was advisable to have them included in this measure. It is one of the worse political somersaults made by any government in my twenty years of parliamentary experience. It demonstrates that this Government, which consists of only 26 members to the Opposition's 30, cannot move in any direction without consulting members of the corner Country party. When it is found that members of that party will not lend* their support, then it is necessary for the Government to change its attitude, and irush hither and thither in a frenzy of excitement, consulting its Parliamentary Draftsman with a view to baving the necessary alterations made to placate the Country f»7] party. Is it anywonder that this tottering Government is facing its political doom ?",55
258,The CHAIRMAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The honourable member for Capricornia knows well that his remarks are-not in order and he must not proceed along these lines.,55
259,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I leave it at that. The Opposition will support these amendments, which have only been brought forward - by the Government under duress in order to avoid defeat. The principles embodied in them were all included in an amendment which stood in my name. I am amazed at members of the Country party now supporting tliese amendments, because of the opposition which they offered to mine, which embodies all these principles and furthermore provided for the construction and extension of railways and reads in co-operation with the States. Amendments agreed to.",55
260,Mr FORDE,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Capricornia) [9.40] - I move That the words "" t h is section"", sub-clause (2), be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words: ""paragraphs (o) to (e) (inclusive) of the last preceding sub-section"". This is a consequential amendment necessary because the Opposition was successful in having the provisions of clause o tightened up by making it mandatory that the Minister should take whatever steps are necessary to control and limit profiteering. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 6(1.) Where, in the opinion of the Governor General, it is necessary or desirable in the interests of the defence of the Commonwealth that information should be obtained in relation to industrial, commercial or other undertakings, or with respect to any goods, ttie regulations mny require such persons or classes nf persons, as are prescribed, to furnish, as prescribed, such information and particulars, as are prescribed, with respect to those undertakings or goods. (5.) The punishment for an offence against this section shall be as follows:(a) If the offence is prosecuted summarily- a fine not exceeding Fifty pounds or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three montlis, or both; (6) If the offence is prosecuted upon indictment- a line not exceeding Five hundred pounds or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both.",55
261,Mr BLACKBURN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Bourke) [9.42]. - I move That the words "" or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both"". sub-clause (5 ) , paragraph (a ) , be omitted. Under this clause, the Government reserves to itself the option to prosecute au offender summarily before a police magistrate or by indictment, that is before a jury. Under the provision of this clause an offender who is convicted by a police magistrate may be fined up to £50 or sentenced to three months' imprisonment or both, whereas any one convicted by a jury will be liable to a fine of £500, or to imprisonment for one year,' or both. My view is that if an offence is so insignificant that the Government considers that the offender should be deprived of the right to be tried before a jury, then that offence does not justify a sentence of three months' imprisonment or imprisonment at all. The clause should be amended so that in the case of minor offences an offender would be prosecuted summarily before a magistrate and be liable only to a fine. Offences for which the Government considers imprisonment should be imposed, should be tried by a jury. It is obvious that the offence of refusing to answer questions may vary in magnitude. Whereas it might be a serious offence when it amounted to an obstinate refusal, it might be of far less importance under other circumstances. In my opinion, a fine is quite suflicient punishment for a minor offence, and, for offences considered serious enough to warrant imprisonment, provision should be made for a trial by jury.",56
262,Mr SPENDER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Warringah-Assistant Treasurer) [9.44] - Wit h all due respect to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), I submit that there is nothing objectionable in the clause as it stands. It is customary in acts of this description, where offences may be of a minor or major nature, for jurisdiction to deal summarily with minor offences to be conferred upon a magistrate, and at the same time to reserve the right to charge a person by way of indictment. Section 5 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904 providesOffences against any act which(a) are punishable by imprisonment, but not for a period exceeding six months; or (6) not being punishable by imprisonment, arc not declared to be indictable offences, shall, unless the contrary intention appears in the act, be punishable on summary conviction. Sections 233B, and 231 and 232A of the Customs Act provide for the imposition by summary jurisdiction of imprisonment up to two years. I instance only these two acts, but there are many cases which come to my mind in which provisions sucb as this are included.. The effect will be, that an offence of only a minor nature will be dealt with by a magistrate. Many magistrates, at all events in New South Wales, and' in some of the other States, have the power to commit a person to prison for at least six months. I submit therefore, that having regard to the course which for years past legislation has followed in this Parliament and in every State of the Commonwealth, the clause should be accepted as drawn.",56
263,Mr HOLLOWAY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Melbourne Ports) [9.46] - I apprehend a danger in connection .with this matter. It seems to me that it would be wrong to give a Minister or any other authority, the right to follow one of two courses. I know of cases in which the Government has been particularly desirous of imprisoning a particular individual, and has not been so greatly concerned about another individual. In such circumstances, if it wished to get rid of one person for a lengthy period, it could choose the course which permitted imprisonment for twelve months, rather than that which provided for imprisonment for three months. I ask the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Spender) whether it is true that the person in charge of the prosecution could discriminate against an individual to whom he was personally antagonistic, with the result that a longer term of imprisonment might be imposed. If that be so, it is quite wrong.",56
264,Mr BRENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Batman) [9.47] - I cannot understand, and I should like the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Spender) to explain to me how t.he person charged is to know whether he is to answer in respect of an indictable offence, or a minor offence which is punishable summarily.",56
265,Mr NAIRN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,When he is charged in court he will know that by the nature of the charge laid against him.,57
266,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I do not think so. Normally, the procedure is by way of an information, which usually does not disclose whether the offence is indictable or is triable summarily.",57
267,Mr SPENDER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,An offence chargeable upon an information is not a summary matter.,57
268,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,It goes before a magistrate in the first place.,57
269,Mr SPENDER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,B y way of a charge.,57
270,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Yes , by way of preliminary inquiry; in the case of an indictprovision able offence, for committal, and in case a non-indictable offence, for hearing and decision. But in this case the offence is one and the same.",57
271,Mr NAIRN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,The prosecutor must elect whether the trial is to be summary or before a jury.,57
272,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,Does he elect when he swears the information and the summons is served on the individual?,57
273,Mr NAIRN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,At the commencement of the proceedings.,57
274,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"If the offence is prosecuted summarily, it goes before a magistrate, who deals with it first and finally. But if the accused person is to be indicted, the magistrate commits hini for trial. My point is, that the accused person is entitled to know when he is charged, whether he. is to be indicted or is to be dealt with summarily. In my opinion, it is fundamentally wrong that the magistrate should be left with the decision as to whether he will deal with the case summarily or commit the accused for trial. Normally, the accused person knows-at all events if he is advised-whethe r the offence with which he is charged is an indictable offence or one to be dealt with summarily. There arc some minor offences in respect of which the accused person himself may elect either to be dealt with summarily, or to be sent for trial npon an indictment. But here there is no question of election; the matter is left to the court.",57
275,Mr BLACKBURN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,It is left to the prosecutor.,57
276,Mr BEENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I am not quite clear as to whether it is left to the court or to the prosecutor; the clause does not make it clear as to whether it is one or the other. But my main point is that the accused person will not know whether he is charged with an indictable offence, or with only a minor offence in respect of which he is to be dealt with by the magistrate. As the clause stands, it puts the court, and above all, the accused person, in a most invidious position. He cannot prepare his defence.",57
277,Mr NAIRN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Perth) [9.52] - The clause itself resolves the problem raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). Sub-claiuse 5a makes in respect of an offence proseof cuted summarily, and sub-cl-juse 5b relatee to an offence prosecuted upon indictment.",57
278,Mr BRENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,But the accused does not know which it is going to be.,57
279,Mr NAIEN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"He knows immediately he enters the court. Every prosecution must have a commencement. The prosecutor must elect, at the commencement of the proceedings, whether he proposes to proceed summarily or by way of indictment. The criminal code allows the alternative, which is constantly exercised, of proceeding summarily or by way of indictment. In - almost every case, the summons discloses whether or not the matter is to be dealt with summarily. The prosecutor is always obliged to elect at the beginning of the proceedings the procedure that he intends to followwhether he proposes to ask for summary conviction or will endeavour to obtain a committal for trial by jury. The amendment of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) is that the power of a magistrate in all summary jurisdiction should be limited to the imposition of a fine. Magistrates have the power to impose a fine with the alternative of imprisonment, and generally, the limit of their jurisdiction is imprisonment for six months, which is greater than the provision of three months in the bill. I think that I ean say quite definitely that in no police oourt in Australia - is the magistrate restricted to less than six montlis. Tlierefore, ithe jurisdiction posed by the bill is by no means too wide.",57
280,Mr SPENDER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"""Warringah-Assistant Treasurer) [9.54] - I submit to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) that the matter is always clear when an accused person is brought before a magistrate. Legislation of this type finds its parallel in legislation dealing with crimes. In the Crimes Aot of New South Wales, certain offences are set forth, and there is the provision that they may be dealt with summarily. If the offence is to be dealt with upon indictment, a different procedure is followed, with which every man who appears before a court is acquainted, because the magistrate explains it to him - before the proceedings are commenced. To my knowledge, that procedure has been followed for at least the last 40 years. I know that, in the legislation of this Parliament and practically every State of the Commonwealth, similar enactments prevail. Therefore, if a man is to be dealt with summarily, he is charged summarily, but if he is to bo dealt with upon indictment, the magistrate informs him that ho need say nothing, because the inquiry is purely one to determine whether or not he shall be sent to trial. f Quorum formed.']",58
281,Mr BLACKBURN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Bourke) [9.57] The point raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is, I think, that a man who is charged will not be given any information as to whether it is proposed to deal with him summarily or he is to be sent to trial by jury, until the prosecutor bas informed the magistrate at the hearing of the course that ho desires to take; the information will not intimate to him which course is to be followed.",58
282,Mr SPENDER,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,It will in New South Wales.,58
283,Mr BLACKBURN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"It may not in Victoria. It is quite possible what the honourable member for Batman has said is correct; I have not examined the point, and am not contending for it. What I am contending for is this: The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Spender) .prohas said that in the Acts Interpretation Act a distinction is drawn between summary and indictable offences. I agree; but I submit that it is exceptional to have a provision under which the prosecutor-no t the defendant - ca n elect the form which the prosecution shall take. The Assistant Treasurer relies on the Customs Act. We cannot do so. That act is the parent of all sorts of abuses; it places the burden of proof on the defendant instead of on the prosecutor. Put shortly, what I am submitting is that, if the prosecutor has the option of bringing a man either before a magistrate or before a jury, the more important cases should go to a jury, and the minor cases to a magistrate. In order to make it clear that that is what is to be done, the act should say that a man canr not be imprisoned by a magistrate; that the prosecutor cannot ask a magistrate to make an order for imprisonment. This act will operate in a time of war. Those who have knowledge of what occurred during the last war, realise how the minds of magistrates are inflamed by prejudice, by the pressure of the press, and by what they feel is the pressure of governments. We know how magistrates acted during the last war. Therefore, I am not prepared to see them endowed with the power to send a man to prison, for having refused to answer questions. It is not a case of defending the class that I represent. I am defending the interests of all citizens. In the main, it will be the constituents of honourable members sitting on the Govermnent benches who will be dealt with under this legislation. A man may be charged with an entirely minor offence, or with a serious offence. If it be a minor offence, the Government should be able to charge him before a magistrate, and the magistrate should have the power to do no more than fine him. If it be a major offence, he should be given the option of a jury trial, and upon conviction be liable to imprisonment. I shall not expound the point more elaborately, because three other amendments of the Opposition have to be considered before that the time allotted to the clause expires.",58
284,Mr BRENNAN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Batman) [10.0] In the State of Victoria, the practice in the case of offences of this kind is to charge the accused with the offence in the statute, and not to indicate whether the offence is indictable or non-indictable. That he must find out by reference to the statute itself. A person would look in vain in this statute, when it is passed, to find out whether the offence with which he is charged is indictable or not. The accused would suffer a grave injustice in that he would not know until he appeared in court whether the offence with which he was charged was an indictable one, or merely a trivial one carrying a penalty of a small fine. In my second-reading speech, I criticized what I described as the inquisition which it was proposed to set up under this clause. The Government, actuated by purely political reasons, may question persons upon a very wide range of subjects. I am not concerned to know whether the person is au employer, and a possible profiteer, or a worker; he is, presumably, a citizen entitled to a citizen's rights. Under this proposed legislation he may be submitted to examination under regulations. offence is really to be created by regulation. It is not described in this clause, or anywhere in the bill except in most general terms. The penalty fixed in the bill for an offence which is not sot out, and against that I protest. I protest against the granting of powers so wide and general, to be supported by regulation, and I protest against penalties being imposed for offences which are to be created by regulations not yet adopted., It is premature to fix tbese severe penalties for offences which are to be created at a later stage. Question putThat the words proposed to be omitted (Mr. BLACKBURN'S amendment) stand part of the clause. The committee divided. (CHAIRMAN-MR . J. H . PROWSE.)

285,Mr GREEN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Kalgoorlie) [10.10] - I move That after paragraph (c), sub-clause (1.), the following paragraphs be added:"" (d) the development and exploitation, in co-operation with any State, of any deposit af ore or other natural resource: and (e) the provision or supply of munitions and the manufacture or assembly of aircraftor parts thereof by the Bailways Department or other authority of any State."". This amendment, if agreed to, will authorize the Commonwealth Government to approach any State government and enter into arrangements with it regarding the exploitation of deposits of minerals and other natural resources. an arrangement would be of great benefit to Western Australia, Tasmania, and New South Wales. In Western Australia and Tasmania there are vast deposits of iron ore that have not yet been worked. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) has made frequent references to the need for establishing an industry for the extraction of oil from coal. Such an industry would be invaluable in time of war. The iron deposits at Yampi Sound in Western Australia have not yet been exploited for two reasons, first, their isolation, and, secondly, because of the interference of Commonwealth authorities. Koolan Island in Yampi Sound consists entirely of high-grade iron ore. Leases have been taken up from time to time by speculators, but the deposits were not worked because of their great distance from markets. Then, within the memory of all of us, a company was formed by agreement with Brasserts Limited of London under which the ore was to be exported. Several months later the Commonwealth Government placed anembargo upon the export of iron ore from Australia. One reason suggested was that the ore was to be sent to an Asiatic state to which for national reasons it was undesirable that it should be sent, but a remarkable thing was that after the imposition of the embargo on ore from Western Australia ore continued to be exported from Whyalla in South Australia by the Broken Hill Proprietary. Company Limited. While the development of this important industry in Western Australia was held up, no less than 832.,000 tons of iron ore was exported to Japan out of a total of 1,346,000 tons exported altogether from 1932 to 1938 and 265,000 tons of iron scrap to Japan during the same period; yet the Western Australian oompany was debarred from exporting one pound of ore.  Order! The honourable member must connect his remarks with the amendment.",60
286,Mr GREEN,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I am sure that the  West Australian, although be subscribes to political beliefs opposed to mine, ""is with me in opposition to the exploitation of the State of Western Australia by big Such interests. He must be with me in my advocacy for the Commonwealth Government to enter into an arrangement with the Government of Western Australia for the development as a State instrumentality of the State's iron ore resources. The scope of the amendment, of course, is not confined solely to Western Australia. There are mineral resources in Tasmania which also could be exploited by the Commonwalth. To illustrate the lengths to which the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited will go, I need only cite the fact that near to the iron ore deposits on Koolan Island in Yampi Sound which are owned by the State, there are similar deposits on Cockatoo Island, which is leased by that company. It has never put a pick into the ground, and is merely biding its time until another company starts to exploit Koolan Island, when it will again use its influence to prevent export. My amendment must appeal to al] honourable members except tliose who are determined to help the big private interests to exploit the public.",60
287,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Corio-Minister for Supply and Development) [10.18] - The - proposed new paragraph d moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Green) refers toThe development and exploitation, in cooperation with any State, of any deposit of ore or other natural resource. I submit that clause 7, 1, is sufficiently wide to provide for co-operation between governments for the development of national resources. It readsThe Governor General may enter into any arrangement with the Governor of any State providing tor any matter necessary or convenient for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to this act . . . [Quorum formed.] Proposed new paragraph e of the amendment is covered by paragraphs e and b of clause 5. Paragraph b has relation to the manufacture and assembling of aircraft. In clause 9 the Governor General is empowered toestablish, maintain and operate or arrange for the establishment, maintenance and operation of factories for or in relation to the provision or supply of munitions. The Government has circulated amendments to clause 14, which also contain sufficient power for the Government to do everything that it needs to do.",60
288,Mr DRAKEFORD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Maribyrnong) [10.21] - I am particularly interested in the proposed new paragraph d moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green). The Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Casey) argues that its provisions are covered elsewhere in this bill, but I submit that there should be a specific reference in it to the subject matter of the amendment. It has been shown clearly that big interests which have a monopoly of the right to exploit certain resources neglect to do so. That neglect is most marked in Western Australia, and the Chairman (Mr. Prowse) ancl other honourable gentlemen from Western Australia should welcome this proposal, which would ensure that the Commonwealth and State Governments would repair their neglect and should be prepared to vote for it. I take it that if the proposed new paragraphs were inserted in the bill the Commonwealth Government would be able to compel companies which have control of Australian resources to develop them. No company should be allowed to hold resources on lease without being forced to utilize them for the benefit of the State in which they aTe placed. They should not be allowed to retard the development of the rich iron ore resources of Western Australia. Another mineral which would be covered by the proposed new paragraph is tantalite, which is used to harden armour-plating. Australia produces the major part of the world's supply of that mineral. It was reported in the press the other day that a large quantity of tantalite was being exported to Japan, where it is used for armament purposes. I do not say anything against Japan, but the Government should exercise supervision over the export of raw materials which may one day. be manufactured into munitions for use against us. Tasmania has resources of osmiridium, which would be developed under this proposed paragraph. It will be found that there are more valuable minerals of this kind in Australia than in any other country, and it is an obligation on the Government to take action to exploit them or care for them in such a way that Australia will have the use of them.",61
289,Mr GREGORY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Swan) [10.26] - I do not subscribe in any way to the implication of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford) that the Government should prevent the export of raw materials to Japan, because there is no better way to antagonize countries than to refuse to trade with them; nor do I intend to discuss the attitude of the Government in regard to the deposits of iron ore at Yampi Sound or the wretched report that it received on those deposits; but I impress upon honourable gentlemen that - we shall create trouble if we do not allow our raw materials to be exported. I see no harm in the proposed new paragraph d, which merely asks for the development and exploitation . . . . of any deposit of ore or other natural resource. I see no reason why the Government should not accept it. I think, however, that it would be. placed better in clause 5 than in clause 7. There is no necessity for the insertion of the proposed new clause e, because the provision or supply of munitions and the manufacture or - sembly of aircraft are already provided for in the bill.",61
290,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Corio-Minister for Supply and Development) [10.29] The amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green) clearly presupposes that the mining enterprises would be carried out by the Government. That is not the policy of the Commonwealth Government. It is for private enterprise to develop resources, and it is only when private enterprise falls down on the job or its operations are insufficient to exploit national resources that the Government may find it necessary to step in. The amendment clearly envisages the development and exploitation by the Commonwealth and the State Governments combined of ore deposits and other natural resources. If the Government should find it necessary, in an extremity, to follow this course in respect of some rare mineral, or metal, which it did not pay private enterprise to exploit, it already possesses power to do so. The amendment, therefore, is unnecessary. Question puliThat the paragraph proposed to be added (Mr GREEN'S amendment) be so added. The committee divided. (THE CHAIRMAN-MB . J. H.

291,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Werriwa) [10.38]. - I move That the following sub-clauses be added:(4.) No person who has any monetary, interest in any industrial commercial or other undertaking which is or has within the preceding twelve months been directly or indirectly concerned in supplying munitions (including aircraft) to the Commonwealth or any authority of the Commonwealth shall be appointed to be a member of any committee constituted under this section. (5.) Any member of a committee who acquires any such monetary interest as is referred to in the preceding sub-section shall cease to be a member of such PEOWSE.) committee. In the limited time at my disposal I 31 can only say that the amendment is designed to ensure that the Government will not appoint its supporters, particu4 larly representatives of vested interests and monopolies, to these advisory comA.YIB. mittees. There is a danger that it will appoint to the committee which will advise it on the purchase of munitions persons who are interested in the selling of munitions to the Government. Such a practice is reprehensible and has made politics stink in older countries of the world, as we are aware from inquiries which have been made into the activities of vested interests. Furthermore, representatives of such interests, who are appointed to committees of this kind, invariably accept the opportunity to secure inside information, and are thereby enabled to compete unfairly in their industries. This practice opens the door to patronage and corrupt practices, which should not be tolerated in a democracy. In the democratic country we should keep responsible government clean, and avoid practices which have bad a most detrimental effect upon the people of older lands.",62
292,Mr CASEY,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"Corio-Minister for Supply and Development) [10.41] - To accept the amendment would be to ignore entirely the absolute necessity for the Government to have the best brains in the community to advise it. In the establishment of the Department of Supply and Development, many problems arise which do not come within the experience of members of the Public Service, and it is necessary to enlist the assistance of the best advice obtainable in industrial circles. The members of the advisory committees will bave nothing at all to do with the consideration of tenders. Amendment negatived.

301,Mr LAZZARINI,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"I bring under your notice, Mr Chairman, that a few moments ago the bells were rung for a moment as they ring tbroughout the building to indicate that the House has adjourned. Two or three members of the Opposition, believing that the House had actually adjourned, left for their hotels. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. WESTERN AUSTRALIAN PRIMARY PRODUCERS' ORGANIZATIONS-CONDITION S OF EMPLOYMENT INNEW GUINEA. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Mri. GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [10.58] On the 4th May, when discussing the wheat industry in this House, I made the AYES. following statement:As honourable members are probably aware, in Western Australia there is a Wheat and Wool Growers Union and also a Primary Producers Association. The latter organization is housed in an extensive warehouse, and is engaged not only in buying, but also in storing and selling primary products. Kankin, G. J. Mr J. S. Teasdale; the president of the Primary Producers Association of Perth, has written to me pointing out that my statement concerning the trading activities of the Primary Producers Association is incorrect. The Primary Producers Association is a farmers' Gardner, S. L . organization, and is the parent body of the Western Australian Country NOES. party both Federal and State. It is also' a farmers' industrial organization. There is also a large farmers' cooperative organization in Western Australia known as Westralian Farmers Limited. This is the trading organization, with a large warehouse and buildings in Wellington-street, Perth, to which I referred. I am pleased to make this correction, as although I am entirely opposed to Mr Teasdale's politics, I have a high regard for Mr Teasdale personally, and also for the public spirit he bas displayed in many directions, and I have no desire to misrepresent the activities of his association.",64
302,Mr WARD,SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT,"East Sydney) [10.59] - I bring under the notice df the Minister in charge of External Territories a very deplorable state of affairs that exists in connection with the employment of certain workers in Commonwealth territories. A Mr Roy Delbridge, of Melbourne, secured employment some time ago with the Enterprise of New Guinea Petroleum and Gold Development Company for a period of two years. I have details of the terms of the agreement under which he went to New Guinea to work. In this agreement it is provided thatThe company ehall take out a guarantee with the Yorkshire Insurance Company in lieu of depositing an amount of £30 landing bond required under the Customs Ordinance of the Territory of New Guinea. The cost of such guarantee shall be £2 15s. and this amount shall be deducted from your first full month's wages. Honourable members know that the conditions applying to a worker who goes to the Territory of New Guinea provide that a bond of £30 must be lodged as a guarantee that he will not be stranded there, should he lose his employment. After working three months in the territory Mr Delbridge did lose his employment. He made unsuccessful attempts to secure other work and, being in destitute circumstances, he was naturally anxious to leave the territory. He applied to the Yorkshire Insurance Company, which was responsible for the issue of the bond, and received from it the following letter:Dear Sir, In reply to your letter of the Oth instant, re your being stranded in Wau, I have to inform you that this is. a matter for the istrator and it does not concern us until a person is put out of the country. I would advise you to interview your late employers and see if they can assist you, or failing that I tliink it would be better for you to try to get another position and earn enough money to pay your passage out of the country, otherwise it is a serious matter. Yours faithfully , Yorkshire Insurance Company Limited. (Signed) L . JOINER, Acting Attorney at Salamaua. The company accepted payment of a premium in order to provide a guarantee bond of £30, the sole purpose of which was to provide money to pay his return passage. When the company failed to meet its obligations under the bond, Mr. Delbridge found himself in a desperateposition. He sought the advice of Mr. Victor A. Florance, a barrister and solicitor at Wau. That gentleman, realizing the desperate state of Mr Delbridge, offered him free the advice contained in the following letter:Dear Sir, He Delbridge. Further to our recent telephone conversation herein, it seems to me that Mr Delbridge should call upon his recent employer to arrange for his passage to Australia. Apart from any question of the employer's common law liability to afford his passage whence he came, Mr Delbridge was obliged to pay to his employer the amount of a premium for Iiis. ""landing bond"" guarantee. In addition to his fare, Mr Delbridge would probably be entitled to heavy damages. In reply to your inquiries as to deportation by the Administration, this matter is dealt with in the Police Offences Ordinance 1025, sections GS to 73. A conviction under section 69 would seem to be equivalent to a conviction under section (18, and by sub-section (2) of section 68 "" Any person convicted of being an ' idle and disorderly person' within the meaning of the last preceding sub-section shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty-Imprisonment for twelve months "". Under section 73 the magistrate may in addition to the penalty, recommend to tke Administrator that he be removed from the Territory . . . It must not bo overlooked that the penalty is imprisonment for twelve months. The practice in Rabaul was to suspend the-penalty pending the result of the recommendation to the Administrator. But the magistrate is not obliged to make the recommendation, and if he were unsympathetic, he could impose the penalty and send Delbridge to gaol. If Delbridge gives the police a statutory declaration in terms similar - to the d r a f t Admin- enclosed herewith, I am inclined to think it would be the duty of the .police to charge him under section 69, although that section only says the police officer may arrest or summon him to appear. Yours faithfully, VICTOB A. FLOEANCE. In order to show h o w serious is the positio n of workers in such circumstances, I shall read section 69 of . the ordinance69 - (1.) Where any police officer has reasonable cause to believe that' any person has no lawful means of support or has insufficient lawful means of support he may arrest that .person, either with or without warrant, and bring him before a Court or may summon him to appear before a court. (2.) If that person fails to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he has sufficient lawful means of support or that such means of support as he has are lawful, he shall be deemed to he an idle and disorderly person within, the meaning of the last preceding section. (3.) The fact that any person charged under this section can produce or prove that he possesses money or .property shall not be taken into account in deciding the charge against that person unless he shows by his own or other evidence that he honestly obtained the money or property. This unfortunate man, who had been guilty of no offence, found himself in the position that, in order to obtain a passage out of the country- a passage which he had been guaranteed by the insurance company-h e had to swear a statutory declaration as follows:1, Roy Delbridge, of Wau, New Guinea, mechanical fitter, do solemnly and sincerely declare1. I have no money and no credit and io lawful means of support nor have I any prospect of finding any lawful means of support while in the Territory of New Guinea. 2. I am aware of the purport of sections 68 to 73 ' of the Police Offences Ordinance 1925 and desire that I may be charged and convicted thereunder and deported under the provisions of section 73 of the said ordinance. That declaration was signed before a justice of the peace. Within twenty minutes of signing it, Mr Delbridge was arrested and placed in the cells, where he remained for eight days. His only offence was that he bad lost his employment. In order to show how Commonwealth officials in the territory treated this unfortunate workman, I shall detail to the House what happened to a friend of his who attempted to get into touch with him in the prison. The friend, Mr. Syd. Barker, a dental surgeon of Wau, wrote to Mr Vertigan the following letter:I have heard that Mr K. Delbridge is at present incarcerated in the Wau jail. I am of the opinion that Mr Delbridge has no legal counsel, and, "" as his best friend in law"" I respectfully seek permission to visit Mr. Delbridge at noon today. A reply by return would be appreciated. To that letter he received the following .reply, dated the 3rd A p r i l : I acknowledge receipt' of your letter of the 1st instant relative to Mr Delbridge. Mr Delbridge has not asked for your assistance, and until he requests a visit from you, permission will not be granted. That letter was signed by Mr D. H . Vertigan, Assistant District Officer. circulated:Although this unfortunate worker had not committed any offence, he was kept in prison for eight days, and his friend was refused permission to visit him in noticeorder to understand his predicament and suggest means of assisting him. I ask the on 'Minister in charge of External Territories  the circumstances of this case, for if such amount of £2? things happened to this man, it is probable Australia that they have happened to others, also. .The insurance company is only ing workmen when it obtains payment .of premiums on the pretence that it will earmark give to them a guarantee bond of £30, pumping as provided in the ordinance of the terriand tory, to protect them in the event of their being stranded. It will be a disgrace to Australia; the Administration, and to the Governing the State ment, if such things are allowed to remain - uncorrected. This unfortunate worker went from Australia to the gold-fields of New Guinea, but because he lost his ing answers:employment he was compelled to make himself practically a criminal-h e to agree to a conviction being recorded against him-so that he could get back to the country from which he had come. I hope that full inquiries will be made to see that insurance companies are not allowed to continue the malpractice of accepting money in such circumstances.  ter in charge of External Territories) [11.10] - I have no personal knowledge of the case brought under notice by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward), but I assure him that I shall have inquiries made in respect of it immediately, and advise him later of the result.

Is it a fact that the State of Western is, under great difficulties, making strenuous efforts to supply its own requiredefraudments of this commodity? 3. If so, will the Commonwealth Government this £16,319 and hand it over to that State in order to equip the growers with special plants and other necessary machinery, to provide funds to devote the necessary scientific inquiry into the special problems connected with banana-growing in Western with the final view in mind of makindependent of outside sources?",66

NA NA",66
305,Mr JAMES,UNEMPLOYMENT,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact, iis stated in the press of the 25tK May, that the Government intends to issue treasury-bills to meet the deficits of State governments? 2. Is it a fact that the proposed issue of treasury-bills will meet only deficits already created ? 3. What action does the Government propose to take to meet the position as it stands today in regard to the large number of unemployed, which is growing greater from day to day?",67
306,Mr MENZIES,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. It is customary for the States eacn year to arrange for temporary accommodation by means of treasury-bills to cover expenditure until receipts from taxation in the latter part uf the financial year come in, when such treasury-bills are usually redeemed. In the present financial year the financial position ot some of the States has become serious in consequence of bush fires, drought, &c., and the States sought increases of loan programmes t "" cover extraordinary expenditure due to these causes, t n order to assist the States, the Commonwealth Bank offered to fund £3,000,000 of these treasury-bills, instead of requiring their repayment. 3. The question ot unemployment is one which comes primarily within the purview of the State governments, but the Commonwealth Government has at all times endeavoured, as far as practicable, to assist the alleviation of the unemployment problem. The Commonwealth has, in the past few years, contributed to the relief of unemployment in various ways. Direct grants have been made to the States for unemployment relief works, and a great deal of employment has been provided by the Commonwealth's expanded works programme and the large increase of defence expenditure. Provision has been made in the current financial year for expenditure of over £16,000,000 for works in Australia. The present defence programme has been increased to an amount exceeding £70,000,000, spread over three years. This expenditure has provided, and will provide, a great amount of employment for the workers of Australia. SUGAR.",67

The increase of 0(1. per 70-lb. bag charged by wholesalers in Perth applies only when retailers purchase a few bags of sugar at a time, which is a comparatively rare occurrence. In such cases the retailer's gross profit would be 12.16 per cent, on the cash cost in the free delivery area. 4.

318,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,UNEMPLOYMENT,"On the 25th May, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) asked the following question, upon notice What is the weekly amount being paid foi salaries and administrative costs in respect of national health and pensions insurance? The weekly liability for salaries at this date is about £460, and for administrative costs (excluding rent) £80. In explanation of these, figures I may say that altogether 125 omcers took up duty with the commission. As soon as the work began to slacken off the officers who could be spared were loaned to other dnpartments for duty, and as much annual recreation leave as possible was granted. When the Government's policy of suspension was declared, the Public Service Board was asked to transfer permanently to other departments as many of the staff as could be spared. At present 49 officers are engaged in Canberra and the States and most of these will be taking up duty with other departments within the nextfortnight, as soon as the work of examining approved societies' books and accounts is completed. As regards rentals, nearly all K f the leases of premises in country districts have been terminated, and space in city offices is being sub-let to other departments as it becomes available. I sball make a further statement on this subject when the National Insurance Bill is before the House. NAMING OF AIKPOBTS.",68
319,Mr MENZIES,UNEMPLOYMENT,"On the 9th May the honourable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) asked a question, without notice, regarding the matter of naming certain airports in Australia after distinguished Australian flyers. I desire to inform the honourable member that this matter - was first considered by-the Lyons Government in March, 1937. It was then decided to retain the present names of Government civil aerodromes and airports, and to allot place names to any Government aerodromes ""which may be established in the future. It was further approved that the naming of aerodromes owned by municipalities or private individuals should be entirely a matter for the owners, as in the case of the municipally-owned aerodrome at Bundaberg, which has been re-named the Hinkler aerodrome. In January of this year, the matter of re-naming the Government aerodrome at Mascot wasagain considered by the Government, which approved of the aerodrome being re-named "" The Kingsford Smith Aerodrome "". Accordingly maps and publications are now being amended to show the name "" Kingsford Smith Aerodrome "" Apart from the above, there has been no actual decision to have airports named after other distinguished Australian airmen. BUTTER SUBSTITUTES.",69
320,Mr JOHN LAWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"On the 19th May, the honourable member for Richmond Defence, upon notice(Mr Anthony) asked whether some measure of protection would be given the butter industry, either by imposing an import duty on the imported materials used in margarine, or an excise duty on butter substitutes. I indicated to the honourable member that an inquiry was being held, and that the matter would be given further consideration. I am now in a position to indicate that the imported materials used in the manufacture of margarine represent on. the average only 6.7 per cent, of the value of the finished article. In view of the small value of the imported materials, it is obvious that any increase of the import duties would have very little effect on the position of the competition of margarine with butter. In regard to the excise duty proposal, I would point out to the honourable member that Australia produced 438,900,000 lb. of butter in 1937-1938, as compared with 5,600,000 lb. of table margarine for the same period; i.e., the production of table margarine represents only 1.3 per cent, of that of butter. The competition is relatively small and has not affected the butter industry to any marked degree. The price of margarine has remained practically constant over a period of years. This matter, however, will be discussed by the Agricultural Council when it meets in about a fortnight's time. DEFENCE: TRANSPORTATION OF TROOPS.",69
