2,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.30]-by have - Wit b very great at regret, I Lave to announce to honourable appreciation members that General Sir John Monash died this morning. Though the news was not altogether unexpected, it will be received throughout Australia with profound sorrow. Sir John Monash was Australian-born; he loved, his country intensely, and was one of the greatest figures in its history. After passing through the Melbourne University with high honours, he practised as a civil engineer and wasin the front rank of his profession. He may well be described as a distinguished scholar, a great soldier, and an eminent citizen. I u many capacities he gave to Australia outstanding service, which his countrymen will long remember with pride and gratitude. Perhaps his greatest achievement was the brilliant command of the Australian Imperial Force in France. Prior to that he had served in Gallipoli,. where Monash Valley was named after him. He won the respect and loyalty of the men he commanded, because he gave to them loyalty and respect, and when criticism was levelled against the Australian soldiers they had no better, champion than their distinguished leader. He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1916, made lieutenant-general in 1918, and general in November, 1929. In civil life the deceased gentleman occupied many important positions. ;Since 1920 he had been chairman of the Electricity Commission in Victoria, occupying one of the most responsible posts in the service of the State. Last year he represented the Commonwealth at the celebrations in connection with the inauguration of the new Delhi, and discharged his mission with credit to Australia and to himself. At the time of his death he was a member of the Council of Defence, and, having sat at the council with him, I can testify to the value of his advice. Others who have had the privilege of serving with him know how sound were the views he expressed. I am sure that the sympathy of this House, and of the Australian nation, will be extended to the daughter and sisters who are left to mourn the loss of a very That this House expresses its deep regret the death of General Sir John Monash, G.C.M.G., KC.B., V.D., places on record its of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his daughter and other relatives in their bereavement.",11
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Wilmot) [2.33] - I second the motion. The death of Sir John Monash is a national loss. He was a great soldier, a great - engineer, and above all, a great Australian. When he left these shores with the first Australian expeditionary force in 1914, he was a colonel, and temporary brigadier-general of the Fourth Infantry Brigade. In 1919 he returned as commander of the Australian Army Corps of five divisions. A successful business man, a distinguished civil engineer, and scholar, Sir John Monash developed into a brilliant military leader. The war furnished many examples of men eminent in other walks of life who achieved success and fame as military commanders, but none more remarkable than that of Sir John Monash. To the conduct of modern warfare he brought the qualities which had made him eminent in the direction of large business \tndertakings. Withal, he won the loyalty and respect of those who served under him, because he was loyal to them, and gave free rein to individual initiative and judgment. All Australians were proud when he was knighted on the field by His Majesty the King. He knew every detail of what was happening within his oommand; he remembered everything. It may be said that Sir John Monash had trained himself to do well almost any task. He graduated at the University of Melbourne in engineering, arts, and law. Twenty years before the Great War, he took up volunteer soldiering. In addition to his great attainments he possessed infinite personal charm, a warm heart, a sense of humour, and an ardent love of his country. After the war he applied his great organizing ability to the problems of demobilization and repatriation. Subsequently, his great energy and ability were directed to the development of the natural resources of Victoria, and once again he met with marked success. A. man of such great parts and patriotism can ill be spared, particularly at this critical stage in the country's history, when his counsel and powers of organization would have been invaluable. On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Prime Minister in expressing our sense of the great loss that Australia has sustained, and our sympathy with the bereaved relatives.",12
4,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Macquarie-Minister for Defence) [2.39] - As Minister in charge of the department which General Sir John Monash served so faithfully and well, I should like to add my tribute of recognition of his sterling character and patriotic labours. He excelled in the arts of both peace and war, and brought to every task a sympathetic mind and a humane understanding. He was respected and loved by those who served under him, and his name will be for ever remembered in our history as one of Australia's.greatest citizens and 361* V Stilts",12
5,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [2.40] I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lyons), expressing the sympathy of this Parliament at the passing of a great soldier, a great uitizeu, and a great Australian. Sir John Monash rendered to Australia service that was never stinted, and, throughout his life, devoted to his country his great natural abilities and an intense public spirit. During the war he proved himself to be a leader of men. Unquestionably, his-leadership of the Australian Imperial Force gave confidence, not merely to his command, but also to the nation as a whole. After the war be devoted himself to the rehabilitation of Australia. Not merely in regard to the great, undertaking at Yallourn, which he managed so successfully, were his outstanding abilities shown; he was always ready to give counsel and assistance to any enterprising and public spirited man or movement; his advice was always available to governments and to individuals. To-day, there will be gloom throughout the homes of the Commonwealth because of the passing of this great Australian, and especially will there be gloom in the hearts of the soldiers who served under him for the four and a half years of the Great War.",12
6,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [2,42} Another beloved friendof mine has gone, the greatest citizen soldier that Australia has produced; the greatest citizen soldier, probably, who took part in the terrible war of 1914-18. Sir John Monash was not only a distinguished soldier, he was a greater organizer, and an engineer of conspicuous ability. I feel it my duty to say that he was one of the few men that I have wronged in my life. At the time of an election for the Corio seat, a telegram was despatched in his name which' afterwards proved to be a forgery. It hurt greatly the sitting member, and brought a new member to this House. To his honour, the latter gentleman assured me that had lie known the telegram to be a forgery, it would not have been used during the campaign. On my wronging Sir John Monash publicly a relation of his, and another great friend of mine, Philip Bebrend, who has also now gone over to the great majority, proved to me that I was at fault. As publicly as I attacked, publicly I made the amende honourable. When the late Sir John Monash returned to Australia, we resumed our acquaintance, and, great man that he was, he showed himself ereat in forgiveness when lie understood how I had been misled, and our acquaintance developed into a firm f riendship. One matter that I felt bitterly at time, and in connection with which I made my protest in this House, was that when there was a royal visit to Australia, the professional soldiers of our Defence Department left that great soldier and citizen on the footpaths of Melbourne, denying him official participation in the welcome. I can only say to those dear ones who will miss him the words of solace that I have expressed in the many partings that I have had during my long life, that the departure of each dear one that wo love but adds to the number who will welcome us when our own turn comes to pass tit rough the shadows.",12
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"North Sydney) [2.45]. - I desire to associate myself with this motion, and with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin), the Leader of ' the Opposition (Mr. Lyons), the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), the Minister for Defence (Mr Chifley), and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney). The news of the death of General. Sir John Monash will be received with great and sincere regret by the people of Australia, to whom he stood as the leader and living embodiment of the Australian Imperial Porce, and all its glorious and imperishable achievements. One by one the great outstanding figures of the world war are passing away. v Yesterday, Haig and Foch; today, Monash. Sir John Monash has gone from among us. But his name is engraven on our hearts- a name that will not die; whose lustre passing time cannot wholly dim. We are still too near the mighty events amidst which he played so distinguished a part to enable us to measure his true greatness; but this much is clear-that of all who held high command in the Allied Forces, his claim to military genius is the least likely to be questioned. To him, more than to any other, is due the so plan which inspired the great offensive of the 8th August, 1918, which plucked victory"" out of the jaws of defeat, and drove back headlong the exulting German legions along the Hindenburg line; sweeping irresistibly through the vaunted barrier, to victory, and to peace. This great soldier, this great citizen, has left us; but across the abyss that now the divides us we waft to him our tributes of homage and admiration, of gratitude and esteem. We extend to his daughter and sister our deepest sympathy.",13
8,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [2.47] - We mourn this afternoon the death of a distinguished Australian, one who rendered unique service to the Commonwealth and the Empire. I had the privilege of knowing Sir John Monash intimately for many years. I knew his name from the day when, as a small boy, I entered his old schoolScotch College, Melbourne-and saw it inscribed on the honour board as dux of the school. At the University, Sir John Monash won degrees in law, arts, and engineering, and carved for himself an academic career which seldom has been excelled. Subsequently, he became Vice-Chancellor of the Melbourne University, and for many years I was associated with him in university work and other public activities. I was also associated with him in the work of my own profession, when I learned to appreciate and value his very clear mind. Sir John Monash had, I believe, the highest degree of intellectual ability, combined with very great practical capacity. As an organizer and administrator, be bad few, if any, equals. His record during the war is one of outstanding and brilliant achievement. As a leader of the Australian Imperial Force, and in other positions which he filled before he became Commander of the Australian Army Corps in France, he won. and held the admiration, loyalty and devotion of his men. At the conclusion of the war lituudertook the great responsibility of demobilization, and on his return to civic life he lost no opportunity of protecting the rights of returned soldiers, and emphasizing their duties and responsibilities as citizens. The work of Sir John Monash at Yallourn, and in other activities, since the with us. war, is well known. He was always a leader. No one in Australia has been a leader in so many spheres - He had great driving force and energy, and wonderful vitality. His interests were wide, and, like his .abilities, were almost universal in scope. He enjoyed the admiration of all Australians, and the affection and esteem of many thousands who knew him. Kls life should be an inspiration to us all.",13
9,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Richmond) [2.50] As one who was a humble and insignificant member of the Australian Imperial Force, I wish to add my meed of praise to what has already been said concerning that very gallant gentleman who, more than any other man, by the service he rendered to the Empire in the Great War, gave prominence to the name of Australia on the map of the world. In fililcii days, men were given dukedoms or other great honours for deeds which cannot compare with those of Sir John Monash. By those who served with and under him his name can never be forgotten. Australia will remember him, mu only for what he did during the war, but also for what he accomplished after his return to civilian life. As an executive officer of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, I have personal knowledge of the value of his work. He never sought the limelight; he was content to do what hp could to help others, and to benefit the land of which he was so distinguished a son. I doubt whether Australia has produced two greater men than Sir John Monash and Sir Harry Chauvel. Today we mourn the loss of one of them; the other we hope will continue among us for many years, to give service in peace time to the nation which he served so well in the turmoil of world warfare. I feei certain that Sir John Monash would have applied to himself, the words of the late Mr Justice Pring, of New South Wales, who said, "" I have done my duty; I can do no more; I should do no less."" But his actions speak louder than any words he might have uttered. As an insignificant member of that great body of men who served under Sir John Monash, I pay my tribute of recognition to a great Australian who is no longer",14
10,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [2.54] - As one who had the privilege of knowing Sir John Monash personally for many years, and of serving under him from the time when, as a boy, I joined the artillery battery in North Melbourne of which he was captain, I also pay my humble tribute to his worth. By his death there passes one of the last of the great war leaders, a versatile genius whose extraordinary gifts undoubtedly led to a speedier termination of the war than would otherwise - have come about. That is admitted even by our former enemies. His outstanding ability took him to the highest command. Alike as soldier, engineer, and scholar, he excelled. In addition to rendering imperishable service to Australia as Commander of the Australian Corps in the war, he rendered invaluable service to his native State of Victoria by the completion, often in spite of opposition, of the Yallourn scheme which utilized its brown coal resources.' Admired by the men he led, honoured by grateful citizens, Sir John Monash hae passed from among us. Australia and the Empire are the poorer for his passing. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Ordered That Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Mrs Gershon Bennett, daughter of the late Sir John Monash. the foregoing resolution, together with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. NA BODIES.",14
11,Mr SCULLIN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.56] - by leave-As numerous questions have been asked by honourable members regarding the making available of funds to public bodies, I propose to read a letter which I received this morning from the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board. The letter, which is dated the 7 th October, 1931, readsWith reference to the provision of loans for the currying out of public works of a reproductive nature thereby providing relief to unemployed. In accordance with the undertaking given by this bank to give consideration to applications from public bodies for loans to carry out works complying with the above, I have to advise you that at the board meeting just concluded the following loans were approved:Clarence River County Council (Nymboida Electrical Scheme) - A sum of £191,000 has been approved towards this scheme, the whole of which, with the exception of a small amount, will be spent in Australia, providing both direct and indirect employment. In addition to the foregoing it would seem that the advantages derivable from this scheme by the dairying industry in the district affected will be conducive in increasing production and thereby national wealth. It is understood that the provision of this loan will enable the expenditure of an additional £30,000 which can be made available from other sources. Queensland Meat Industry Board - A loan of £05,000 has been approved for the purpose of providing extra equipment and operating charges connected with the carrying out of this scheme. It is believed that besides assisting in the direction of further employment the scheme will have the effect of increasing the export business, thereby adding to the national income. Warrnambool Sewerage Authority - A loan of £40,000, which also entails providing £12,000 for working account, for the purpose of starting the first section of a sewerage system for the town of Warrnambool, has been approved. It is understood that practically the whole of this money will be spent in a form which will absorb labour and it would appear that it will be reproductive financially through revenue besides providing much needed sanitation for Warrnambool. Newcastle District Abattoir Board - Loa n of £12,000 has been approved for the purpose of adding to the refrigerating chambers of this undertaking. It is understood that the whole of this will be spent directly and indirectly on labour, and wil l provide accommodation for the growing demand for export facilities from this port thereby increasing come from overseas. The board will continue to consider applications complying with the conditions and in accordance with the ability of the bank to provide funds. It is understood, of course, that public bodies will apply to the banks with which they are at present doing business for financial assistance in accordance with the understanding which has been approved in this connection. Yours faithfully , ROBERT GIBSON, Chairman of the Board of Directors. FREIGHT ON WOOL.",15
12,Mr RIORDAN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"Will the Prime Minister have an inquiry instituted at the earliest possible date into the extortionate freight on wool, compared with the freight charged for other cargoes, exported from Australia, more particularly since wool is realizing very low prices ?",15
13,Mr SCULLIN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,This matter is under consideration. I have been in touch with the Overseas Transport Association in connection with it.,15
14,Mr RIORDAN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"Has the Overseas Transport Association brought under the notice of the Minister for Markets and  parity between the freight charges on wool, compared with those charged on other exportable commodities? Has the Eederal Government a representative in that Association? Can the Minister procure for me an explanation why the freight of wool should cost 1 3-16d. per lb., compared with %d. per lb. charged on frozen meat, which requires refrigerated space, 27s. per ton on flour, and 25s. per ton on wheat? Why are Sydney harbour dues 9d. per ton on wheat and' 5s. 3d. per ton on wool?  vernment has no representative in the Overseas Transport Association. The subject of overseas freights has already been taken up, and, through the Prime Minister's Department, representations are now being made in order to afford relief in every possible direction. CANBERRA RELIE F WORKS. AWARD RATES AND CONDITION'S.",15
15,Mr BLAKELEY,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"Las t Friday, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) made certain reprein- sentations regarding the conditions under which relief works at Canberra were carried out, and he wished to know whether awards and other conditions were being observed. I am informed by the Industrial Officer, through the Secretary to the Works Department, as follows:At the inception of the Canberra Unemployment Relief Fund Committee, which has accredited representatives of the Australian Workers Union and Building Trades Unions in Canberra, it was decided that award rates and conditions should apply, with the exception of payment on the job, when it was decided that with respect to payment, men should draw their pay on the following day. This was considered necessar3 at the time owing to works finishing ou different days, and owing to the necessity for avoiding increased departmental expenditure involved in payment on the job at frequent and irregular intervals. This matter was recently reconsidered, and it was agreed to institute a weekly pay day, i.e., Friday, and to' arrange relief works in such a manner that they would begin on Monday and end on Friday, the men being paid on the job up to and including ceasing time on that date. Unfortunately, the incidence of wet weather has interfered with the arrangement on two relief jobs. I u these cases the men are paid on the job on Friday for the number of days worked up to and including that day. The pay for the balance of the days worked, which go to make the rostercd week, is available for the men on the following Friday. The union representative on the committee agreed to this arrangement. It will be seen, therefore, that although - ward provides for fortnightly payments, men on relief work are being paid weekly, and, wherever practicable, with due regard to economy, on the job. Tho Industrial Board's award provides for payment for certain holidays, subject to the condition that employees shall have worked on the days immediately preceding and >succeeding the holiday. W it h regard to the Easter holidays, men on relief works worked a five-day week, and payment was made for Good Friday and Easter Monday in cases where such holidays fell in their rostered week. Similarly, payment was made for such holidays if the rostered week finished on Easter Monday. When the rostered week finished on Friday, payment was only made for Good Friday. It will beseen, therefore, that although the provision regarding men having worked the days immediately preceding and succeeding the holidays was not complied with in every case, men on relief work did not suffer any monetary loss. ] may say that, in connection with the Federal Capital Territory relief works, the spirit and letter of the awards are being scrupulously observed.

20,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"Has the Commonwealth Government resumed payment to New South Wales of the sums due to it under the federal aid roads scheme, or are those amounts still being retained to offset the amounts owing by New South Wales to the Commonwealth ?",16
21,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,The Commonwealth has resumed these payments to New South Wales since that State has undertaken to fulfil its obligations to the Commonwealth. WAR SERVICE HMS ,16
22,Mr MARR,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"I recently asked whether the Government would consider allowing the purchasers of war service homes to meet their commitments with respect to those homes by means of Commonwealth bonds. Has the Government further conSTOCK. sidered the matter, and if not, will it",16

25,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"I draw the honourable member's attention to a question, asked on notice, on this subject by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), to whom I have supplied ah answer today. CANBERRA. 'Bos SHELTER SHEDS.",17
26,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"The Minister for Home Affairs has laid stress on the ideal labour conditions, holiday pay, and five-day working week that are enjoyed in Canberra. Will he prepare a statement showing the cost to the Commonwealth of the shelter sheds that are being provided in Commonwealth-aveuue, at the entrance to Hotel Canberra, and at the back of Parliament House, should the work be completed before Parliament again goes into recess?",17
27,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,I shall obtain the information for the honourable member.,17
28,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"Is the Minister aware that for several weeks a number of persons have been engaged in building these small shelter sheds ? When they are completed, if ever, will he inform me of the actual cost of each?",17
29,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"I strongly deprecate honourable members criticizing something of which they know nothing. The shelter sheds in question are of very solid construction, and excellent work is being put into them. I have already promised to furnish information regarding their cost. Mr HAWKER,-Are these shelter sheds intended to be used as resting places by persons who are waiting for 'buses, or by those who presumably are erecting them? Question not answered. SODA ASH.  Trade and Customs aware that a Mr. George MCPhail, of Adelaide, has in hand a proposition for the manufacture of soda ash, that the Minister in charge of Development (Senator Daly) has taken a deep interest in this project, and that at the present moment he is awaiting a I report from Mr Gepp, who has inquired into the economic aspect of the manufacture of this commodity at Port Adelaide ?",17
30,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED,"Senato r Daly, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Price), and other honourable members and honourable senators have discussed this proposition with me.

31,Mr MACKAY,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Has the Minister for Markets and Transport in his possession information to the effect that there is a shortage of overseas refrigerated shipping space, with the result that there is a serious accumulation of butter and meat in cool storage at several Australian ports ?  devoted to this - matter a considerable amount of time. The replies that have been received in response to our representations are to the effect that, on account of the very favourable lambing season, there is an unprecedented demand for refrigerated shipping space. It has also been, pointed out that, for the last three months, the export of commodities generally has been ten times as great as was the case during a similar period last year. A thorough investigation is being made, and everything possible is being done to alleviate the position. PROPOSED NEW INDUSTRIES.",17
32,Mr MARRS,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether it is a fact, as I have been informed by persons who are concerned, that the representatives in Australia of several large English and American manufacturing firms which had intended establishing big works in this country have decided, within the last few days, to advise, their principals not to proceed further with the venture on account of the high cost of production ?",17
33,Mr FORDE,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"No such information has heen conveyed to me; on the contrary, I have met the representatives of some English and American manu-' facturers who are most optimistic regarding the future of Australia, who believe that this country has already turned the corner, and have advised their principals to invest their money here. GRANT TO WHEAT-GROWERS. Mr M. CAMERON - Will the Prime Minister, before making final arrangements for the distribution of the £3,000,000 that it is proposed to grant to wheat-farmers, consider the allocation of a portion of the amount among the growers of barley who depend solely on that product for their living? f Mr Scullin - The request made'to the banks on behalf of the Premiers Conference was for a bounty on wheat production. I do not think that any of the money that is to be made available can he diverted to the assistance of the growers of any other grain. INTEREST ON MORTGAGES.",18
34,Mr RIORDAN,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"I ask the Prime Minister*whether the Queensland Government has yet put into operation that portion of the Premiers' plan which provides for a reduction of 22-J per cent, in the interest rate on mortgages? If it not done so, will the right honourable gentleman make representations to the Premier of that State to give effect to that portion of the agreement?",18
35,Mr SCULLIN,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"I shall have inquiry made of the Queensland Government, to ascertain what the position is. WHOLESALE PRICE LEVELS.",18
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs noticed that, according to the Statistical Bulletin which was issued this morning, certain wholesale price index figures for Melbourne have increased to the following , extent between 1929 and August last:Groceries from 1090 to 1769. Building materials from 1754 to 2091. Chemicals from 1942 to 2179. Will the honourable gentleman have inquiries made to ascertain whether profiteering is being practised under the increased tariff that has been imposed?",18
37,Mr FORDE,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,If the right honourable member will place the information in my hands I shall give it careful consideration. I have also been requested to investigate price levels in the dairying industry. It has been pointed out that that industry has been bolstered up at the expense of the consumers. I have promised to have the inquiry made.,18
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"In view of the fact that the wholesale price index figure for dairy produce has declined from 1853 in 1929 to 1336 in 1931, and that of agricultural products from 1792 to 1097, will the Minister take the necessary steps to reduce the prices of those commodities which our primary producers have to purchase ? ' Mr Forde - I very much regret, in common with other honourable members, that our primary producers have to depend upon the vagaries of the world's market for the disposal of their surplus products, and that, in recent years, they have not received an adequate return. I am endeavouring, by means of the protectionist policy of this Government, to establish for them a wider local market which, as every honourable member knows, is the best market. SUGAR AGREEMENT.",18
39,Mr CURTIN,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether it is has in accordance with the provisions of the sugar agreement that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company shall prohibit unionists from working at their establishment at Cottesloe Beach?,18
40,Mr FORDE,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Provisio n is made in the sugar agreement for the continuance of the policy of preference to unionists that was agreed to by the Queensland cane farmers, the mills, and the Australian Workers Union in that State. I believe that the Queensland Government, although not in agreement with that policy, undertook not to oppose its application. The principle does not extend to the working conditions that are in operation in the mills of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in other States. If the honourable member will place his complaint before me, I shall have inquiries made, and furnish him with a written reply.",18
41,Mr GUY,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Is the Minister for Trade and Customs aware that complaints arc being made that grocers in Launceston are obliged to pay £38 4s. 2d. per ton spot cash for A l grade sugar, contrary to the provisions of the sugar agreement, and that grocers in Hobart have until recently been obliged to pay a greater sum than that specified in the agreement for the same grade of sugar ? If that charge can be sustained, what steps will the Government take to recompense those grocers who are losing heavily owing to the breach of the agreement?",19
42,Mr FORDE,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,If the honourable member will place his complaint before me I shall have' it fully investigated. Government will take whatever steps lie within its power to redress any grievance that exists.,19
43,Mr BEASLEY,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Can the Prime Minister say if there are any means of testing the sweetening quality of sugar produced in Australia today as compared with that of the 1929 production? I raise this point because, in some quarters, there is a strong feeling that the quality today is not nearly so good asit was a couple of years ago?",19
44,Mr SCULLIN,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"I understand that - the quality is determined by the net titre standard, and I presume that adequate steps are taken to maintain the standard. The sugar agreement is based upon the delivery of sugar of standard quality, and I have every reason to believe that its sweetening quality is as high as in former years.",19
45,Mr GREGORY,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"In view of the opposition of government supporters to any proposal which savours of the exploitation of the people, will the Prime Minister undertake t'o give hofforable members an opportunity to discuss the motion standing in my name with regard to the sugar agreement and the embargo on importation?",19
46,Mr SCULLIN,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Whether that motion will be discussed at an early date depends upon the expedition with which urgent, government business is dealt with.",19
47,Mr MARR,REFRIGERATED SHIPPING,"Since one of the principles affirmed by the recent conference of Premiers to consider the financial rehabilitation of the Commonwealth was equality of sacrifice, will the Prime Minister give the House an opportunity to discuss the sugar agreement with a view to requiring those engaged in the industry to join with other sections of the people in the common sacrifice?",19

What is the salary paid to the constructing engineer or officer in charge? 3. What is the estimated approximate cost, of working the station when complete? 4. What is the estimated additional revenue attributable to the station? Mr A . GREEN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w :1. Approximately £24,000. 2. The constructing engineer is provided by the contractor, and no information is available as to the salary he is paid. 3. The approximate cost of working the station, including interest and depreciation, will be £7,000. 4. It is not practicable to state the effect of establishing an individual station, but it is anticipated that the development of the general plan for the National Broadcasting Service will bring about a 20 per cent, increase in licences. The scheme aims at providing reliable service to listeners in practically all the settled areas of the Commonwealth-embracin g about 95 per cent, of the population-o n a basis which will be self-supporting as a whole.

What is the cost to date of experimenting on the installation, operation, &e., of theMurray multiplex and teletype telegraph systems between Launceston and Melbourne? 2. Has the experiment proved that this system can be worked successfully and economically between Launceston and Melbourne? 3. In view of the fact that the Wheatstonetelegraph system now in operation has worked successfully for a number of years, and i» reported to have met all telegraph requirements, what is the object. in continuing the heavy expenditure involved in failures and experiments associated with Murray multiplex and teletype systems? Mr A . GREEN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The investigations have been carried out as part of the research and experimental work of the department, and independent records of cost arc not maintained in such circumstances. 2. The department has accumulated a mass of extremely important data valuable in the general technical aspect of its communication services, and, although finality has net been reached concerning the operation cf the system over submarine cable circuits, the operation of the circuit has been improved. 3. The Wheatstone system does not meet all telegraph requirements. Both the service and economic aspects will benefit considerably hy of a stable machine printing system. FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY.

58,Dr MALONEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice I. Has his attention been called to a paragraph in the Queanbeyan Age of the 2nd instant, in which the following comment is made on certain information supplied by the Minister for Health in reply to a question by the honourable member for Melbourne:-""The writer of the articles in our journal well knew that there were no restrictions in regard to entering the Territory, but the fact still remains that people arc compelled to reside in Canberra in order to hold their jobs. No denial was given to other matters mentioned in the article with reference to butchers, dairymen, &.c, not being permitted to continue to serve their customers who lived in the Territory, nor to other matters re trade, nor to the burning of wood in preference to selling 2. Is it a fact that tradesmen are not permitted to serve customers in the Federal Capital Territory? 3. Is it a faet that citizens in the Territory are not allowed to sell wood in Queanbeyan) 4. If so, does the Minister intend to make trading between Queanbeyan aud the Territory free as it is between State and State?",20
59,Mr BLAKELEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. I have referred - to the newspaper paragraph mentioned by the honourable member. For many years, residents of Queanbeyan enjoyed a large measure of employment in connection with the activities of the Federal Capital. The Federal Government has been compelled, owing to present financial conditions, to suspend the general constructional programme for the Territory, and the limited funds that are available are sufficient only to afford a certain measure of employment to residents of the Territory. The question of employment of persons living in the State is considered to be a matter for the State Government. 2. Restrictions in regard to Queanbeyan tradesmen serving customers in the Federal Capital Territory relate only to the supply of uieut und milk. It is regarded as essential that the sale of meat and milk within the Territory shall, in the interests of public health, be subject to certain control, and permitted only where the conditions of their production can be under scrutiny. The laws of the Territory do not permit of federal authorities exercising such scrutiny within a State. For this reason, the sale within the Territory of meat and milk from Queanbeyan is not permitted. 3. Yes, so far . as unoccupied and leased Crown lands are concerned. The timber is the property of the Crown and its quantity is limited. It has therefore been the policy for several years to reserve the supply for governmental purposes and for the use of the residents of the Territory. 4. As a general principle, it is not desired to interfere with free trading between Queanbeyan and the Territory. The exceptions indicated, however, are considered to be justified on the grounds of public policy. TEXTILE INDUSTRY. CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT .",21

64,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [ 3 . 2 5 ] - I know of no tariff item either in Australia or elsewhere, in which there are such extraordinary features and such peculiar implications as in the item under discussion. The duties on Oregon and baltic in the' 1908-11 tariff ranged from 6d. to 2s. 6d. per 100 super, feet., today, they are as high as 24s. per 100 super, feet. Numerous inquiries have been made regarding these timbers. The first was held by the Interstate Commission in 1914-15, the second by the Tariff 1925,' the third by the board in 1927, the fourth by the board in 1929, and the last by the board in last year. On every occasion the Tariff Board has definitely and cally reported against any increase in these duties, but despite recommendations the rates have been increased to the extraordinary extent in dicated. In its annual report for 1928 the board, commented upon the efforts made by interested parties to influence the Minister, and statedThe method adopted' by interested parties to influence departure from the Tariff Board's recommendation is worthy of study and deserving of strong comment. It has happened, after the Tariff Board has held an inquiry, at which over 100 witnesses were publicly examined on oath, has carefully studied the whole of the public and confidential evidence, and has presented a recommendation to the Minister, that a few men, parties to the application, have made representations to members of Parliament, and to the-GrOvcrnment, which have resulted in the setting aside of the weight of public evidence and the studied recommendations of the board. That is exactly what has happened in connection with these timber duties. "" A few men, parties to the application, made representations to members of Parliament, and to the Government, and succeeded in persuading the Minister to set aside the board's recommendations."" I am with the board in strongly protesting against this procedure. In its report of the 10th June, 1930, the board statedAfter having given the utmost consideration to the matter from all aspects, the board is of opinion that an increase in the present rates of duty on undressed Oregon in sizes 2^ inches (or its equiva-1 12 inches x 4 inches, or its equivalent, and lent), per 100 super, feet, over, will be neither justifiable nor desirable. British, 13s. Od.; intermediate, 13s. Od.; general, Mr JONES - Fro m which report has 15s. Od. the honourable member taken that extract? Mr ARCHDA LE PARKHILL - The last one which the board made on the subject. That report also contains the following observations:After reviewing the position in the principal importing States, the board is satisfied that the most hopeful result that could be anticipated from the adoption of the proposals put forward regarding Oregon is the replacement of Oregon by Australian hardwood to the extent of, at the most, 40,000,000 super, feet out of the average importation of 200,000,000 super, feet. At the very utmost, the imposition of Board in these duties can displace only 20 per cent, of the Oregon and baltic now being used. The views of the board have been enJune of tirely ignored. The board might just as well have saved its own time and the taxemphatipayers' money by ' not making its inquiries. But why have these reports been its ignored? It has been due to the extraordinary agitation that has taken place on this subject-a n agitation which presents some most astounding features. Certain timber interests in Melbourne, who have been lifelong opponents of duties on Oregon and baltic, suddenly made up their minds to associate themselves with those who were endeavouring to push the sale of hardwood, and with a ubiquitous union secretary, in an endeavour to secure, an increase in the duties on Oregon aud baltic. An Irish-American writer has framed this maxim, "" The hardest thing to find in this world is an honest partner for a swindle."" Apparently, those interested in the effort to increase the duties on this timber had no difficulty in finding "" honest partners"" for their swindle, in certain Melbourne timber merchants, their erstwhile enemies who joined with them and the union secretary in urging the Government to take this step. The reason for this change of front was that the timber merchants in question were caught with heavy supplies of timber. They had overbought, and decided to endeavour to protect themselves at the expense of the general public. On this aspect of the subject, Smith's Weekly, of the 28th June, 1930, published the following comment:Tho nigger in the woodpile is represented by a group of Melbourne timber interests. With amazing audacity, this little coterie of importers has attempted to prevail on the Minister to enrich their pockets, and save their skins, at the expense of Australia. Seldom in the history of commercial warfare has such an unblushing change of front been seen. Never in my experience have I known such an unblushing change"" of'front. But the explanation is quite simple. These Melbourne timber merchants, having over-bought, decided to influence the Government to become a party to a transaction which, although entirely opposed to the best interests of the public, would enable them to protect themselves. The quantity of oregou and baltic timber in Australia affected by the increase of these duties was 50,000,000 super, feet. This timber was imported when the duties. were lower, but the price of it has been increased in accordance with the higher duties now in operation. This meant that the timber merchants who owned the timber took from the pockets of the people no less a sum than £150,000. One can understand, in this circumstance, that this building rang with the reverberations of log-rolling at that time. As a money-making proposition, the scheme was far better than Lang's lottery, for there was no risk in it. Moreover, the prize was not_ £5,000, but £150,000. I do not blame ""the hardwood people for accepting the assistance of the softwood timber merchants in endeavouring to promote their interests. At the time the agitation for these high duties was going on, the secretary of the union affected was also working overtime driving from State to State in a brand new Packard car- a make of car which is usually possessed only by people of great wealth. blame the Government for allowing itself to be made an instrument for imposing additional expense on the general public. There was no limit to the audacity of the people who were associated in promoting this scheme. The secretary of the Hardwood Association in one of the States wrote a letter to the leader of my party complaining of certain questions which I asked in this House. He even had the audacity and effrontery to ask that I should be stopped from discussing this matter. Could effrontery'go further than to request that the elected representative of the people should be prevented from expressing his qpinions on the floor of this House? I mention this point to show the extent to which the people engaged in this wild raid upon the pockets of our citizens were prepared to go. They would stop at nothing to achieve their fell purpose. The owners of the baltic and Oregon to whom I have referred will now be able to secure £150,000 more for their timber than they have the right to expect; the hardwood people will have the satisfaction of knowing that very much heavier duties are being imposed on oregon and baltic",22
65,Mr MARR,RETURNED SAILORS AND,And the union secretary will have his car!,23
66,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"But are these the only parties to be considered? By no means! One party has been absolutely ignored by those who have so successfully striven after these additional advantages. There is another party at whose expense this advantage has been obtained: I refer to the users of Oregon, who should rise in their wrath because of the way in which they have been imposed upon by those whom I have just mentioned. The interests of oregon users were uot considered for one moment; they were merely asked to pay up, in order to benefit those who held large stocks. Those importers did not consider the position of suburban timber merchants who were unfortunate enough to be caught with timber on the water. Their interests were too small to be considered in this wild grab. They had merely to pay the higher duties imposed, which resulted in some of them appearing in the Bankruptcy Court. Later I shall supply ample But I evidence to prove that there is no economic substitute for oregon. I have not time to include this at present. These duties place an additional impost of £440,000 annually on the users of Oregon, because, regardless of the duties, a certain quantity of this timber must be used. In order to obtain supplies of an essential commodity, those engaged in the building trade have to pay nearly £500,000 in duty, which is eventually taken out of the pockets of the people. Oregon used for mining purposes is admitted free of duty, because no other timber is suitable for that purpose. Oregon is also essential in concrete constructional work, as no other timber can be utilized for that purpose. Further, it is an absolute necessity for constructing homes for the poorer section of the people. An ordinary weatherboard cottage, conjisting of three rooms and a kitchen, and constructed in the customary method of tilting Oregon and Australian timbers, would cost £322 Is. od.; but, if constructed solely of Australian timber, would cost £405 17s. 9d., an increase of £83 16s. 4d., or 26.02 per cent.",23
67,Mr CURTIN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Thos e figures are governed largely by the locality in which inch a> house is built.,24
68,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"In this case the quotations are based on two bouses, built in the same locality, and therefore the comparison cannot bo challenged. Messrs. Howie and Moffatt, one of the best known contracting firms in Australia, which has just completed the Bank of New South Wales in Sydney, provided in the foregoing detailed estimates indisputable evidence that these duties place an unnecessarily heavy burden upon the working class of this community. I am not unmindful of the difficulties of those engaged in the hardwood trade; but they' arc not comparable with the misery of the men who are compelled to walk the streets' vainly seeking work in consequence of the inactivity in the building trade, due largely to the excessive cost of oregon and other building materials. These duties have been imposed owing to the ill-advised action of the Minister. The cost of buildings constructed in Sydney and suburbs for the vear 1928 was £9,76S,000; in 1929, £9,070,000, and in 1930, £2,356,000.",24
69,Mr MARTENS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Why wa3 the reduction so pronounced?,24
70,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND, Largely in consequence of the excessive costs resulting from the imposition of those duties. The figures for the present year will be even worse.,24
71,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Does not the honourable member think that the general trade depression was largely responsible?,24
72,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"But for the policy of this Government tha depression would not have been so severe. Business men would have stimulated trade had the Government kept its nose out of the affairs of commerce. The greatest obstacle confronting business men today is the ill-advised and interfering attitude of this callow Minister for Trade and Customs, who places his opinions beforo men who have given their lives to th« businesses in which they are engaged. These duties are of no benefit to the hardwood timber industry. If an embargo were placed upon the importation of oregon, what would be used in its place? Either New Zealand rimu or cement or asbestos sheeting. The Tariff Board sets out quite clearly that much, of the depression in the hardwood industry is due to lack of organization on the part of those engaged in that industry. "" Much of the difficulty experienced by local sawmillers in disposing of timber,"" says the Tariff Board, "" is due to the absence of organized methods of marketing and selling their timbers."" The board also saysAnother mutter which culls for serious ""-jiisidoration is that of bringing about a reduction of mills. Many of these mills ceased operations, but even at the present time it would appear that the industry is over burdened with saw-mills operating individually. The effect of this is: (1) intensified competition; (2) ratio of invested capital to business unsound; (3) ratio of overhead charges to output excessive! [Quorum formed.] Hardwood can never take the place of baltic flooring, except where it is specially required. Both classes of timber have definite economic uses, and to attempt to substitute the one for the other, even to a limited extent, is about as foolish as expecting a man to wear his boots where his ha.t ought to be. These duties have also prevented the importation of a paltry £150,000 worth of Japanese oak which was very useful in filling up vessels and decreasing the freight rates to Australia, about which we are complaining at the present time. Australia exports to Japan goods to the value of £11,518,986, and imports from that country only £4,707,299 worth. Japanese oak is used merely for furniture, and the Australian trade in it has not increased over a number of years. The importations were doing no harm to any one, but the prohibition of this timber has interfered with our commercial relations with Japan, aud engendered a bad feeling in that country towards Australia. Norway and Sweden fake from us, through Great Britain, infinitely more than we take from them; but by stopping the importation of Baltic timbers we have set up against ourselves potentially disgruntled nations, inasmuch as they can rightly claim that they get from us no consideration for the produce they buy from us. It is useless to say that we can live to ourselves. It is all very well for those who have never been outside Australia, or even outside their own State, and who never read anything to improve their minds, to argue that Australia need take no notice of the other nations of the world. We live by selling to the other nations, and we cannot afford to ignore them in the way we are doing. As a protest against these duties, I move an amendment to restore' the rates to those in existence in 1927-28. I move That the suh-item bo amended by adding the following:"" And on and after 9th October, 1931(H ) Timber, undressed, viz.:Douglas Fir {l'seiidolsuga lasii) (1) In sizes of 12 inches by G (2) In sizes of 7 inches by 2i (3) In sizes less than 7 inches",24
73,Mr GULLETT,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Henty) [3.55] - In the timber division of this schedule, there are about 50 items, covering the whole range of timbers in use in Australia, but I do not feel in the least competent to discuss them, although I venture to say that I know as much about them as most honourable members. Mostly as the result of brain waves on the part of the Minister, and to some extent, as the result of a number of most unsatisfactory hole-and-corner conferences among interested parties, the Government, flouting the reports of the Tariff Board, has proposed drastic changes in the rates of duty. The timber industry is in a most chaotic state so far as the tariff is concerned. No one can have the faintest idea what effect these duties are likely to have, whether the benefits to the sawmillers will not be altogether nullified by the financial punishment inflicted on every user of timber in the community. It is not possible for the committee to debate these alterations intelligently, nor is the Minister capable of explaining his reasons for making them. I , therefore, suggest that the whole of the timber items of this' schedule afford a first-class opportunity to the Government to break new ground in the way of tariff inquiry. I have long been of opinion that it is impossible for a Tariff Board of four Dougmembers to cover adequately the whole range of Australian industries, and my inches (or its equivalent) suggestion is that the Minister should and over- set up a special board of inquiry into (a) For use underground for mining the whole range of the timber industry, purposes as preand that upon that board there should scribed by depart- be representatives of every ramification of mental by-laws, Brit- the industry; the saw-millers, the timber ish, free; intermediate, free; gene- merchants, the master builders, the users ral, free; of timbers, and the important industrial (6) Other, per 100 unions concerned. As the honourable mem 8s.; intermediate, 8s.; general, 8s. excellent speech has pointed out, there is a very definite"" conflict of opinion between inches (or its equivalent) the various industries affected by these and upwards, and less than duties. I protest against this awful mess 12 inches by 0 inches (or we have had presented to us. Nothing its equivalent) per 100 super, feet, British, 9s. Gd.; could be less business like, nothing more intermediate, 9s. Gd.; obscure than this range of duties. I beg general, 9s.

Us.; general, l is . people of the Commonwealth.",25
74,Mr CURTIN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Fremantle) [4.0] - I feel disposed to welcome the suggestion of the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett). I say that as one who has had some reason for endeavouring to understand the extraordinary intricacies of the timber industry - I mentioned last night that for five years I was federal president of the Timber Workers Federation of Australia, and in that capacity I found it extremely difficult to reconcile the variations of the points of view of the timber employees, let alone the employers, in the various States, and it was almost an impossibility for the federal council of the union to arrive at a tariff policy. As a result, such representations as were made to Ministers at that time with respect to the tariff were made by State branches, acting independently of the federation, and usually in association with the employers of their own particular States. Thus, frequently the Timber Workers Federal Council was faced with the extraordinary spectacle of a branch union acting in combination with the employers of its State to impose upon the country generally a tariff policy to which the timber-workers of the other States were entirely opposed. I ask those honourable members who believe that the difficulties of the timber industry at this period are attributable to the deficiencies of the tariff, to consider this extraordinary position: there is considerable unemployment in the brickmaking industry of Australia. The decline in the demand for bricks has been almost as great proportionately as the decline in the demand for timber; but it surely cannot be said that the losses suffered in the brick-making industry are attributable to the inadequacy of the tariff in respect of the protection afforded to the workers.",25
75,Mr GULLETT,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Has not the Minister placed a duty on bricks?,26
76,Mr CURTIN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,No .,26
77,Mr GULLETT,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Surely that is an overnight.,26
78,Mr CURTIN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"There are proportionately as many unemployed in the brick-making industry as in the timber industry. The decline in the demand for timber, as in the demand for bricks, is due, in part, to the general depression; but before the depression made any of its evil effects manifest in Australia, there had been a decline in both the brick-making and the timber industries, because of the advent of concrete and steel increasing factors in large building construction. The gradual alteration of architectural practice, particularly in the principal cities, meant necessarily the use of diminishing quantities of timber and bricks in building construction. Even in what we regard as pre-depression times, the timber and the brick-making industries were being adversely affected because of the development of new methods of construction. Let us examine the alterations in the duties. Take for instance oregon logs in the rough. The old duty was 5 per cent., 5 per cent, and 10 per cent., and the new duty is 10 per cent., 20 per cent, and 30 per cent. In the old days the duty on oregon brought into be sawn on the benches-size , 12 inches by 6 inches-wa s 8s., 8s. and 8s. per 100 super, feet. It is now proposed to substitute a duty of 13s., 13s. and 14s. per 100 super, feet. Let me tell the Minister that the proposed duty is practically prohibitive. It ensures either that oregon will not be imported, or that, if it is imported, its price will be such as to make its use almost prohibitive. There is an intimate relation between the price which the millers charge for Australian hardwood and that at which oregon is available in Australia. When I was associated' with the Timber Workers Union, we could always estimate the price of either hardwood or oregon by the price of the other. Those who are familiar with the industry must admit that Oregon has its special uses. That is admitted even in respect of the tariff, because oregon for mining purposes is admitted free, but this class of timber has a special use in building construction. I do not say that it is essential to use. oregon to the extent to which it was used prior to 1911; but, with regard to certain types of roofing, it is desirable to have a satisfactory tensile strength without having excessive weight. For that purpose, in certain classes of structures, any architect who knows his business specifies oregon. I therefore do not propose to support a policy which will make it impossible for oregon to be used in Australia except for mining purposes. In adopting that attitude, I believe that I am acting in the best interests of the timber industry. There has to be competition with the Australian hardwood r millers if we are to protect the public. 1 say that as one who bad to fight the timber employers for many years. Only last, week I informed honourable members on this side of the chamber that the timber employers in Western Australia had been successful in having wages reduced by 18 per cent.; but it cannot be urged that that attack upon the workers' standard of living in Western Australia was made necessary by the importation of oregon which made it impossible for the local industry to be successful. The employers' case was based on high freights, and costs, and the fall in the market prices. No one put forward the plea that the industry in Western Australia was lacking in prosperity because of the excessive importation of oregon. Let me tell honourable members who accept the statements of the members of the Victorian Hardwood Millers Association, in respect of the fairness of the prices charged by them, that the average hardwood miller is simply the dummy for a city timber merchant, and is allowed to put up a case in support of increased duties on oregon in order that the price of hardwood may be advanced.",26
79,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The price of Australian bardwood, since these duties have been imposed, has been reduced by 30 per cent.",27
80,Mr CURTIN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That is because the millers cannot sell their stocks of hardwood. The existing competition in selling prices has no relation to ordinary business practice. It is in part attributan able to the effect of certain firms being obliged to realise their assets in order to meet their obligations, ^ e have therefore had this undoubted unloading of 3tocks. Those who believe that the legislation of this Parliament is treated by the employers have to remember that the sugar agreement is at present being grossly abused by the Colonial Sugar Refinery Company, despite its assurances to the contrary. I represent the workers, and I refuse to accept the declarations of any group of employers that they will not increase prices if granted these concessions. I know that, at the first opportunity, they would exploit the public. The prohibition of the importation of oregon into the Commonwealth would give Australian hardwood millers an opportunity that they would not otherwise possess, and I know Australian hardwood associations enough to believe that they would take that opportunity to pluck the public. Can any honourable, member seriously claim that it is necessary to impose a duty of 13s. per 100 super, feet on 12-in. by 10-in. oregon in order to protect the Australian hardwood industry? Why, fourteen or fifteen years ago we could buy oregon in Australia for 25s. a hundred super, feet. The proposed duty represents an extortionate impost. If the Australian hardwood industry cannol carry on with the existing duties, it cannot carry on at all. I remind the honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones) how the Australian timber employers fought the strike of workmen, only a few years ago. I remember honourable members on this side, who were then in opposition, railing at the Timber Merchants Association. Then, honourable members would not, accept their assurances that they were bona fide, honest men. Since then the timber merchants have availed themselves of every opportunity to reduce the wages of their employees. How comes it that honourable members on this side are now prepared to accept their declaration that, if overseas competition is shut out. they will be fair to the Australian public? As a general practice they have riot been fair either to the Australian public, or to their employees. I see no reason why I should give these people absolute monopoly of the Australian market, and I refuse to vote for the increased duties.",27
81,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wide Bay) 14.12] - I cannot allow to go unchallenged the statements of the honourable  which really give voice to the brief that he holds from the importing saw-milling interests of Sydney. My purpose is to conserve the interests and promote the development of our primary industries; it is my desire to see our own timber used for constructional work, and the trade stimulated. The assertions of the honourable member for Warringah are not borne out by facts. He stated that when the Government increased the duties on oregon and baltic pine, there was an accumulation of imported softwood timbers 'in this country amounting to 70,000,000 super, feet. He implied that the Government had done something that was not honourable; that its action in increasing the duty had enabled timber importing concerns to reap a benefit of £150,000. He said that the importers after flooding the market arranged with the Government for the imposition of a high duty so that they could make huge profits. If . the honourable member were conversant with the facts he-would know that for months before the imposition of those duties the timber interests of Australia had been endeavouring to persuade the Government to increase the duty, or even place an embargo, on oregon. While the Government delayed in taking action, timber importers accumulated huge stocks at the old rates of duty. "" That is why there was 70,000,000 super, feet of oregon in stock in Australia when the new duties become operative, and why there is now such a dearth of employment in our forests and saw-mills. Howover, it is not fair that the honourable member should say that this Government co-operated with the importing interests, and enabled them to flood the market. Actually, the new rates were imposed originally at the request of the timberworkers, who pointed to the need for greater protection against the imported article. To illustrate his point that the increased duty on oregou had killed the building trade the honourable member stated that in 1929 the building activities carried out in Sydney amounted to £9,071,000, while in 1930 they had fallen to £2,356,000, due, he declared, to the high duties on imported timber. The honourable member made no reference to the depression, which, obviously, brought about the decline. That is a typical instance of the weakness of the case adduced by him - article, I am afraid that the honourable member is not concerned about any additional cost in the workers' homes; he seeks rather to conserve the interests of the timber importers. If he had his way he would flood Australia with importations, cause a dearth of employment, and reduce our workers to the coolie level. If we have any regard for the interests of our workers we must protect Australian industries. Mr Bernard Corser. The honourable member also stated that, oregon is a necessity; that it is brought in free for mining purposes and for use as scaffolding. It is; and it is used in only one mine in Australia-that of the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited. Por years the great mines in Queensland have used our own hardwoods, and today those timbers are sound, and standing up to the job splendidly. No other timber in the world will stand a greater strain than Australian hardwood, which could advantageously be substituted at Broken Hill for oregon. We have pine' in Australia that is admirably suited for scaffolding, and available in any lengths required. Everywhere in my State first class timbers are waiting the application of the axe, ready for use in the country that has grown them. In my own district there are great pine scrubs, where timber is rotting and going to waste because unpatriotic timber merchants prefer the imported article. Equally as good as oregon, that pine is there in quantity, and Australian workers are available, anxious to hew and market it. The honourable member for Warringah declared that, except in special instances, hardwood cannot take the place of baltic for flooring. I submit that there is no timber on the market more suited for flooring purposes than Australian hardwood. It is astounding and unfortunate that Australia, and particularly New South Wales, has not used more of its own hardwood for flooring. The honourable member stated that, if a threeroomed weatherboard cottage were constructed of Australian instead of imported timber, it would cost an additional £83 6s. 4d. If that is so, it is rather curious that the poorer workers of Queensland did not construct their homes of imported timber. Invariably they U3ed the local and they possess the cheapest and most satisfactory homes that could be built. I venture the opinion that it is not the shortcomings of Australian timbers that caused the honourable member to make such statements. His attitude can be attributed to other motives. We know that, whether it be for the cottage of the worker, the mansion of the magnate, or the imposing edifices of the business world, Australian timbers are unsurpassed. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) intimated that the hardwood millers of Victoria act as dummies for the city merchants. That cannot be said generally of' our hardwood millers. In my State, the . hardwood miller is usually interested in the hewing and hauling of the timber, as well as in its later treatment. Our railways, which were constructed to open up our vast hinterland, will lose even more heavily if we encourage the importation of foreign timbers. A pastoralist in my electorate ringbarked some millions of feet of hardwood, upon which the Forestry Board charged him a royalty, declaring it to be saleable. When he endeavoured to market it, he could not obtain 6d. per 100 superficial feet for it. The reason is that this 70,000,000 superficial feet of oregon is in the hands of merchants in our two leading capital cities, people who have disseminated propaganda lauding the alleged advantages of the imported article and belittling our own timbers. The honourable member for Fremantle said that it is necessary to have'the competition afforded by the importation of Oregon, otherwise our hardwood millers will exploit the public. That is not the case in Queensland.",27
82,Mr MAXWELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Would the hardwood millers be likely to tell the honourable member if it were so?,29
83,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The teamsters and timber-cutters would very quickly make it known if it were so. In my State the timber interests and the public work amicably together to advance the local timber industry. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) does not regard the timber merchants as honest men. I condemn the importation of oregon, becauseI believe that we should use the timber which grows in this country. We have the timber and also the men, the teams, the tractors, the railways, and the roads to convey it to the users; but for lack of sufficient protection to the local indusperts try, imported timber is used in large quantities throughout Australia. It is time that we took adequate steps to protect this native industry against imported timber. [Quorum formed.] [20]",29
84,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Franklin) [4.27] - I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay' (Mr Corser) that we should protect the Australian timber industry. Indeed, I regret that the Minister has not seen, his way to place an embargo on the importation of timber from other countries. Honourable members opposite have decried Australian timbers. The honourable member for War not carry heavy weights, that it is brittle and breaks easily, and is unsuitable for many purposes. At one time, I was employed in one of the largest mines in Australia, in which Australian timber was used exclusively. That timber was so satisfactory that when one stope was worked out, the timber was, contrary to the mining regulations, removed and used elsewhere. Only sound timber could be used in that way.",29
85,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That could not have been done had the timber been called upon to bear much weight.,29
86,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Australia n timber is also used in the Queensland mines. Unfortunately, we have allowed the Broken Hill mines to be timbered with imported oregon. Had the use of oregon been prevented in the beginning the mining companies there would have been forced to use Australiau timber. Their unpatriotic action in using imported timber in preference to timber grown in Australia is to be regretted.",29
87,Mr ARCHDALE PARJEHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Why did not the honourable member object yesterday? The item went through on the voices.,29
88,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"We , on this side, are adhering to the schedule; the honourable member accepts the policy laid down by the importers. It has also been coptended that it is necessary to import baltic timber for flooring purposes. Australia has many timbers suitable for that purpose. Indeed, many European exare of the opinion that Australian hardwoods are superior to most other timbers for use as flooring boards. . Australia has exported many millions of feet of flooring timbers. Some years ago, Tasmania sent some magnificent timber to England to be used in the construction. of a breakwater at Dover. Some of that timber was 20 inches by 20 inches and 120 feet long.",29
89,Mr MAXWELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Is the honourable member advocating the removal of the duty?,30
90,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am in favour of an embargo on the importation of oregon. Four years ago, the timber-workers of Tasmania were in constant employment and earning good wages; today there are 1,000 timber-workers unemployed in that State. Instead of there being villages of contented, happy people, the timberworkers and their families are destitute and depressed. During the recent adjournment, I met Mr Burgess, the warden of the Esperance district, who told me that in the timber districts of Tasmania, from ' which he had just returned, the people were practically starving. pointed out by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones) yesterday, these getters are a superior class of men. Although many of them are almost as powerful as giants, they are unable to make a livin g because of the competition from imported timbers. I agree with a good deal that has been said regarding the distribution of timber throughout Australia. The high price of timber is due, not to high wages being paid to the timber-workers, or to any excessive profits made by the millowners, but to the charges made by city distributing merchants. The Government should have some control of the selling price of commodities which are protected. If that were the case, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) would have no ground for complaint that a prohibitive duty on timber would lead to the exploitation of the timber-users in Australia. The Indi district of Victoria oontairis some of the finest forests iii the world; yet men there are unable to make a livelihood because of the importation of - timber from other countries. Honourable members opposite have contended that if we did not import timber, our own forests would be denuded of timber in a few years. That is not so. Each year millions of feet of timber are lost through bush fires and the ravages of various pests. A proper system of afforestation would ensure an almost unlimited supply of timber, because the timber in our forests is growing faster than it is being used. I trust that the committee will not agree to a reduction of the duty.  listened with interest to the remarks of honourable members as to the relative merits of various timbers. Australia is far behind the rest of the world in afforestation matters. In South Australia a good deal has been done, chiefly with softwoods. If it could be shown that Australian timbers are suitable for all purposes, I should be pleased, but although I regard the Australian timber industry as one of great importance to this country, I doubt whether Australian hardwood is as suitable as oregon for certain purposes. I have had some experience in the building trade, and As regret to have to admit that, in my opinion, oregon is more suitable than timberAustralian hardwood for roofing purposes.",30
91,Mr CULLEV,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Does the honourable member mean that it is more durable?  superior to hardwood as a roofing timber. The Tariff Board, in reporting on the substitution of Australian timber for Oregon, and in referring to the State of South Australia, remarkedThis State produces practically no hardwoods suitable for building purposes. As to softwoods, considerable areas have been planted with pines, but these plantations will not be producing supplies of timber in any material quantities for some years. Very few wooden houses are built in South Australia, the large proportion of the buildings being of stone or brick. Hardwoods are obtained - from other States, principally stringy-bark from Tasmania and jarrah from Western Australia. These hardwoods are used for purposes where strength is the main requirement, but oregon is used almost without exception, for roofing purposes. Owing to the climatic conditions in South Australia, hardwood timbers are not suitable for roofing purposes. Saw-millers contend that, if hardwood can be used for roofing purposes in Tasmania, it should be suitable for that purpose in South Australia, but the experience in the building trade in my State is that the hardwood scantling timbers produced in Tasmania warp and twist when used in South Australia, owing, as I have said, to the hot and d r y c l i m at i c conditions. The report of the T a r if f B o a r d c o n t in u e dAfter reviewing the position in the principal importing States, the hoard is satisfied that the most hopeful result that could be anticipated from the adoption of the proposals put forward regarding oregon is the replacement of oregon by Australian hardwood to the extent of, at the most, 40,000,000 super, feet per annum (i.e., in normal times) out of the average importation of 200,000,000 super, feet. The heavy d u t y on oregon has not had the effect of increasing the o u t put of Australian hardwood as a substitute for oregon; it has rather proved a burden to in d u s try . The d u t y of 8s. per 100 super, feet is, in the case of merchantable oregon, in the v i c in it y of 110 per cent, ad v a l o r e m . I realise that the Government imposed the h i g h d u t y on oregon for the purpose of encouraging Australian in d u s try . That is a most laudable objective, and I hope that in those States where hardwoods are suitable for b u i l d in g purposes they will be used. In a letter that I have received from the B u i l d e r s and Contractors Assoc i at i o n of So u t h Australia passage occurs:We again approach you in reference to the duty on Oregon. The building trade in this State is at a standstill. Wo have practically no bush mills in South Australia, and oregon must be used for roofing, &c. We do not know of any work where hardwood has replaced Oregon, and given extra employment in the mills. No extra employment has been given to employees in bush mills in this State, but unemployment has been caused by this overloading, which means about £16 per house, and which has to be carried for all time. Let me now give a V i c to r i a n o p in i o n . The R e in for c e d Concrete and M o n i e r Pipe Construction Company P r o p r i e t a r y L i m it e d , M e l b o u r n e , in a letter to me, dated the 23rd June, stateWe should like to add our protest against the excessive duty on oregon timber, which matter, 'we understand, you are proposing to bring forward in the House. We have been very large users of Oregon in our work for the past 25 years, and, on account of the s?ry high cost of this material, have, from time to Lime, made many experiments with other timbers-particularl y with hardwood. results of all our experiments have been most unsatisfactory, and we have been forced back to Oregon, or in some cases baltic T. and G. sheeting. Our local hardwood is entirely unsuitable for reinforced concrete work, not only on account of its hardness making it much more coBtly than oregon in respect of labour, but because it warps and shrinks so that the necessary watertight forming for concrete cannot be obtained. This condition is generally reached before any concrete can be laid on it , and, in any case, the hardwood can only be used once, as against repeated use of oregon. The position, therefore, is that the cost of a ll reinforced concrete structures is seriously increased by the high cost of the essential timber for this work, and any relief that may be possible in respect of the cost of this material would affect all concrete structures throughout Australia. Mr H . E . R e i d , of R e i d B r o the r s , P o r t Adelaide, is an expert on t i m be r , and he has supplied me with the following in for m at i o n concerning the c o m m e r c i a l possibilities of pinus insign is':The timber to which pinus insign is must be compared when considering its market value is Oregon. At the present time pinus insign is costs no less than 7s. 6d. per 100 feet super, more delivered at Port Adelaide than oregon. This fact, coupled with the inferiority of the timber itself, as compared with Oregon for general purposes renders it a hopeless proposition. The material would have to be stocked in a variety of small sizes, whereas overseas timber is imported in large flitches and can be , the following cut up as required. . . . The fact that constructional timbers such as oregon are often needed in lengths of 40 to 50 feet preclude all possibility of using pinus insign is in its place, as, not only is this timber unobtainable in long lengths, but even if it were, the inherent weakness of the timber is such as to render ineffectual the very object for which long lengths are needed. Joinery - Providin g that exceptional care is allowed in selecting the materials-and an allowance of about 50 per cent, made for waste more than the timber commonly used for this purpose-it could be used, but even then it must be kiln dried. It is asserted by tradesmen that, in any case, it is not suitable for sashes, doors, door frames, or casement frames. For box-frames and other joinery requiring only small sizes and short lengths of timber, it has been used; but, considering that the use is restricted to these lines, and the care that'has to be exercised in selection, together with waste, it is not really a commercial proposition for this purpose. For Other Purposes - Whil e it is known that selected material has been used in the Architect-in-Chief's jobs for floorings, and very occasionally for joinery, the merchants have every reason to believe that they would only be supplied with the material which would be left after the Government had selected the The best quality stuff for themselves. The fact must also be borne in mind, when discussing the Government jobs which have used this timber, that the material has only been put in the jobs because the specifications have forced the builders to use it irrespective of their own personal opinions on the matter. The royal commission which investigated the finances of South Australia, as they were affected by federation, reported at page 25Oregon pine imported from the United of America, and flooring boards and deals imported from Korway andSweden, all which are necessary for building construction, and which constitute the major portion of timber used in an average dwelling-house, cannot be adequately replaced by Australian-grown timber. The abnormally high tariff - m these timbers lui3 the effect of imposing an addiI tional burden ou South Australia as comsary pared with the other five States, due to the fact that the requirements of the latter partially met by locally-grown timber. Speaking for the State of South Austimber. tralia, I say that our hardwoods cannot take the place of Oregon. Consequently, I intend to oppose the increased duty.",30
92,Mr MARTENS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Herbert) [4.58] support the increased duty. It is sugment. gested that Oregon is necessary for very many purposes. It certainly is debatare able whether we possess a timber that can replace it for high scaffolding work. If there is such a timber, I do not know of it. I have gone into this matter very carefully with persons whom I can trust in the fullest sense, both employers labour and employees, and they are uuanimously of the opinion that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for tralia to provide a timber that is suitable for scaffolding purposes. I wish to discuss the matter principally from the point of view of the mining industry. In the State of Queensland, there are many very big mines which can have used an enormous quantity of timare ber. It is a long time since a number of them have been worked, yet the timber which they contain is as good today when it was put in. The timbers that have been mostly used are ironbark and bluegum. After Mt. Morgan had been operating for a considerable number of case or not. years, the company undertook to try out the open cut system of mining. Only the first two levels were worked on system, and an enormous stack of timber was taken from them. I was privileged to be present when Mr Justice Webb, the late Mr W. J. Dunstan, and the late Hon. W. N . Gillies, on one occasion, visited Mt. Morgan to sit in that town as an industrial court. In the company of Mr Eoyd, the general manager, we inspected the timber taken from the first two levels, and found that it was quite as good as when it was put in 30 or 40 years previously. There is no denying States the weight that has to be held up by timber in the Mt. Morgan mine, and the of same applies to the Scottish mine in Gympie. A terrific weight in the shape of a mountain is borne in the different levels of the Mt. Morgan mine; yet very little, if any, oregon has been used there. t has been suggested that oregon is necesfor building purposes. Very little are is used in Queensland except in the case of a few big buildings, and then only because . it is cheaper than Australian That is largely the reason which underlies the advocacy of the use of Oregon to a greater extent than other timbers. Millions of feet of it were imported I during the regime of the lastGovernMany other imported articles that are today being replaced by those that manufactured in Australia, come within the same category. Eor years the argument was advanced that Australia was not capable of providing at a suitable price, what its citizens needed. That idea is gradually being dissipated. 'We of can provide the different timbers that are needed for various purposes, but we must dispel the impression that the imAusported article is needed if the job is to be done properly. The honourable  quoted certain figures relating to costs. I am not prepared to lock horns with him on that phase of the matter, but I say that we have all the timbers which required for the construction of the houses of which he spoke. I agree with the honourable member for Eremantle as (Mr Curtin), who, by way of interjection, said that it would depend very largely on the locality in which the houses were built, as to whether that was the",32
93,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I have that taken two in the same locality.,32
94,Mr MARTENS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I shall not discuss that aspect of the matter. I say that we have the requisite timber in abundance. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) that when timber is matured it should be harvested, and that if it is not, it deteriorates, as the result of the activities of pests, dry rot, and the like. Yesterday, the honor son) expressed the belief that the reduction of royalties might have a very good effect on the timber industry. I believe that royalties are altogether too high. But there is something that is even worse, and that is a practice which has been adopted by different, governments, particularly the Governments of the State from which I come, both past and present. I have had arguments on the subject with Mr Swain, and also with Mr. MCCormack, when he was Minister for Lands in that State. The practice to which I refer is to place an up3et price on standing timber, and then sell it by auction, the result being that the person who wishes to build a home has to pay an excessive price for the timber on account of the competition that is thereby instigated. When an upset price is placed on timber by the departmental officers, that ought to provide a sufficient return. The only person who benefits from the present arrangement is the miller, who is able to pay a high figure for the timber. He operates through a dummy, who frequently is involved financially with him, and thus is the victim of circumstance. The dummy allegedly is the purchaser, but he derives no benefit except the honour and glory of harvesting the timber for the miller aud the merchants in town. T. am prepared to do all that is possible to prevent the importation of either oregon or any other timber so long as we have timber that is suitable for the work that has to bo done. Consequently, I have no hesitation in supporting the Minister in his attempt to improve the market for our own product. I do not believe that the amount of duty imposed is more than is necessary for the protection of our own indnstry. I am of the opinion that oregon has been used in this country because it has been cheap, and because it can be dumped here at a rate at which our timber cannot compete with it. Another great difficulty with which industry has to contend, was mentioned yesterday. An enormous number of sawAustralian mills have been established, which today arc causing a lot of trouble, because the quantity of timber available for sawfor milling purposes is not sufficient to keep them all functioning uninterruptedly. That, however, is a small factor, which is hardly worth considering in the general sense. I contend that we have an ample supply of timber for all our needs, except for scaffolding purposes. I would be prepared to allow oregon to be imported free of duty for that purpose. I am not a revenue tariffist, and do not believe that it is a good proposition to impose duties merely with that object. If we cannot produce any commodity which the people need, it should be allowed to come in free of duty so that it can be purchased as cheaply as possible. At the same time, I admit the soundness of the contention of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin), that the merchants will take advatitage of the duty to make as much profit as possible. That, however, applies to every walk of life. It has been suggested that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has committed a breach of the sugar agreement, but that company did not act alone in that matter. In the application to the court it had associated with it a number of other parties. A monopoly will not be given to the timber merchants to any greater extent"" than that which they, possess at the present time. With all due deference to any opinions that may be held to the contrary, I say that the presence of oregon in Australia today does not affect very greatly the selling price of timber so far as the consumers are concerned.",32
95,Mr LATHAM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Kooyong) [5.6] - I should feel more satisfied in regard to these proposals could I obtain replies to representations that have been made to me hy timber merchants and builders. I regard the timber industry as subsidiary to the building industry, the furnituremaking industry, and the like. It is no good doing anything to timber that will prevent its use for building and other purposes. If the effect of imposing a duty is to increase building costs in such the a measure that there is no compensation by way of increased employment in the timber industry, obviously the duty cannot be justified. Oregon, as we all know, is a very fine timber, indeed, many purposes, and I wish that Australia were fortunate enough to possess it in large quantities. We have extensive hardwood forests, but not so extensive ns many people imagine. I have been I old by many responsible people - that were wo to go straight ahead in the use of our hardwoods for all building purposes, the stock of usable hardwood would not last for more than fifteen or twenty years.",33
96,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That statement differs from the opinion of experts.,34
97,Mr LATHAM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That is the view of some experts; I should like to hear that of others. In quoting prices, one has to distinguish between the price at sidings and the price at the yards; but I think I am safe in saying that, speaking generally, the price of Oregon is at least twice that of hardwood at the present time. I have been informed that, under existing conditions, notwithstanding the considerably higher pi'ice of oregon and the fact that, in Victoria at any rate, the price of hardwood has recently been decreased, the sales of oregon are being maintained in the same proportion to hardwood sales as was formerly the case. I am unable to believe that there is a general conspiracy against the use of Australian woods. It is to everybody's interest, except possibly that of a few importers, that Australian wood shall be used to a maximum extent. If it be the case that oregon sales are maintaining their proportion-havin g regard, of course, to the greatly reduced building activity which is at once the sign, the symbol, and the result of the prevailing depression-it appears to. me to be very difficult to justify an increase of the duty, allegedly in order to help the Australian timber industry. If these be the facts, and surely they are readily enough ascertainable, the imposition of higher duties will not really assist the Australian timber industry in competition with oregon, but, on the contrary, will make it still more difficult and expensive to build than was the case previously. Like every other honourable member, I have some personal knowledge of the value of Australian hardwood. I have Tasmanian weatherboards and flooring in a house, and I do not wish to see anything better. It is a splendid wood, beautifully turned out, but expensive. Still, J was prepared to pay the price, and I am proud of it. On the other hand, I have had Victorian hardwood which was not a credit to anybody, because so much of it was sap wood and badly seasoned.",34
98,Mr MARTENS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That was not the fault of the timber itself.,34
99,Mr LATHAM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"It was the fault of the suppliers. I merely mention the fact because I consider that some timber suppliers need to develop - a better sense of their responsibility to an important Australian industry. On one occasion, when I asked to be supplied with the best hardwood timber procurable, I was furnished with timber that was not at all satisfactory. One external floor has been renewed three times in twelve years. It is now down in jarrah, another Australian timber, but more expensive, and I have no doubt that it will see me out. In not a few instances the reputation of Australian hardwood suffers, not because the timber itself is faulty, but because suppliers have not a proper sense of their responsibility. For this reason I should like to see some definite, action taken by the Australian timber industry to maintain and enhance the reputation of our very fine timbers. . If it be a fact that sales of oregon, in relation to hardwood sales, are being maintained in much the same proportion as hitherto, we are not likely to assist the Australian timber industry by these duties. The only effect of them will be to increase the cost of building. When I consider the excessive duties that have been levied on glass, galvanized iron, and many other commodities, and think what house-building is going to cost in the future, I feel that I must be satisfied on the points which I have raised, before I can support these duties.",34

105,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"This Government is endeavouring, by means of its tariff policy, to build up Australian industries. The honourable member for Warringah, in his opposition to these duties, quoted certain statements that appeared in Smith's Weekly. I have no doubt that the information supplied to that newspaper came from the same source as the information used by the honourable member this afternoon, namely, from the timber importing interests in Sydney, which have been right up against these duties ever since they were imposed. They are prepared to use Smith's Weekly, the"" honourable member, or anybody who is willing to voice their objections to the Government's policy. The honourable gentleman also attributed the decline ir* building activities throughout the Commonwealth to these higher timber duties. The real cause is to be found in the shrinkage of the national income by £200,000,000, and the fact that the Commonwealth can no longer borrow yearly £40,000,000 overseas, by which means this country enjoyed a condition of artificial prosperity for so many years. The3e factors, more than the incidence of the timber duties, are responsible for a falling off in building activities throughout the Commonwealth. If people could have obtained' the timber for nothing there would have been little, if any, more building, because of late there has not been the demand for houses, and, as. a result, the building trade is passing through a period of severe depression. There are thousands of empty houses in all our capital cities, and in The the larger provincial centres of its population. Many people, .instead of living in homes of their own, are now in tenements. Therefore it is sheer nonsense to attribute the depression in the building trade to the timber duties imposed by this Government. When framing its tariff - policy, the Governmenthad to bear in mind the fact that our ovterseas commitments required the payment annually of approximately £48,000,000. Accordingly, we deemed it desirable to increase the protection on those products which we can manufacture or grow in Australia. Timber being one, we resolved that, so far as possible, Australia's requirements should be„ supplied from local sources. Our trade agreement with Canada permits the importation of Canadian timber under favourable terms, and in return we have been able to secure a generous measure of preference for Australian primary products in the Canadian market. Possibly, there is no other commodity covered by the present tariff resolution concerning which such greatly divergent views are held even by those holding definitely protectionist opinions. Briefly stated, it might be said that there are three distinct schools of thought regarding the effects of protective duties in the local timber industry. The first school maintains that the quantities of hardwood timber employed vary in proportion to the quantities of softwood timbers used, and that extensive use of softwood timbers will mean an increased demand for Australian hardwoods. The second school of thought believes that the world is approaching a timber famine, and therefore that it is foolish for us to deplete our forest reserves when we can purchase timber from other countries at low prices. The third school tends that softwood timbers definitely compete with hardwood timbers, and that it is essential to impose protective in order to ensure the use of our hardwoods. Not one of these three schools of thought is quite correct in its assumptions, but there is a degree of truth in each of them. The adherents of the first school take the view that softwood and hardwood each has its definite uses, and that one cannot, with advantage, be substituted for the other. They also urge that, the cheaper softwood timbers are, the better it is for the hardwood milling interests, because more building operations will be undertaken at the lower rates. Among the adherents of the second school of thought are numbered many of our forestry experts and advisers. Consequently, careful attention must be given to their views. I have had many interesting conversations with Mr LanePoole, the Commonwealth forestry adviser, who believes that within the next twenty years there will be a timber famine in Australia, and indeed in the southern hemisphere. The theory of adherents of the third school of thought is endorsed by all those who urge that the arguments advanced for protection generally apply to the timber industry. Those persons who are directly interested in the local industry state quite definitely that as it has to bear its proportion of the burdens of protection, it should receive its benefits. The condition of the industry has been exhaustively examined by the Tariff Board on three occasions, and I found it so difficult t'ocome to a decision as to these timber duties that 1 arranged for a special conference between the Tariff Board and representaAlr. Forde.. tives of the industry in Australia. No other subject has given the Government so much concern. No one can deny that, following the imposition of these duties, there has been considerable activity in our hardwood forests. Many hardwood saw-millers have sj>ent ""large sums of money in erecting drying kilns in order to market well matured and properly seasoned timber. Unfortunately, our Australian hardwoods got a bad name during the war period for no other reason than that, owing to the sudden demand, sawmillers marketed unseasoned and unsuitcon- able timber. But they have had their lesson, and are now marketing timber of uniformly good quality. It has been duties estimated that the additional amount which would be paid out in wages, as the result of the substitution of hardwood for baltic timber, would be £600,000, and that consumers would be getting a better article for their money. The Tariff Board also reported that there were 1,455 bush mills engaged throughout the Commonwealth in sawing native timbers, and that the aggregate number of men employed on felling, hauling, and milling was 6,200. The annual wage bill was estimated by the board to be £3,645,000. Later figures supplied by the Australian Saw-millers Central Council show that the increased duties have kept at least 9,000 men employed in the timber industry. On this basis, an increase of 3,000 employees may be attributed to the incidence of the tariff. As to the effects of the new duties, it is too early yet to claim any positive result's, because the new rates synchronize with the prevailing unprecedented depression. No other industry has been so badly affected as the building trade upon which the timber industry depends for its market. Because of the slowing down in building operations throughout Australia, saw-millers found themselves loaded up with imported timbers. Many have not yet been able to dispose of their surplus stocks. Consequently, our hardwood saw-millers have not yet really experienced the full benefit of the duties that have been imposed by this Government. I am informed that in Victoria alone local hardwood sawmillers have accumulated stocks totalling approximately 53,000,000 superficial feet. Most of this timber is already well seasoned, and the rest of it is being properly and scientifically seasoned. I ask the committee not to do anything that will increase the unemployment that is already too prevalent throughout Australia by reducing these duties, and so lessening the protection which the timber industry at present enjoys. The statistical information that I have obtained shows that 9,000 people are dependent upon this industry for their sustenance. It would be a short-sighted policy for us to do anything which would throw these people out of work. There could not he an immediate revival in. the building trade even if we admitted timber duty free, for we already have a surplus of office accommodation, public buildings, war service homes, and private dwelling houses throughout the Commonwealth. In the years just past the Governments of all the States have spent money very freely to enable workers to build homes for themselves. This was possible on account of heavy borrowing and boom times. These are not boom times, and we cannot borrow money overseas for building purposes. For these reasons, and also because the entire removal of the duties would not stimulate the building industry, I ask honourable members to agree to the Government's proposals. I am sure that if they do so, the timber industry will feel the benefit of this protection when the depression has passed and normal times have returned.",35
106,Mr LYONS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wilmot) [5.26] --It seenfi to me that if there is which we are justified in maintaining it is our timber industry. While I am definitely of the opinion that many items in this schedule should be reconsidered, I am also of the opinion that we own must protect our timber industry. The suggestion has been made by the honoreffect able member for Henty (Mr Gullett) that an independent inquiry, apart altogether from the Tariff Board, should be made into this industry. I would quite agreeable to the adoption of that proposal provided that a fair .and imthe partial tribunal were set up. I am sure that those engaged in the timber industry would be able to justify the degree of protection which has been given them. In every inquiry made hitherto it been shown clearly that the industry merits protection. While I intend to support the proposals of the Government in this connection, I would not oppose a proposition for a complete and independent inquiry int& the .whole circumstances of the industry. The debate has been concentrated today upon the question whether Australian hardwoods can be satisfactorily utilized for purposes for which imported softwoods have hitherto been used. It has been shown clearly that our hardwoods are quite satisfactory for mining purposes. They more than hold their own against imported softwoods. I am able to speak with some experience of this industry in my own State. I know that not many years ago governments of every political colour believed that it was necessary for them to specify that their construction departments should use a big proportion of imported softwoods for the erection of public buildings, schools, and dwelling houses. But in more recent years it has been proved in Tasmania beyond any doubt, that our hardwoods are quite satisfactory for these purposes. The practice today is to use a great deal more hardwood than formerly.. Many buildings of great beauty and permanence have been erected in Tasmania almost entirely of hardwoods. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) referred to the use of inferior hardwood flooring. It is true that some inferior timber has been used; but today it is quite easy to obtain firstone industry class hardwood flooring. The Tasmanian timber industry has been almost altogether re-organized in the last few years. Previously, every small timber-miller did his work in his way, and paid little regard to the ° general welfare of the industry. One of this was that a great quantity of inferior timber was sold every year. It was for this reason that the sawmillers of Tasmania prevailed upon the be Government with which I was associated in that State, to take steps to re-organize industry, with a view to ensuring that only timber of good quality and type should be put on the market. Unfortunately, just when this re-organization was almost complete, the depression overtook has us. But we have had enough experience to show that it is now possible to ensure that first-class hardwood timber only will be placed on the market. Speaking from the stand-point of employment-and again I rely principally o n my Tasmanian experience-the timber .industry is very important. If the t i m >ber mills of Tasmania could resume full - time operations, the unemployment pro'blem of that State Would be practically Solved.  dear for the people to'buy.",37
107,Mr LYONS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Timbe r has fallen substantially in price. It has been suggested by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) that the timber-millers would take advantage of the higher duties to increase their prices; but the fact remains that price levels today are Very low.,38
108,Mr CUBTIM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The f all has only been in consonance with the general f all in price levels.,38
109,Mr LYONS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I know that there has been a f all in prices generally, but I do not think there is any ground whatever for the fear that there will be a definite increase in the price of timber. T have already made reference to the suitability of Australian hardwoods for mining purposes. I should like to emphasize the fact that this timber is also quite H* suitable for many other purposes as imported softwoods. I have no doubt - hat honourable members have had supj'lit'd to them certain information which has come to hand fro m the Hardwood Millers Association of Victoria. Prom this material I quote the followiug parat-ra |>h :It has been argued that oregon had to be imported for certain purposes, and I propose to take one which the Tariff Board itself deals o with on page 25-(a ) ""Oregon for special purposes."" In this the board draws the conclusion that oregon is essential for (a) forming Of concrete work, and (6) heavy beams, &c. In reference to (a), let me quote the report of the Resident Engineer at Eildon reservoir of the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission in regard to forming for concrete:"" Re Kiln-dried Hardwood-Rubico n Forest. - In the form work used during the construction of the ' blister tunnel' on the face of the spillway, use was made of the hardwood of the Rubicon Forest, supplied by Clarke and Pearce Proprietary Limited, of Alexandra. Kiln-dried T. and O. lagging, 3J, ' 4J and 5i by i inches was used on both flat and curved surfaces, and proved so successful that it was thought that, were this product more widely known, greater use of it might be made. In dismantling of form-work, this lagging withstood considerable rough usage, the operation in consequence being carried .out with greater expedition and less waste than would be possible with either oregon or baltic. In this case there was practically no waste, and the timber was either stacked for further use, or immediately re-assembled. This capacity for successful re-use greatly offsets the price, and tends to un economy in timber not possible with the imported softwoods used under similar conditions."" too I think that statement definitely disposes of the argument that our hardwoods are - not suitable for use in the forming of concrete work and for heavy beams. The concluding sentence of my quotation is also of great importance. If our hardwoods can be used a second time, they have an advantage over softwoods, which offsets any difference in price. The re-organization of our timber industry throughout Australia has led to a definite improvement in the standard of the timbers marketed. Experiments designed to improve still further the quality of Our timbers are being continually carried out in Tasmania and elsewhere, so we may expect a progressive advance in this respect. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) made some reference to the relations between the employers and the employees in the timber industry. T have had some experience in this direction. I personally know employers in the Tasmanian timber industry who have had in their employ the members of the same family for very many years. Many of these employers retained the' services of such employees for a considerable period after the demand for timber fell off. Some of them, in fact, retained men in their employment until their resources were entirely exhausted. I have in mind * the case of one milling firm-on e of the biggest in Tasmania-whic h has had the members of certain families associated with it for two generations. The senior member of this firm said to me not very long ago, with tears in his eyes, that he had come to the end of his resources, and would have to discontinue the employment of men who had been associated with him throughout his life, and with his father before him.' He was almost heartbroken at having to turn these old employees adrift. Such employers do not deserve condemnation. I look forward to the day when we shall not only be supplying from local sources the bulk of the timber required in Australia, but shall also be exporting special classes of timber. In the meantime, however, it is essential that we should maintain this industry in order to develop the local market.",38
110,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Kennedy) [5.39] The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Lyons) has referred to the possibility of developing an export trade in timber. There was a time when we did a considerable trade in this direction, but unfortunately the "" go-getters"" came into the industry and sold poor quality timber to customers overseas. The adoption of this policy was disastrous to the trade. The honourable member for Warringah  house constructed solely of Australian timber cost £83 more than one in which Oregon was used. A similar statement was made by a builder named Howie in giving evidence before the T a r i ff Board in Sydney, and although the board asked Mr Howie to supply detailed costs, the information has yet not been supplied. Appareutly, it was a reckless statement which cannot be substantiated. Instead of proving it3 accuracy, Mr Howie has handed over his brief to the honourable member for Warringah, in an endeavour to spread further lies against locallygrown timber.",39
111,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I had the details with me this afternoon.,39
112,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Why were they not supplied to the Tariff Board as reand quested ?,39
113,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,They supplied to the board.,39
114,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Although board has made several requests to Mr . Howie, the details have uot been supdustrial' plied.",39
115,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Who told the honourable member that? One of the dry hardwood lobbyists?,39
116,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I challenge the honourable member for Warringah to for prove that my statement is incorrect,39
117,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The board has been, supplied with the information required.",39
118,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I challenge the in honourable member to prove that Mr . Howie has supplied the figures. Before tliese duties were imposed, 58 per cent, of imported timber and 42 per cent, of local timber was being used in building construction, but today the figures are 75 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively.",39
119,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The honourable member obtained his information! from some person within the building with whom I saw him conversing.,39
120,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am at liberty to converse with any one I wish. Unfortu nately for the honourable member, some one who could disprove his statement was present.",39
121,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,My statement was fair .,39
122,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"So is mine, and it is true and is taken from the T a r i ff Board's manuscript.",39
123,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member cannot disprove what I have said,",39
124,The CHAIRMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Mr MCGRATH) I ask the honourable member for W a r r i ngah to cease interjecting, otherwise I shall have to take action.",39
125,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"P r i o r to the imposition of these duties an effort was being made by timber producers in Northern Queensland to for m a company and to install the dry-kiln system which at that time had been practically untried in that State. The cost of the machinery required by such a company in order to place it on a proper commercial basis would be £100,000. The necessary k i l n equipment would cost about £30,000. Hardwood seasoned under the air-drying were system warps, and the company desired sufficient protection before incurring the heavy expenditure on plant. Por some time, the Council for Scientific and In Research has been conducting k i l n tests on eight different classes of timber; but it is difficult to produce a k i l n capable of satisfactorily treating different varieties of timber. Although these tests have been in progress some time, a report of the results has - not been furnished. As the duties have been in operation for only eighteen months, the industry has not had sufficient time to develop. The inactivity building operations is due to economic conditions, and not to the duties imposed on imported timber. The cost of building has now reached the 1914 level, and the price of timber has fallen 30 per cent, since the Imposition of these duties. I understand that a house which could have been built two years ago for £600 can now be constructed for £400. The governmental departments in Queensland state that there has been a fall of over 35 per cent, in building costs, owing to the decrease in the price of iron and timber and other building materials. One of the difficulties of the Queensland timber industry is caused by the high royalties charged. When a member of a Queensland Parliament, I was of the opinion that the high charged placed the industry on an unfavorable footing. If a reduction in royalties is impracticable, protection can be afforded only by imposing customs duties. There is 710 need to import timber for mining or other purposes, and if an embargo were placed upon importations tomorrow, the mining companies now using imported timbers would soon find a suitable substitute in Australia. Queensland timber is used in the Chillagoe, Etheridge, Mount Isa, Oloncurry, and Palmer mines, and it has the advantage of being able to resist the ravages of white ant's to a greater extent than imported timbers. It was also found that four or five out of every twelve of the sleepers made from imported . timber used on the Etheridge railway had been seriously attacked by whiteants after they had been in use for only twelve months, whereas. local sleepers were not affected for some considerable time. Suitable scaffolding timber can also be obtained in Australia, and if our timber resources are to be developed, we should encourage the use of local timber for mining and building purposes. Some honourable members opposite have said that in opposing these duties they are considering the interests of the workers. As a representative of the working class, I consider that the 9,000 men engaged in the timber industry in Australia should be protected. A good deal of timber imported into this country is handled by Chinese. [Quorum formed.] Recently, I received a letter from a man engaged in the timber industry in Vancouver who had apparently read my speech on the Mr Riordan. Canadian trade agreement. In referring to the industrial conditions in Canada, he said that the mention of unionism in the Canadian lumber camps was sufficient to result in a man being chased out of the industry. He further said that in that country Chinese and Hindus are extensively employed in the timber and. other industries. A good deal of opposition has been raised to the importation of Russian timber, owi ng to the conditions under which it is alleged to be produced; but if investigations were conducted into the industrial conditions in other countries it would probably be found that they were even worse than those which are royalties said to exist in Russia.",39
126,Mr BAYLEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Nothin g of the sort.,40
127,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) does not know anything about it. Mr BA.YT.EY - I have seen the men at work.,40
128,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member and those with whom he is associated interfered with the operations of. Russian interests which were buying £4,000,000 worth of our wool annually, but they are prepared to give extensive preference to American products, although the Americans buy nothing from us. I do not think that the operation of these duties will increase the cost of a timber cottage by even £1. If the Australian sawmillers were forced out of business owing to inadequate protection, the price of imported timbers would immediately increase, and buildings would consequently become more expensive. I trust that the majority of the committee will support these duties, and thus give the industry the assistance which it deserves.",40
129,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wakefield) [5.55] The claim put forward by the honourable members for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) and Herbert (Mr Martens), that these duties are necessary to enable the A'ery fine softwoods of Queensland to be sold at, a profit, because of the heavy royalties demanded by the Queensland Government, should bring home to the committee how extremely exorbitant these duties are. It is an astounding proposition that the users of timber in all parts of Australia should be asked to pay an additional customs impost in order that the revenue of one State may be bolstered, and so that certain individuals may be in a position to buy votes with other people's money. The people who are expected to provide it are those who ought to be engaged in the building trade, but, unfortunately, today are out of work, in every city and every little country town. The f u t i l it y of imposing exorbitant duties on timber was proved by the reference of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . Frost) to his recent visits to timber camps in Tasmania and other parts of Australia. The honourable member found timber workers practically starving through unemployment. These duties, which have been made exorbitant in order to help the Queensland Government revenue, have thus failed to provide work for timber workers whom we would all be pleased to see at work again. They are, as the honourable member for Franklin says, a specially fine class of men. I shall quote the opinion of an outand-out supporter of the Government, Mr F . F . Ward, secretary of the South Australian Labour Party.",40
130,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,He is a stout enough protectionist.,41
131,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"He is, and an outand-out supporter of the present Government, but there are some acts of bushranging which even he cannot condone. He says The duty adds greatly to the cost of a house, and houses are mostly required hy the workers. Oregon costs only 4s. per 100 super, feet at the port of shipment. Freight, wharfage, and other charges amount to 10s., which is equal to a protective duty of 250 per cunt. If the duty is 8s., that means an additional protective duty of 200 per cent., or 450 per cent, on cost. The present duty of 14s., added to freight and other charges, means an increase on cost of 24s., which is equal to a protective duty of 000 per cent. That certainly is an unbiased comment upon these exorbitant duties. I congratulate the Minister upon the moderation of his speech. He is evidently one of those wise men who, when about to propose something particularly outrageous, cloak their purpose by using the most moderate language possible. suggests than we cannot look for any in crease in employment in the building trade, because of the large number of empty houses and offices to be found in every city and town, completely ignoring what will be the first section of the building trade to revive. An y one who moves about can see houses and buildings of all descriptions in cities and towns, and in farming districts, in need of repair, but the work of renovation is held up because of the excessive cost of iron and timber. Even a slight reduction in the cost of these materials would start a revival in the building trade so far as renovations are concerned. The idea that particular kinds of Australian wood can become substitutes for the world's most suitable timbers for every use, is contradicted by the figures quoted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), showing that, since the imposition of these exorbitant rates of duty, sales of oregon have been maintained in approximately the same proportion as formerly. The Tariff Board's report, which is now a year old, and does not deal with sales actually taking place today, commented to the'same effect as follows:It will be noticed that the duties hitherto imposed have not had the effect of restricting the importation of oregon. Ou the contrary, despite the increases in duty, the proportion of oregon to the total timber used has become greater. The failure of the duties to achieve the object for which they were imposed is very clearly demonstrated by the fact, us disclosed by the graph, that during the three years immediately preceding the war, when the average rate of duty on undressed timber (having regsurtl to the various sizes) from the United States of America was 2s. Od. per 100 super, feet, the timber in question represented 23 per cent, of the total Australian consumption. In the years 1920-2"" to 1928-29, when the average duty was Ds. Od. per 100 super, feet, undressed timber from the United States of America was 32 per cent, of the Australian consumption. This would appear to force the conclusion that in many parts of Australia oregon is essential for building purposes. That shows that when the duty was one-quarter of what it was during the three years before the present Minister took charge of the tariff, the percentage of imports of oregon from America was smaller, and probably if the figures were available to date, it would be found that He even with this extortionate duty the proport-ion of oregon which is being used in Australia is as high as, or even higher than, before. Only essential work is boing carried out today, and when that class of work is being undertaken it is customary to use the most suitable timber available, which, in most instances, is oregon. I do not propose to refer to each of the items in this section of the schedule. I support most strongly the amendment of the honourable member for  not carried in this chamber, I hope that another place will insist upon it.",41
132,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Indi) [6.5] - The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) quoted figures to show that oregon was still being largely used in Australia, but I have obtained some official figures from the Customs Department which show that, since the imposition of these higher duties, there has been a definite decline in the use of undressed timber from abroad. That is clear evidence that the Government's action in introducing this tariff schedule was justified. The figures which I shall quote will perhaps startle the honourable  who seems to think that oregon, because it craoks before it breaks, is the only timber suitable for mining.",42
133,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am conlaw, cerned not about mining timber, but about timber for houses.",42
134,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The total' imports of undressed oregon, mostly from the United States of America and Canada, in 192930 were 181,310,680 super, feet; and in 1930-31, 22,716,865 super, feet; a decrease of 158,593,815 super, feet. In view of those figures, how can the honourable member for Wakefield substantiate his statement that the proportion of sales of Oregon in Australia is still being maintained?- The value, of undressed timber imported into Australia in 1929-30 was £1,299,877, and in 1930-31, £122,226; a decline of £1,244,110.  the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was that the proportion as between local and imported timber is still the same. That is different altogether from the point which the honourable member is making.",42
135,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Thos e figures speak for themselves. The honourable member for Warringah stated that oregon was the only suitable timber for mining. Let roe tell him that I have had years of experience in mining, and I know that there is in use in the gold mines of Victoria Australian timber which cracks and gives warning of danger just as much as oregon does. That.timber was placed in the mines long before I was born and it is as good today as it was when it was first put there. I cannot understand the anti-Australian spirit which animates some members of the Opposition. They are ready to import any class of timber regardless of the conditions under which it is produced, whether by Chinese, Hindu, or black labour-provide d that it is cheap. The honourable member for  interjection that the price of Australian timber was too dear; yet only a week or so ago I heard him say that he intended to hold his wheat on the farm became the price offering was not high enough. He wants a high price for his wheal, yet he is not prepared to pay a decent price for Australian timber. He takes a one-eyed view. Oregon for mining purposes is imported duty free. In 1929-30 the quantity of Oregon imported for use underground for mining purposes, as prescribed by departmental bywas 10,512,080 super, feet, valued at £40,030; and in 1930-31, 8,781,934 super, feet, valued at £25,204. Because this timber is imported duty free it can be sold at a considerably reduced price. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) quoted from a letter from the secretary of the Labour party in South Australia, to the effect that the landed cost of oregon. was 4s. per 100 super, feet.",42

In dismantling of form-work, this lagging withstood considerable rough usage, the operation in consequence being carried out with greater expedition and less waste than would be possible with either oregon or baltic. This is not the timber championed by the honourable member for Warringah  that this is the opinion of an expert, and I place more reliance upon it than upon that of the honourable member, who probably has not used either type of timber. The report continues-^ In this case there was practically no waste, und the timber was either stacked for further use. nr immediately re-assembled. rapacity for successful re-use greatly affects the price, aiid tends to an economy in timber not possible witli the imported softwotids used under similar conditions. the As will be seen from the - attached - reports of the foreman carpenter, this consignment has been used, in some cases, four times. Yet one honourable member told us that he had a letter from a company stating that this tiinber could be used only once. The report goes onThe blister tuhnef and No. 1 inspection shaft on the main drainage system arc the first and last structures completed with this timber, the finish being highly satisfactory. This information is forwarded in case other engineers of the commission might find it economical to use the product of the Rubicon Forest. In adding freight, the railways accept it as 700 super, feet to the ton. The report of the foreman carpenter on the job readsAdverting to my previous report, 1I have to advise as follows: The kiln-dried hardwood now being used for the third and fourth times made up practically perfectly, being well oiled and showing rio curl after stripping of forms. We are told by one honourable member that this tiinber warped. Evidently the minds of 'some honourable members opposite, who are apt to believe everything that they are told, are warped-. This report continuesSome of the boards used for the fifth time, FOBEST. however, were not able to be used oil the original face, but, on being reversed, proved just as good for the face of the forms, In the initial stages the 31 inch and 4£ inch proved uiore effective for form work as the edges did out curl quite so noticeably as some of the 51 inch. The latter curled slightly, and had to be dressed off with the plane. After the second, third and fourth use, however, no curl could be distinguished. In stripped form work, the timber"" was nut damaged to any extent after being used for the fourth time, and is still fully serviceable for further use in form work. The face left on the concrete after using the kiln-dried hardwood is far superior to that left after iisin;.' baltic or oregon. W h at does the honourable member for W a r r in g a h think of that, w h i c h is the opinion of a practical m a n . The r e p o rt concludes-^ Re 51 inch by j incli seasoned hardwood, blister tunnel. In reference to this, I havr --submit the following:1. Placing - Woo d was in perfect condition and went together well. 2. Concreting - After concreting, the boardn did not twist longitudinally and retained their This original condition. 3. Stripping - After a fortnight's use, the boards stripped well, all nails extracti-d readily, and the tiinber showed no signs nf splitting or any similar defect. 4. 12 f t . (i in. radius - Bein g over a 12 f t . H in. radius, it was necessary to bend these boards, and thej' responded to this treatment. 5. Cleaning - Cleane d well, and in good condition for other use. I have read the views of experts who handle and use this timber. This committee should attach consider able weight to them. I believe that I have sufficiently exploded the fallacy that no other timber can replace oregon for timbering mines. The timber used in those big tunnels must possess similar qualities to those needed by timber used in mines, and the reports on it are perfectly satisfactory. The timber used was kilh-dried, seasoned by Clark and Pearce Proprietary Limited, Alexandra. Several other kiln-drying plants are being erected in my electorate. There is one at Powelltown. Recently a timber expert .from overseas visited that plant and, after seeing the seasoning plant in operation, and examining some of the homes in the locality in which baltic pine was used, he declared that he wondered why the people of Australia should resort to the imported article when they had such fine timber of their own. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) complained about the defects in local flooring timber. I should like him to inspect the plant at Powelltown. I am sure that, after doing so, he will select the local product when next he builds, or desires to refloor his home. There is a seasoning plant in course of construction at Yarra Junction, owned by Messrs. Yelland Brothers Proprietary Limited, from whom I have received the following letter:RE TARIFF ON IMPORTED TIMBERS. We understand the above, among other items, will be debated in the House, commencing next week, and we, among others of your supporters, have confidence in you, in that you will help to protect our industry against foreign competitors, both as regards oregon and baltic timbers, as well as box shooks for local use. We, as well as other millers in Victoria, are on the point of putting in seasoning plants for the production of floorings and all other building timbers, also for box shooks. Tliese products will be superior to imported timbers, and at no greater price, provided we get protection from overseas, insuring us the volume of trade, when trade is available. Little or none exists at the present Mr Jones. The proposed duties embodied in the schedule may appear high, but if the two following factors are taken into consideration, it will be seen that they are' not too high:I should like this to sink into the mind of the honourable member for Warringah1. The natural prejudice so many Australians appear to have against the products of their own country, encouraged, of course, by importers and others handling these lines who, in most cases, partly or wholly finance the buyer, but who should, and would, handle the local timbers if the foreign softwoods did not intrude. 2. And, perhaps, worse still is the "" trade war "" in which oregon in particular is sold under cost, as a sort of "" star bargain"" line, or as a "" leg in "" to secure for the seller the supplying of the other requisites, such as joinery, roofing, floorings, & c , which form the major cost of the structure, and on which the profit is made up. This "" war "" was on until the trade collapsed last year. if these duties are passed, we shall immediately construct kilns for the seasoning of hardwood furniture, floorings, linings and joinery, as well as box shooks for containers for all types of local manufactures, and for f r u it . Our seasoned hardwood f r u it cases have proved most satisfactory, both for export and for interstate trade. In supplying the above lines, including hardwood scantlings, we shall not exceed in price the present list prices, subject only to wages awards. It will be noted that many lines of hardwood scantlings are being sold today at considerably under the list prices, hut these lines are chiefly stocks which are deteriorating whilst millers are financially embarrassed. We have six bush mills in the Wurburton district, and only one is working, and that part time, so you will readily understand our anxiety to get the tariff settled so that when there is trade in Australia, Australian millers will have a chance, and incidentally help to keep the money in the country. That is a most desirable objective. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) declared that the hardwood millers would exploit the people by charging high prices, if there were no overseas competition. He did not produce facts or figures to substantiate his charge. Those available show that the reverse is the'case. Since the new duties were imposed the prices for hardwood all over Australia have fallen, on aD average, by 30 per cent. They are baok to 1 9 l i levels. Although many sawmilling companies have not paid a dividend for years, the additional duties entime. abled them to reduce their prices substantially. ""When better days come, and the decline in the building trade has passed, we shall probably a still further reduction in t i m bor prices, as the millers have an increased output with practically the same overhead charges. Before the new duties came into operation 42 per cent, of the timber used in Victoria was grown locally. Since they were imposed 75 per cent, of the locally-grown article has been used. I am pleased that the Victorian Government gave orders that all timbers used for government building purposes in that State should be Australian grown. It is a pity that .similar action is not taken by every other State Government. I believe that when he was in office with this Government, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lyons) issued such an order in connection with Commonwealth timber requirements. admire him for doing so. It is a pity that some of the honourable member'si present followers do not entertain a similar Australian outlook. The Minister rightly reminded the honourable member  previous government, which he supported, tried to carry out the recommendations of the Tariff Board, but Parliament decided otherwise. I hope that, in this instance also, Parliament - will insist on adequate protection being given to the Australian timber industry. I think that I have answered the charge that there is no satisfactory substitute for Oregon. The honourable member for Warringah also said that hardwood could never take the place of baltic pine for flooring, excepting in special circumstances. Did any one ever hear such a ridiculous statement ? Mr AROHDAL E PARKHILL - How many people have hardwood floors in their homes?",43
145,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"A timber expert who visited Australia some time ago expressed surprise that, in a district where mountain ash grows, so many of the homes had baltic flooring. In my electorate, doors and window frames of Australian hardwood are to be found in considerable numbers. At Powelltown, where the biggest saw-mill in Australia is situated, the local school is built exclusively of Ausenjoy tralian timbers. There is no finer model school of its kind in Victoria. I will have repeatedly drawn attention to the beautiful timbers in this chamber, all of which are Australian. In the new Civic H all in Brisbane, costing about £1,200,000, none but Australian timber is used. I desire to conclude by quoting from the Melbourne Age of the 16th December, 1930OUR TIMBER RESOURCES. AN EXPERT'S OPINION. "" Great Wealth Untapped."" To make an inspection of the main timber mills and stocks of Victoria, Tasmania, West Australia and Queensland timber with a view to extending the export trade with the United Kingdom, Mr J. Hall is, a director of J. Hallis and Company Limited, timber merI chants, of Hull and London, arrived at Melbourne yesterday by the Otranlo. Mr Hallis said his firm had been actively engaged in pushing the sales of Australian timbers in the United Kingdom. His firm was contemplating the importing of raw material from Australia and milling it in .England to suit local requirements. Higher freight rates of recent years had had little effect on the trade. For furniture Australian timber had been found extremely suitable. - Jarrah and kauri were being used for flooring some of London's most Important buildings. For beauty, texture, grain and utility, he considered that there was no other timber in the world comparable to the best Australian product. Discussing the economic situation, Mr. Hallis said ""Australia had fallen over before she was really hit."" We had not even touched the fringe of the financial depression before we were turning our faces towards prosperity. Pessimists should realise that in its timber resources alone, Australia had a great wealth practically untapped. .1. hope that .the committee will pass these duties in ""order to make it possible for this wealth to be tapped.",45

The object of this amendment is to permit of the incorporation of this sub-item conference as set out in the tariff resolution of July, 1931. It will be recollected that the tariff resolution of the 29th July last provided for an increase in the duties on industries this sub-item, and in order to make the legal position secure in regard to any duties which may have been collected imposition under that resolution, it will be necessary greater to incorporate it with the present proincreasing posals. The amendment makes no difof ference to the rates proposed under the resolution of the 29th July last.",46
148,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [8.37] - I regret that the British preferential duty on timber cut to size for box-making been increased from 5s. to 12s. per 100 super, feet. This duty affects the probut ducers of dried fruits, who require this timber for the manufacture of their boxes. The Minister will probably tell me that they obtain a rebate on the cases in which their goods are exported, yet use of Australian timbers. this duty wi\l penalize them considerably in regard to their home market. This one of the many instances in which the timber duties press unduly upon South Australia. I rose in my place recently to tude to these duties. speak on this matter, but I was "" gagged."" I now take the opportunity of pointing out once more that South Australia suffers severely because of the tariff.  tralia,",47
149,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member reported speak on behalf of his own State; but wood, while Western Australia grows many that kinds of timber, South Australia has a placed paucity of forest areas.",47
150,Mr MORGAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Darling Downs) that [8.40] - The duties on this sub-item creased are open to precisely the same objection as those with which the committee has just dealt. This high increase in the timber duties will not help Australian industries. Any increase above the provided in the 1921-28 schedule could be justified only if the increase were made for revenue purposes. The schedule was sufficiently protective to safeguard the interests of Australian dustry. These duties are almost certain to increase building costs. This point was amply stressed by the Tariff Board in its report, in the course of which it statedIn considering the proposals put before th« and in arriving at the conclusions and recommendations set out in this report, the Tariff Board has kept constantly in mind the serious unemployment which exists in the concerned and the essential need for relieving the position so far as is practicable. W i th this in view the board sets. itself out to ascertain where it could recommend the of duties that would encourage the use of Australian timbers, and thus provide additional employment^ without unduly the cost of timber to the users, or preventing supplies of imported timber where such timber is considered essential. That statement furnishes justification for a reversion to the schedule of 1921-28. It has been urged that the importation of has timber for case-making has seriously affected the use of Australian hardwoods, I submit that that argument cannot be supported. I refuse to accept the view that honourable members who favour the importation of softwoods are necessarily implicated in a conspiracy against the I yield to nobody in my appreciation of Australian is timbers and in my support of Australian industries. I contend that there is nothing anti-Australian in my attiThe subject of unemployment is constantly obtruding in this debate, and I would answer that by again quoting from the report of the Tariff Board on the importation of the class of softwood with which this sub-item deals. The board As regards Oregon (Douglas fir) and redhowever, the board feels most strongly if the duties set out in the proposals before the conference on the larger sizes were adopted, the added cost to the building trade would far outweigh the benefits would accrue to the saw-milling industry, and that the ultimate result would be derather than increased employment. Unemployment, so far as it exists in the timber industry today, is due, not to the importation of these particular softwoods, rates which are needed to make up the deficiency in Australian softwoods, and which mu3t continue to be imported for old some years to come, but almost entirely to the prevailing depression. It is perinfectly plain to any person who studies the statistics that we are importing annually 500,000,000 super, feet of softwoods. That fact carries its own conviction; those softwoods are needed, otherwise they would not be imported to such an extent. Australian forests are rapidly being depleted of their softwoods, and at the present time their capacity is well below Australia's requirements. It ds necessary to establish further forestry schemes to make good the shortage. That industry of afforestation and reafforestation must be established before it can be protected. Hence, the existing restrictions upon the importation of those woods which Australia needs to carry on its building enterprises are unjust. Forestry is a great investment; no factories have to be established, no expenditure incurred on plant. Australia is at present engaged in that particular work, which is of the greatest possible importance to the future of this country. Meanwhile, some measure of protection is necessary, and that is provided by the 1921-28 tariff. No reason has been advanced-non e can be - for increasing the duties in the manner proposed. The money that is being spent today on forestry development is an investment ,in a definitely reproductive work, which bas no need of support. The committee can assist it to the extent that is necessary, without recourse to these particularly high duties. Meanwhile, it is essential that the softwood which is necessary for building and constructional purposes shall be imported, because .that will obviate the depletion of our existing supplies, and allow them to be utilized in such a manner that they will be available until the forests that arc now growing up become commercial propositions. Such a position cannot be arrived at in anything under 25 or 30 years.",47
151,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND, I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the item.,48
152,Mr MORGAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I propose to do so. If we protect our own supplies until the forests that are now being developed are available for commercial use, the end that the best experts in forestry have in view will be achieved, and it will be unnecessary to impose these increased duties.",48
153,Mr GREGORY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Swan) [8.51] - An extraordinarily large increase is proposed in connection with the duties on timbers that are required for the making of boxes for use in the export trade. Honourable members are aware of the extreme diffi-' culties that are being faced by the dried fruits and other industries which we wish to develop.,48
154,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,No one can complain of what is proposed. Timber for cutting into box shooks is to be admitted free.,48
155,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [8.53] - I protest against the manner in which the amendment has been submitted. The Minister gave an explanation of it that could not be heard by many honourable members because of the buzz of conversation in the chamber, and few honourable members understand what it means. That is not the way in which the committee should be treated. The amendment will have a retrospective effect, because it will operate from July last. The Minister gave no reason for that; we are expected to take it on trust.",48
156,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It only legalises what has heen done.,48
157,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,He has tried to cover up the duties proposed under sub-item i 2 by reducing those under i 1.,48
158,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," There has been ample time to cir1 culate the amendment. In the case of bills, the amendments that are to be proposed, not only by the Minister, but also by private members, are printed and circulated some time before members are asked to consider them. This tariff schedule has been before the committee for several months, yet we have not been made acquainted with the amendments that have been contemplated. I oppose the amendment that has been moved to this sub-item, because I do not understand what is proposed.",48
159,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I am unacquainted with the purport of the amendment. Is it proposed that sub-item r 2 shall remain as it is printed?,48
160,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The tariff on timber, undressed, n.e.i., in sizes not less than 4 inches in width and not less than 3 inches inthickness, for the manufacture of boxes, is free British, free intermediate, and Is. general. The object is to observe the provisions of the Canadian trade agreement.",48
161,Mr LATHAM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Kooyong) [8.56] This is an example of the method by which, the Government is seeking to put the tariff through the committee. An amendment has been propofeed by the Minister; but, apparently, honourable members on both sides have no idea of what it is. It could readily have been circulated some time ago, but that was not done. This procedure abundantly justifies the decision of the Opposition not to take any further part in the discussion of the tariff.",48
162,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"This was in the tariff schedule that was tabled ou the 29th July last. It has been lying on the table ever since, and it is a waste of time talking about it.",49
163,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wide Bay) [8.58] - I have n& wish to cross swords with honourable members on this side in their oj>position to the proposal of the Minister. I consider, however, that the proposal of the honourable gentleman is a very liberal one-mor e liberal, indeed, than I should feel inclined to bring forward. His reason-that it is in accordance with the Canadian trade agreement - canno t lightly be brushed aside. The proposal is that, under the British and intermediate tariffs, undressed timber in certain sizes shall be admitted free, while under the general tariff the rate is to be only Is. per 100 super, feet, which amounts to 2d. per 100 lineal feet of box timber for fruit cases.",49
164,Mr GREGORY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Nobod y objects to that. Read the next portion of the sub-item.,49
165,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"It reads, "" Timber, undressed, cut to size for making boxes, per 100 super, feetBritish, 12s.; intermediate, 12s.; general, 14s."" That works out at about 2s. per 100 lineal feet, which would not impose a very great hardship on the manufacturers of boxes. The tops of our pine timbers, of which there is now a considerable wastage, could be sold to Australian box-makers very cheaply. It is desired, in Queensland at any rate, that they shall be used more extensively than is the case at the present time. There is no ground for complaint, therefore, in regard to these duties. Under the trade agreement with Canada, dominion timber for boxmaking is admitted free; but if importers wish to use other timber they will be required to pay 12s. per 100 super, feet, or 2s. per 100 lineal feet, and will get a rebate. If they do not care to use the Canadian timber they can utilize Australian pine tops at probably one-half the price. I see nothing wrong with the item, and intend to support it.",49
166,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wakefield) [9.2] - I rise to support the amendment of the Minister to bring the schedule into conformity with the provisions of the Canadian trade agreement relating to timI ber. The duties in paragraph A are now lower than those in the 1921-28 tariff. I offer no objection to the increase in the general tariff on that class of timber. I am, ihowever, disappointed that the rates upon shooks for box-making have been increased. This additional impost will be felt severely by our fruit exporters.",49
167,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Box-maker s can import that class of timber free from Canada.,49
168,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am aware that if cases made from imported timber are reexported a drawback on the duty paid will be allowed, but for all fruit sold in Australia the case-makers will be obliged 'to use 4-in. by 3-in. planks, or else the le3s accessible Australian timber. I am informed that there is considerable wastage in cutting up 4-in. by 3-in. planks; that in some cases, the freight of the amount of wood lost in sawdust is equal to all the wages paid in the box-making industry, and that these additional cost* will reduce the capacity of the fruit industry to pay wages in conformity with Australian standards. All these artificial restrictions will make it more difficult for the fruit industry to find its natural level and regain its former employing capacity. I therefore propose to vote with the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) against the proposed duties in paragraph 2, but will support the amendment of the Minister to paragraph 1.",49
169,Mr GREGORY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Swan) [9.6] - I appeal to the Minister to agree to an amendment of the proposed duties on timber undressed, cut to size for making boxes. A little while ago I received a letter from the Dried Fruits Association in Western Australia advising me of the difficulties of its members with regard to timber for box-making, and stating that if they were permitted to import timber from Norway they would be able to save 5d. on each box. They cannot afford to pay these heavy duties. There were uo complaints fro m box-makers when the duty was 5s. per 100 super, feet, and I see no reason why it should how be increased to 12s. I hope that the Minister will agree to revert to the former duty.",49
170,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [9.8] - Are we to understand that the duties in paragraphs 1 and 2 are to be taken together, or will honourable members have an opportunity to vote upon them separately?",50
171,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I have no objection to the sub-item being divided.,50
172,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That being so, I shall accept the duties in paragraph 1 with pleasure, because they represent a substantial reduction upon the duties imposed in June of last year, but I am strongly opposed to the duties in paragraph 2, on undressed timber cut to size for making boxes. The increase in this sub-item is nearly 140 per cent. I shall vote against it . Amendment agreed to.

As honourable members are aware it is not the practice to circulate tariff amendments before they are brought down. But this is not a new amendment. It was tabled on the 29th July last.",50
174,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [9.12] - The Minister's amendment increases the general tariff from 6s. in the 1921-28 schedule to 16s. per 100 super, feet-a n increase of nearly 200 per cent. I hope that at least one other honourable member will support me in the call for a division.",50
175,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Warringah) [ 9 . 1 3 ] - I intend to support the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) in the interests of our primary producers who surely are entitled to some consideration. These increased duties are not justifiable.,50
176,Mr GREGORY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Swan) [9.14] - If a man put his hand into my pocket and stole my money I could have him arrested and, upon conviction, he would be lodged in gaol. The. duties in this sub-item have been increased from 6s. in the 1921-28 tariff to 14s. in the British and intermediate tariffs, and 16s. in the general tariff, and will take too much out of the pockets of one section of the community. I emphatically protest against this form of legalized robbery. My only regret is that parliamentary usage will not permit me to use appropriate language to express my condemnation of it . I have a contempt for honourable members who are associated with the f r u it industry, and yet support these duties.",50
177,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"F r a n k l in ) [9.15] - The honourable member for Swan (Mr , Gregory) referred to the proposed duties as likely to impose a great hardship on exporters. He knows very well that, in respect of all timber used for the export trade a rebate of duty is allowed. From one small wharf in my electorate more f r u it is exported than from the rest of Australia, and only hardwood cases are used. Honourable members who are opposing this duty are making a plea for the importers, who realise that hardwood produces a better case for the export of f r u it than does pine. The excellent f r u it that is exported from Western Australia is encased in hardwood.",50
178,Mr GREGORY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I am thinking of the burden that is being placed on the exporters of dried fruits.,50
179,Mr FROST,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Thos e exporters are protected by the drawback which, in my opinion, is not necessary, and is prejudicial to the timber industry. Hundreds of men are unemployed in the district I represent through the use of imported pine cases. Several local firms have combined to erect a large kiln at a cost of approximately £50,000, to dry timber for export cases, and the law requires that all cases used for sending f r u it overseas shall be of seasoned hardwood, properly dressed. The hardwood cases are just as attractive as are those of pine. I am surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), because already the pine forests in South Australia are being cut, and they will be able to supply the local requirements of boxes. That industry should be assisted by an embargo on imported timber.",50
180,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wide Bay) [0.19] - Some honourable members are wrongly regarding these duties as an impost ou the f r u it exporter. timber can be imported from Canada, and if it is used for the making of boxes for export the duty on it is rebated. The item relates to timber cut to sizes and dressed or partly dressed, and the object of the duty is to protect Australian labour. I am surprised that the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) should look scornf u l l y upon Queensland members who are supporting this item. Imported timber which is cut to sizes and dressed should pay a substantial duty, because it deprives Australian workers of employment. The amendment will protect our people, and secure to them work that should be done Lu Australia. For that reason I shall support the item. Although the honourable member for Angas refers to some of us as die-hard protectionists, he is equally bigoted when the wine industry in his own. district is concerned. It is the duty of honourable members to take a broad view, and safeguard the interests of Australian labour.",51
181,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Kennedy) [ 9 . 2 1 ] congratulate the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) on his national outlook. It is time that our tariff protected not only the saw-milling companies, but also the Australian workers. I have no sympathy for those who import timber already cut to sizes and dressed. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) sneered at the Queensland peanut and pineapple pools; but, having regard to the £1,000,000 grant to South Australia, the wine bounty, and the concessions made to other States, I am convinced that Queensland gets a comparatively small share of the federal largesse. I support the amendment, because it will provide work for our people without inflicting a n y hardship on those engaged in the f r u it export industry.",51
182,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [9.23] - I , too, desire to see the Australian workers protected, and they include not only the few engaged in sawing timber into lengths for boxes, but the hundreds of primary producers who require cases for marketing their product in Australia. They should not be penalized. If the duty is increased from 6s. to lGs., the price of locally manufactured cases will advance nearly to that at which the imported article could Uncut be sold. Sneering references have been made to the wine bounty and the gram of £1,000,000 to the State of South Australia. Much more than £1,000,000 if required by that State to compensate it for the burdens imposed upon its people by the Queensland sugar, pineapple, peanut, banana, and butter industries, and the secondary industries of the south-eastern States.

183,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [9.30] - Sub-ite m L deals with "" timber, dressed or . moulded, n.e.i.; timber, tongued or grooved or tongued and grooved; weatherboards"". This class of timber is used in practicallv all the homes of the supporters of the Labour party, yet a Labour Government proposes to place a duty of 24s. per 100 super, feet upon it. As has been pointed out in the debate on another item which was summarily ended, this duty will increase the cost of the workers' homes. It is a scandal and a disgrace that a Labour Government should be proposing these extraordinarily heavy duties, which will place heavy disabilities upon the workers of this country. The timber affected by this item is cheap in price, and there is no real substitute for it in Australia. Honourable members may talk about mountain ash, Tasmanian blackwood, blackbutt, and other timbers of which there are limited quantities in Australia, obtainable only at great cost, but they cannot disguise the fact that' this particular timber is necessary for the construction of homes. Hitherto, our supplies of this class of timber have come chiefly from Norway and Sweden with which countries we have a favourable trade balance. They buy much more from us than we buy from them. Yet we are deliberately proposing to place the extraordinarily heavy impost of 24s. per 100 super, feet duty on this timber. It is impossible for Australia to use all the wool, wheat, and other primary produce which her people have to market. There is a big surplus production which must .be sold in other countries. Our population is only about 6,500,000. If it were in the region of 60,000,000 the attitude which the Government is adopting might be reasonable, for we should have a sufficient population to buy the whole of our primary produce; but a population of 6,500,000, which is being diminished daily because of the fiscal policy of the country, does not provide anything like an adequate market at home for either our primary or our secondary production. If this proposal is agreed to we shall estrange two friendly nations. We shall indicate to them that we do not care whether they trade with lis or uot. We shall also do a serious injustice to the working people of this country if we approve of this duty. I do not expect my remarks on this subject to make any great impression upon honourable members opposite, for I have no doubt that they will vote en bloc in support of the Government's proposal. But whether I have any other support or not, I intend to oppose as strongly as possible, even to the point of calling for a division, the increasr ing of the duties on baltic timber.",52
184,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [9.37] - I also intend to oppose this tremendous increase in duty on dressed or moulded timber and tongued or grooved or tongued and grooved timber and weatherboards. The duty under the general tariff on this class of timber is being increased to 24s. per 100 super, feet. Very little, if any, of this timber will come from Great Britain, so we must regard the duty under the general tariff as the one that will be effective. This timber is covered by two items in the old schedule, and the increases are from 8s. 6d. to 24s., and from 15s. to 24s. I am not quite sure whether the increase on the weatherboards is from 8s. 6d. or 15s. to 24s., but I presume that it is from 15s. to 24s. Whatever other honourable members who represent South Australian constituencies may feel, I am certain that South Australia will feel the full weight of this increase. The people who live in the metropolitan area of South Australia will not be affected very greatly, for galvanized iron and weatherboard houses may not be built in or near Adelaide; but the poorer people who live in the country districts of that State will feel the effect of these duties. I agree with the honourable mem it is an amazing thing that the Labour party should be imposing these added burdens upon the people. The dwellers in weatherboard houses in the suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney are represented in this Parliament by Labour members. There is no doubt that the residents in the metropolitan areas of several States will feel the effect of this very heavy impost. Honourable members are sick and tired of this tariff debate, which has lasted for five months. They seem to be willing to take anything lying down, because they hope that the members of another place will resist the imposition of these duties. But I feel that I must enter my emphatic protest against this proposal. I hope that the members of another place will stand up to their duty better than we have stood up to ours. It must be remembered, however, that they can only suggest alterations to the tariff. I admit that the spectacle of only five, six, seven, or eight members sitting on the Government benches",52
185,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND, The honourable member must confine his remarks to the item before the Chair.,53
186,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am sorry that I am not permitted to tell the people outside what is going on in this chamber; but whether the item before the Chair is weatherboards or tongued and grooved timber, or anything else, we see honourable members opoosite entering the chamber like dumbdriven cattle to vote in a solid phalanx in favour of any proposal that the Government brings forward. Thank God an election is coming in the comparatively near future. I feel sure that the people, when they get the opportunity, will take such steps as will cause some drastic alterations to be made in this schedule, not by the members of this Government, or Parliament, but by the members of the Government and Parliament which will succeed it ",53
187,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.42] - The rates of duty proposed on this timber are, generally, in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. When the previous item was under discussion it was complained that the Government had not followed the recommendations of the board; yet now, when we are actually proposing &c). a duty of Is. per 100 super, feet less under the British and intermediate tariffs than the Tariff Board recommended, we are also criticized. This departure from the board's recommendation is proposed in order to provide a greater margin between the British and intermediate and general rates, in order to give a preference to Canadian timbers in conformity with the trade agreement which was recently' negotiated with that dominion. The Tariff Board, which carried out an exhaustive investigation into this subject, estimated that the amount of money that would be spent on timbers used in substitution for Baltic timbers, would be between £600,000 and £700,000 per annum. Is not the expenditure of that large sum of money likely to creato additional employment in Australia? I ask honourable members to support the proposal because it is generally in conformity with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Question-That sub-item L be agreed to-put . The committee divided.

Item 292 (Laths, palings, pickets,",53
188,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [9.48] - Unde r this item it is proposed to impose on laths for blinds duties ranging from 50 per cent, to 65 per cent. I should like to ask honourable members who, throughout the day, have been boasting of the magnificent timbers produced in Australia, why it is necessary to impose a duty of 65 per cent, under the general tariff' to protect those engaged in the simple process of making laths for blinds. Provision is also made under this item for a duty of 12s. per .1,000 to protect those engaged in the manufacture of Laths used for plastering, and which are sold in a rough state. On a rough line such as palings, which at present have natural protection in the form of ocean freights, exchange and primage duty, a duty of lGs. per 1,000 under the general tariff is proposed. I cannot understand why there should be any necessity to impose a duty in any form on palings which require practically no treatment and are used principally for fencing. Why should it be necessary to impose any of these duties in a country possessing such extensive timber resources?",53
189,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The rates are Is. lower than those imposed, under the 1928-29 tariff.",54
190,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That may be so, but they should be still lower. On undressed pickets, made from jarrah or stringy bark, a duty of 8s. per 100, or approximately Id. each, is considered necessary to protect those engaged in the making of pickets against importations which have to bear the cost of thousands of miles of ocean freight, primage duty and an exchange rate in the region of 30 per cent. I remind the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who has directed attention to the fact that the rates have been reduced Is. per 100 as compared with the 1921-28 tariff, that when those rates were imposed, a 10 per cent, primage duty was not collected and the exchange rate was not as it is today. It is impossible to make any impression upon those rabid protectionists who are in favour of increasing duties in spite of the fact that the exchange rate is against importers, and a 10 per cent, primage duty is now being collected. They still persist in piling up these and in frustrating the efforts of those deavouring to protect the users of these commodities. Is it the intention of the Minister to separate these sub-items when a vote is taken?",54
191,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,No .,54
192,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Balaclava) [9.52] There is no occasion for frenzy on the part of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). If the honourable member carefully studied the position he would realise that these duties are necessary to protect those engaged in the saw-milling industry. I opposed the last item because I felt that baltic flooring does not enter into competition with flooring boards locally produced. The Warburton timber mills in Victoria, as well as those at Alexandra are, I know, 1 doing excellent work; but for those who cannot afford to pay for a more expensive flooring, baltic timber is suitable. The laths and pickets included in this item are made from scrap material of the saw-mills which would otherwise be burnt.",54
193,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Why impose a duty of 65 per cent.,54
194,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If pickets, laths and other products are dumped into this country the Australian saw-millers have no outlet for these articles, and consequently, their overhead expenses are increased through lessened turnover. If a market for scrap material is available additional employment is provided. In the circumstances, the duties proposed do not seem excessive, and I intend to support them.",54
195,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.56] - For the year * 1929-30, the importations under this item were valued at £21,000. The proposed duties were recommended by the Tariff Board, with the exception of those in sub-items B, C and F, which, under the British and intermediate tariffs, are Is. lower than those recommended by the Tariff Board. There should not be any opposition to the item.",54
196,Mr ARCHDALE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"PARKHILL (Warringah) [9.57] - I am profoundly duties moved by the lucid explanation of the en- honourable member for - Balaclava (Mr. White) who, in endeavouring to justify these duties, convinced me that they are nothing but monstrous impositions. To impose a duty of 65 per cent, under the general tariff on laths and palings is an absurdity. If the Minister wishes to accept the Tariff Board's view on this matter, it is more than I am prepared to do. It is outrageous to ask the committee to support a duty of 65 per Cent, on laths for blinds, which could be shaped up in one's spare time. Under the 1921-28 tariff mouldings used by picture-framers and furniture manufacturers were dutiable at 6s., but the rate has now been increased to 10s. per 100 lineal feet. The cost of importations is Is. 9d., but the duty alone is 10s., or about 600 per cent. The imposition of these duties has compelled furniture manufacturers and others to use inferior material sold at 5s. per. 100 lineal feet. Considering the natural protection afforded, a duty of 3s. 6d. per 100 lineal feet, which is equal to 200 per cent., should be sufficient to protect the dozen hands or so engaged in the industry. Here we are, a national legislature, spending our time in passing heavy duties to protect an industry which employs about a dozen hands. These impositions are grossly out of all proportion to other items in a tariff itself of a most unscientific character. That we should be asked to accept them passes the comprehension of any one who takes the time to try to understand such things. Furthermore, it is an insult to one's intelligence.",54
197,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [10.1] - The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) says that if I could only understand it, the reason for this duty is quite plain. What I can understand is that if some of the articles mentioned by him are made from the scrap of sawmills, manufacturing other articles which are protected by excessively heavy duties, they ought not to require a protective duty of 65 per cent. I agree with the honourable mem instead of advancing good reasons for the duties, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has advanced good grounds for their removal. I have been amazed to see the Minister throw out his chest and declare that the Tariff Board has recommended some of these timber duties, particularly when I remember that during the last few weeks he has been flouting the reports of the board. He blows in regard to the Tariff Board reports hot or cold according to how they happen to suit him. His claim, therefore, that we should accept these duties because the Tariff Board has recommended them does not appeal to me. In South Australia, with the exception of split red gum post and rail fences, there 'are very few fences made of local timber. There is very little timber in the State out of which palings and pickets can be made. Yet the people of the State are asked to pay this heavy duty. It is useless for honourable members to argue that the duty payable on the imported article will not be added to the cost of the Tasmanian picket. The Australian manufacturer always brings up his price as close as possible to that of the imported commodity. [Quorum formed.] The Government, not satisfied with imposing heavy duties on all other material required for house construction, proposes to ask the builder to pay a duty of 10s. per 1,000 on laths used for plastering' walls or ceilings. I protest against these ever-increasing timber duties, which have been imposed at the request of honourable members who have timber growing in their electorates. Every one receives consideration from the Government except the poor users of timber.",55
198,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wide Bay) [10.7] - The honourable member should realise that there are some parts of Australia which are expected to pay their way by the development of their commercial assets. South Australia is not in a position to do so', with the result that Queensland, which is developing its timber resources, among others, has heen called upon to contribute towards a gift of £1,000,000 by the Commonwealth to South Australia, to help it to overcome its unemployment problem. The money, however, has been used to help to balance the State budget. The honourable member who would prevent other States from developing their resources sends his wheat to Tasmania, but' buys his palings from Norway. The honourable member cannot complain about the price charged by Tasmanians for palings.",55
199,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,But why is there need for this duty?,55
200,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,To afford to the people engaged in the industry a reasonable amount of protection. Why has a bounty been provided for the export of wine?,55
201,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Why is there a bounty on sugar production?,55
202,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,There is no bounty on sugar production The CHAIRMAN (Mr MCGRATH) Order! The committee is not dealing with sugar.,55
203,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I quite agree that the honourable member was out of order in his reference. I strongly urge the committee to stand by the subitem in the schedule.,56
204,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Warringah) [10.11] - Mr Chairman,56
205,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It will probably be necessary to apply the closure.,56
206,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I would not have risen again but for the reference of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) to the £1,000,000 grant to South Australia for unemployment; because Queensland is living on the Commonwealth to the tune of £7,000,000 for sugar.",56
207,The CHAIRMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Order ! The committee is uot discussing sugar.,56
208,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I can only say that it is monstrously unfair to allow the charge to be made against South Australia without giving honourable members an opportunity to reply to it.,56
209,The CHAIRMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I must ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the item.,56
210,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," Why should it be necessary to put a duty on the laths required for plastering walls and ceilings? The rate is not 10 per cent., 25 per cent., or 35 per cent., Frost, C. W. but 600 per cent. Surely this committee will not blithely and gaily jmss items of this kind without taking the faintest interest in them. I enter my protest.",56

218,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [10.50] - I protest in the strongest and most unmeasured terms against the duty on rakes, seeing that a rake is an implement which is used by every man on the land. I assume that the members of the Country party will support me in opposing this duty. Motion (by Mr EIORDAN) negativedThat the question be now put.",58
219,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," This item covers a number of articles made of wood, including rakes, meaning the old wooden type of hay-rake. The present duties are ad val., British, 50 per cent., plus 10 per cent., making 55 per cent., which, with a surcharge of 50 per cent., totals 82£ per cent. The duties on foreign rakes are 65 per cent., plus 10 per cent., ad val, or 72£ per cent., which, with a surcharge of 50 per cent., equals 107£ per cent. Steel rakes previously came under item 208 A, "" Manufactures of metals"", the rate on which is now, British, 45 per cent., ad val., and foreign, 60 per cent., ad val. It was found thatwhen it suited the Customs Department to collect under item 303 A - "" ""Wooden ware""-it did so, because rakes are specially mentioned in the tariff, but today rakes, being included under "" wooden ware"", have to pay the special 50 per cent, extra duty, which makes their cost exceedingly high. Wooden rakes could be left under item 303 A, but steel rakes should be permitted to enter under item 208 A - "" Manufactures of metals ""-and be dutiable at 45 per cent, if imported from Great Britain, otherwise at 60 per cent., or preferably at lower rates. Rakes are essential to the man on the land, and we should see that their cost is not loaded with high duties. Every honourable member of this committee, irrespective of party, realizes the need for reducing the costs of production; but when honourable members of the Opposition urge that production costs should be lowered, their statements are misconstrued, and they are charged with advocating a reduction of wages. That charge cannot be laid against the Opposition in connection with this item. A reduction of the duty on these articles is urged in the interests of the man on the land. It is unreasonable that he should be called upon to pay such excessive duties on the implements he uses. In addition to rakes, this item covers such articles as bellows, walking sticks, hods, mallets, grain shovels, mitre boxes, wood-split pulleys, and wood bungs, all of which are of greatest importance t« the man on the land.",59

227,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.9] - The ser- present rates were introduced on the 19th Juiie, 1930, and it will be seen that imports had commenced to increase again prior to the introduction of the tariff resolution. The proposed duties provide for three sizes, 6 inches and under, over 6 inches and up to 16 inches, and over 16 inches in diameter. This grading of sizes became necessary on the introduction of talking pictures, for the production of which records the Columbia .Gramophone Company of Australia laid out a plant. The manufacture of records under 6 inches in diameter is now carried out in this country. The industry employs approximately 750 persons.",60
228,Mr HA WEEK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wakefield) [11.10] 1. protest against the increase in duty, particularly on records used for talking films commonly displayed in country towns. It means that a heavier tax must be paid on the smaller plant used for talking pictures in the country. It is most unfair that the type of films shown in the cities, where the attendances are sufficiently large to warrant the installation of the more expensive type of plant, should bo admitted at the lower duty.",61
229,Mr BAYLEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Oxley) [11.11] - I was hoping that the Minister would be able to give fuller information on this matter. Is it possible for records by world famous artists who have not visited Australia to be reproduced in this country?,61

231,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [11.13] - Information was recently obtained by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) showing that in 1928-29, from the 1st July, 1928, to the 30th Juno, 1929, the duty at the rate of l f d . per lineal foot returned revenue to the amount of £147,752, and for the period 1st July, 1929, to the 22nd August, 1929, the revenue totalled £49,460, which represented a fallingoff of almost £100,000. films come from the United States of America. From the 23rd August, 1929, to the 30th June, 1930, the duty collected at the rate of 3d. per lineal foot amounted to £245,544; while for the period from the 10th July, .1930, to the 30th June, 1931, the rate of 4d. per lineal foot yielded a revenue of only £143,784. There must be some explanation of the fact that the receipts are less under a rate of 4d. than they were when the rate was lfd.",61
232,Mr COLEMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,What is your explanati on ?,61
233,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"My explanation is that the same number of films is not coming in, and that they are being duplicated in Australia. If that be the case, the Government should consider whether it is obtaining all the revenue to which it is entitled. Clearly, if it is not receiving what it expected by means of this duty, the_duty should he increased so that it may do so.",61
234,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"To-da y the negative is sent to Australia and positives are made from it, whereas formerly the negative and about five positives were sent. That accounts for the difference in the revenue.",61
235,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If the Government is satisfied that it is receiving all the revenue that it should obtain, I have nothing further to add. Item agreed to. DIVISION 12 - HIDES , LEATHER ANU RUBBER. Item 324 (Chamois leather, & c ) .",61
236,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [11.20] - This item deals with chamois leather, which is made from Australian sheepskins, and on that account I am somewhat diffident about opposing it ; but the increase of 100 per cent, in the duty on importations from Great Britain appears to me to be excessive.",61
237,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,A very good chamois leather is made in Australia.,61
238,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am glad to hear that. I hope that the local manufacturers will capture the Australian trade. But the question that is agitating my mind is, What protection is there for the consumer? Can the Minister give an assurance that the increase of 100 per cent, in These the duty will not result in a corresponding increase in the price charged by the local manufacturers?",61
239,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.21] - The Tariff Board inquired into this matter in 1929, and recommended that the rates imposed under the 1921-28 tariff be not varied. Conflicting evidence was tendered with respect to the quality of Australian chamois leather, compared with that proprice duced in England. The board considered that, with an effective system of distribuBut tion, the industry in Australia should able to compete against imported chamois leathers. The company which made the application for increased duties is now defunct, but manufacturing activities are being carried on in the same factory a new company. ""Whatever may have manufacturers. been the position at the time that the board's inquiry was held, the fact remains that, as a result of the higher duties, the local company has increased its output by 33^ per cent. By reason of a more effective sales organization, which at present is in train, it expects that its output will double the quantity manufactured prior to 1930, The value of the sales of Australian chamois leather for the twelve months' ended Jnne, 1931, amounted to £9,000, while imports for the same period totalled only I move£4,000. Imports have decreased by over £15,000 during the last twelve following:months. The new company employs a system of distribution under which any wholesale merchant can obtain supplies at list prices, less 15 per cent. This effectively overcomes the objection raised by the Tariff Board. The prices of locally-made chamois the 1921-30 tariff. leather are lower than those quoted imported lines.",61
240,Mr MCGRATH,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Ballarat) [11.23] I support this item. There are three factories manufacturing chamois leather in Melbourne today, and they have almost captured the Australian trade. The quality of the article which they produce far surpasses anything that is imported. I have with me a sample of English chamois leather which is sold 4s. 6d., and another of Australian chamois leather which is 25 per cent, heavier, and has a far better finish, which is sold for 3s. There has been a reduction in price since the local started. There is every prospect that this industry will render substantial heavy duties. assistance to our graziers, because all chamois leather that is sold in Australia, whether it be made locally or imported, imposition. is manufactured from sheepskins.",62
241,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [11.24] - I was glad to hear the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) say that the of the Australian chamois leather is lower than that of the imported article. I shall watch developments in conbe nexion with this industry, because I am averse to voting for a duty of 50 per cent, on any commodity; and if I find that the price is increased, I shall avail myself of the first opportunity to launch by an attack in this House against the Item agreed to. Item 325 agreed to. Item 326 By omitting the whole item and inserting in its stead the following item:"" 326. Leather, rubber, canvas and composition belting, and green hide for belting and other purposes, ad val - British , 40 per cent.; intermediate, 45 per cent.; general, 50 per cent.""",62
242,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.25] That the item be amended by adding the ""And on and after the Oth October, 1931320.

243,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [11.26] - The articles included in this item are used for extensively hy the general public, and I fail to see how the Minister can explain satisfactorily the proposal to impose duties of 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and big 60 per cent. These goods have been made factories in Australia for many years, and surely there is now no need for such If I can prevail upon the another honourable member to call with me, I shall vote against such an excessive",62
244,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [11.27] - I agree with the views that have been expressed by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). It is utterly unreasonable in a country which produces all the raw materials that are used in the manufacture of boots, shoes, slippers, and every other article that is included in this item, that it should be proposed to impose such exorbitant duties as are provided, especially in view of the protection that is afforded by the primage duty of 10 per cent., the present exchange rate of 33 per cent., and the cost of insurance, freight, &c, in connection with the imported article.

249,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [11.40] - I am to the proposed increase in the duty on hose-which is essential to the industry of market gardeners and is used extensively by householders. Hose has been manufactured in Australia many years, aud surely the industry is now sufficiently established to be able to continue without the support of duties ranging from Is. to Is. 3d. per lb. In respect of some qualities of hose, those duties are equivalent to 6d. a foot. Such high protection cannot be justified, and I shall vote against the amendment. [Quorum formed.]",63
250,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wakefield) [11.43] My main objection is.to the imposition of a duty on a poundage basis. Hose is not usually sold by the lb., and the rates proposed by the Minister, amounting, i u some instances, to 170 per cent., will have a paralysing effect. If the Australian hose has any merits, it should be sufficiently protected by ad valorem duties. Hose is of considerable importance to market gardeners, particularly in the drier part's of Australia, and to householders throughout the Commonwealth it is an essential convenience.

When this item was before the committee in June last, honourable members vigorously protested against the incorporation of n provision for theimposition of deferred duties on absorbent cotton wool as soon as the industry was in a position to cater for a reasonable proportion of Australian requirements. Although this action was based on a recommendation of the Tariff Board, I agreed to give further consideration to the matter. Since then the position, so far as local manufacture is concerned, has materially altered. Steps have have been taken by Felt and Textiles of Australia Limited, with the assistance of the munitions factory at Maribyrnong, to have these goods manufactured in Australia. Existing machinery is being used, and the quality of the product is excellent. In fact, an examination by an independent consulting chemist of the locallyproduced cotton wool and a high-grade imported line showed that the Australian article possessed greater absorptive and retentive properties than the imported Further experiments showed that the local cotton wool is completely neutral, is soluble in ammoniacal copper oxide solution, and conforms in all respects with the requirements of the British pharmacopoeia. A sample of the local product was tested at the Melbourne Hospital by the Hospital Board of Supplies, and was found by that authority to possess the qualities necessary for hospital use. The price of the locally-made absorbent cotton wool - ranges fro m Is. 2d. to Is. 4d. per lb. This price compares more than favourably with the present landed duty-paid price of imported cottonof the same quality, and is well below the price charged to hospitals in respect of the imported. My inquiries show that the price charged to hospitals varies from Is. per lb. in respect of the lowest grade, to 2s. lOd. per lb. for the highest gradeimported. Australian requirements of absorbent cotton wool are conservativelyestimated at 400 tons per annum, and car* be met by the local manufacturer. On this basis the munitions factory would show a return of £10,000 for preparing the material for cotton wool at the reasonable cost of 2£d. per lb. The Australian cotton industry will also benefit considerably, Bis the cotton used in the manufacture of cotton wool will be in the proportion of 50 per cent. Australian and 50 per cent, imported. The position in regard to prices is explained in the following letter which I have received from the managing director of Federal Felters Proprietary Limited, Flinders-lane, Melbourne, under date of the 6th October, 1931:With reference to the proposal to increase the duties on absorbent cotton wool (not medicated), we guarantee that, if the proposed duty is passe 1 into law, the cost of absorbent cotton wool to hospitals will not be increased above present-day levels. This guarantee is given ou the understanding that production costs, i.e., wages and raw materials, arc not increased. Any advantage gained by the lowered production costs will be passed on to the consumers. You are aware that I have given guarantees on other matters to your Government, and it is within yoiir knowledge that these guarantees have been honoured in every respect. I have gone into the matter very caref u l l y , and I consider .that the position is quite satisfactory.",66
272,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Balaclava) [12.46 a.m.] - I am strongly opposed to these duties. I think that, instead of being ratified, they should be reduced. When the item came before the committee in June last, the Minister realized that the numbers were against him, and postponed it . The honourable member for Indi was then one of its strongest opponents.",67
273,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I then believed that the new duties would increase the price of cotton wool to the hospitals. I am now assured that that will not be so.,67
274,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The explanation of the Minister is too unsatisfactory. Honourable members who know anything about business are aware that wholesale prices have come down considerably. The price of this product should also be reduced. The imposition of these duties would inguarantee flict a rank injustice upon the hospitals of the Commonwealth. Already every hospital in ""Victoria is carrying on with the greatest difficulty, labouring under heavy overdrafts. The Minister has sprung this item the committee Avithout warning. ""When it was previously before the committee I received numerous letters, including one from one of the largest hospitals Victoria, expressing gratitude to who had opposed the imposition of these duties. Does the Minister pretend that those people have eaten their words? This is tariff-making of the very worse kind. The Government is making matters more difficult than ever for the sick, and for the charitable people assist our hospitals. I intend to for a division on the item, to see Avhether those Labour members Avho had the courage to voice their protest against the duties a few months ago will do so market. ugain on this occasion.",67
275,Mr CROUCH,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Corangamite) [12.50 a.m.] - I was one Avho protested strongly against the imposition of these duties in June last. I had letters on subject from the Oolac, Camperdown, Stawell, Maryborough. Ararat and other excluded ? hospitals in my constituency. Before I would change my views I sought to Australian people. an assurance that the duties would not mean additional charges to the That hospitals. I have a lotter from managing director of Eederal Eelters Proprietary Limited, addressed to me personally, and dated the 7th October, 1931, which readsDear Sir, I assure you, on behalf of the manufacturprefer ing interests which are affected by the tion of a duty on absorbent cotton wool, that they will supply the Hospitals Board of Supplies at the same rate as such cotton could be imported from England-of British origin-wer o no duty imposed, subject to proportionate increase as occurs in Australian wages over the existing Australian wage. I understand that 90 per cent, of our cotton wool requirements was imported from England. I feel that, if that letter is placed on record in Hansard, it will a sort of charter to our hospitals their interests Avill be protected.",68

278,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Waronly ringah) [12.52 a.m.] - I am not satisfied with the explanation that has been given by the Minister. I am informed on that each Victorian hospital uses approximately 50 lb. of cotton wool per annum. An additional charge of 4d. per.j lb. on this product would involve in those institutions in an aggregate inthose creased expenditure of £2,000 per annum. 1 presume that when the Minister claims that the price of this commodity will be the same as that of imported cotton wool, he is adding the duty to the price of the imported article.",68
279,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The price of the Auswho tralian product will not be increased call beyond that of imported cotton wool, landed duty free. The duty will provide the necessary protection, and enable local manufacturers to capture the Australian",68
280,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The increased duties will give this company very a monopoly. Is competition such an awful thing that it has to be suppressed? the Why should the duty be increased to snob an extent that the British article is,68
281,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It Avill give employment,68
282,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," reason is insufficient to warrant the the increase. The item has been sprung on the committee. I am strongly opposed to a duty, even of 4d. per lb., on a commodity that is so essential to our hospitals.",68
283,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [12.56 a.m.] - I seeing the word "" free"" in the imposischedule against this item to any assurance from a manufacturer that he will wool not increase his prices. I am tired of hearing these repeated promises that such there will be no increase in prices if protective duties are imposed. The greatest protection that could be given to our hospitals would be to allow cotton wool to come in duty free. Apparently some be pressure has been brought to bear on honthat orable members opposite to make .them change the views that they previously ex : be pressed on the subject, as they now appear to be quite submissive to the wishes of the Minister. The fact that cotton is grown in the electorate of Capricornia affords no justification to me for the penalization of our hospitals.",68
284,Mr JONES,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Indi ) [12.57 a.m.] - I previously opposed these duties because t thought that they would mean increased costs to the hospitals. I am satisfied with the assurance that has been given this evening that that will not be the As a result of the imposition of these duties, additional employment will be provided, and our hospitals will be able to purchase, without extra cost, an article that is equal, if not superior, to the imported product. Therefore, I shall support the item.",69

It is not the first occasion that i to the rescue of the manufacturers of Australia. It has the machinery, chemists and experts .necessary out very fine work. One of the reasons why the Australian cotton wool industry has established itself so rapidly is that the necessary machinery was already existence at Maribyrnong.

286,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Balaclava) [1.0 a.m.]. - Evidently , the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) had timely wanting of the Minister's amendment. Had I known it would be moved, I could Blakeley, A. have produced letters from hospitals conBrennan, demning the Government's proposal.",69

Has that factory come to the rescue of the sick people in the comcase. munity? We are told that we ought to be proud of the Maribyrnong Ammunition Factory. Yet we know something of the trouble it caused through manufacturing sheet brass. Now another f i r m is using this government institution to help it in the manufacture of cotton wool. No doubt it will claim that its product has the hallmark of quality, because of its association with this government factory. For that reason, and because it provides work for a few operatives, we are asked t has come to grant the firm a monopoly.",69

290,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"W h e r e an industry can show that it can meet competition, in and will not be a burden on the community, I agree that it should be prom a tected, but I object to penalizing the sick in our hospitals in order to provide a monopoly for any company.

291,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [1.8 a.m.] - I move That the item be amended by adding the following to sub-item (B) :"" And on and after the Oth October, 1931"" (n) Lamps of glass or chiefly of glass or with glass fonts; glass parts of lamps or lanterns other than chimneys, ad val - British , 35 per cent.; intermediate, 50 per cent.; general, 00 per cent."" The amendment proposed constitutes an increase of 10 per cent, in the British preferential tariff on the goods covered by this sub-item. The Tariff Board recommended the rates in the item as it at present appears before the committee. In departing from the Tariff Board's recommendation, the Government ascribes its reasons to events ""which have taken place since the board presented its report in June, 1930, and to facts which it considers were not stressed at the inquiry. In November, 1929, the Government increased the rates on the goods covered by this sub-item to 40 per cent., British; 55 per cent, intermediate; and 60 per cent, general. Those rates were retained until March, 1931, when, acting upon the recommendation of the Tariff Board, the rates were reduced to 25 per cent, under the British preferential tariff, and to 50 per cent, under the intermediate tariff. Notes. That reduction in the British rate gave the manufacturer in Great Britain such a wide margin of preference over his Vi'uiu. T. W. foreign competitor that the latter was precluded from marketing his goods in Australia in competition with lampware shipped from Great Britain. The local company has received information to the effect that a European firm is seriously considering transferring some of its plant and a number of its employees to Great Britain. Should it do so, a duty of 25 per cent, would not enable the local company to carry on against the competition of this European company. Moreover, British manufacturers would be seriously affected, for the reason that foreign operatives working for the European company in Great Britain would not be subject to the conditions of labour applicable to British workmen. I remind the committee that the British preferential tariff of 25 per cent, has stood for many years, and has beeii regarded in the nature of a revenue duty. That the British manufacturer commanded a fair proportion of the market with a 15 per cent, margin of preference under the 1921-1930 tariff should not be 1 lost sight of. It is also noticeable that under the rates in the sub-item, as it at present appears to the committee, the British manufacturer enjoys a 35 per cent, margin of preference over the foreign manufacturer, which is 10 per cent, greater than that which Che Australian company receives over the manufacturer in Great Britain. Illuminating glassware is produced totally by hand labour; and the difference between the rates of pay in Great Britain and Australia is such as to render a'25 per cent, duty imjpotent. Should the European manufacturer referred to remove his factory to Great Britain the position, from the point, of view of the local company, would be infinitely worse. It is interesting to note that under the 40 per cent. British preferential rate operating prior to March last, the company was enabled to extend its plant and to provide employment for an additional 36 operatives.",70
292,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Balaclava) [1.12 a.m.]. - If it were not tragic, it would be ludicrous to find that the tariff of the Commonwealth of Australia is framed in this way. Some one tells the Minister that a certain European firm is likely to start a factory in Britain to manufacture certain glassware, and that therefore he had better alter the duties on that commodity, and the Minister agrees to do so! If some one outside Parliament said that that was how tariffs were framed, he would not be believed. We are not told the name of the firm which may commence operations in Britain, nor do we know the name of the man who whispered the story on a street corner. It is not uncommon for European and American companies to establish factories in Britain. When they do so, they have to conform to British industrial regulations. Moreover, they employ British workers. There have been instances in which our protective policy has encouraged companies from overseas to establish works ih Australia. One such company set up a factory in Australia to manufacture lawn mowers when the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton'), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, was in Britain. The machinery necessary for the manufacture of the lawn mowers was admitted practically free of duty. Mr Fenton' - What is the honourable member insinuating? - Mr WHITE - When , a British company, with British capital, commences operations in Australia, and refuses to dispose of any of its shares in Australia, the profits it makes go out of this Mr .FOBDE - But it employs Australian workers.",70
293,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The cases, then, are exactly analogous-; the foreign company of which the Minister spoke will employ British workers if it establishes a factory in Britain.",71
294,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It will probably take operatives from its own country.,71
295,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"There is no justification for duties being raised in this way, merely because some one has scared the Minister. I oppose the amendment.",71
296,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [1.14 a.m.] - I oppose the amendment. The Minister has told us that a duty of 35 per cent. British preferential tariff is necessary to protect this Australian industry against British products. What an admission of our incompetence! Industries which cannot 'be carried on without duties of from 4.0 to 60 per cent, are uneconomic. In this age, when electric light is superseding the ordinary oil lamp in all the main centres of population, the imposition of a heavy duty to encourage the production of a more or less obsolete commodity, is absurd. The Australian Glass: Company is one of the harshest monopolies in Australia. Many of the distributing firms are hobbled, being compelled by the manufacturers to contract for supplies twelve months ahead. I am very suspicious of the relations between the Australian Glass Company and the Government. This monopoly seems to be able to get from the Ministry anything it wants. Yesterday, we saw how the Minister was prepared to allow the product of slave labour in Kenya Colony to be imported so that the Australian Glass Company might get it more cheaply. He was deaf to the appeals made on behalf of a South Australian industry. The company appears to have some "" p u l l "" over members of the Government.",71
297,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The Government does not know any company in this matter; it is merely protecting Australian industries.,71
298,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [1.17 a.m.] - The old duties under this item were 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent., country. and we are now asked to increase them to 35 per cent., 50 per cent., and 60 per cent. I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister. Are lamps and lamp glasses to be produced by the Australian Glass Company ?",71
299,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I do not know the manufacturers.,71
300,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I have a very shrewd suspicion that the Minister is adding to one of the most unfair and grasping monopolies in Australia. The amendment is being sneaked in at an early hour of the morning without explanation, and in the expectation that, in a comparatively small committee, it will pass unnoticed. I protest against any further bolstering of the Australian Glass Company. The goods covered by the item are not manufactured in Australia. Hurricane lamps, for instance, are not made locally, and it is unlikely that the expensive plant necessary for their manufacture would ever be installed in Australia. Mr Forde,-Hurrican e lamps are made here.",71
301,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," Even if that bo so, the manufacturers should not require protection to the extent of 35 to 60 per cent. It is quite clear to me that the Government is placing another industry in the grip of the octopus company which controls the manufacture of glass in this country. If honourable members have any regard for the public they will not permit this monopoly to increase its hold upon the community. The imports of lamps and lamp glasses come not from Great Britain, but principally from Belgium, Czechoslovakia and Germany.",72
302,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Chiefl y from the United States of America.,72
303,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," Some come from America, but the present exchange rate and the general state of the money market are a sufficient protection against the importation of American goods. There is a sinister significance in the fact that a duty of 35 per cent, is proposed against the United Kingdom, from which none of these goods will be imported, and duties of 50 per cent, and 60 per cent, against, the countries which are the only real competitors with the Australian manufacturers. The British preferential rate of 35 per cent, is intended merely to camouflage the advantage that is being given to a powerful monopoly. The policy of excluding goods of European origin inflicts grievous harm on the general public. Cheap glass jugs manufactured in Europe are bought readily by people of small means, but the policy of the Government is to exclude these and similar goods and concentrate the whole trade in the hands of a monopoly which will supply to the market what it chooses, and charge for it whatever price it thinks fit. I enter my emphatic protest, against the manner in which this item is being dealt with at this hour of the morning, and against the monstrous duties that are proposed in order to bring another field of industry under the control of Australian Glass Company.

304,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [1.33 a.m.] The item covering plain clear window glass first appeared in the tariff schedule as a deferred duty to come into operation on the 1st July, 1926. The rates were proposed after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board in 3925, and were subsethe quently agreed to by Parliament as a deferred duty, and incorporated in the 1921-28 tariff. At the Tariff Board inquiry, and also when the subject was being discussed in this chamber, reference was made to the method of manufacture that the Australian Glass Company had intended to adopt. Representatives of British interests suggested that the methods employed in the factories of England were superior to the Fourcault system which the Australian company intended to use. The position is that the Australian Glass Company, before deciding on the method it would adopt, investigated the manufacture of window glass overseas to ascertain the best methods employed in any part of the world. The result of that investigation was in favour of the Eourcault system. The December^ 1930, issue of the magazine Glass, which is the recognized organ of the glass industry in Great Britain, gives some up-to-date information regarding the Eourcault system. An article in it, written by Professor W. E. S. Turner, OBE., D.Sc, reads as follows :Substantial improvement has been effected ill the past live years . . . Strict temperature control is an essential factor j n successful operation of the '-'Fourcault"" process. . . . The investigations of the flow of the glass through the drawing channels from the furnace have resulted in the modification of the design of the channels. The standard design at one time consisted of a drawing channel like a T-piccu to the melting furnace length. . . sucli an arrangement involves the reheating and cooling of the glass as it [lasses successive reheating and drawing chambers. The most recent designs ure planned to supply each machine with fresh glass from the furnace . . . (to overcome the reheating difficulty). The "" F o u r c a u l t "" process has undergone rapid development in recent years and has found its way into many countries . . . they are to be found in India, China, and Japan. Australia is about to install them (1030), while in the past live years they have rapidly displaced both the hand aud machine cylinder methods and now possess a substantially greater production capacity than the Libbey-Owens process in the United States of America. The Australian Glass Company has incurred a great deal of expense in establishing its factory. It has invested approximately £330,000 in the enterprise, and there is no doubt that it will be able to supply the whole of the Australian requirements. But huge stocks of glass were imported and stored some time ago, so that no orders are available at. present for the Australian company. So soon as orders come to hand, the company will be ready to put its furnace into operation. The duties now proposed can be fully * justified. I shall not deal with the matter further at the moment; but will provide honourable members with fuller information later if they desire it.",72
305,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [1.36 a.m.] - I move That the item be amended by adding the following:"" And on and after the nth October, 1931 (n) Sheet, viz.: (1) Plain clear, per 100 feetBritish, 3s.; intermediate, 4s.; general, 5s. (2) Figured rolled, cathedral, milled rolled, rough cast, wired cast, and opalescent, per 100 feet-British , 3s.; intermediate, 4s.; general, 5s."" In the past, window glass litis been dutiable at so much per 100 feet, or at an ad valorem rate. By changing the method of applying duty to this item, the Government is really camouflaging the position. It is now proposed that an extraordinary degree of protection shall be imposed, which will practically amount to prohibition. It should not he overlooked that the Australian Glass Company, which applied for and was granted these duties, admitted to the Tariff Board that it is hot employing such an efficient plant as its competitors. How is it possible, in these circumstances, to justify any increase in the duty? The duties now being imposed are, without doubt, excessive. The old rates were-British , 2s. per 100 feet, and general, 4s. per 100 feet. The duties now under discussion are-British, 12s. 6d. per 100 feet for 16-oz., and 16s. 8d. per 100 feet for 21-oz.; and general, 17s. 8d. per 100 feet 16-oz., and 27s. 8d. per 100 feet 21-oz. These duties are equivalent to increases of 525 per cent, and 735 per cent. British, and 330 per cent, and 590 per cent, general. The provision for alternative duties of British 45 per cent, and general 60 per cent, ad valorem, whichever is the higher, is misleading, as invariably the duty per lb. represents from 75 per cent, to 200 per cent, on the f.o.h. price. I u spite of these facts, the Minister has made no attempt to defend his proposal, and I do not think he will do so. In the face of these extraordinary increases, one cannot help feeling that there is in this proposal something more than an intention to protect the Australian industry.  honourable member mean by that statement?",73
306,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The Minister may make what he likes out of it. The Australian Glass Company apparently can get anything it likes to ask for. Surely it is not difficult for honourable members to see that the imposition of these duties must inflict still greater hardships upon those engaged in the building trade. It should be readily admitted that, if an industry needs such extraordinary protection as this, it is not in the interests of - the community that it should be established here. It must be evident, from the comparisons which I have made, that the duties now proposed have been introduced without proper consideration, and in a haphazard fashion. The cost of window glass is important to every individual in the Commonwealth. In my opinion, it is impossible to prove that the imposition of these duties can be beneficial to the community in any way. I repeat that the alteration in the method of imposing the duty on window glass has camouflaged the real effect of the duties. I have moved my amendment with the object of reverting to the old method of imposing the duty. I ask the Minister whether the Tariff Board recommended that the duty be imposed at so much per 100 feet, or by weight, or on an ad valorem basis? I do not think that he will tell me that the board favoured the adoption of the weight method. I ask honourable members to agree to a reversion to the old method.",74
307,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [1.43 a.m.] - We are now dealing with one of the most unpleasant and unsavoury items in this schedule.

308,Mr EOKOE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That is absolutely untrue.,74
309,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I direct the attention of the Minister to a statement made at a deputation which I introduced to him on this subject. member of the deputation told the Minister to his face that this company knew the exact date when new duties would come into operation.

315,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The facts are against the Minister. I cannot get anything and have never suggested that I can. Only the favoured few get anything.,74
316,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,No one is favoured more than any one else. Every case is dealt with on its merits.,74
317,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,In this particular case the deferred duty was imposed a month earlier than was originally intended. .What is the Minister's explanation of that? That is another instance of the tender treatment meted out by this Government to this industry.,74
318,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It is quite within the power of the Government to do that.,74

324,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," This company has obtained a monopoly of glass stocks in Sydney, and also of manufacture of glass, because of these prohibitive duties, which amount to embargo. This item is similar to others in that it refers to the products not Great Britain, but of the United States of America, Czecho Slovakia and GerManly many. The price of glassware used by the workers of this country, which was previously obtainable at a reasonable cost, has been largely increased as result of the operation of this duty. Mr E.

CUNNINGHAM - I bought glass t here only last week.",75
335,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The reason is that this company has bought up all the stocks of glass, and is selling it at its own price. The cost of these glass-houses has been increased by some o'd per cent, as the result of the opera-, lions of these duties and the handing over of the glass industry to one company. There is not a tighter monopoly within Australia. This company has so organized the glass industry that the average man cannot buy it except under extortionate conditions. This is a most iniquitous duty. The Government managed to sneak in just prior to this item an additional item which has great potentialities for adding to the burdens of the community. Let me point out the significant and sinister form of these duties. *A heavy tariff is imposed against Great Britain of some 45 per cent., which is quite inoperative, because much of this kind of glass does not. come from that country. The operative duties are those of 5i> per cent, and 60 per cent. Those are the loaded duties designed to prevent imports. Mr E. Ri-usv - Import s from where?",76
336,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," Prom the United States of America, Czecho Slovakia, and Germany. It has been pointed out that prior to November last the tariff on glassware was as set in this item, and under it Great Britain had a preference over continental and foreign glassware of 40 per cent., which is unfair and unnecessary, as Great Britain exports to this country only the highest grade qualities of cut crystal, which is a luxury line, whereas other lines from the Continent are glassware for everyday use. That is the glassware which is being excluded. This tariff is most pernicious and dangerous, and the Government, in introducing it, has disregarded altogether the interests of the community generally.",76
337,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.0 a.m.] This Government has merely brought into operation deferred duties that were introduced by a Nationalist government after a careful inquiry had been made by the Tariff Board. Practically the whole of the rawmaterials used for our glass-making arc of Australian origin. The honourable member for Warringah  Glass Manufacturing Company knew that the deferred duties were about to become operative. That is untrue. If the company made an intelligent guess, that is its business. It was certainly not given any information by the Government or by an officer of the Customs Department. 1 resent the insinuations of the honourable member for Warringah, hurl them back in his teeth, and challenge him to prove them.",76
338,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member could not have read the report of the Tariff Board, which recommended the imposition of these duties.",76
339,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Exactly ; all this Government did was to make operative duties that were decided on by a Nationalist government. The honourable member for Warringah shed crocodile tears over the alleged difficulties of the tomato-growers in his district. As a matter of fact the Australian Glass Company definitely promised to make glass available to the tomato-growers at a price at, least as low as that charged to them by the importing companies. Mr ARCHDAT.B PARKHII.T. - That promise has not, been carried out.",76
340,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That is the fault of the tomato-growers to whom the glass was out offered a month ago. The honourable member comes along with a brief from the importing companies, and makes groundless assertions. I am stating facts. I shall not allow his misrepresentations to go unanswered. Following upon its decision to undertake the manufacture of window glass, the Australian Glass Manufacturing Company engaged in the importation and sale of window glass manufactured overseas by the "" Fourcault"" system. This was done to enable the Australian Glass Company to establish a trade in the actual class of glass that it proposed to make here, and thus fix a market before the factory began to operate. To have done otherwise would have courted disaster, for the simple reason that a factory turning out large quantities of glass for which no market had previously been provided, would quickly be obliged to close down while a sales organization was built up. It must be kept in mind that overseas manufacturers of glass had for many years enjoyed an unrestricted business in Australia. Naturally, the idea of having to meet competition from an Australian company, assisted by a protective tariff, was not an agreeable prospect. Every difficulty that could be placed in the way of the Australian company by overseas interests was to be confidently expected. The first essential to success on the part of the local concern was, therefore, to work up a business connection in the class of glass it intended to manufacture. The importation of window glass by the Australian company has been referred to as an attempt to exploit the public by importing glass while the tariff was low, witli the intention of holding it u n t i higher duties were imposed, aud then selling the imported glass at increased prices. So far as the Australian Glass Company is concerned, it did not import glass for the purpose of holding it for a higher t a r if f ; it did so to build up a trade before the increase was imposed. it was not the intention of the Australian Glass Company to take advantage of the tariff to charge increased is borne out by the fact that.the company has not increased its prices, nor does it intend to do so. Any increase in the prices of sheet glass since the introduction of increased duties has been made by companies other than the Australian Glass Company, concerns over which that company has no control, and whose interests are allied with overseas manufacturers. Mr ARCHDAL E PARKHILL - Who supplied the honourable gentleman with this information?",76
341,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I assure honourable members that I have not consulted any manufacturer on the subject. I certainly did not obtain any information from Smith's Weekly, as did the honourable member for Warringah. Criticism has been levelled at the Australian Glass Company for not having produced any window glass, although a protective dury has been imposed. The explanation is that the local company could not start to manufacture until there was a demand for the product. That demand could not exist while the country was loaded with imported stocks. Importers loaded up in 1925-26 aud have kept heavy stocks ou hand ever since, in order, to prevent the Government from bringing in the deferred duty. The terms of a deferred duty provide that it will not be imposed, until the goods concerned are made in Australia in satisfactory quantities, and. of a satisfactory quality. So long therefore, as the importers could keep the supplies of glass up to a point that precluded the Australian Glass Company from selling any appreciable quantity of its output so long was the possibility of commencing manufacture in Australia delayed. The inauguration of the industry meant the expenditure of £300,000. Once begun, the production of glass has to be continuous for a certain period, as l the the temporary closing down of a furnace means the loss of hundreds of pounds. Under these circumstances, the Australian Glass Company could not start the in dustry while the duty was still deferred. Action was first necessary to create the conditions under which a market would That be possible when production began. On the 19th June, 1930, the Governprices ment introduced a tariff proposal that abolished the deferred provisions and i m posed the full rate. This was the only way to check the importations that were keeping the stocks up to a point that prevented local manufacture. Before i m posing the duty, the fact was ascertained that the falling off in building has lessened the demand for sheet glass, arid that the stocks held by various importers were sufficient to meet all requirements until the Australian factory reached production. The establishment erected by the Australian Glass Company is the finest sheet glass factory in the world. The works have now been completed, and production will be begun as soon as stocks of imported glass are sufficiently reduced to permit sales of Australian-made glass. As to what is the amount of protection necessary to enable an Australian company to compete successfully with i m ported window glass is necessarily somewhat - uncertain. At the Tariff Board inquiry, the applicant company submitted estimates of what it thought would be its manufacturing costs, but, with an entirely new industry such as this, the estimates are necessarily somewhat speculative. In view of the disparity between rates of wages in this' country and those in other glass-making-countries, however* the Tariff Board recommended that the rates applied for be granted. They were madedeferred duties. The offence of this Government is that it made them operative. Why were they provided by a Nationalist government, if they were not to be made operative some day? Why should the action of this Government be regarded with suspicion? I and my predecessor can look anybody in the face. We know no individual in these matters, but treat each application ou its merits.",77
342,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Why were the duties brought down at this juncture?,78
343,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"When it is anticipated that deferred duties are to be brought into operation, importers immediately endeavour to hoard up large stocks. In this instance, the importers desired to have sufficient imported glass on. hand to prevent the local enterprise beginning operations for another eighteen months or two years. The Australian Glass Company gave an assurance that when it began production it would supply unlimited quantities of sheet glass for primary producers' glass houses at prices substantially lower than those previously charged in Australia.",78
344,Mr RIORDAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The company has been waiting for the orders of people like the tomato-growers in the Manly district.,78
345,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Whic h gives the lie direct to the statement that those producers cannot obtain glass. Air. ARCHDALE PARKHILL - I ask that that remark should be withdrawn. It is untrue, and most offensive to me.",78
346,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND," I shall not direct ihat it be withdrawn. The words used were that the circumstances referred to ""gave the lie direct to the statement"" made by the honourable member.",78
347,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If any criticism is to be made with regard to the imposition of the duty on this sheet glass it should he directed against the importing houses which are the agents of overseas manufacturers. Inquiries made by the department brought to light the fact that immediately the increased duties were imposed importing and distributing firms increased their prices by an amount equivalent to the increased duties. Huge Hocks had been imported by these firms, and the duty paid thereon was at the nominal rate of British, 2s., or general, 4s. per 100 square feet. There is no justification for such action. It is a deliberate exploitation of the public, including primary producers who use glass houses to grow certain products. A refreshing contrast in business morality is the action of the Australian Glass Manufacturing Company in refusing to increase its . prices for plain clear sheet glass on which the higher duty had not been paid. The company not only maintained its pre-tariff selling prices; it also inquired into the bona fides of each purchaser in order to ensure that sales were made to actual users of glass, and not to "" dummies "" of the glass importing and distributing houses. Owing to the various sections of the Australian Glass Company's activities being closely related, it is rather difficult to state the actual capital invested and the number of employees in any one section. For instance, the capital invested and the men engaged in the refractory factory are partially employed in the production of sheet glass, partially of pressed 'ware, and partially of cut crystal. The same applies to the engineering works of the company, as well as to its administration. The following facts will, however, give an indication of the position of the Australian Glass Company and its branches: It has a factory in each State excepting Tasmania; there are four factories in New South Wales; the capital invested in the company is £1,654,489. Prior to the depression it employed 2,400 persons, although' in the early part of this year the number of employees had fallen to 1,500 - The new factory has been completed for the manufacture of window glass, .opal glass, figured rolled, milled rolled, rough cast, wired cast and opalescent glass. The manufacture of cut glass is rapidly extending. These extensions will mean, the employment of approximately 500 additional workers when business becomes normal. That will bring the total number of employees up to nearly 3,000, the greaterproportion of whom will be male adults. The annual wages bill will be from £550,000 to £600,000. Certain importing interests, which were opposed to the establishment of a glass manufacturing factory in Australia, were prepared to kill the new industry by any means. The present Government put into operation the deferred duty recommended by the Tariff Board and adopted by the Nationalist Government only in order that employment might be given to our own people.",78
348,Mr R GREEN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Richmond) [2.23 a.m.] - During this tariff debate I have been a candid critic of the Government's proposals. I have not hesitated to criti cize the backyard industries which have grown up in our midst without benefiting the country. But the figures which have been quoted by the Minister to-night regarding the capital invested in this industry, and the number of workers, it employs, must make those who are generally opposed to the Government's fiscal policy hesitate before rejecting the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which inquired into the industry. Knowing the rumours which were current regarding this company, I inspected its works. I went around quietly, and asked a number of questions. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the replies I received, all of which were given with apparent candor. The representatives of the company were most willing to place their cards on the table before a representative of the people who wished to gain first-hand knowledge regarding its operations. The policy of the Country party is to assist the natural industries of this country by whatever means that can best be .done. I understand that most of the raw materials required for the manufacture of glass are obtainable in Australia, and that practically the only things imported are certain chemicals. It is, therefore, evident that the glass manufacturing industry comes within the category of natural industries. When I visited the factory the furnaces were not in operation, but they will soon be ready to commence the manufacture of plain sheet glass. I , therefore, feel that the time has arrived when the deferred duty should become operative. I propose to vote for the dutiesproposed by the Minister. "" Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL (Warringah) [2.24 a.m.] - The Minister has made extraordinary preparation in defence of these duties. In other cases he has either refused to make a statement or has given only meagre information; but, in regard to this item, he has read a carefully-prepared brief, covering a mass of details relating to this company and the manufacture of glass. How did he know the statements that I intended to make?",79
349,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"In view of the allegations against the company, I felt that I should give in detail the result of the investigation made by my officers.",79
350,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The Minister's defence is merely a series of assertions, uttered in a cheap-jack claptrap fashion, with many gesticulations and offensive references. He said that he would not allow this and that to be done. He cannot stop the people of this country from saying what they know. They want more than the antics of a cheap-jack Minister to satisfy them regarding this company. The Minister said that the price of glass had not been raised. I am prepared to produce before the Tariff Board, or any other impartial body, persons who will be prepared to swear that they could obtain glass only if they paid increased prices for it. The Minister's contradictions are not evidence.",79
351,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The importers increased their prices, although they had not paid the increased duties on the glass they sold.",79
352,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I admit that some small pieces of glass have been manufactured in Australia; but they have been of such a thickness that they have .caused much trouble in the trade. The Minister said that as soon as the. factory is established it will commence to manufacture sheet glass. He appears to think that the establishment of a factory is all that is necessary to manufacture sheet glass. Yet he knows that an American company spent about £500,000 in endeavouring to manufacture sheet glass, and, because of atmospheric conditions, was unable to make it. The British company from which we obtain some of our sheet glass had experts examining England almost foot by foot before it decided on Doncaster as the site of its English factory. Its experts said that other portions of England were not suitable for the purpose. Frequently shakes and imperfections make it difficult to get large sheets of clear glass without flaws in it. The 600 Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Australian company has no guarantee view that it will he able to manufacture glass be in this country. Meanwhile, Belgium, from whence most of our sheet glass came, in quite unfriendly from a tariff point W of view. Mr C. RILEY - What is wrong with the samples of glass exhibited 'by the consider Minister?",79
353,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND," Those samples remind me of a man who enlightening goes to a fish shop to get some fish to take home to his wife to prove that went fishing. The Melbourne Argus the 9th April, 1931, published a letter in which the writer asked Mr E. Norton Grim wade to answer the following quesposing tions :I . la it n fact that his Australian company haa not yet produced a single foot sheet glass, figures rolled glass, rolled plate, wired cast, opalescent, or opal glass? 2. it a fact that when the deferred duty on sheet glass was agreed to by Parliament in 1926, it was on the basis that the Australian manufacturer would prove his ability to duce quantity and quality before it was applied? Perhaps the Minister will answer that question. A condition precedent to the application of the deferred duty was that vious Ministry. the company should be able to satisfy the Minister that it could produce of approved quality in commercial quanconditions tities3. That, notwithstanding this, the present Government brought the duty into force on the 20th June, 1930, before the Australian lished. manufacturers had even attempted to manuWarringah. facture, although four years had pas&ed, cluding the greatest building boom in our history? 4. That the duties on sheet glass were made operative ou the 20th June, 1930, although the Minister had proclaimed ther deferment until the 1st August, 1930? S. Why hfive prohibitive duties on figured rolled glass been instituted since the June, when Mr Crimwade admits that company will not be producing "" until of the present month,"" although Mr Smith, manager of the Australian company, told the Tariff Btiard in Sydney on the 4th February that i i would definitely be producing on 23rd March last? 0. Did Mr Smith admit the Tariff Board that not even an experidoes mental foot of figured rolled had been by his company up to the 4th February, that be, therefore, could not give production nor could he give the board any figures support the excessive duty applied for? If the Australian company has apparently yet reached the stage of knowing production coats, what is the basis of Mr Grimwade's ""confidence"" regarding selling prices? Tariff. of Mr Grimwade's statement that "" prices will satisfy every one,"" this obviously must on basis of prices ruling before the 20th June, 1930, and presumably it is proposed to sell at such ju ices or lower, where, then, is the need for the present excessive duty? 9. i ll Mr Crimwade deny that all the duties under discussion are in contravention of the Tariff Board Act? 10. Does Mr Grim wade that glass duties, which range from 100 per cent, to more than 300 per cent, on f.o.b. values, are warranted, even if local manufacturers were actually producing? A reply to the foregoing questions would be to the pulTlic. he Mr Grimwade has maintained a deathof like silence. He has never answered those questions, because any attempt to do so would only unmask his industry, exit to the public as an octopus-like monopoly that should never have been started, and whose operations should be of.either closely investigated.",80

The amendment affects the item as it appears in the schedule in the following respects:- "" Decanters "" are included in sub-item B ; an increase of 10 per cent, is made in the British rate under subitems u, c, and F ; and a new sub-item a is incorporated to cover "" Vacuum Elasks and similar Vacuum Containers and parts thereof "". The reasons which the Government advances for these amendments are as follow: First, some doubt existed as to whether decanters could be regarded as bottles, and it was deemed advisable to mention them specially in item 250 B which covers cut glass bottles, &c. Decanters which are of glass other than cut glass will be dutiable under item 250 c. Secondly, as to the increase of 10 per cent, in the British preferential tariff, the Tariff Board has recommended that the ad valorem British rate in respect of the item should be 25 .per cent. The British rate of 35 per cent, ad valorem proposed in the amendment is the same as that, introduced in November, 1929, in respect of certain glassware, and on the 19th June, 1930, in respect of certain other glassware, and which was lowered to 2n per cent. in March last. Immediately rates equal to those now proposed were previously introduced, an impetus was given to the local firm Mr Forde. . engaged in the manufacture of glassware. Eor instance, the company had contemplated the abandonment of its activities in the cut-ware section of the industry, but, inspired by the additional protection granted, it intensified its manufacturing operations and increased the number of hands employed in the manufacture of cut glass articles from seventeen to 100. Shortly after the British rate on cut-ware was increased, ""Webb's Crystal Glass Company Limited, one of the largest manufacturers of cut glass in England, commenced negotiations with the local company with a view to joint manufacture in Australia of this country's requirements, but as soon as the British rate reverted to 25 per cent, negotiations ceased. ' The 25 per cent. British preferential rate on glassware has operated for many years, and has been looked upon in the past as a revenue duty. It offered no inducement to British manufacturers to operate in Australia. Under a protection of British, 35 per cent.; intermediate, 50 per cent., and general, 60 per cent., the Crown Crystal Glass Works Limited decided to manufacture certain glassware in Australia, and was proceeding satisfactorily with its preparations; hut the reversion to the 25 per cent. British rates has served as a distinct set back tb the company. British, manufacturers are unlikely to commence manufacture in Australia so long as they can land their goods at prices which are competitive with local glassware. With a margin of 15 per cent, under the 1921-30 tariff, British manufacturers secured a good share of the local market. The Government has been approached by representatives of foreign countries who are large purchasers of Australian produce and are concerned in the export of glassware to Australia, who have complained that the 35 per cent, margin of preference accorded to Great Britain over their countries' glassware was out of all reason. They drew attention to the fact that the margin of preference enjoyed by Great Britain over foreign countries was 10 per cent, greater than that which the Australian manufacturer received over the British manufacturer. The Government had the choice of two coursesto reduce the foreign rate to 50 per cent., or to increase the British rate to 35 per cent. The second course has been adopted, for the reason that the local manufacturers could not hope to compete with the lower foreign rate, and the Government is of the opinion that the interests of the Australian industry should be preferred to those of the industry conducted in the Mother Country. The Tariff Board sets out full y its reasons for recommending the rates under the general tariff now before the committee. formed.] I feel that I should make some reference to the strides which this industry has made under the protective tariff imposed by the present Government. In November, 1929, 274 hands were emjdoyed in this work; but by March, 1931, the industry accounted for the employment of 557 increase of 283 in a period of fourteen months. W it h the British rate again increased to 35 per cent., it is safe to assume that employment will still further increase. A considerable amount has been expended on buildings and plant in order to cater for the variety of glassware which the public demands, and the additional machinery required almost wholly manufactured in Australia. I hope that this amendment will be agreed to without delay.",81
363,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [2.59 a.m.]' - The Minister's statement was quite unconvincing to me, and for reasons which I gave when discussing the previous item I intend to vote against the imposition of increased duties ou the items now before the committee.

376,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.18 a.m.] move That the item be amended by adding the following:"" And on and after the 9th October, 1931423. Trophies won abroad and decorations medallions and certificates awarded or to be awarded and sent from abroad to individuals and trophies or prizes sent by donors resident abroad for presentation or competition in Australia, as prescribed by department by-laws, free.

In many cases the recipients were not in affluent circumstances. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 424-Vessel s trading intra-state moveor interstate.",87
377,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Balaclava) [3.19 a.m.]. 124:-This is the only charitable action of the Government in connection with the tariff schedule. It will give relief to those who receive presents from overseas; in many cases to poor migrants who would otherwise have to surrender the gift because of their inability to pay duty.,87
378,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [3.20 a.m.] - It is a very considerable time since the Tariff Board reported on this item. I suggest that move the Minister should consider resubmitting it to that body, especially with regard to the operation of the deferred duty - 225:",87
379,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.21 a.m.] There is a deferred duty, which dates from the 1st July, 1932, on vessels trading intra-state or interstate, or otherwise employed in Australian waters for any continuous period of three months. Before that duty is made operative the matter will be referred to the Tariff Board for public inquiry and report. As the board already has a long list of items to consider, I do not know when it will deal with this one. Item agreed to. Items 432 and 433 agreed to.",87
380,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia - Minister I for Trade and Customs) ['3.22 a.m.]- move That the following new item be added:"" 104.

The only alteration is in the duties on beeswax, which have been increased in the intermediate tariff from Id . to 3d. per lb., and in the general tariff from 1-Jd. to 4£d. per lb. Proposed new item agreed to.",87

The Tariff Board has recently inquired the into the question of increased duties on these goods, and the above are in conformity with its recommendation. Proposed new item agreed to.",87
382,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.24 a.m.] - I That the following new item be added:"" 225. By adding the following to item ' And on and after the Oth October, 1931225 (A ) French Chalk and other preparations of Steatite, n.e.i., ad val., British, 20 per cent.; intermediate, 20 per cent.; general, 30 per cent.

(c) Crayons and Pastels including Solid Lead Pencils; Chalks, n.e.i., ad val., British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.'"". The only alteration to this item is an increase in the duties ou school chalks from 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent, to 50 per cent., 55 per. cent., and 60 per cent. In 192S, the Tariff Board exhaustively inquired into the matter of duties on school chalks and recommended these rates. The report of the hoard has been printed and circulated to honourable members, and gives full information on the subject. It indicates that the T a r i ff Board was satisfied that an excellent case was made out for the imposition of these duties, also that the local plant is efficient and capable of supplying Australian requirements. Both the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) are interested in the matter, and urged that this should be included in the schedule as a new item.",87
383,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Warringah) [3.25 a.m'.] - Thes e duties are far too high. I want it to be understood because I do not divide the committee on the item that I agree with the duties.,88
384,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [3.26 a.m.] - I also register my protest against these high duties, and against new items such as this being introduced at this hour.",88
385,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Maribyrnong) [3.27 a.m.] - Althoug h this item does not affect my constituency, I happened, at the time the Massy Greene tariff was before Parliament, to take an interest in the subject, and was apj>ealed to by the manufacturers of these chalks to lend them my support. This is an all-Australian material equal to any that can be imported. It also has the virtue of being cheaper that the foreign article. Proposed new item agreed to.",88
386,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.28 a.m.] - I move That the following new item be added:""240. By adding to sub-item (B) of item 240' And on and after the Oth October, 1031240 (B ) (1) Electrical insulating sheets, (2) Tiles, n.e.i.; Sheets, n.e.i. and n.e.i., composed wholly or in chief value of cement and asbestos, including articles of reinforced cement, ad val., British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.'"". The amendment imposes an increased duty of 10 per cent, on electrical insulating sheets, composed of asbestos and cement, or of similar materials. This action has been taken in accordance with a recommendation. by the Tariff Board.",88
387,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [3.29 a.m.] - This item does.not appear in the schedule, and I object to it being brought down at this extraordinary hour by the Minister. I have here a long statement with regard to tiles.",88
388,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The item has nothing to do with roofing tiles.,88
389,Mr ARCHDALE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"PARKHILL - I am aware of that, but it has a lot to do with tiles that are used for kitchens. I protest against this item, because it excludes - almost all tiles excepting those with the limited number of patterns manufactured in Australia. The better class of tile which although not made here, is in great demand, should not be excluded. I realise that it is useless to protest in this chamber, but in another place I hope that an alteration will be made. Proposed new item agreed to.",88
390,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.31 a.m.] I move That the following new item be added:"" 250.

It will be seen that the protection proposed is over 100 per cent. Moreover, as the various State Governments have given preference to Australian products, government architects have varied their specifications to permit of the odd sizes of slates made in New South Wales being used in government buildings, thus enabling large quantities of the local product to be utilized. One company interested in roofing slates bas stated that with the present duty and the existing production costs, it could 3ell slates at a figure very much below that of the imported article, and still make a profit of 20 per cent.",88

392,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am prepared to give the Minister the name if necessary. I protest against the duty, because I believe that the natural protection to this industry is sufficient.",89

A deputation waited on me, and the honourable member for Balaclava also interviewed me in regard to this matter. I have gone into the question with the officers of the department, but am not yet in a position to make a definite recommendation. I , therefore, cannot agree to the honourable member's request for a recommittal of the item.",89
397,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Balaclava) [3.40 a.m.]. - by leave-Many of the seed merchants throughout Australia who have written to the Minister about this matter are perturbed because they have not received a reply. Seed known as rape has been included in item 91 B, which covers canary seed ,and food for birds. The merchants claim that that was clue to an inadvertence, and that an alteration could easily be made. Mr SPEAKER .(Hon. Norman Makin). - The commodity mentioned by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) is not contained in any item in the schedule before us. .The honourable member is not empowered to move a new item; he may only amend an item that is actually in the schedule.

401,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.50 a.m.] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The measure follows the usual lines of a Tariff Bill. It imposes the duties set oui in the schedule which has just been dealt with by this House, as from the 27th March, 1931, the date on which the consolidated resolution was introduced. Clause 5 - validates the collection of duty in accordance with the various resolutions which have been tabled since November, 1929. Clause 7 contains the usual provision concerning rates which are higher in the existing tariff', 1921-30, than in any of the resolutions. In such cases the higher rates are collected on deposit, and eventually paid into revenue, no refunds being allowed. Clauses 8 aud 9 are formal, dealing with existing trade agreements and deferred duties. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or dfbate; report adopted. THIRD READING. Motion (by Mr Forde) proposed - That the bill be now read a third time.",90
402,Mr SCULLIN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Yarra-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.52 a.m.] - I am very pleased with the expedition which has been . shown in the later portion of the discussion of the tariff schedule. 1 hope that the bill now before the House will have an equally favourable passage through the Senate. As Leader of the Government I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) on the manner in which he has handled the long and complicated tariff schedule. I have never known a Minister show greater application and skill in steering a tariff measure through Parliament.,91
403,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Maribyrnong) [3.53 industry a.m.] - Howeve r our opinions may differ in regard to the merits of the tariff schedule, honourable members on both sides are ready to give liberal praise the Minister for Trade and Customs for the manner in which he lifts handled it. Fie has shown remarkable industry considerable capacity, and has proved fitness to do thoroughly and successfully a very intricate task. I heartily congratulate him upon the result of his endeavours. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [3.54 a.m.] desire to associate myself with remarks of the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton). Representing a large industrial electorate, I have had to trouble the Mincharacter ister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) in regard to scores of items, and I take this opportunity to express my sincere tion. appreciation of the industry he has displayed, and the earnestness with which he has discharged a heavy responsibility. I am sure that I shall express the views of all honourable members also if I testify to the able and zealous assistance rendered., not only to the Minister, but to a\\ of us by the officers of the Trade aud Customs Department. They have worked night and day for many months, and I have received from them, as I am sure other honourable members have, a great deal of help and advice.",91
404,Mr HAWKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Wakefield) [3.55 a.m.] - I have not seen other Ministers for Trade and Customs handle tariff schedules in Parliament, but. I readily admit the great industry which this young priest of high protection, the present Minister, has shown in piloting through the committee a tariff of abominations. He resorted to every parliamentary device, disciplined his supporters, and did not hesitate at times to use almost brute force to overcome the opposition of a tired committee. The Minister undoubtedly showed great application and considerable good temper, and as an opponent of the duties he proposed, I gladly acknowledge the ability with which he performed his allotted task.",91
405,Mr GABB,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Angas) [3.56 a.m.] - I , too, give to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) full credit for his and patience, but I do not share his optimism as to. the effects which the increased duties will have. I cannot believe that the tariff will put an end to to depression, unemployment, and gloom. The schedule is about to leave this chamber for the time being, but I hope that it and will be returned by the Senate with his requests for the removal of many of the anomalies and burdensome duties.",91
406,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Warringah) [3.58 a.m.] - I extend to the - I Minister my congratulations upon the the way in which he has handled the tariff schedule. I fought many of the items vigorously and consistently, but I have not reflected upon the Minister's or questioned his probity in any way. If ever I seemed to do so, I assure the Minister that that was not my intenI compliment him upon the industry and skill he has displayed throughout a long and wearying debate, und upon the patience and courtesy which he has extended to honourable members. He did exceedingly well.",91
407,Mr R GREEN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Richmond) [3.59 a.m.] - The party to which I belong dissents entirely from the general fiscal principles enunciated by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and embodied in the tariff schedule. Wo do not hold out any hope that the backyard industries which have been established and have nourished since the tariff policy of this Government was put into operation will*continue after a change of Government has taken place. We have no quarrel whatever with regard to the granting of reasonable protection' to the natural industries of Australia. Simply because some persons say that they can manufacture certain goods in Australia we do not believe that they should be granted all the protection that they desire. We think it necessary that all manufacturing should be done on a commercial basis. We do not stand for the absurd duties which have been included in this schedule. We believe that after a new government is returned-a n event which I am sure will occur before very long-ther e will be a considerable reduction in the number of these recently established backyard and .exotic industries.",92
408,Mr LATHAM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Kooyong) [4.2 a.m.] I anticipate that, the House will have another opportunity to deal with a number of the items in this schedule in respect of which some important changes may be made, and I shall reserve my observations until that event happens.",92
409,Mr WHITE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Balaclava) [4.3 a.m.] I do not know that there was any need to throw bouquets at the Minister, but the Prime Minister set the example. He said that this was the most stupendous tariff schedule that a Minister had ever had to handle in this House. It is my first experience of a general tariff debate, and it leads me to say that I believe that if this business had been handled by a commission of business men charged with the duty of determining what duties should be imposed, the work would have been done more expeditiously and equitably. The discussion in this House has involved the printing of reams of paper in Hansard, and has caused many honourable members to discuss numerous subjects about which they knew very ""little. No doubt from the point of view of his party, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) has been a most valuable member, and has clone his work most efficiently. Personally I have had every courtesy shown to me.  1I have been silent for a considerable time, but I cannot congratulate the Government in any sense upon having succeeded in securing the consent of a majority of honourable members to the passage of this bill. The blood of this tariff will be on the hands of the Government. The schedule has been bludgeoned through the House.",92
410,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member is not in order in using that expression.  tary, I withdraw it and apologize. Perhaps it would be plainer to say that this bill has been forced through because it gives expression to the policy of the Government. But. that policy has been carried out against, the advice of the best economic and scientific brains in this country. The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it. The principal industries of this country are languishing and perishing. Secretariats of competent experts have ;id vised the Government on ways and means of insuring equality of sacrifice by all sections of the community in this time of depression, but the Government has not accepted the advice tendered to it, nor has it adopted a policy which has involved all sections of the community in equal sacrifices. It has heaped burdens on one section of the people, but has refused to allow another section to suffer any hardships. The members of the Government have' talked a lot about the primary producer.;, and have shed crocodile tears in sympathy with them; yet this tariff must inevitably lay heavy burdens upon these very people. Not one item of the tariff schedule has been passed with my blessing. I believe that these duties will be a curse to the country. I hope that the members of another place will make such drastic alterations to the schedule that it may be possible to remedy some of the evils that the Government has created. In consequence of this tariff, monopolies have been built up in some industries, while other industries have been allowed to languish, with the result that there is extensive unemployment throughout the Commonwealth. This, I nm persuaded, is the effect of this tariff. believe that no good whatever can follow from the passage of this bill, 1 cannot congratulate the Government upou having forced it through the House. have remained silent during the discussion of most of the tariff items because of the f u t i l it y of arguing against the Government majority; hut I hope that the members of another place will speak in no uncertain voice, and that they will do something to remedy the present state of affairs.",92
411,Mr FORDE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.8 a.m.],- 1 thank tbo Prime Minister and honourable members on both sides of the chamber for the congratulatory remarks they have made regarding my work in piloting this bill through this House. It is pleasing and encouraging to know that although at times feeling runs high during a debate, honorablo members of all parties can show friendly sentiment towards a Minister, notwithstanding that, on occasions, he has bad to reply sharply to statements that have been made. I am sincerely grateful for what has been said, and I reciprocate their sentiments. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the wonderfully good work that has been done by the ' officers of the Trade and Customs Department in preparing this schedule, and in making the research that has been neoessary in connection with many of the items. The work has been stupendous, and has placed a greatly increased burden upon a very efficient band of officers. I am satisfied that it would not be possible to find a more efficient staff anywhere in the world, and I have great pleasure in recording my appreciation of their services. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. HOU R OF MEETING . Motion (by Mr SCUIXIN ) agreed toThat the House at its rising adjourn until 2.,10 p.m. this day.
