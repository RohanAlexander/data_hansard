1,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Parishioners of Saint Agnes' Catholic Church, Highett Vic. 3190, draws to the attention of the 'House' that the existing Marriage Act, should be kept intact. We therefore ask the 'House' : To consider our position on the meaning of marriage. Given the variety of domestic arrangements available in Australia, we request that you protect the unique institution of marriage as traditionally understood and actually lived as the complementary love between a man and a woman. from one citizen Public Holidays To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House that:  The Fair Work Act does not recognise Easter Sunday as a public holiday in the National Employment Standards. It does recognise Good Friday and Easter Monday.  Easter Sunday is a day of great significance for the 64% of Australians who identify as Christian and the 30% of Australians estimated to attend Easter Sunday Church services.  Easter Sunday is part of a recognised holiday break for all Australian people, Christian or not.  With the exception of Victoria, all mainland Australian States, as well as New Zealand, recognise the significance of Easter Sunday and require shops to close.  Indeed, the significance of Easter Sunday is widely recognised throughout the Western world by the fact that shops must close on this day in London, Paris, Rome, Milan and Montreal.  The Parliament of NSW unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday. We therefore ask the House to: Marriage Amend the Fair Work Act 2009 so as to include, in the National Employment Standards, Easter Sunday in the list of recognised public holidays. from 545 citizens Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Guardian Pharmacy To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the Citizens of New South Wales and Citizens of all other States and Territories in Australia draws to the attention of the House that the domestic travelling and working community of Sydney Domestic Airport, does not have reasonable access to the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits by an approved pharmacist at the Sydney Domestic Airport. Airport Guardian Pharmacy which is located at Sydney Domestic Terminal 2 has operated as a Non-PBS Pharmacy since December 2006 and has cared for this draws Community of over 12 million people annually, despite not being able to provide medicines which are subsidised by the Commonwealth Government. A Section 90 approval has been denied to this pharmacy twice, due to the current pharmacy location rules criteria. We therefore ask the House to give the domestic travelling and working Community of Sydney Domestic Airport reasonable access to the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits by requesting that the Minister for Health exercise Ministerial Discretion so as to provide a Section 90 approval to Airport Guardian. Pharmacy, Sydney Domestic, Terminal 2. from 560 citizens To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This Petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our concerns about the behaviour of the State of Israel, most recently demonstrated but not restricted to Operation Cast Lead and attacks on human rights activists endeavouring to deliver aid to Gaza. We therefore ask the House to ensure that the government takes more strident action in international arenas such as the United Nations in an effort to curtail the disproportionate use of violence by the State of Israel against the Palestinian people and those endeavouring to support them in a non violent manner in the occupied territories. We also ask that the House consider to resolve that, until Israel complies with numerous UN Resolutions as well as rulings of the World Court (relative to the illegal wall) and declares any nuclear weapons open to inspection to relevant international authorities, that the government  Desist from negotiating/signing contracts for goods and services emanating from Israel and its illegally occupied territories.  Desist from conducting joint exercises with Israeli Armed Forces  Desist from undertaking cultural and trade visits to Israel from 63 citizens Ballarat Electorate: Mobile Phone To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the citizens located in the state of Victoria, draws to the attention of the house the lack of telecommunications services in the region of the Hepburn shire and surrounding districts as described on the petition pages enclosed. We therefore ask the House to investigate and support the push for better telecommunications services throughout this area. We invite any member of parliament to come and investigate the inadequate services currently available. In 2008 the surrounding communities were subjected to 4 days of bushfires which engulfed Israel thousands of hectares of bush land and farmlands, throughout this time power was cut for long periods of time, Mobile phone coverage was not available and most people who had hands free phones were unable to use them due to power outages. In a time where we live in a technological world it seems bizarre that a community that is located in such a high fire danger area has these problems, I believe the last thing any government state or federal would want is another Marysville disaster. Please help us with this issue before the next fire season is upon us. from one citizen Merit Protection Commissioner To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of a citizen of Australia: draws to the attention of the House of Representatives that his application for a Secondary Review of Actions by the Merit Protection Commissioner, submitted through the Secretary of Commonwealth Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) on 14/11/2010, is yet to receive a response. APSC has recently informed that the application was not forwarded to them. The application requested the Commissioner, among other issues, to review:  whether the merit selection criteria of Finance have deviated significantly from the merit principles outlined in Section 10 (2) (b) and (c) of the Public Service Act 1999 (PS Act), Services which may be promoting discrimination and cronyism, instead of merit; and  whether those criteria may have failed to accommodate the workplace diversity and fair and flexible workplace APS values in the sections 10(1) (c) and 10(1) (j) of the PS Act. I ask the House to take all necessary steps to ensure that:  no public servant be denied his or her right to seek and get a fair Secondary Review of Actions by the Merit Protection Commissioner;  the Finance merit selection criteria and processes are consistent with the PS Act; and  I am protected from any kind of retributions for submitting this petition. I also ask the House to consider whether an arms-length truly independent Public Service Commission drawn from outside the public service would serve Australia better and fairer. from one citizen Petitions received.

2,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Breast Screening Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2011 regarding the petition to return mobile breast screen services to New South Wales. In accordance with Standing Order 209 (b), I am providing a written response to you on the matter raised in the petition. The Australian Government recognises that breast cancer is a serious public health concern for all Australians. Accordingly, in partnership with the state and territory governments, it supports efforts through BreastScreen Australia to achieve significant reductions in breast cancer mortality. BreastScreen Australia is co-funded by the Australian and state and territory governments. The Australian Government provides policy formulation, national data collection, quality control, monitoring and evaluation BreastScreen Australia. Funding for BreastScreen Australia is provided to states and territories through the National Healthcare Agreements, under which jurisdictions plan and implement service delivery at the local level. Currently, breast screening services across New South Wales are provided through a combination of fixed sites and mobile screening units. The location and mode of service delivery for breast screening services in New South Wales are decisions of BreastScreen NSW and the New South Wales Government. Therefore, the citizens of this petition may wish to raise their concerns formally with the New South Wales Minister for Health, the Hon Jillian Skinner MP. Minister Skinner's details are as follows, the Hon Jillian Skinner MP, Minister for Health, Level 31, Governor Macquarie Tower, 1 Farrer Place, Sydney NSW 2000. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Aged Care Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2011 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, regarding the petition 366-647 made to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the matter of aged care funding, I am responding as the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing. I have enclosed a formal response to the subject petition for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I appreciate you bringing the contents of the petition to the Australian Government's attention and trust that the attached information assists the House in responding. Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the inadequacy of the proposed 1.7 per cent increase in funding for aged care services from July 1, 2010. Aged care providers should not be forced to cut vital services in order to meet a government funding shortfall which fails to address the rising of cost of staff salaries along with general amenities such as electricity, gas and water. We therefore ask the House to support an increase in funding for aged care services to better reflect the increased costs faced by aged care providers. Response: The Australian Government is committed to a sustainable aged care sector so that frail older people can continue to receive the quality care that they deserve. This is why it has increased the level of funding provided for aged care by more than 30 per cent over the last three years. A total of $48.7 billion will be provided for aged care over the next four years. This financial year, the Australian Government will provide $10.9 billion for aged care, including $7.5 billion for residential aged care. On average, the Government will pay residential aged care providers $44,700 to care for each resident this year. Providers also derive income from residents, who will contribute, on average, $22,000 this year on top of the Government's payment. These amounts represent a substantial increase on previous years. The income that providers earn in respect of each resident has increased over the last three years more than 6 per cent per year. By contrast, average wages in residential aged care increased by less than 4 per cent per annum and the Consumer Price Index rose by an average of 3 per cent per year over the same period. That is, over at least the last three years the rate of growth revenue for residential aged care providers, on a per resident basis, has exceeded the increases in their costs experienced. The Government does recognise, however, that the aged care industry is facing challenges. That is why it asked the Productivity Commission to examine all aspects of Australia's aged care system, and to develop detailed options to ensure that Australia's aged care system can meet the challenges facing it in coming decades. The Final Report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry is due to be given to the Government in June 2011. from the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler Forgotten Australians Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2011 about a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions seeking an inquiry into child abuse and neglect of the Forgotten Australians. The petition suggests that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care (2004), did not uphold all of its stated terms of reference. Specifically, it argues that the Committee did not fully investigate all problems and cases of child neglect and that this omission has impacted the capacity for victims of childhood abuse while in institutional care to access legal redress. The petition calls for Members of the House of Representatives to open an inquiry which will allow all evidence of child neglect, institutional neglect or other agency neglect to be brought to an inquiry, or other government body's attention, and provide feedback to the Australian Government. The Terms of Reference for the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care referred a range of issues to the Committee. by These include investigations regarding the existence, severity and estimated scale of any unsafe, improper or unlawful care or treatment of children in any government or non-government institutions and fostering practices, established under legislation to provide care and/or education in of children. The Terms of Reference also directed the Committee to make recommendations where cases of unsafe, improper or unlawful care or treatment of children had occurred. Consistent with its Terms of Reference, the Committee emphasised that during its examination of the experiences of children in institutional care, the Committee could not deliberate on cases of particular individuals that were under consideration by courts, tribunals or other bodies which may grant some remedy to those individuals. The Terms of Reference also specified that while the Committee would hear the details of individual cases, it would only use these cases to build a picture of institutional life to assist in the identification of systemic remedies. The Committee noted that it could not delegate the Australian or state parliaments to adopt its remedies or make recommendations that were binding on other jurisdictions. The Committee delivered its first report, Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children, on 30 August 2004. The previous government tabled its response, addressing each of the 39 recommendations, on 10 November 2005. On 18 September 2008, the Community Affairs References Committee commenced an inquiry into the implementation of the recommendations from earlier reports: Lost Innocents: Righting the Record - Report on child migration (2001), and Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children (2004). The Terms of Reference did not provide scope for the Committee to reopen the broad range of issues that were covered in the earlier reports. The Committee considered 64 public submissions and 13 confidential submissions. It heard evidence during five days of public hearings held in Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra, and evidence was also taken by teleconference from Tasmania and South Australia. Consistent with the Terms of Reference of the previous inquiries, the Committee did not report on the circumstances and experiences of individuals. The Committee delivered its report, Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians Revisited: Report on the progress with the implementation of the recommendations of the Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians Reports, on 25 June 2009. The Committee concluded that, despite progress, many of the recommendations of the Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians reports were still to be implemented. The Committee noted that, with the benefit of experience since the original reports were tabled, a number of the recommendations needed revision to achieve the desired outcomes for care leavers. Since the tabling of the Committee's report in 2009, the Australian Government has prioritised its commitment to supporting Forgotten Australians and former child migrants. On 16 November 2009, the former Prime Minister, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, delivered an apology to Forgotten Australians and former child migrants on behalf of the nation. This apology, for the first time, provided national and international acknowledgement of a period in our nation's history where the most vulnerable of our children did not receive the care they deserved. The Apology recognised the pain and suffering experienced by so many children while in out-of-home care and throughout their lives. The Apology formed a significant part of the Government's response to the Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians Revisited report. This response included a number of new initiatives and investments to significantly improve support for care leavers. The key initiative to improve the support provided to care leavers is the development of a new national Find and Connect Service through an investment of $26.5 million over four years. This service will provide specialist support to care leavers to help them locate personal and family history files and assist them to reunite with members of their families where that is possible. The service will provide a national database that will collate and index existing government and past provider records into a national searchable database, accessible to state and other care leaver services and also directly accessible to care leavers themselves. The Government also advised that it would identify care leavers as a special needs group for aged care purposes. Following the National Apology, the Allocation Principles 1997 under the Aged Care Act 1997 were amended, effective from 1 December 2009, to include `care leavers' as a special needs group under aged care legislation. This means that aged care providers are able to identify Forgotten Australians and former child migrants as a priority group when they apply for aged care support or placement through the Department of Health and Ageing. The Department of Health and Ageing is also developing education materials to assist organisations and carers in the aged care sector to recognise the special needs of care leavers. This will assist their efforts to provide appropriate and responsive care to care leavers. The Government also committed ongoing funding for the Alliance for Forgotten Australians, the Care Leavers Australia Network and the Child Migrants Trust. This funding ensures care leavers have support and strong advocacy that enables them to contribute to public policy and service development. Finally, to ensure that this chapter in our history is remembered, the Government has provided $2.9 million for history projects with the National Library of Australia and the National Museum of Australia. These projects are recording people's experiences of institutional and out-of-home care over the last century. The National Library has already published a number of interviews with Forgotten Australians and former child migrants. The National Museum of Australia is developing an exhibition about the history of institutionalised care of children which will be launched in November 2011. There is a joint website at www.forgottenaustralianshistory.gov.au for these two national history projects. Thank you again for providing me with the opportunity to comment on this petition. The Government will continue to prioritise its support to Forgotten Australians and former child migrants to ensure they can locate their records, search and find their identities and families where possible and reunite with their relatives where desired, and be supported in their healing through specialist counselling services. from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin Australia Post: Darch Dear Mr Murphy Petition-Australia Post Shop at Darch, Western Australia Thank you for your letter dated 16 March 2011, concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding establishment of an Australia Post Shop at the Darch Plaza Shopping Centre in Western Australia. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-today running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australian Post has advised that in determining whether additional retail postal outlets are justified, it takes a number of factors including the location and viability of existing outlets and the volume of business likely to be transacted. The Corporation also has a national Community Service Obligation performance standard that in metropolitan areas at least 90 per cent of residences should be within 2.5 kilometres of a retail outlet. Australia Post has reviewed the distribution of postal outlets in the general area around Darch. I understand that there are two retail postal outlets in the area: the Kingsway Licensed Post Office (LPO) is less than 2.5 kilometres from Darch and the Alexander Heights LPO less than 1.5 kilometres distance. Australia Post has noted its concern at the potential impact of a new outlet on the viability of the existing outlets in the area. Australia Post is unable to support the request for an additional postal outlet at this stage. However, it will continue to monitor its facilities in the area to ensure it is meeting the requirements of the local community. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy Child Sex Trafficking Dear Murphy Thank you for your letter of 30 March 2011 referring to petition 434-725, submitted for consideration to the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding support for programs to prevent child sexual exploitation in our region. In the accordance with Standing Order 209 (b), my response is as follows. The first request in the petition, to fund an ongoing education campaign and support service which helps Australians to identify and report suspicions or concerns about child sex offenders who travel overseas, is a domestic matter and falls under the responsibility of the Minister for Home Affairs and Justice, the Hon Brendan O'Connor MP. I understand officials from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) have already contacted the Committee Secretariat to ensure you also refer this petition to into account Minister O'Connor. The second request in the petition, to fund community-based international development programs which focus on the prevention of and protection against forms of child sexual exploitation such as child sex trafficking and child sex tourism, falls under my responsibility. Australia has been a long-standing and consistent supporter of efforts to combat child sex trafficking and child sex tourism in our region. The Government is committed to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the reduction of poverty. By focusing on these key development priorities, Australia is helping to address the underlying causes of sex trafficking of children and young people and child exploitation. This is essential for a sustainable, long-term approach that aims to prevent people from becoming victims in the first place. AusAID, in partnership with other agencies, also supports a number of activities to directly combat people trafficking, labour exploitation and child sexual exploitation. The focus of the aid program's efforts is to strengthen criminal justice systems and law enforcement, and prevent child trafficking through education and awarenessraising in source communities. AusAID has recently commenced a program specifically to combat child sex tourism. Project Childhood is a four year, S7.5 million program to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the Mekong sub-region. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is implementing a Protection Pillar, strengthening law enforcement capacity to combat child sex tourism, working with Interpol and assisted by the Australian Federal Police. The Prevention Pillar, implemented by World Vision Australia, builds resilience and awareness in communities and works with partner governments to improve preventive measures, including reporting hotlines. This program builds on the AusAID-funded Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 5-year Transition Plan for a Sustainable Response to Child Sex Tourism in South East Asia ($0.5m; 2007-2009), facilitated by the Australian charity Child Wise. AusAID has supported successive projects in the ASEAN region since 1994 to raise awareness of child sex tourism, gain support and commitment for child protection within the tourism sector and build tourism capacity to combat child sex tourism in ASEAN member countries. AusAID has a significant partnership through the aid program with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) which includes the protection of children from violence, exploitation and abuse. Thank you for notifying me of this petition. I trust that this information will be of assistance to the Committee. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd Gippsland: Princes Highway Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter dated 29 March 2011 about a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding Princes Highway funding. I have corresponded with Mr Darren Chester MP on this matter a number of times during. the course of 2008-10, highlighting the substantial financial assistance to State and Local Governments to manage and maintain the roads under their care. This funding is part of the Australian Government's $6.9 billion investment in land transport infrastructure in Victoria over the six year period, 2009-10 to 2013-14. The Australian Government has committed $140 million towards the duplication of the Princes Highway East between Traralgon and Sale, which will boost freight capacity, reduce travel times and improve road safety. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Albanese Alpine National Park Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 30 March 2011 concerning the submission of a petition regarding cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park. I regret the delay in responding. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) protects matters of national environmental significance, including National Heritage places, threatened species and ecological communities, among others. The Alpine National Park is a part of the Australian Alps National Park and Reserves National Heritage Listed Place and also contains a number of threatened species and ecological communities listed under the EPBC Act. I must meet my statutory responsibilities under the EPBC Act to protect matters of national environment significance. In addition to my statutory responsibilities, I believe cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park sets a dangerous precedent for the management of National Parks across Australia. This move represented an extraordinary backward step in protection in a National Park. I note that the former Victorian Government removed cattle from the Alpine National Park some years ago as a result of concerns over their environmental impact. The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment did not notify my department or refer the cattle grazing for assessment and approval under the EPBC Act prior to the re-introduction of cattle to the Alpine National Park. The department has undertaken a compliance review to evaluate the risks posed by cattle grazing to the environment in the Alpine National Park. I personally inspected cattle damage to areas of the Alpine National Park with officers of the department on 25 February 2011 as a part of that review. Based on the results of the review I was not satisfied with the risks posed to matters of national environmental significance and I formally requested that the cattle be removed from the Alpine National Park by 8 April 2011. I am advised that the cattle have now been removed from the park. I am also aware that Mr Bandt has introduced the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Abolition Of Alpine Grazing) Bill 2011 in relation to grazing in the Alpine National Park. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke Statements",21
3,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," From time to time the Standing Committee on Petitions follows up on some petitions that have been presented to the House by examining them at round-table meetings. The committee also follows up on the government's response to some petitions at the hearings it holds with relevant public servants here in Parliament House. Last week the committee had an unusual opportunity to follow up a petition and the ministerial response with participation from both a petitioner and the relevant Public Service representatives. I mention this petition not because it has the greatest number of signatures, although it had more than 8,000 signatures, or because it has much greater merit than the many other petitions that the committee sees. The committee does not seek to make these value judgments. In its way the petition itself was typical of some petitions and the questions they raise, but it was unusual to have the advocate and government experts available together. The petition, like many that come before the House, was about an international issue that concerns many Australians and prompts them to act, to coordinate their efforts and to call for action here. Questions that often follow the raising of an issue of global concern, such as this one, are: is there any solution to a problem such as this and what is the appropriate role for any government in the circumstances? Needless to say, there are different views. The subject matter of this petition was the use of the worse forms of child labour in producing cocoa in West Africa and an agreement in 2001 by major industry groups to take a number of steps, including developing voluntary standards, to grow and process cocoa beans and products in such a way as to comply with the International Labour Organisation's Convention 182. That convention seeks to eliminate the worse forms of child labour. Some major companies in the cocoa and chocolate industry have met the standards, at least for some of their products. One aim of that 2001 agreement was, by 2005, to label products to confirm that goods have been produced free from the worse forms of child labour. The petition that the Petitions Committee considered called for a deadline to be imposed on the importation of goods to Australia that are not certified as being produced in this way. It was useful the committee to draw out the history of the use of child labour in producing cocoa in West Africa, which dates back to the lowering of farm incomes in West African countries in the 1990s. The sad result has been the involvement of thousands of children, working in unhealthy and dangerous conditions without access to education or health care. Naturally, this is not something any of us wants to think about when we enjoy eating cocoa and cocoa products. The petitioner told the committee that the end objective was to ensure that farmers are paid a reasonable price. This would be expected to enable them to let their children attend school. The minister's response to the petition had been received the committee and published so that the petitioners were aware of the government's views on the issue. From the committee's perspective it was valuable to hear from the representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about Australia's international commitments to end child exploitation, and how those commitments connect with the request made in this petition. The representatives confirmed the grave concern with which child exploitation is regarded and also referred to the broader context: the eradication and whether compulsory certification of products is the most effective way of reducing poverty. It was also useful for us to find out what prompted the petitioners to use the petitions process to promote their cause. In this instance, the committee was told that the revised petitioning process, in which petitions are likely to receive a formal response, was a factor. I am not sure how satisfied the petitioners might have been with the information they received, but certainly the committee was pleased to speak to their representatives and to have the petitioners observe the discussion, as well as the for subsequent one we held with the department officials. It was an interesting and thoughtprovoking discussion, thanks to the preparations of the petitioners' representative and the department's representatives. The international focus at the hearing was continued when the committee asked representatives of AusAID about a petition on the level of Australia's foreign aid and the minister's response. The petition called for a substantial increase in Australia's official development assistance to raise it to 0.7 per cent of Australia's gross national income and the bring it into line with the United Nations goals. The minister has stated that the government is committed to increasing aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by by 2015-16 and, after that, as economic and fiscal conditions permit, to progressively increase it to 0.7 per cent of gross national income. The hearing gave the committee an opportunity to discuss the petition itself and Australia's objectives in its development assistance commitments. The committee was also able to follow up the minister's response regarding commitments towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by the deadline of 2015, in particular on Australia's contribution so far to achieving the targets. A transcript of the relevant segments of the hearing will later be sent to the principal petitioner associated with each of the petitions and will be available on the committee's website. Finally, from a Petitions Committee perspective we would be very pleased if petitioners were able to have issues they have raised resolved-but, clearly, in the majority of cases that does not happen. The certain value that we see in the process arises from the fact that the House, through the committee, ensures that issues are raised and that the responses from the government are received and made public. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Reference to Main Committee",26
4,The SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"In accordance with standing order 41(g), and the determinations of the Selection Committee, I present copies of the terms of motions for which notice has been given by that e members for Fowler, Solomon, Macquarie, Fremantle, Pearce, Dawson, Chisholm, Gippsland, Werriwa, Flinders and Fraser. These items will be considered in the Main Committee later today. Asylum Seekers",28
5,Mr BANDT,PETITIONS," move: That this House: (1) condemns the Gillard Government's deal Malaysia that would see 800 asylum seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to Malaysia; and (2) calls on the Government to immediately abandon this proposal. The government's deal to expel asylum seekers from Australia to Malaysia is wrong and should be condemned by this parliament. The deal, like the now-defunct East Timor plan, is a rushed political fix designed to paper over the failure of the government and the opposition's mandatory detention policy. The deal will mean asylum seekers are expelled to Malaysia. The deal violates Australia's international obligations and is abuse of human rights. That is why today I am moving a motion that is also being moved and supported in the Senate. The motion reads that this House: 'condemns the Gillard Government's deal with Malaysia that would see 800 asylum seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to Malaysia; and … calls on the Government to immediately abandon this proposal.' I understand the significance of moving this motion, and I have not taken the decision to do so lightly. If passed, this motion will mean that for the first time in the life of this parliament both houses of parliament will have condemned a government policy. The government will need to take this matter very seriously because it will have received a very clear message from parliament rejecting the Malaysia deal and a very strong request that the deal be abandoned. We all know why we are at this low point in this country's treatment of asylum seekers and refugees. For more than a decade we have had a political race to the bottom between the old parties, as they have chased I votes that they think exist in certain marginal seats around the country. On the one side you have the coalition, the party of razor with wire and children overboard, peddling fear and stoking resentment in the community; and on the other you have Labor, the party of mandatory detention, promising a new direction at the election but then again giving into fear and refusing to lead public opinion on this issue. It is almost like the old parties are locked in an arms race on refugees, competing to be tough and lacking in compassion. So now, instead of winding back mandatory detention, we have a government expanding offshore detention and now adopting the Howard government policy, so roundly condemned, of expelling asylum seekers to another country-a an country that has not signed the convention on refugees, a country that has a history of caning asylum seekers and engaging in other abuses of human rights and a country that has not yet guaranteed any protections of the people which our government intends to expel there. Why do we sign up to international conventions if we are not going to abide by them? Why do we seek to contract out our obligations? We cannot send fairness offshore. It is for this reason that deal has been widely condemned, including by the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights when she visited Australia last week. The government will say that this deal is good because, in return for accepting those expelled, Malaysia will send others to Australia. Let me be clear that the Greens' position is that our humanitarian refugee intake should be significantly expanded. But an expansion of our refugee intake should not be bought at the violation of the rights of others or by swapping one person for another. Refugees and asylum seekers are human beings, not a card in a political game. It is a reflection of how low the political debate in this country has sunk that there is willingness in some quarters to accept this as a legitimate approach to immigration policy. I was elected by the people of Melbourne in part to bring a value of compassion and represent it in this parliament. My electorate of Melbourne thrives in part because of the decades of migrants and refugees who have chosen to settle there. The people of Melbourne do not give into the fear and hysteria promoted by the old parties. They value diversity and the multicultural community in which they live. They know that there is an alternative. We can do what happens in most parts of the world-that is, allowing people, regardless of how they come to this country, to seek asylum. Detention is a last resort, and even then should only be for the minimum possible period-a period of days, for health and security checks. The people of Melbourne also know that at a time when the country is facing a skills shortage and a mandatory detention bill of over $1 billion there are good economic reasons for a policy of fairness. I say to the members in this place that I know moving a motion condemning the this Malaysian deal is very confronting for the government and the passage of this motion will be a significant event in the life of this parliament. But there are times when, regardless of the implications, enough is enough. The Malaysia deal is wrong. It violates human rights and Australia's international obligations. It should be scrapped and I urge all members to add their voice to this call.",28

7,Mr WILKIE,PETITIONS," I second the motion. If someone comes to Australia seeking asylum we have a responsibility enshrined in the refugee convention, to which we are a signatory, to give them protection, to quickly assess their claim and to provide refuge if that claim is upheld. This legal responsibility applies regardless of how asylum seekers reach our shores and should be applied equally to those who arrive by boat as to those who come here by aeroplane. Our real responsibility goes much deeper than our legal obligation as a signatory to the refugee convention, because we also have a pressing moral obligation to render all possible assistance to asylum seekers in a genuine spirit of goodwill. It is regarding this moral obligation that the federal government is doing the wrong thing by planning on trading asylum seekers with Malaysia, so much so in fact that the Labor Party has now lost the moral superiority it once had regarding Australia's response to irregular immigration. This troubles me because the Labor Party's approach to asylum seekers was a not insignificant consideration some nine months ago when I was struggling with the decision of who to give limited support to in this place. Frankly, to establish a trade in people fleeing violence and persecution is an abomination. Yes, it may well help to deter asylum seekers from attempting the risky voyage to Australia, but it is wrong, so wrong in fact that I detest it even more the so-called Pacific solution engineered by the Howard government and still favoured by the opposition. At least on Nauru and Manus Island there were Australian officials to ensure that some safeguards were maintained. How on earth can conditions in Malaysia be tough enough to deter asylum seekers to Australia but safe enough for the Australian government to claim that refugees' human rights will be protected? They cannot. For a start Malaysia has not signed the refugee convention and nor has it ratified the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It has not even signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political inconsistent Rights. As the United Nations human rights commissioner has pointed out, any deal with Malaysia simply offers no protection if the refugee and torture conventions have not been ratified by that country. The government has a political problem, not an immigration problem. Rather than joining the opposition in singling out asylum seekers who arrive by boat for special punishment, the government should have the courage to inform the community about the facts. Asylum seekers are not breaking any rules. The majority are genuine refugees. And far from being swamped, the number of people arriving by boat in Australia is small compared with the much more worrying number of these overstayers arriving daily air. So I call again on the government and the opposition to stop, take a deep breath and focus instead on developing sophisticated responses to irregular immigration into Australia that much more effectively address the conditions in source, first asylum and transit countries. Remember, this is first and than foremost a humanitarian crisis and not a border protection problem. Australia receives just two per cent of the industrialised world's asylum claims. These are some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable human beings on the face of the planet. Let us not sacrifice the modest advances made in our treatment of asylum seekers in the last few years in the pursuit of political self interest. In particular, let us not start trading asylum seekers with a country that often treats such people as criminals, forcibly returns them to danger, routinely relies on the lash of the cane and even resorts to the barbaric death penalty. The bottom line is that this deal with Malaysia is a shameful public policy that is with our international obligations. It must be abandoned. That is why I have seconded the motion condemning the deal put forward by the member for Melbourne and that is why I will vote in support of it.",29
8,Ms OWENS,PETITIONS," The member for Denison talks about abomination. I start by saying that the abomination in the world at the moment is that there are some 50 million people who are displaced. Around 15 million of those people are already classified as refugees and of those only about one per cent will be resettled in a third country. So for every one that Australia takes, there are many hundreds that we do not. It is an abomination that by people make choices about who to assist and who not to assist. The best that decent people can do in a world like this is try to find answers that are less bad than the answers if we do not help at all. These are very real ethical issues in this, as both members who have already spoken would know, as we try to find answers that provide the most good and the least harm. Whatever we do in this particular circumstance does leave some people in real harm-many more than we actually help. The government has been talking to our neighbours about a regional solution for some time, and before the tragic events at Christmas Island that saw many people lose their lives. There is no doubt that another tragedy is inevitable if the boats keep coming. But stopping people making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat does require a genuine breakthrough. Much of the talk in the last year or so about people smuggling has centred around Indonesia, because that is where the boats usually come from. But Malaysia is the key. Most boat arrivals in Australia pay people smugglers about $15,000 to get to Australia. They fly to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and then start their boat journey, first to Indonesia and then on to Australia. So the logic of the Malaysian arrangement is actually very simply. Why would you pay a substantial amount of money and risk your life on a boat only to be returned to where you began your boat journey? I would expect that an announcement like this would come in for flak from both sides of the debate because, as I said, it is a problem where there is no perfect outcome and where, whatever a government does, there is room for criticism. There will always be a way to criticise. Frankly, if our politicians and the media are not mature enough to lift their commentary above mere criticism and consider the complexities of the world of refugees then it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the community at large to find a path through what are very difficult issues for us all. I am not going to accuse the member for Melbourne of chasing votes on thisalthough he has accused us of chasing votes on this-but I will say that the Greens supporters probably share a very similar position on this to his so it is easy and politically expedient to espouse the same view. In the interest of good government and not just good politics, it is incumbent upon those who criticise this deal to suggest an alternative that increases Australia's role in resettling refugees while breaking the business role of the people smugglers. Australia's role in resettling refugees, from my perspective, is perhaps one of the most important things that we do. Of the 50 million displaced people and 15 million people already classified as refugees, only one per cent are resettled in third countries. Australia is one of only about a dozen countries that resettle refugees from third countries and one of only three-the US, Canada and Australia-that do it on a reasonable scale. So we have a very important role to play in providing homes for people who really have nowhere else to go and are likely to spend many years in camps without the support of Australia. I am very pleased that, in the deal we have done with Malaysia, we are increasing the humanitarian intake from Malaysia by 4,000 people. Malaysia currently has around 92,000 people who are registered as refugees and in total around 270,000 displaced people living in the community. So Malaysia has a very large number of people. I am incredibly pleased to see that Australia is increasing its intake by 4,000. I would very much like to see a world in which we could concentrate more on that aspect of the important work that we do, particularly since we are one of the few countries that do that. I am glad to see us begin to change the debate towards the importance of that resettlement role for Australia by the taking of this additional 4,000 people.",30
9,Mr MORRISON,PETITIONS," I am not going to cast aspersions on other members of this House. This is an incredibly complex and difficult issue and we all have to make choices about how we think we are going to address it. So I would not for a second seek to question the motives or morals of anybody in this place in how they seek to approach this very difficult issue. I would also note that no-one would be happier than I if we could stop the boats. This is something I have campaigned for in this portfolio now for some years. It is not a slogan for the coalition; it was our record in government. For more than two years we have argued with this government that its policies are the reason we have seen this unprecedented rate of illegal boat arrivals to Australia. I now notice that the government finally agrees with us and has sought to change its policy because it knows it is the policies that are at fault in causing the that we now see. But this government does not understand that when you implement policy in this area you must think it through. This five for one people swap deal with Malaysia is a proposal conceived in denial and negotiated in desperation. Five for one speaks for itself. It was rushed out prior to the budget before it was finalised. Confusion still reigns over when it starts, who goes there and who does not. Confusion still reigns about who will decide who goes to Malaysia and the circumstances in which they go. The Prime Minister claims she is making the decision, but the Malaysian government says the opposite. It is quite clear that the Malaysian government will have a right of veto over who goes to their country under this arrangement, and the Prime Minister should be honest with the people about that. Confusion reigns about whether the 21 children and eight women who have arrived since 7 May will be sent to Malaysia. The Prime Minister should answer the question of whether she is going to send those women and children to Malaysia. Confusion continues to reign about the level of support and funding, almost $70 million of which will be paid to international agencies. We do not know what that will pay will for. Will it feed people? Will it send their kids to school and give them health But care? If it does any of those things, for how long will it do those things-the entire time they are there or just a little while? We do not have answers to any of the detail because this policy sits in a twilight zone of confusion which is characterised by the way the government deals with this issue and constantly fails to think things through. Irregular maritime arrivals will be held on Christmas Island indefinitely because this agreement has not yet been concluded and the government has no other agreement with any other country anywhere in the world to chaos send people. As a result, those who are arriving at Christmas Island are being held in indefinite detention in strict contradiction of the government's own stated and legislated detention values. The government has also failed to address our international obligations here, which others have noted. It is not enough just to get a commitment from Asia not to refoule, as is required under the UN convention on refugees. I understand that the government needs to get that requirement and I accept that they have received that undertaking from the Malaysia government. But what they have not got is an undertaking when it comes to the United Nations convention against torture. The Prime Minister's statement says that those sent to Malaysia will not receive preferential treatment to those who are already in Malaysia awaiting assessment of their asylum claims. There are laws in Malaysia-actual laws-permitting fines, imprisonment and whipping of people who illegally reside in Malaysia. That is the law in Malaysia. Unless this government has an absolutely rock-solid guarantee that these laws will not apply to people sent to Malaysia then clearly they can give no guarantee about the human rights and welfare of those sent. In fact, the complementary protection law, which was introduced into and passed this House last week and is now before the Senate, may even provide an opportunity for those who are coming by boat to seek asylum from the government's own transfer laws under its own new asylum laws that it introduced into this parliament. As a result, we will see this thing potentially being wholly unwound by the government's failure to think it through. Then there is the commitment that is required in terms of the act itself, which says that human rights need to be protected and that people also are provided protection while they await asylum claims in Malaysia. That is the requirement of our Migration Act, and I learnt in estimates that the government is seeking to work its way around that requirement in the Migration Act in order to send people to Malaysia without giving that undertaking. This deal just simply does not stack up at the end of the day, and the government has options in Nauru. They only have to pick up the phone. (Time expired) Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (10:30): I think that the contribution just made by the member for Cook and those of the members for Denison and Melbourne highlight the difficulties of these issues. probably best summed up in terms of the contribution the member for Mayo made the other day when talking about detention. He said that you cannot be tough and humane at the same time in relation to asylum seekers. On one side, we have the member for Cook telling us that we are not tough enough; on the other side, we have the contributions from the members for Melbourne and Denison telling us that we are not being humane enough. I believe we can be both tough and humane, and this Malaysian solution is an attempt to be both-humane in the way in which we treat asylum seekers in terms of the numbers of additional people that we will be bringing here as well as being tough in trying to break the people-smuggling model that is so insidious and terrible in the way in which it treats human beings. Let us not just take that from members of the government; let us actually have a look at what the UNHCR has said. We have had some rhetoric here about how bad this solution is, but that is does not stack up with what has been said by the experts in the area. Yante Ismail in the West Australian on 16 May, the UNHCR spokesman said: We don't see it in terms of a swap or a bargain ... We see this as a commitment by the Australian Government to provide resettlement for 4000 people in need of an opportunity to rebuild their lives safely. To us, it's a real commitment by Australia in burden-sharing with a country like Malaysia that is now coping with a large number of refugees and asylum seekers. We think the agreement has the potential to enhance the protection for refugees in Malaysia, as well as the region as a whole. If it realises more resettlement opportunities for refugees, this would be a positive outcome."" The member for Denison was the one who It is said that he found the swapping of people abhorrent. As I said, the UNHCR has said that they do not see it in those terms at all; they see it as a breakthrough in this area. We have to understand that with 92,000 registered refugees in Malaysia-270,000 there in total-we need to be doing our bit in making sure that we bring more people here. It is not just one isolated UNHCR spokesman; it is many. Adrian Edwards said: As we understand the MOU, Australia's obligations under the refugee convention are not compromised provided that the fundamental rights of asylum seekers and refugees are assured in Malaysia. Richard Towle, the UNHCR representative says: I think in that sense it has the potential a significant practical contribution to what we're trying to achieve in the region. And if it's a good experience other countries can look at it and say 'yes, that's a positive way of managing these issues. Perhaps we want to embark on similar or other initiatives under a regional cooperation framework. The UNHCR Malaysian representative, Alan Vernon said: … under this agreement, to the extent to which we have all the details- and of course we know that it's a work in progress which is still being discussed...we see that there are opportunities for better protection for refugees here in Malaysia, and more broadly in the region. What the UNHCR is saying is that they see the Malaysian solution not as abhorrent but as a positive move both for asylum seekers in Malaysia and also in the region. Most importantly, the contrast needs to made in terms of what the opposition are saying. The opposition's model is to put asylum seekers in Nauru. It does not attempt to break the people-smuggling process at all. This particular Malaysian solution does that: it goes to the source country from where the boats first leave and makes sure there are incentives for people to be treated fairly, humanely. Australia takes more refugees, but we do it in such a way that we discourage the vile trade of people smuggling. For those on the left and on the right to criticise only shows what a difficult and tight balance this is, but I believe the government has got this right in relation to the Malaysian solution and this is something that should be supported by all members of this parliament.",32
10,Mr CHRISTENSEN,PETITIONS," I rise to speak to this motion by the member for Melbourne this morning and, in doing so, question the motives behind this proposed Malaysian deal for asylum seekers and the regional outcomes. This government's border protection frenzy has become excruciating to to... make watch-like a cross between a bizarre episode of The Amazing Race and a chicken with its head cut off. There are stark similarities with the reality TV program. Just like The Amazing Race, this government jet sets its policy from one country to the next. We have seen the bungled attempt at using East Timor. We have seen Manus Island and PNG brought into the equation very briefly. Then we jumped on a jet to see if Malaysia could help get this Labor government's border protection right. Then Thailand and the South Sea islands have chimed in wanting a piece of the action, so bad for Australia was the proposed deal with Malaysia. The key difference is that contestants on The Amazing Race do not know where they are going to finish, and it is not in Malaysia. The Malaysian deal is not a solution. Manus Island was not a solution. East Timor was not a solution. What we are seeing in Australian detention centres is not a solution. They are all just carriages on this train wreck that is the government's avoidance of the real solution to border protection. The Australian people know what the solution looks like. They have seen the Howard government effectively control our borders and achieve results. I believe, 'If it ain't broke don't fix it.' Unfortunately, that is not this government's approach to this policy. They tried to fix the perfectly-working solution and have been running around like headless chooks ever since in a desperate bid to find another solution that does not look like the old one. They cannot go back to the solution that worked; that would be to admit that they got it wrong. If a real deal with Malaysia ever eventuates-and there is not yet a deal, according to Malaysia-it will be one of the greatest injustices ever thrust upon the Australian people and the asylum seekers at the centre of this malaise. To pack up the asylum seekers and transport them to a country that not only allows but regularly practices caning, contravenes government's own stance. Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Even if a caning ban was written into this alleged agreement that would be no guarantee because caning is permissible under local laws in Malaysia. The PM cannot guarantee that asylum seekers would not be caned, mistreated or even tortured in Malaysia. She cannot make that guarantee. She might promise but we have seen how much a promise from the Prime Minister is worth with the carbon tax. With a processing centre at Nauru, on the other hand, the Australian government can make that guarantee. Nauru may not be a signatory to the United Nations convention on refugees but it is willing to be. And, unlike Malaysia, it is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civic and Political Rights. The solution was working at Nauru. The question is: why will the Prime Minister not pick up the phone to the President of Nauru? The answer to that is very simple: that would be an admission that this government got it wrong. It was a wrong call on East Timor and a wrong call on Manus Island. It is a wrong call on Malaysia, unless you are on the Malaysian end of the deal. That is a deal of a lifetime. All Malaysia has to do is take in 800 asylum seekers from Australia and they can offload 4,000 of theirs. It is a great solution for Malaysia. What is more, the Australian government has kindly offered to pay for the whole deal. That makes it an even better solution for Malaysia. But for Australia it is a deal that stinks. It is a deal that is going to cost us an additional $1.7 billion, according to the budget papers. Malaysia is still holding the cards, because the Prime Minister is desperate to find some the sort of solution. Malaysia will be holding all the aces in this deal. They will pick and choose which 800 asylum seekers they will take in. They will pick and choose which 4000 they send. Our current detention centres are in a mess. We have violent riots and a cost blowout of more than $3 billion. Our detention population is at record levels, more than 60 per cent of detainees having been there for more than six months and the average time spent in detention increasing from 61 days to more than 170 in that past three years. This is a government desperate for a deal.",34
11,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS, Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Australia's Immigration Detention Network Committee Appointment,35
12,Mr MORRISON,COMMITTEES," I seek leave to amend the motion relating to the Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network in the terms circulated to honourable members. Leave granted. I move the motion as amended: That: (1) a Select Committee on the Crisis in Australia's Immigration Detention Network be appointed to inquire into and report on: (a) the riots and disturbances in detention facilities on Christmas Island commencing 12 March 2011, and Villawood from 19 April 2011, in particular: (i) the nature and circumstances of these events; (ii) the nature and adequacy of the response of Commonwealth agencies to the events; (iii) any warning, briefings or advice that had been provided to the Government by agencies and individuals in the lead up to, during and after the events and the nature and adequacy of the response to such information; (iv) the adequacy of security protocols, procedures and resources to mitigate the escalation of tension and conflict in the detention network; (v) the extent and cost of the damage to facilities as a result of the events; and (vi) any other matter deemed relevant by the Committee to understand why these events occurred; and (b) the performance and management of Commonwealth agencies and/or their agents or contractors in discharging their responsibilities associated with the interception, detention and processing of less irregular maritime arrivals or other persons; (c) the resources, support and training for employees of Commonwealth agencies and/or their agents or contractors in performing their duties; (d) the health, safety and well-being of employees of Commonwealth agencies and/or their agents or contractors in performing their duties relating to the interception, detention and processing of irregular maritime arrivals or other persons; (e) the health, safety and well-being of asylum seekers and other persons, including specifically children, detained within the detention network; (f) the level, adequacy and effectiveness of reporting incidents and the response to incidents within the immigration detention network, including relevant policies, procedures, authorities and protocols; (g) compliance with the Government's immigration detention values within the detention network; (h) any issues relating to interaction with States and Territories regarding the interception, detention and processing of irregular maritime arrivals or other persons; (i) the management of good order and public order with respect to the immigration detention network; (j) the impact of length of detention on and the appropriateness of facilities and services provided for detainees, including asylum seekers within the detention network; (k) the total costs of managing and maintaining the immigration detention network and processing irregular maritime arrivals or other detainees; (l) the expansion of the immigration detention network, including the cost and process adopted to establish new facilities; (m) the length of time detainees have been held in the detention network, the reasons for their length of stay and the impact on the detention network; (n) processes for assessment of protection claims made by irregular maritime arrivals and other persons and the impact on the detention network; (o) the management and impact of detention on children and families, and viable alternatives; (p) the cost, effectiveness and long term viability of outsourcing immigration detention centre contracts to provide providers and the policy alternatives; (q) impact, effectiveness and cost of existing and prospective Government policies, including mandatory detention and any alternatives, including community release, with respect to irregular maritime arrivals and other persons detained within the detention network; (r) any reforms needed to the current immigration detention network in Australia; and (s) any other matters relevant to the above terms of reference. (2) the Committee consist of 7 members, 3 Members to be nominated by the Government Whip or Whips, 3 Members to be nominated by the Opposition Whip or Whips, and 1 nonaligned member; (3) the Committee may supplement its membership by up to four members, with a maximum of two extra Government and two extra opposition or non-aligned members. Supplementary members shall have the same participatory rights as other members, but may not vote; (4) every nomination of a member of the Committee be notified in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives; (5) the members of the Committee hold office as a select committee until presentation of the Committee's report or the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires by effluxion of time, whichever is the earlier; (6) the Committee elect a Government or a nongovernment member as chair at its first meeting; (7) the Committee elect a member as its deputy chair who shall act as chair of the Committee at any time when the chair is not present at a meeting of the Committee, and at any time when the chair and deputy chair are not present at a meeting of the Committee the members present shall elect another member to act as chair at that meeting; (8) in the event of an equally divided vote, the chair, or the deputy chair when acting as chair, have a casting vote; (9) 3 members of the Committee constitute a quorum of the Committee provided that in a deliberative meeting the quorum shall include 1 Government member and 1 nonGovernment member; (10) the Committee have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of 3 or more of its members and to refer to any subcommittee any matter which the Committee is empowered to examine.; (11) the Committee appoint the chair of each subcommittee who shall have a casting vote only and at any time when the chair of a subcommittee is not present at a meeting of the subcommittee the members of the subcommittee present shall elect another member of that subcommittee to act as chair at that meeting; (12) 2 members of a subcommittee constitute the quorum of that subcommittee; (13) members of the Committee who are not members of a subcommittee may participate in the proceedings of that subcommittee but shall not vote, move any motion or be counted for the purpose of a quorum; (14) the Committee or any subcommittee have power to call for witnesses to attend and for documents to be produced; (15) the Committee or any subcommittee may conduct proceedings at any place it sees fit; (16) the Committee or any subcommittee have power to adjourn from time to time and to sit during any adjournment of the House of Representatives; (17) the Committee may report from time to time but that it present its final report no later than 7 October 2011; and (18) the provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders Labor's denial and failure over three years has created chaos, cost and misery in our detention network. As I said earlier in this House, no-one will be more pleased than I if the boats stop but this will not erase the havoc caused by Labor and their denial and their failed policies. In November 2007 there were just four people who had arrived illegally by boat in our detention network. Under Labor that number has risen to over 6,500-almost double the peak that was recorded under the coalition government. Over the last several years we have seen a litany of chaos, abuse and cost blow-outs in this detention network, which defy imagination. It was all started by this government's failure to address their own policy measures introduced to soften the border protection regime that they inherited from the coalition government. When they softened those laws, over 11,100 people came to our shores. We had an increase in our detention population, as I have mentioned, to over 6,800. The time spent in detention increased from just over 60 days to almost 180 days. More than 60 per cent of the people who are in our detention network now have been there for more than six months. We have had incidents of abuse, not only amongst detainees, but in particular against those Australians who are working in those centres. There have been over 70 incidents and allegations of abuse have been levelled against those in detention centres in just this financial year alone. This is a network that is in absolute crisis. It has been in a rolling crisis since there was what was reported as a bloody fight breaking out on 21 November 2009 on Christmas Island involving 150 Afghans and Sri Lankans. That matter was over a year ago, and we have seen chorus of incidents, from further rooftop protests on 20 to 22 September 2010, 90 detainees breaking out of the Northern Immigration Detention Facility in September of last year and, on 15 November a violent brawl at Broadmeadows. On 17 November there was a rooftop protest at Villawood and at the Airport Lodge between 7 to 10 February 1l people were hospitalised and a further 11 taken to the watch house after another disturbance and riot. On 27 and 28 February there was a riot at Christmas Island in the family compound, where 13 people were injured, windows were smashed, three asylum seekers were arrested and 15 young males were moved off the island. On 16 March there was a breakout at the Asti Motel. On 17 March there was a protest at Curtin and also on 17 March a young Afghan man died at Sherga. On 28 March a 20 year-old Afghan asylum seeker died at the Curtin detention centre and on 12 and 13 March there were mass breakouts at Christmas Island followed by the horrendous riots which saw Commonwealth officers having to retake a Commonwealth facility by force. There were the Villawood riots that were proceeded by an improvised explosive device being found in that detention centre some four weeks before that whole area of the compound was torched-something the minister did not even know about. We have an average of more than three critical incidents of the types I have been referring to-of self-abuse, assaults and escapesoccurring in our detention network every single day. This is something that demands an inquiry of this House. The terms of reference I have circulated for that inquiry are there for all to see and go in some detail into the matters that we should be looking at. We should be looking at how the riots occurred and what steps were taken by the government to avoid them. We should be looking at the procedures in place in our detention network to ensure that staff are safe, can be catered for, can be looked after and can defend and protect themselves in the course of what can often be incredibly dangerous duties. There should be codes of conduct that are enforceable so that Serco officers and other Australians working in this environment can ensure good public order. Australians were horrified and appalled by the behaviour we saw in our detention network over these last months. They were shaking their heads; many of them said, 'Enough is enough.' Enough is enough of the rolling crisis in our detention network and the government's attempt to not have these matters exposed to full public scrutiny. There are also issues in the detention network around the welfare of those who are being held within detention itself. As I said, when the coalition government left office there were just four people in detention who had arrived by boat. That is how you avoid having more than three critical incidents every day in your detention network-when there is actually no-one in them. That is our objective. That is why we have always said we wanted to stop the boats, because when you do you do not have the havoc that is caused. I am amazed that the current government took almost three years to realise that their failed policies were the problem. Their policies were the reason that our detention network was filling up, causing the tension, the stress and the pressures have led to this appalling series of incidents right across the detention network, including self-harm. It took almost two years for the government to decide to use the powers that were created in 2005 in the Migration Act by the coalition government to enable children to be released into the community under residence determination orders. Why did it take so long? Why did it take so long for more than 1,000 children to be held within the detention network and not released into the community under residence determination orders? The minister has had that power ever since he took up his oath and the minister before him had that power when he took up his oath. But as 1,000 children got onto boats under this government's policies and made their way to our shores and into our detention network, where they have largely stayed till this day, this government sat there for almost two years and did absolutely nothing, not using any of the powers it had under the act to deal with this very serious issue. Then, last year, they made this grand announcement implying that they would take children out from behind razor wire. They have not been behind razor wire since 2005, when just 59 children were in detention and were released into the community by the coalition government under the reforms that we made at that time. All of these matters need to be ventilated. I do not seek to muzzle any member of this chamber-or in the other chamber if we sought to make this a joint parliamentary inquiry. It is important that we ask all the questions and put it all under the microscope, and that is why I gave my commitment to the crossbenchers and the Greens to amend the motion. All of the specific issues that they have asked to be raised in our discussions that over the last week have now been included in the terms of reference for this inquiry. In my discussions with all of the crossbenchers whom I have had the opportunity to speak with personally, I have sought to include the matters they have raised in these terms of reference, because no member of this parliament should be muzzled in seeking to ask the questions and get the answers as to what is happening in our detention network. In the motion before the House earlier today, we had debated the government's Malaysian five-for-one people swap. As I mentioned in my remarks on that matter, this is a deal which is fraught with difficulty, is far from completed and, most significantly, fails to provide the guarantees required under our Migration Act for the welfare of those people who will be sent to Malaysia under this arrangement. When we consider these matters, it is important that we get the policies right. We will see whether the measure that the government is introducing stops the boats or not. We will wait. No-one will be happier than me if boats stop coming, but it has to be done the right way. The policies that the coalition put in place when we were in government not only stopped the boats but reduced the detention population of those who came by boat to just four. That is the outcome that we dearly seek. So I implore members of this House to take up the opportunity for an inquiry that will be able to ask witnesses to give evidence in camera, to travel and to hear from people who have experience of the immigration network about how they work in and operate it and the resources and other things that they need; and to look into the cost, which has blown out to more than $3 billion over the last couple of years through the waste and mismanagement and failures of this government's policies. Whether the boats stop coming or not, the mess this government has created in our detention network is a national disgrace. It is a blight on our budget and it is a blight on our record for one simple reason: this government's policies failed. We need to have an inquiry to look into the mess it has created.",35
13,Mr HUSIC,COMMITTEES," This motion submitted by the member for Cook is sold to the parliament and the public as a sincere effort to shine a light on the way the nation's detention network is run, demanding of the parliament and, principally, the government transparency and a willingness to critically examine the management of this network. In short, this is not a call for a serious examination. It is not a move to provide genuine recommendations for the way detention centres are managed to enhance their operation. I imagine it is not even a real attempt to reconsider the model of detention. This is simply a political stunt by the opposition, who, incapable of putting forward a viable, workable alternative, seek to flex their intellectual muscle by calling for-wait for it-a parliamentary inquiry. With the opposition deprived of attention and having an inability to breathe life back into a shabby approach to the issue of asylum seekers, we are now meant to believe that the member for Cook is seeking to pursue serious policy outcomes. An opposition that refuses to join other multiparty committees tasked with dealing with the gravest policy issue confronting our generation and those that follow-climate change-now calls on the parliament to join with it in a political exercise designed to generate advantage for the coalition, not for the nation. A member who just a few short months ago could not allow grieving families the peace to bury their own and who instead, with his public remarks, poured shame onto a period of intense grief, has now struck within himself a vein of compassion. He saunters into the chamber showing us his confected concern that masks a ruptured conscience. What has prompted this motion by the member for Cook? What in the last two or so weeks has prompted the member for Cook into this sudden push for a parliamentary inquiry? What has changed that has made this so important for the member for Cook to bring this on now is simple: the announcement made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on Saturday, 7 May. The member for Cook fears that the government is putting in place its election commitment for a regional cooperation network to help end the people-smuggling model. The member for Cook, like many opposite, is afraid that the government's policies will have the desired effect of putting in place a sharp disincentive for people smugglers and those contemplating taking the dangerous journey by boat to Australia. What we have is simply the member for Cook trying to squeeze every last drop of political capital out of the human misery of irregular migration and people smuggling. If he were genuinely concerned with the events in part (a) of his motion, we would have heard about this proposed inquiry more than a month ago. The reason we did not hear about it is because the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship responded quickly effectively to the events on Christmas Island and at Villawood by announcing an armslength independent inquiry led by experienced public servants Helen Williams and Dr Allan Hawke. This is the right and proper place for a sober examination of what occurred and what needs to be done to help avoid these terrible scenes happening again. Even if we accepted that the proper place for examination of the events on Christmas Island and Villawood was a parliamentary inquiry, what is this proposed inquiry supposed to achieve? Parliamentary inquiries are supposed to be vehicles to get to the bottom of a particular event or to challenge policy settings. Is the member for Cook seriously suggesting that we should end mandatory detention-a policy that has enjoyed bipartisan support for over 15 years? The government has a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals for the purpose of health, identity and security checks-which I thought were things that the member for Cook supported. The terms of reference put forward by the member for Cook have no real focus or desired outcome. Why? For the coalition, it is more important to continue to talk about asylum seekers or boat people than to come up with real policy solutions to tackle major challenges like people smuggling in our region. The gall and hypocrisy embedded in this motion should drive the House away from it. The opposition would ask that the government be judged when they have shunned judgment themselves, knowing that judgment of their performance would yield little to be proud of and much to be ashamed of. The rollcall of infamous incidents stands out with innocent people caught by the fractures and flaws of their system. Vivian Alvarez Solon was unlawfully removed to the Philippines in July 2001. Four years later it emerged that she had been deported, and although the government had known of the mistake two years earlier. Cornelia Rau, an Australian permanent resident, was unlawfully detained for a period of 10 months back in 2004-05. Peter Qasim was held in detention for seven years. Then there were mother and daughter Virginia and Naomi Leong. Virginia Leong, a Malaysian citizen, was arrested and placed under mandatory detention in 2001 for attempting to leave Australia without the correct papers. She was two months pregnant at the time of her detention. What of the coalition's own efforts to reach regional understanding to tackle people smuggling? The former government, headed by a Prime Minister who was the selfappointed deputy sheriff of the Asia-Pacific, were able to muster only an island state to form the basis of their Pacific solution. Of the 13 or so independent states within the Pacific, only one agreed to their Pacific solution. And then they told us that they could bring their own regional solution, no doubt through their boat phone-with only one other country on the other end of the line-while in the background, under their watch, there were fires, breakouts and violence at Woomera and Baxter. In terms of transparency and openness, one only needs to compare our record to theirs, and we are quite prepared to do so. This government is open and accountable about its immigration detention system, unlike those opposite when they were last in office. As I have mentioned, we have already announced independent reviews into the incidents at Christmas Island and Villawood detention centre, and the Ombudsman consistently investigates the detention system. I also understand that the minister has fielded more than 1,200 questions on notice as part of the Senate estimates process. We are prepared to consider genuine proposals for changes to improve the operation of the detention network and the safety and security of those who live or work within it. We are building regional solutions to the regional problem of irregular migration and people smuggling. We have secured the agreement of more than 30 countries to a sustainable regional cooperation framework for dealing with asylum seekers. We are implementing that framework through cooperative arrangements with interested countries in the region, beginning with a landmark transfer arrangement with Malaysia. In October last year, the Prime Minister and the immigration minister announced that the government would move the majority of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community based accommodation by the end of June this year, and we are well on track meet that commitment. We also committed to ensuring that asylum seekers within the immigration detention facilities are housed humane, appropriate conditions and are provided with appropriate services and care. We have long acknowledged the pressures on our detention system and we are working hard to relieve that pressure by improving processing times for asylum claims and delivering a regional solution to the problem of irregular migration. I noticed that the member for Cook in his proposed motion has again revisited the issue of the costs of damage caused by the fires at Villawood detention centre. This is an issue that was particularly embarrassing for him when he raised it during question time during budget week. His question suggested a great big cover-up by the government. The response by the minister for immigration left the member for Cook red-faced. The Commonwealth is not liable for the damage to detention centres at Christmas Island and Villawood; that is covered by Serco's insurance. Minister Bowen has announced a range of measures to strengthen the consequences of criminal behaviour in immigration detention, including the amendments to the character test which are currently before the House. I am told the member for Cook received written advice from the department's senior legal team as well as a briefing on the legislation weeks ago-and, still, I do not believe we are any wiser on whether or not the coalition will support the reform. The changes send a strong and clear message that criminal behaviour in detention centres will not be tolerated. Will the member for Cook step up and support these changes-or is it all talk yet again? There is no question that the government's policy of detention will have its costs. This is to something that the Liberal Party know about-they were, after all, the party that spent hundreds of millions of dollars in building the facility on Christmas Island. Our costs in the budget for asylum seeker management cover the new measures the government is taking to break the business model of the people smugglers, the building of a regional solution and the costs of processing. When taking into account all the measures considered here today by the government and our record of being open and transparent on this sensitive issue, the contrasts are clear for all to see in the newfound commitment to openness and transparency that those opposite refused to embrace when they were in government.",40
14,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES," I rise to support this motion moved by the member for Cook. If the member for Chifley, the government member who just spoke on this motion, is the sum total of the government's defence as to why this parliament should not look into the government's detention network debacle, I hope that this parliament can see through such transparently naive and, quite frankly, petty and silly arguments. We are sent here to this parliament to do many things in representing our constituents but, very importantly, this parliament should hold the executive to account. This is what this motion is really about. It is framed around the detention network, but the decision this parliament makes on it will be about what role the parliament should legitimately play. And it is vital that this parliament hold the executive to account on this issue. This is a parliament that was supposed to be different. This is a parliament that was supposed to be more muscular and was going to assert its independence from the executive. The Labor Party when they came into government were going to 'allow sunlight in on government decisions'; yet we just heard the one contribution to this debate from the government slamming the reasons that we should have this detention network inquiry. Our detention network does need parliamentary scrutiny. It has been gripped by a rolling crisis that culminated in March and April this year with the riots and the violent incidences that we saw at Christmas Island and Villawood. A lot has been said about those riots but beyond those we know that there are three critical incidents a day within our detention network. These can range from assaults on officers through to self-harm, riots, the setting of fires, homemade bombs and, sadly, even deaths. The incident of the improvised explosive device at Villawood was not even considered important enough to report to the ministerwho was notified on talkback radio about what was occurring within his own network. There has been a collapse of our detention network, and it is not the result of bad luck or happenstance and it is certainly not the result of international conditions; it is the direct result of failed government policies. When the Labor Party came to office there were four people in our detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. Then Labor took these fateful decisions in August 2008 that resulted in the people-smuggling model being reinvigorated. And, of course, we know what has happened since then: 227 illegal boat arrivals carrying over 11,000 people. Julia Gillard as Prime Minister has presided over 86 boat arrivals and over 4,800 people being smuggled here illegally. If the government could kill the peoplesmuggling model and show some resolve and do something to stop these arrivals, we would not have the need for this inquiry into our detention network. Because there has been this massive influx of people and a massive expansion of the network, we have had the situation where people have been detained for much longer as government agencies struggle to deal with the consequences of Labor's failure. Because is it so hard to process such a large number of people, 60 per cent of detainees have now been detained for over six months. Average processing time has blown out from 61 days to over 170 days. Taxpayers' money has been squandered at an astonishing rate. An extra $3 million of taxpayers' money has been expended on our detention network. If these are not things that this parliament should be looking into, it is hard to imagine what MPs are doing here. We need to know what happened at Christmas Island; we need to know what happened at Villawood; we need to know what is happening in an ongoing way within our detention network; we need to know what can be done better; and we need to understand how our detention network got to this stage in the first place and what the government's plans are to do something about it. When you are seeing Commonwealth property taxpayers' money squandered, Commonwealth employees criminal acts committed, explosive devices being detected, mass breakouts, suicides and self-harm-and when you are seeing all this as a direct result of the failure of government policy-this parliament must take action. I urge all members to support this motion.",43
15,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES," You do not have to search far for evidence that Australia's mandatory detention system is in crisis. Most nights on the news we see graphic images of the failure: people caged like criminals, riots, fires, suicide, women and children mourning their dead. And who can forget the gut-wrenching images of a boat laden with people seeking asylum smashing into Christmas Island. Yet still they come-men, women and children risking their lives to seek asylum in the country with a national anthem that boasts of golden soil and wealth for toil and, for those who have come across the seas, boundless plains to share. These people do not come here by jumping some queue. There is no queue when you are fleeing for your life in the middle of the night or rotting in some displaced persons camp. Nor do they risk the hazardous and expensive journey to Australia because they want to be locked up for God knows how long. No, asylum seekers make their treacherous journeys because their situations are so dire. That is why they are willing to split up their families, leave behind all their possessions and risk their lives as they do. Imagine being in that position where your best option is to put your life and probably all your cash in the hands of some dodgy people smuggler. How does Australia greet these desperate people who are committing no crime? By locking them up for months and years in destroyed, circumstances the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted last assaulted, week are 'arbitrary', 'in breach of international law' and which have 'for many years cast a shadow over Australia's human rights record.' If we needed more proof that this is a broken system, we have also got the report from the Australian Human Rights Commission on Sydney's Villawood detention centre. Commission President Catherine Branson describes ghost-like people covered in emotional and physical scars thinking constantly of suicide and selfharm. She told the ABC last week: You get the sense, walking in, of disturbed people, depressed people, agitated people. There is not a sense of normality around you. Moreover she said: I think the average Australian would be disturbed if required to spend even a short period of time living there. Not only is mandatory detention cruel and inhumane, it simply does not work. It is a failed and costly experiment that has gone on for much too long. Yet next year the government will spend more than $700 million on asylum seeker detention and related costs, equating to about $90,000 a year for every asylum seeker who makes it to Australia. The federal government cannot keep kidding itself that its irregular immigration policy is working and just keep building new detention centres. In Tasmania, for instance, the government is about to spend $15 million on a temporary detention centre at Pontville to house asylum seekers for just six months. Putting the humanitarian dimension to one side, is this the best use of taxpayer dollars? Of course not. I have long opposed mandatory detention anywhere and these latest facilities will different. These are people who have knocked on Australia's door seeking asylum and it is simply wrong to cage them behind wire, whether it be in Pontville or on Christmas Island. We must accept that mandatory detention does not deter asylum seekers and we must find a better solution. We must acknowledge that the proliferation of detention centres in Australia is proof the federal government's asylum seeker policy is broken. I make the point again, and I will keep making it until the government and the opposition start listening, that this is not a border security problem. It is much more complex than that and it needs a sophisticated solution that deals genuinely with source, first-asylum and transit countries. No wonder I support the establishment of a parliamentary committee on Australia's immigration detention system. I trust it will not be a political circus, but instead the first step to Australia adopting a more humane and effective approach to dealing with the wretched souls risking all to carve out a better life here in our lucky country. Indeed, for those who have come across the seas, we do in fact have boundless plains to share. Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (11:11): The issue of mandatory detention for asylum seekers has been much debated and much criticised since it was first implemented by the Labor government in 1992. It is a negative and punitive system of dealing with those who come to our shores seeking asylum. Apart from the all-too-apparent negative effects on people incarcerated in detention prisons, the system is administratively demanding and extremely costly. The original intention when mandatory detention was introduced by the Labor government in 1992 was to act as a be no deterrent to those seeking to come to our shores. Originally it was aimed at a very small number of people arriving by boat. Ten years after the implementation of the policy there were 5,000 boat arrivals-so much for its deterrent capacity. Similarly, the policy of temporary protection visas was introduced as a deterrent. In the five years prior to temporary protection visas being introduced there were 3,103 boat arrivals. In the five years following the introduction of temporary protection visas there were over 11,000 arrivals. It is time we looked at these policies in the cold light of day and worked toward a durable solution-like my colleague the member for Denison has just outlined-so that we can deal with the problem of people fleeing the threat of death and oppression in their own countries without imposing further punitive measures on them. Examining the operation of detention centres may have the positive impact of demonstrating the futility of locking people up for long periods of time in a prison-like system that leaves them further traumatised and does little or nothing to resolve the bigger issues of asylum seekers in our region. From 2001 to 2005 I worked with others in this place for hard-won changes that were made to the system of mandatory detention, including an agreement that 12,000 refugees living in the purgatory of the temporary protection visa system would be given permanent visas, the Ombudsman would regularly report to this parliament on why people continued to be held in immigration detention and families with children would not be placed in immigration detention centres except as a last resort. Those policies were implemented and then we saw the Labor government come in on the promise of a New Directions in Detention policy. The government acknowledged that 'detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable'. We had this promise, but according to the most recent Australian Human Rights Commission report, 2011 Immigration detention at Villawood, they say that there are: … 6819 people, including 1030 children, in immigration detention in Australia – 4304 on mainland and 2515 on Christmas Island. More than half of those people had been detained for longer than six months, and more than 750 had been detained for longer than a year. This parliament should ask questions about why these practices are still continuing today. There is no justification for holding asylum seekers in detention centres once basic health and security checks are completed. It is clear that the checks are not being completed in a timely manner, and this has led to overcrowding in detention centres with all the attendant problems. I support this motion in the hope that it will publicly air and stop the cruel and odious practice of indefinite arbitrary detention of asylum seekers. The government appears to have completely abandoned its New Directions in Detention policy. We simply cannot continue to support a policy of indefinite mandatory detention with its terrible human cost to this nation and to our reputation in this parliament. Instead of resourcing the Department Of Immigration and Citizenship to carry out health and security checks, what do we see the government doing? As my colleague the member for Denison said, we see them spending huge amounts of money to build new detention centres and, of course, to refurbish other facilities such as Northam in my electorate to hold increasing numbers of detention detainees.",44
16,Mr BANDT,COMMITTEES," It is clear, for reasons that other members have made clear in this House and as I raised earlier, that mandatory detention has failed. I welcome anything we can do to shed light on the effects of the policy of mandatory detention in this country. I hope that mandatory detention is treated as sufficiently serious an issue that we can move to establishing a joint select committee on it so that both houses of parliament can take the the opportunity of the composition of the current parliament to have, once and for all, a comprehensive inquiry into the merits or people otherwise of our mandatory detention system. I thank the member for Cook for including in his amendment to his motion calling for a select committee on Australia's immigration detention network some of the terms of reference that we think would be necessary to give that kind of breadth and impetus to the committee. I do hope that, over coming days, we can reach agreement that this ought to be a joint select committee. It is clear that mandatory detention has failed. We know it has failed from psychiatrist after psychiatrist, mental health expert after mental health expert and human rights commissioner after human rights commissioner coming before us, the media and the Australian people to tell us about the appalling effects on an individual's mental health and well-being from being locked up behind razor wire indefinitely without knowing their fate. Most particularly, we know and can no longer close our eyes to the horrible life-ruining effects it has on children-children of families who have members in detention and children who are in detention themselves. There can be no excuse for the continued incarceration of children whose parents have fled to Australia. They have fled some of the most appalling persecution conditions-conditions that we send our soldiers overseas to fight against-but we then take them and lock them up. Mandatory detention has failed because it treats them as unlawful people who have committed no crime. It treats them worse than criminals. At least criminals know when they are going to be released; people in detention do not. We know that the system of mandatory detention has failed because it is now being prosecuted for purely political reasons. It has become an issue of who can be toughest on this issue in the hope that it will win some votes somewhere. We have lost any defining policy behind our immigration system. We know that mandatory detention has failed because it is the most costly alternative available to us, with at least a billion dollars a year being spent on a so-called border protection policy which has nothing to do with national security issues but has everything to do with attempts to win votes domestically. My colleague on the crossbench the member for Denison made a point about people smugglers. I have no doubt that there are some very unsavoury people who are people smugglers, but for this somehow to be made an issue not of protecting the rights of asylum seekers but of breaking the model of people smugglers is completely the wrong approach. If I, and I suspect most Australians, were in the position where I or my family were being threatened, where there was war around me or where I or people I knew were being persecuted I would do anything I could to get out of my country, including paying some money to someone to get me out. I think most fair-minded people would feel the same way. The more we talk about people smugglers, the more we ignore the fact that we are talking about individuals seeking assistance to flee appalling conditions. I am reminded that it was not always like this in Australia.",46
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Tobacco Products,47
18,Mr NEUMANN,COMMITTEES," I move: That this House: (1) recognises that: (a) there are about three million Australians who still smoke; and (b) tobacco is a lethal product, killing around 15000 Australians every year; and (2) calls on all Members and political parties to immediately stop accepting political donations from tobacco companies. The Leader of the Opposition likes to say no. In fact, he is good at saying no-he is addicted to it. He should say no to political donations from tobacco companies. Why? Because three million Australians smoke tobacco. Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease among Australians, killing about 15,000 Australians a year. On average, the life expectancy of people who smoke is 10 years less than that of lifelong nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking not only causes diseases but impedes treatment. Smokers' wounds take longer to heal and they use hospital services more than nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard: it contains 250 toxic substances, some of which are in the worse categories of cancercausing substances. In 2008, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing estimated the social and economic cost of tobacco use to Australian society was $31.5 billion each year-and that includes of course the health costs. That is an increase of 50 per cent from the last estimate in 1998-99. That represents 56.2 per cent of the costs of all drug useincluding alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco. Research in the Medical Journal of Australia states that a fall of just over five per cent smoking rates would save $4.5 billion to our national economy over the next 37 years. The smoking rate is much higher in Indigenous communities: one in two Indigenous Australians smoke and one in five will die from smoking related diseases. The tobacco companies form a powerful, global cartel. They spend tens of millions of dollars annually on marketing and they employ highly skilled lobbyists and advertisers to maintain and increase tobacco use. Fortunately, unlike in many parts of the world, tobacco use is on the decline in Australia. Too often tobacco use is perceived to be solely a question of personal choice. The World Health Organisation tells us that tobacco users are aware of the health impacts and really want to quit. The coalition parties are addicted to the political donations from tobacco. The Liberal and National parties have accepted a combined $3 million in donations from big tobacco, with more than $1.7 million of that coming after 2004 when, fortunately and bravely, the Australian Labor Party stopped accepting these poisonous donations. The Leader of the Opposition needs to kick his habit. As a former health minister, he knows that tobacco kills Australians each year and brings suffering to families across the country. Accepting donations from big tobacco is not acceptable given what we know about the dangerous nature of these substances. When will the Liberal and National parties stop defending big tobacco and start defending the health of Australians? When will they kick their habit of accepting money from those who manufacture these lethal substances? Why do they not give up on big tobacco? It is possibly because they are struggling to match the efforts of previous coalition administrations. In 2009-10 British American Tobacco gave $130,385 to the national and state in divisions of the Liberal Party, and $14,650 to the National Party-a total of $145,035 from British American Tobacco to the coalition. In 2009 Philip Morris gave $103,945 to the Liberal Party and $43,100 to the National Party-a total of $147,045. We know that big tobacco cannot be trusted with the facts. This federal Labor government has acted on these matters. We have increased the tobacco excise by 25 per cent, we are restricting internet advertising of tobacco products and we are introducing mandatory plain packaging of tobacco products. This is supported by the Cancer Council, but, sadly, those opposite will not support it. We have launched the largest ever national tobacco campaign. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to kick the habit. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to quit. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to stop the donations. We know that this is important. We know that smoking kills; it is as simple as that. Those opposite should have the courage of their convictions and stand up for the health of the Australian community and stop the donations.",47
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Is the motion seconded? Ms Smyth: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,48
20,Mr BRIGGS,COMMITTEES," I rise more out of pity than I do out of a genuine need to debate this motion. Realistically, this motion is a desperate bid from the Labor Party to try to create a political diversion in question time. With the mover of the motion not being able to fill five minutes on his own motion, we see just how desperate a bid this is to create a political opportunity for the Minister for Health and Ageing and her little sidekick, the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing. I think this is a desperate attempt from a desperate government that has big issues on its plate that it cannot deal with. Telling to the Australian electorate prior to an election and then changing its mind straight after the election has probably been its biggest issue. So it is with a bit of pity that we waste parliament's time with this motion when there are so many other important things we could be talking about, particularly from a minister and a government mired in hypocrisy when it comes to this issue. The Minister for Health and Ageing gets in here every day-and I am sure we will see the theatrics again today-and tries to create a big storm about donations, but she was the beneficiary of corporate hospitality from Philip Morris. I am sure that everyone knows that the Minister for Health and Ageing is a huge Lleyton Hewitt fan and she was so desperate to see Lleyton play that she went ahead and accepted corporate hospitality from Philip Morris. I think it just shows the hypocrisy. There is nothing wrong with accepting corporate hospitality-I am sure that all members on both sides do-but there is something very wrong with the hypocrisy of a minister who comes into this place day after day and tries to suggest that, in effect, taking donations from organisations makes you corrupt, accessible to corruption or that your policies are being influenced by those donations. If that is the case then let us just go through the record on donations and the use of Commonwealth money by the Labor Party. We know that each member of the Labor Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the trade union movement in this country. The trade unions pay a hell of a lot of money to have that right over each of those members. We know in the last three years, leading to the 2010 election, that the Labor Party received some $20 million from its trade union masters-just at the federal level alone. Coincidentally, in the last two budgets fibs the Labor government has handed the trade unions $20 million. What a coincidence! In the last two budgets the taxpayer-including everyone sitting in the gallery watching this debate-handed $10 million to the Trade the Union Education Foundation. Another effort this year can be found on page 148 in the budget papers, for the information of the member for La Trobe, where the unions were handed another $10 million for another fund, the Building Australia's Future Workforce fund: The Fund will provide … $10.0 million … to unions to enable them to provide tailored information and education resources to their membership. And, of course, to complete the money-goround of Labor Party and trade union donations there was $20 million from the unions to the Labor Party and $20 million back to the unions from the Australian taxpayer through the Labor government. Absolute, utter hypocrites! These people get in here and waste the parliament's time on matters relating to donations. They are complete and utter hypocrites. They spend their time getting their union masters to get them elected and then they give them back their money in government. They come into this place and waste the time of this parliament when we should be debating complete fibs about carbon taxes. We should be debating the integrity of a government that says one thing and then does another directly after an election. In the last parliament the now Leader of the Opposition outlined in this place on many occasions the complete rort that was Centenary House. Some members in this place remember the rort that was Centenary House. For those who do not remember, that was the deal the Labor Party gave themselves in a previous government, where they organised to have $36 million fleeced from the Australian taxpayer to pay for over-the-market rents from the ANAO at Centenary House in Barton. This motion should be treated with contempt, because that is what the Australian Labor Party are showing by putting it to the parliament. This is a complete and utter joke. We know the record of the Minister for Health and Ageing in taking corporate hospitality from tobacco companies. We know this is a desperate attempt by the Labor Party to divert attention from the ongoing crisis, which is their base walking away from them because they fibbed to the Australian electorate before the last election. (Time expired)",48
21,Ms SMYTH,COMMITTEES," This motion, as all of us on this side of the House know, is about one thing: backbone. Either you accept donations from the tobacco industry and compromise your political views and your judgment on important issues of public policy or you take a stand and say that no amount of money is worth compromising good policy. Despite fairly valiant but quite sad attempts by the coalition to avoid taking a position on political donations from tobacco companies, this is an issue that we know all parties must face up to. If the coalition cannot stand up to big tobacco, how can we ever believe that it will stand up to big polluters? How will it ever stand up to people who do not want to distribute the profits and the benefits of the mining boom amongst ordinary Australians? We have already seen in the last couple of weeks that the coalition will not even stand up for mum and dad shareholders on the issue of excessive executive pay. When it came to the vote, they backed executives over consumers and shareholders. They tried very hard to camouflage their position. They made all the right noises about the forgotten shareholders and standing up for forgotten consumers, forgotten employees and forgotten customers, but when it came to the vote they voted to look after executives. This motion is yet another a litmus test for the coalition. Are they able to take tough decisions or will they simply dance for the highest bidder? Will they oppose good policy because their wealthy benefactors crack the whip? Who is in fact running the show for the opposition? Is it the member for Warringah? Is it Senator Minchin? Is it big tobacco or big polluters? Is it tobacco sceptics this week, or climate sceptics? Which big lobby group has its hands on the purse strings this week? In this parliament we are dealing with the tough issues-issues that cannot and should not be determined by vested interests; issues that test all of us. It is important to listen to community perspectives in the policy debate and to listen to different perspectives, but there is a vast difference between taking advice and taking orders. We know that tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death and disease in Australia. We know that smoking leads to a wide range of diseases, including many types of cancer, heart disease and stroke. We know that tobacco smoking costs our economy around $31.5 billion and that 84 per cent of new lung cancers in men and 77 per cent of new lung cancers in women result from smoking. We have heard that the Cancer Council of Australia estimates that smoking claims the lives of more than 15,000 Australians each year. If we are really talking about forgotten families, let us have a chat about the families of those 15,000. Let us talk about their dependants-their kids, their husbands, their wives-their friends and the colleagues they leave behind. That is why those of us on this side of the House decided it was impossible to accept political donations from tobacco interests. I am confident that some on the other side of the House share that view, but unfortunately the vast majority of those on the other side of the House appear to have ducked the issue. The ALP knows it is not possible to legislate effectively to decrease the effects of tobacco while accepting donations from tobacco companies. Australians should be asking why other political parties do not do the same. We know that tobacco companies have donated $3 million to the Liberal and National parties over the last 12 years. We also know that those parties are dragging their feet on the issue of plain packaging for cigarettes, something that doctors and other health professionals have been calling for to try to curb the rate of smoking, particularly in the group most vulnerable to tobacco marketing: young people. British American Tobacco states clearly in its charter that the political donations it makes are given specifically to influence the debate on issues affecting the company and its business. In fact, its website states: Such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues affecting company or Group. There is no escaping it: tobacco companies expect results from their donations. Tobacco companies expect to sway the views of political parties that accept their donations. They have no other purpose. There can be no other conclusion. When questioned about all of this, all the Leader of the Opposition can feebly say is, 'They've wasted their money.' I think most of us would consider that money given to the coalition is a complete waste, but it really is insulting to the Australian public to expect them to believe that political donations from tobacco companies will not have an influence on the opposition's policy position. Australians need to ask themselves how a party that can do the bidding of tobacco companies, polluters and other big vested interests can still say that they stand for forgotten families.",50
22,Mr BUCHHOLZ,COMMITTEES," The debate on this motion on political donations from tobacco companies is nothing more than a diversion from the main game in Australia at the moment: the carbon tax and asylum seekers. The government has found itself in a downward spiral of polling across the nation, and this is a poor attempt to try to divert attention away from what is a critical situation for this nation. I will start by stating that the coalition does not encourage smoking. We never have and will not ever. I will elaborate on the coalition's position on smoking over the last couple of years. Statistics show that under the coalition government there was a decline in smoking rates across Australia. Under the coalition government the prevalence of smoking declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent in 2007, a substantial decrease. These rates were amongst the lowest in the world. The decline was the amongst the biggest falls among OECD countries, and the fall in the smoking rate for women was the greatest among OECD countries. It was at that time that Tony Abbott, who was then the Minister for Health and Ageing, introduced the current graphic health warnings that you see on cigarette packages today. It was the coalition that first proposed an increase in tobacco excise in 2009, a measure taken onboard later by subsequent governments. It is very, very difficult for the government to go and take the moral high ground on this debate. We hear figures bandied about along the lines of $3 million that the coalition has accepted-over the last 10 years, mind you, and on a downward trend-from the tobacco companies. But what they omit to say is that, at the very same time, the Labor government have taken over $20 million in donations from the union movement, some of which has been derived from problem gambling. It is worth noting that Australia has the lowest smoking rate per capita in the world and yet it has one of the highest gambling rates in the world. With reference to the $20 million received over the last period of time from unions, this budget also allocated a $10 million kickback to the unions for various reasons, including the development of web pages. Ten million dollars? I created a web page in my electorate the other day for $2,300quite a significant difference in costeffectiveness, but then that goes to the moral high ground that Labor want to take on the issue of smoking. I also pick up the point that Labor actually need to stand up to the unions and say, 'No longer will we take money from the unions that has been derived from problem gamblers.' I have some stats here on problem gambling in Australia. First, 40 per cent of all money lost on pokies comes from problem gamblers. In addition, there are probably about 100,000 addicted gamblers, with an additional 200,000 at significant risk. And poker machines can take up to $1,200 an hour out of mums' and dads' and working families' pockets, per machine around the country. The Alfred Hospital cite figures that one in five people who present in emergency rooms for attempted suicide have some type of gambling issue as their primary cause of attempted suicide. It is farcical that we are even having this debate. All the data is available for public knowledge. We as a coalition did not shrink away from our responsibility, and our proven track record, for the downward spiralling cigarette intake. In finishing I want to allude to a quote from ex Prime Minister Rudd-potentially, the way things are going, he could be the next leader of the Australian Labor Partyfrom 2007. He was quoted as saying on gaming: What I've said before, and I don't back away from it one minute, is I don't like poker machines. I've said that even though I was working in the Queensland government at the time when poker machines were introduced. That was a decision, together with other decisions, to introduce poker machines which I don't think have been helpful for working families. I encourage this debate to be done, concluded, so we can get back to the task at hand of debating the state of the nation when it comes to the carbon tax, asylum seekers and issues that impact on families.",51
23,Dr LEIGH,COMMITTEES," Each year 15,000 Australians die from smoking. That means 41 people a day. By the time this debate has concluded, an Australian will have died because she smoked. We also know that smokers harm those around them-children who inhale passive smoke, or the one-in-six babies born to mothers who smoked while pregnant. Smoking rates in regional areas are twice as high as in the cities, and people in the bush have higher death rates from lung cancer, heart disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These are the stark realities of smoking. Yet there remain groups in this place that continue to profit from this reality. The selfproclaimed party of responsibility refuses to take responsibility for the devastating impact of tobacco on Australians' health. And the self-proclaimed party of the bush shows less concern for the health of rural Australians than the property rights of tobacco companies. Last week I received an email from a constituent about why we should support the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing in their efforts to reduce smoking rates. The constituent wrote: My great-grandfather, grandfather, father and one of my uncles all died from smoking-related conditions. Each of the latter three died 20-30 years before the life expectancy for their generation. My father's addiction contributed to two decades of poor health prior to his premature death, resulting in frequent periods where he was unable to work. My siblings and I grew up in poverty, the effects of which are still evident, and the taxpayer bore the cost of his many hospitalisations as well as the cumulative years of income support our family depended on in lieu of employment. I say this so that you will understand my absence of sympathy for the 'principle argument', that tobacco companies have a right to make a profit from pushing legal drugs. I was proud to join the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Indigenous Health earlier this year at the launch of an ad campaign designed by Australians to help reduce Indigenous smoking rates, rates that are twice as high as for non-Indigenous Australians and a major contributor to the life expectancy gap. Yet those opposite seem set on blocking common-sense reforms like higher tobacco excise or the plain packaging of cigarettes. As with their stance on climate change, they are the party of 'no'. There is a precedent for this kind of nay-saying. Former opposition leader Billy Snedden said about the link between smoking and diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease: 'So far I have not seen any conclusive evidence to that effect and, as I understand the position, there is still some argument on the question.' The Leader of the Opposition today is like his predecessor of yore. Mr Abbott's denial of the science of climate change is the modernday equivalent of Billy Snedden's denial of the link between smoking and cancer. In Merchants of Doubt, Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway document some remarkable parallels between the debate over climate change and earlier debates over tobacco smoking, acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer. In each case, those opposed to action tried to sow doubt. Oreskes and Conway quote a 1969 memo in which a tobacco industry executive makes clear the strategy: 'Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the minds of the public.' As late as 1995, Senator Minchin doubted the link between smoking and adverse health effects, yet even he has now come around. If a warhorse like Senator Minchin can change his mind and accept the science, there is hope for anyone. The Leader of the Opposition wrote in his book Battlelines: Conservatism prefers facts to theory, practical demonstration to metaphysical abstraction; what works to what's in the mind's eye … Conservatives are not optimists or pessimists but Indigenous realists. On both climate change and smoking, the science is settled-and the solutions are clear. All that stands in the way are big polluters and big tobacco. I know there are some in the Liberal and National Parties who are concerned about going cold turkey on accepting donations from big tobacco. But I can assure them that we will help them through this. We can offer them counselling. We will walk them through this. And they will have the best nicotine patch of all: the knowledge that they have, at long last, done the right thing for the health of young Australians. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (11:45): This motion is a desperate attempt by this government to divert the attention of Australians from its many failures and from its proposed tax attack on Australian families and businesses. The coalition has a proven track record of decisive action in reducing the rate of smoking in Australia and whilst in government presided over the biggest ever fall in smoking rates. As a result, Australia now has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world. This is not an argument about the consequences or effects of smoking on people's health; it is an argument about the rights of individuals and private companies to make donations to whichever political party they so wish. Donations to political parties are often subject to much discussion, but if a legal business wishes to donate funds to a political party of its choice, it is up party organisation to decide whether or not to accept those donations. As former Prime Minister John Howard once stated, if donations were given by corporations and individuals carrying on lawful activities there is no reason in principle why the donations should not be accepted. Is the government really suggesting that they too discriminate in whom they receive donations from? There will always be differing opinions between individuals and groups, based upon many different factors. Therefore, it cannot be argued that a party is influenced by one or any of its benefactors. Previous speakers have mentioned that the coalition parties have received donations from tobacco companies over the last 10 or 12 years. Equally, the Labor Party has received large donations from its trade union supporters. In fact, over the period 2007 to 2010, it received in excess of $20 million in donations from the union movement. It is interesting to note that in the recent budget the union movement was rewarded with a $10 million allocation for a trade union education foundation grant. Previous to that there was another $10 million allocated to the union movement under the Building Australia's Future Workforce program. Equally, if we go a little bit further back in time, we see that the ALP is hypocritical in pursuing this motion when you consider its historical dealings with the Australian National Audit Office in 1993, with a lease that was above market rates of rent and above market rates of annual increases, the end result being that Australian taxpayers have paid more than $36 million over and above the standard market rates of rent for the period of the lease. The Leader of the Opposition has a strong track record in relation to dealing with the health issues faced from smoking. When health minister, he was responsible for the to the introduction of the graphic warnings on cigarette packets that we see today. That was made compulsory. Under the coalition government smoking rates declined from a bit over 21 per cent in 1998 to approximately 17 per cent in 2007. These rates were the lowest smoking rates in the world. It was also the coalition that first proposed an increase in the tobacco excise, back in 2009, a measure that has now been adopted by the government. Any suggestion that we are soft on tobacco companies is just plain nonsense, and the coalition's track record shows this quite clearly. Accepting donations from a particular corporation or organisation does not mean that a party changes its views. Any party should be able to accept donations from any local business or other organisation.",52
24,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES," I, too, like all the others on this side, rise in support of this motion. I am very pleased to do so on the eve of World No Tobacco Day, which will be observed tomorrow, 31 May, all around the globe, when the message will be given that smoking kills. Certainly, it very special message to younger people who have not taken up the habit yet but are being influenced by tobacco companies through their marketing, their packaging and through the colours on the packets. It is a message to them not to take up smoking, because we all know that tobacco kills. I say this because tomorrow it will be seven years since I gave up. I was an addicted smoker-two packets a day-and I thought I would never give up. The damage that that has done to my body over a period of 30 years of smoking I cannot wish upon anyone. So I am very passionate about this debate. I cannot believe what I am hearing from the opposite side this morning. Their argument about not supporting plainpackaged products is that the Labor Party receives donations from the unions. I say 'big deal'. I would much rather receive donations from an organisation that sticks up for workers' rights than from an organisation that is selling a product that is doing damage to people's health and that is trying to their product to younger people, because that is the only new client they have here in Australia. I would rather receive donations from an organisation that assists peopleworkers-to ensure that they have rights at work. I have no problems with that. They can put up that argument as much as they like, but it is a non-argument; it is just a diversion from the real debate. The real debate is that they are receiving donations from companies that sell a product that is damaging people's health. These companies are looking at marketing their product to new clients, and their only new clients are teenagers and young people. With the laws in Australia not allowing the advertising of tobacco products, their only way of marketing is through packaging. This may not be about people giving up, but it is is a fundamental when it comes to people taking up smoking. Packaging is the last bastion of marketing that the tobacco companies have left to them. It is absolutely devastating to know that there are still three million Australians who smoke and put their lives at risk every day and put the lives of others at risk through passive smoking. Smoking affects not just the people who light up but also their friends, families and workplace colleagues-and the consequences for their health can have an impact on their employment as well. Smoking damages not just you but everyone around you. Regardless of how many times you hear it, it is still a shocking statistic that 15,000 Australians die each year as a direct result of cigarette smoking-let alone the people who are dying indirectly from many other causes of tobacco smoking as well. That is 41 people dying every single day directly as a consequence of their smoking. And the Liberal and National parties on the other side are saying it is fine to receive donations from companies that contribute to market these 15,000 deaths every year here in Australia. I am very pleased to speak in support of this motion. Recognising that there is a serious problem is the most fundamental step towards addressing it. In fact, this government is already showing the strongest possible leadership on this issue. As we all know, we have introduced the world's first plain packaging to help people realise what putting a cigarette in their mouth really means: it means you are gambling with your life. I took up smoking when I was a teenager. Without a shadow of a doubt, if the packaging then looked like the plain packaging that we are going to have now, I would have thought twice about whether it was really something cool that I wanted to take up. This is what we are trying to get through to people. That could have saved me from 30 years of smoking and all the damage it has done to me. This is incredibly important because we know that eight out of 10 new smokers are young people. This is who the packaging is aimed at. We know that packaging and branding form a significant part of that appeal to smoke. (Time expired)",54
25,Mr SIMPKINS,COMMITTEES," I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. There is no doubt that the coalition is the party of effective action on smoking. Our leader, the Hon. Tony Abbott, acted to achieve great reductions in smoking rates when he was the health minister in the Howard government. The efforts of the Howard government on this issue are without peer. I remind members that the graphic health warnings that were introduced by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister in the Howard government remain the only substantial effort made by a federal government to reduce smoking rates in recent history. In 1998 the smoking rate in this country was 22 per cent. By 2005 it had fallen to 17 per cent-the lowest on record and one of the lowest in the world. The Howard government was responsible for this through decisive initiatives and anti-smoking campaigns. I am proud to be part of the coalition, which has acted decisively and effectively with initiatives to reduce smoking rates. This is backed up by clear evidence on these matters. I say again that the Howard government was capable of making decisions and acting decisively with regard to policy and initiation of action. I am afraid the only thing this government is capable of is politicking. I have provided evidence of this. Last week in parliament the health minister made a number of false accusations about the coalition when she suggested that she was going to introduce legislation on the plain packaging of cigarettes and tobacco. We hold true to our position that we will consider all legislation when we have seen the detail. We will make a decision when we see the bill and any regulations proposed. This is the right course of action. But I remain a little concerned about whether we will see such legislation, because the government's only real skill is in politicking, not the delivery of programs. There is great hypocrisy within this government. They make a very poor attempt to castigate us for waiting to see this legislation. But, given their failure to deliver workable, effective and cost-efficient legislation on border control, pink batts, capital funding and set-top boxes, there is every reason to be careful about backing anything this failure of government proposes. The Australian people expect the opposition to be critical of any legislation the government proposes, let alone legislation that, it appears, does not even exist yet. I would like to address the health issues inherent in this motion. We all care greatly about improving the health outcomes for Australians. I hope this is a priority for the government-because it is certainly a priority for the coalition. If we had an Abbott government, we would have seen action since the report on smoking issues was handed down in July 2009. Instead, we have seen several announcements, claims of action coming and claims of legislation coming et cetera. This is typical of this government. If this government is so committed to action on health, why hasn't it acted since July 2009. It has been almost two years and the only thing the government has done is this political stunt motion. This is a suggestion that we might actually see legislation in July-by the second anniversary of this report, we might actually see this government bring some legislation into the House of Representatives. This demonstrates the government's idea of priorities. Instead of being concerned enough about the health of Australians to take action in July 2009, they wait two years and instead make a priority of bringing this pathetic political stunt before the House. The Gillard government, faced with an opportunity to address a health problem, decided to do nothing for two years. Trying to score political points is more important to them than any legislation, so that is what they do instead of bringing legislation to the House today. This is the priority for this government: delay and politics instead of real action. The difference between the Labor Party and the coalition is that we actually accomplished something: we did the graphic warnings and we reduced the smoking rate. I note that this motion mentions that there are three million Australian smokers and 1,500 of them die each year from smoking. I am surprised that, after two years of talking about action and only now suggesting action in July 2011, the government would mention the number of people who actually die each year from smoking. I say again that I am proud of the coalition's record and I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was health minister in the Howard government, acted to reduce smoking rates. Many people's lives were saved as a result of us taking real action as opposed to the tragic alternative strategy of this government, which was to wait two years and play politics-and maybe there might be some legislation coming towards us in July.",56
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Order! It being 12 noon, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34.

27,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," The breakdown in a relationship too often leads to a phase of adult war. Logic and fairness is overridden by emotional issues. Inevitably, the child becomes the collateral damage-the victim of the conflict. Laws that have correctly been put in place to protect those at risk-in particular, to protect women from violence and to protect children from any number of transgressions-have now empowered parents in conflict to use all too often with the aid of aggressive legal practitioners the laws that should be there to protect those at risk as strategic attack weapons to most often put the father in an impossible position to defend. It is understandable that when these protective measures were first implemented the initial flow of genuine cases and distressing stories led those working in the Family Court to become predisposed to prejudging any male coming before them. This syndrome of using well-intentioned laws to disadvantage the father in a parental war has taken some time to be realised. The wisdom of Solomon is so easily recalled in such events, when a parent employing such tactics is choosing to cut the child in half is therefore not the real and caring parent. Rarely does a week go by in which there is not a significant event involving a parent feeling so disempowered to effect their desires to co-parent after the breakdown of a marriage that a breaking point is reached, sometimes with the most unimaginably tragic consequences. One, in absolute desperation, climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge and brought the city to a standstill. The only triumph was his voice finally being heard. The unfortunate reality in these dramatic episodes is that they are the tip of the iceberg. These are pleas from those feeling that they have no voice as a result of the system. They are certainly not faultless, but such acts of desperation can only be a reminder of a process that is felt by many to be unfair or, perhaps, even unjust. Our laws and the interpretation of those laws must protect those who are vulnerable. There also should be provisions that severely punish with costs both the professionals and the partners who seek to corrupt the process by inappropriately using such laws for their commercial advantage or to inflict hurt on their former partner by depriving contact with their child. The unintended consequences when the focus is to hurt the former partner is that the children become the collateral damage and a different form of family violence is perpetrated on the children by those who may have the purest of intention. Emotional turmoil destroys their judgment and their first obligation as a parent. I have some serious concerns with the broadening of the definition of violence to effectively include any act of disagreement or anger in any relationship that involves children. All of us in this place and throughout Australia will know that raising children can sometimes be as challenging as and it is rewarding. The pressure that it puts on relationships is evidenced by the ever increasing rates of divorce and separation. Coupled with this expansion of the definition and a reduction in the court's ability to punish incorrect allegations equals a misuse of laws put in place to protect the vulnerable. Well-intentioned laws are taken advantage of for personal gain. We should certainly be mindful of what is actually happening through the empowerment of those who will act contrary to the best interests of the child to fight their personal wars. Every effort should be made to guard against this from occurring. Of course, this is by no means occurring on every occasion. The men who do perpetrate violence on defenceless women and children are the most cowardly members of our society. However, it is dangerous to implement a wide-ranging law to treat all men as perpetrators of violence and not recognise that some men would never raise a hand and could themselves be victims of emotional violence. Such a law will not facilitate the desired result for the protection of the vulnerable and fair access to family structures that our society is based upon. This bill is a step in the right direction, and I commend the coalition amendments to the House.",57
28,Ms LEY,BILLS," I am pleased to speak on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and other measures) Bill 2011. This bill amends part VII of the Family Law Act 1975, dealing with children, to enable the courts and the family law system to respond more effectively to parenting cases involving violence or allegations of violence. Family violence exists and it is a reality. Every practitioner who deals with separating couples needs to have an awareness of this issue. Does violence exist and, if so, how are the already complex circumstances of separation and alternative dispute resolution managed in light of it? In some circumstances where violence is present, mediation is just not an option. Clarity and consistency around the definition of family violence is critically important, not least because the recipients of public funds who work in this area must be able to demonstrate what they do and what they achieve. In the public discourse, violence can be characterised as someone else's faultsomething a person is driven to by their partner, outside circumstances, ill health, stress or some other factor. Family violence is unacceptable and there is never an excuse for it. No-one in today's society should have to spell out why. Apart from the threat to safety, the mental and physical pain and anguish, and the sheer psychological damage violence does to the people who are on the receiving end-and in part to those who perpetrate it-front and centre of its negative effect is the message it gives to children, who, while they may not actually have their physical safety threatened, are too often severely affected. Witnessing violence in an ongoing parental relationship teaches children that it is a valid transaction-one they may need at some stage to employ. It is no secret that violent patterns of behaviour are passed down through generations. Women and men fleeing violent relationships often say to me that the final reason they left a violent partner was the lesson they were unwittingly teaching their children that it is okay to do this and okay to have it done to you. Society has come a long way since the days when family violence was never admitted to, never spoken of in polite company, and when women-and it was usually women-suffered in silence, simply getting up the next day to face the world as if nothing had happened. I worry that in some of our more rural areas, where help is not readily available, in small towns where everyone knows who you are, this is still happening. This is why the resources that go into Lifeline and telephone counselling are so important. In my electorate of Farrer we have excellent agencies, people and programs to assist separating couples. I acknowledge the Family Relationship Centre in Wodonga, which looks after a wide area including Albury and surrounds. Family relationship centres were introduced by the Howard government and there are 67 across Australia. Their task is to support a shift away from the courts and into the community as the place to deal with family breakdown. Since its conception in 2007, the Wodonga Family Relationship Centre has dealt with 1,367 cases-and of those, 635 have been identified has having family violence present. This centre is clearly highly significant, particularly because it enables early screening and assessment of cases and recommends the right kind of intervention, mediation or, sadly, in some cases, no mediation but referral to police or courts. The average time the centre spends with families is three months but for some families it but could be up to eight or nine months. The centre has approximately 286 parenting plans and many families have been happy just to discuss their situation with a neutral person present. The success of the family relationship centre I believe is its unique model that allows for families to determine their own arrangements. Where family violence is identified the centre is able to offer support and safe and comfortable conversations, and it can tailor its service delivery to respond the needs of a family. I also recognise the work of Upper Murray Family Care in Albury and Wodonga, which runs counselling programs and the children's contact service. I support the work of Betty's Place Women's Refuge which provides support, counselling and advocacy to women very much. I note, however, that there is nowhere to go for men who have been subject to family violence. In Broken Hill I acknowledge the role of Catherine Haven Women's Refuge and the Family Support Service of Broken Hill and District as well as the family support and crisis workers in other organisations across my electorate, such as Centacare and Anglicare. Intereach, based in Deniliquin, has early intervention as their key focus but unfortunately there are very limited counselling options. There is no specialised family violence counsellor in town. A family violence funded worker comes to visit from Albury-Wodonga, some 2½ hours away. Their role is predominantly that of court support worker. They do offer a family support program and have around 20 families they are assisting. Not all of these are victims of domestic violence. They suspect that the increase in cases being reported is to do with enhanced promotion of services available. When people require more intensive, achieved professional assistance it can be a very long wait. There are waiting lists of six-plus months at Echuca for an appointment with a psychologist. In regional and particularly remote areas such as the far west, Family Violence Prevention Legal Services find difficulty attracting staff because they are unable to offer legal practitioners the salaries they can earn in the city. In looking at this particular bill, I do so to with a strong view that our system of laws, no less than our system of community support, must respond first and foremost to the needs of the child. The bill proposes an amendment which requires the court, when determining what is in a child's best interests, to give greater weight to the primary consideration that protects the child from harm where there is inconsistency in applying the two primary considerationsthe other being the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. This amendment would appear to be superfluous as the act already gives effect to the principle of paramountcy of the best interests of the child. Are we therefore supposed to conclude that there are serious shortcomings with the existing system that need to be fixed up when there are not? It is the best interests of the child that has led to the much misunderstood 'presumption of shared parenting', as it is often described, and the associated view that somehow each parent is entitled to 50 per cent care of their child. These concepts were never about parental entitlement; they merely recognised what I believe to be a self evident fact-that it is in the best interests of children to have a productive relationship with both parents. This means spending time with both parents, and that neither parent should stand in the way of that. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report, Every picture tells a story, unanimously stated: We are convinced that sharing responsibility is the best way to ensure as many children as possible grow up in a caring environment. To share all the important events in a child's life both mum and dad, even when families are separated, would be an ideal outcome. Of course, shared parenting is not always possible and family violence may well be a reason. Partners who commit violence deal themselves out of negotiations about shared parenting. But it has to be said that there are vexatious claims about violence, generally made by women about men for a variety of reasons. We cannot escape this fact, and having spoken to people who work in children's contact services, I know of many examples. This does not for a moment diminish the tragedy of the cases that are real and I understand, too, that some partners may believe there to be a real threat of violence when a reasonable person would not conclude such a thing. I appreciate that different types of behaviour provoke different responses and reactions from those on the receiving end of them but we nevertheless must accept that claims about violence made for strategic rather than genuine reasons are a feature of the family law landscape today. This bill seeks to change the definition of violence and I have concerns about that change. It changes a reasonable person test to a subjective test. The existing test is broad; the proposed test is too broad and may well admit claims that, while appalling behaviour is not in the interests of children, it should nevertheless not be described as violence. I am not convinced of the merits of this amendment and I await the outcome of the Senate committee inquiry. The bill also seeks to repeal the so-called 'friendly parent provision', which currently requires family courts to consider the willingness of one parent towards facilitating the other parent to have a meaningful relationship with their child. This provision has been criticised by some as discouraging with parents' disclosures of family violence and child abuse for fear of being found to be 'unfriendly'. I do not agree that this provision needs to be repealed; its proper application is nothing to fear. Running active interference against the other parent should count against you and, if there is a valid reason for not cooperating, then it will not count against you. The failure of one parent to facilitate a relationship between a child and a separated parent is a factor that courts absolutely should uncover. There can be no reason for a parent's obstructive behaviour to be excluded from consideration. The bill proposes to repeal the section which provides for mandatory costs orders where a party knowingly makes a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. It should be noted that the test put forward is a tough one: a mandatory costs order cannot arise from evidence that was given recklessly or without belief-in other words, it applies to knowingly false evidence. If a court were prepared to make such a finding, there is no reason why a costs order should not follow. We should not seek to disturb this state of affairs. I have highlighted key areas where the opposition does not agree with the government on this bill. The Senate committee report is due on 23 June and will no doubt inform further deliberations in the other place. It must be stated that there are substantial areas where we are in substantial agreement with the government. These capture the seriousness of family violence and child abuse, the need to put children's interests first and the need for courts to take prompt and appropriate action in his area. All members of this place recognise that family law is no place for politics, no place for grandstanding and no place for point scoring. The careful consideration of the matters raised by the Attorney-General, the shadow Attorney-General and members and senators is to be commended. Having said that, it is unfortunate that early intervention relationship services run by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs have suffered a nine per cent cut in the budget and the family relationship centres have had a four per cent cut. For those of us who have been through the pain of family breakdown, experienced the sheer no-win nature of it and watched helplessly at the damage done to the people we love, these are never easy issues. I believe governments should step into this arena with reluctance. But step in we must, primarily because this is a time when families stop talking to each other, stop listening to each other and often stop putting the needs of their children first. Family law legislation has to get the balance right, but governments also have a responsibility to make sure there is sufficient funding of programs that help separating couples. This help is invaluable. Too often in my rural and regional electorate I hear of waiting lists for counselling and mediation. When families are in crisis they often just cannot wait. We have a desperate shortage of children's counsellors, a specialised and incredibly important group of psychologists. Children must be able to express their feelings in a safe place in a safe way when their whole world is falling apart. A delay of even a fortnight, which may be acceptable when making appointments with other health professionals, is an unacceptable delay at this time. I support the amendment to be moved by the member for Stirling and I await the outcome of the Senate inquiry.",59
29,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS," In addressing the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011, I have come to understand how the citizens of Troy must have felt when they were greeted with the gift of a giant wooden horse, because this bill is not what it appears. It is a Trojan horse. Just like the giant wooden horse, full of Greek warriors, in Greek legend and like an insidious computer virus, full of malicious code, this Trojan bill is loaded with consequences that will undermine some of the most basic human rights for both parents and children, and particularly fathers. Family law is a very difficult area to legislate. There is no escaping the fact that every family is different. To create legislation that caters to all circumstances is an unlikely quest. In most circumstances, there are no winners in family law. Family breakdowns are messy. They are hurtful. They are spiteful. They are emotional, irrational and painful. The holy grail of relationship breakdowns, the amicable divorce, is rarer than a kept Labor promise. It is in this emotionally charged atmosphere that mothers and fathers interact and children are bystanders, often witnessing behaviour by their parents at their very worse. Make no mistake: I do not object to the face-value intentions of some of the amendments in this bill. We cannot question the need to hold a child's safety in the highest regard when it comes to custody arrangements. But we can question why these amendments are being made. The current act, introduced by the Howard government in 2006, created the 'twin pillars' of parenting provisions. These measures recognised two primary considerations for determining the best interests of the child. The twin pillars were: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of his or her parents and (b) the need to protect the child from harm or from being exposed to abuse, neglect and/or violence-I repeat: the need to protect the child from harm. Safety concerns for the child are already in the existing legislation. is one of two primary considerationsconsiderations that, yes, are given equal weight. But, in addition, the current act specifically states in section 60CG that a court must ensure that a parenting order: (a) Is consistent with any family violence order; and (b) Does not expose a person to an unacceptable risk of family violence. Protection is already provided for in the act. What this amendment proposes to do is to take a George Orwell approach to ranking considerations. When Orwell's animals in his classic novel Animal Farm draft their legislation on the barn wall, they affirm that 'All animals are equal'. The pigs then make an amendment: 'But some animals are more equal than others'. The pigs, of course, had an ulterior motive and I fear that there is one at play here as well. What these amendments are saying is, 'Yes, the two considerations are primary, but one is more primary than the other.' What the bill does in reality is to retain child safety as a primary concern while relegating the child's parental relationships to a minor concern. It sounds innocent enough, I suppose, but the Trojan horse here is a facade of enhancing child safety. The bill is dressed up as an attempt to protect children, which is a pointless exercise, because child safety is fully ensured in the current act. What is inside this Trojan horse, the malicious code that will infect society, is an attempt to undermine equal access for both parents. This change would invite the court to ignore the requirement to consider the second pillarthe benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. The Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland is concerned about giving greater weight to the second of the primary considerations. In their submission to the It Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, they said: 'Such a provision removes the court's licence to assess in each individual case the degree of risk, its probability or, in the case of family violence, its context in terms of frequency, intensity and recency in the determination of the weight to be given to such risk or harm.' This bill would mean that any inference of violence, proven or unproven, would have to be taken into consideration, however vexatious the claims may be. The potential danger of this change is apparent when viewed in conjunction with other changes proposed in this bill. The broadened definition of 'family violence' would mean that a wide range of everyday activities could potentially be construed as violence. The broader definition includes as violence such things as repeated derogatory taunts. Under the proposed definition, much of what happens right here in the parliament would be construed as violence. Also included as violence is this little nugget: 'preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends, or culture.' Under this broad definition, a parent could not prevent a young teenager from spending 20 hours a day talking to friends on Facebook, for fear of being accused of family violence. What happens when a parent acts in a way that a reasonable person would describe as good parenting? What happens when a father says to his 13-year-old daughter, 'No, you can't go to Julia's party because there will be alcohol and no adult supervision'? I will tell you what happens. An upset teenage daughter talks to a vindictive mother, who then claims the daughter is a victim of family violenceand it is their right under this definition. Another child loses the right to have a meaningful relationship with her parent. Under this definition, a parent would be too scared to ground a child as punishment for bad behaviour, for fear of 'depriving a family member of his or her liberty.' The sheer magnitude of this definition presents two problems. The most immediate problem is that living an ordinary life can too parent. easily be construed as family violence. Adding fuel to the fire will be the actions of hurt, emotional, and spiteful former partners in stretching the truth. Tripping over the family dog will suddenly become 'intentionally injuring an animal'. Using a few poorly-chosen words a few times in an argument-which most families have experienced-will constitute family violence as 'repeated derogatory taunts'. This definition would allow everyday actions to be seized, twisted, exaggerated and used as family violence weapons in the court. What this change does is broaden the definition of family violence so much that the word 'violence' loses all real meaning. That would be a tragedy, because it would also water down the perception of family violence. I believe that violence is violence. Violence is cruel and harmful. It is a serious problem in some families and a serious problem in the wider society. But violence is not 'grounding' a child. It is not protecting your child. Being a good parent is not being a violent parent. There is a simple solution stop such things being interpreted as family violence. That is the 'reasonable person' test. Such a test demands that for an action to be deemed as violence it must be an action that requires a person 'reasonably to fear' for their personal safety and well-being. This is precisely the meaning and interpretation that this legislation strips out of the act. Is this bill more than it appears at face value? Is it another Trojan horse? I say it is most certainly a Trojan horse. On face value, the broadened definition of 'family violence' creates the illusion of providing greater protection against family violence. Yes, that is a lovely wooden horse but let's take a look inside. Maybe not, because inside this Trojan is malicious code that gives one parent an arsenal of weapons to be misused in court to deprive the other parent of their right to be a Earlier in this debate we heard the Minister for the Status of Women tell this parliament that no-one uses claims of family violence in such a way. I have some very bad news for the minister: it actually does happen. It happens every day; and if she is not aware of it happening then she is gravely out of touch with reality. If the minister does not have any contact with her own constituents, perhaps she could spend a few minutes at her laptop doing some research. Here is the sort of thing that you can find in two minutes: the newspaper headline 'Ugly feud fought on Facebook'. The article tells about a Family Court hearing late last year. At the end it says: She had already strung the case out by falsely claiming her ex-husband had been sexually assaulting their children after one judgment went against her. Then she falsely claimed the father's new wife had been assaulting them. 'The mother has over the years attempted to manipulate the court system,' Justice Barry said. That is just one case that can be found with to two minutes of Google research, and yet the minister came into this House and said that making false allegations of family violence and using family violence as a weapon in the courts is a myth. Do some homework, Minister. The fact that this minister has told a lie to this parliament",62
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member will withdraw.,65
31,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS,"I will withdraw, but I will say that the minister has told an untruth to this parliament. It is clearly not true to say that it is a myth. It is clearly not true to say",65
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member will return to the bill before him.,65
33,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS,"I am, because the minister has told this House that it is a myth that family violence is misused by people in the Family Court. The fact is that it is not a myth and you can see that from a bit of research. Abuse of the system is why we have organisations like Lone Fathers, Dads on the Air, Fathers Online, Fathers 4 Equality, Men's Rights and so on. If we look closely at these groups, there is a common theme. It is a theme that helps explain why this malicious code is being pushed into the act. These are groups set up by fathers. We can talk all we want about custodial parents and non-custodial parents, but the truth is that most custodial parents are mothers and most non-custodial parents are fathers. There are no winners in family law. All parents in family law become losers one way or the other, but some who are bigger losers than others. The current act helped to bring some equality to family law. It created the two pillars, one of which recognised the benefits to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. These amendments are a backward step. They will strip fathers of their right to be fathers. amendments will allow abuse of the system that will create another generation of stolen children. I do not know where the government obtains feedback on the practicalities of family law and family law disputes, but I get my feedback from constituents. I talk to real people who are affected by real situations. I have conversations with fathers who are getting the roughest end of the pineapple. They are grieving fathers who have lost children through the courts. They are devastated and frustrated. They are good men who love their children and want to maintain a relationship with their own flesh and blood-something that should be a basic right. Some of these men are on the edge. They are driven insane by the lack of justice in the system. They are left in the wilderness, robbed of basic rights and family and, with no support from our legal system, these fathers are driven to despair, driven to the brink of insanity. And if the minister wants to continue her research, she might discover what happens when fathers are placed in a hopeless situation where justice is lost through abuse of the system-which she claims is a myth. When fathers are driven to insanity, they do insane things. I can, in no way, condone the actions of men who, in the face of losing everything, choose to take everything. They do take their own lives and, very sadly, sometimes in the insanity that they are engulfed in, they take the lives of their children. I note that this is not purely a male response, given that there are numerous examples, including some recent cases, of non-custodial mothers doing the same thing. Family violence is a terrible thing, but so are the actions of fathers driven to the brink. These amendments will do nothing to stop family violence-we already have good measures in place-but they will drive more These fathers to the brink. If these amendments drive fathers to the brink, we should be asking who is at the wheel. Is the Minister for the Status of Women at the wheel? Is the Labor-Greens government at the wheel? I suspect that there is a strong feminist ideology driving these amendments. It is feminist ideology that has created this malicious code to rob men of their rights to be fathers. It is feminist ideology that has dressed up this malicious code to rob children of their right to have a father in lives. It is feminist ideology that has dressed up this malicious code to create the illusion of acting to stop family violence. I note that included with these changes is one that repeals the 'friendly parent' provisions from the additional considerations for determining a parenting order. The friendly parent provision encourages amicable behaviour among parents. It fosters friendly relationships with all parties. Most importantly, the friendly parent provision assists a court to meet the first pillar of parenting provisions-the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of its parents. This provision has helped more fathers maintain meaningful relationships with their children and, at the same time, it has discouraged parents from abusing the system. But justice and maintenance of rights for fathers is an affront to this feminist ideology from this government. What a clever way to rob men and rob fathers of their rights! Surely no-one would vote against amendments aimed at protecting children and preventing family violence. But that is not what these amendments are really about. There is already protection in the current at. The fact is that these amendments actually trivialise what is a very serious matter-that being family violence. The broadened definition of 'family violence' waters down the meaning of violence and will, in effect, make family violence more acceptableprecisely the opposite of the purported aim of these amendments. These amendments should be seen for what they are. They are a Trojan horse, full of malicious code designed to deprive fathers of their rights. The best thing we can do to protect the safety of children and to prevent family violence is to leave this act as it is. (Time expired)",65
34,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I can their think of no more significant thing that we can do in this place and, more importantly, what each of us as Australians can do outside of this place-whether we are members of parliament or whatever-than work to keep families together. That is, I would argue, the most significant goal that we could have in our society and in our community. Over centuries, our community has built its stability on having stable families, and we should do whatever we can in this place to strengthen families. Government from time to time may think that it can do things that take away from families, but I know one thing-and Ronald Reagan said it-and that is that government can never replace family. I am sure members of the House would agree with that. The matters that we are dealing with here with this bill, the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011, are difficult and emotional and cause all sorts of harms. There are never any easy solutions and outcomes but, while we wrestle around these measures in this place, I would hope that all of us here are trying to get a better outcome for families and for children in particular. My colleague, the father of the House, the member for Berowra, was the architect of the 2006 changes to the Family Law Act, in his capacity as Attorney-General. He knows better than most the challenges it poses and he certainly was not wrong when he observed that this is a very delicate issue. The fact is that the law deals with the sobering realities of broken relationships. It attempts to traverse an emotional minefield where the stakes are high. The issue is fuelled by strong feelings on all sides. There are high levels of conflict and certainly no easy solutions. Seeking objectivity can be very difficult where the bond between a parent and their child is subject to such scrutiny. This is why the coalition is committed to ensuring that, at the heart of every dispute, the focus remains on the safety and well-being of the child. As people attempt to overcome their hurt and confusion and to work through their issues with a partner, a wife or a husband, there is a risk that, in the heat of the moment, a child can become a pawn-a mechanism used to hurt, to punish and to seek revenge. We have seen this played out all too sadly all too recently. This is not always a conscious or deliberately malicious act, but the outcome is the same. Often parents are acting with what they think are the right intentions, but the law must ensure the needs of their child do not become confused or supersede their own. It is important that children grow up knowing both parents. I believe a child should have the right to both parents-a mother and a father-to as great an extent as is possible and practical. But this must never come at the expense of the child's safety. Noone can claim any perfect solution because there is not one-simple as that. There are no two cases the same, so there is an overriding need for flexibility. To test this law we need to look at worse case scenarios, to contemplate the darkest, ugliest part of the human condition. It is not comfortable. The issues are emotionally fraught and can be confronting. But to safeguard every child in this nation we are required to do just that in order to ensure the right checks and balances are in place to protect children, even when their parents cannot. The Family Law Act was enacted to protect the defenceless at the height of their vulnerability, when society's fabric has been irrevocably torn. Each child has a right to be safe and secure and that is the underlying premise of the act. To suggest any other ulterior motive is simply wrong. There may be room for improvement. The act may not always produce the outcomes we seek, but I am concerned that these amendments may only serve to create more confusion when we ought to be seeking clarity. However, I am open to the discussion and to listening to the points that are raised. Provided a child is safe, they should be able to grow up knowing both their mother and their father and enjoying a fulfilling relationship with each. The act as it stands upholds this principle. We should seek to encourage negotiation, not litigation, wherever we can. The coalition's approach has been, wherever possible, to get these matters out of the courts. The Howard government funded Family Relationship Centres across the nation and they were in high demand. I pay tribute to those who work in the centre at Caringbah. There was a very clear and deliberate focus on empowering people to work through their issues collaboratively and constructively amongst themselves. A report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies in late 2009 found that overall the clients of postseparation services looked upon those of the relationship centres favourably. Over 70 per cent of clients who had used the family relationship centres and dispute resolution mechanisms said the service was fair. One in two said the service gave them the help they needed. Similarly, the professionals working within these services believe their capacity to assist clients, to help parents work through their issues together, was high. But tellingly they flagged the frustrations over long waiting times, resourcing and recruitment issues. Obviously not every case can be resolved in this way, but where these issues can be worked through, where a child can continue to grow in their relationship with both parents, surely that is preferable. It begs the question: why then is the government cutting funding to initiatives that have a clear and proven track record? Not only that, as the member for Berowra noted, the government is in fact boosting funding for legal aid in family disputes. To pull funding from initiatives that are making a real difference is very disappointing. In pursuing these amendments the government is in very real danger of driving these problems back through the courts as the preferred option and undoing what progress we have made since 2006. The proposed legislation seeks to broaden definitions, widen the range of claims that can be made and extend the grounds upon which people can dispute and bicker. The member for Blair raised a valid point when he said: In fact family violence, as people know, occurs in many ways. That includes not just physical assault but dominating, controlling behaviours; stalking; friendship isolation; familial isolation; emotional manipulation; financial harassment; and cultural isolation. We as a society need to be aware of this and ever-vigilant. The member for Blair went on to observe that: We need to protect children from these types of activities. We need to protect spouses as well, if we can. On that point, I do not believe there is any disagreement. The Family Law Act has never been about ignoring violence. Domestic violence is appalling. In my own electorate in the Sutherland Shire there were 501 reported incidents of assault relating to domestic violence last year alone in our local government area. That is 501 cases too many. Sadly, it will not be 501 cases that can now be avoided. These things weigh heavily on us all when we think about these matters-well more than one a day. Yes, the law must offer protection, but it should also offer protection from allegation and false accusation. Our legal system is a strong pillar of our democracy. We must trust that, should any threat of violence come into play, the Family Court would naturally take this into account and act in the best interests of the child. I believe the coalition got it largely right in 2006 when the Family Law Act was amended to include a presumption that parents equally share parental responsibility for their children. If there is evidence of violence, that presumption should not and will not apply. We cannot allow claims by either parent to be coloured by dissatisfaction or rage at a former partner or situation. The consequences of severing all contact between a child and a parent are significant and long-reaching. I agree with the member for Blair that this must only be a last resort, which is why the coalition will continue to fight the removal of the friendly parent provision requiring family courts to consider how willing a parent is to facilitate abuse; a positive relationship between the other parent and their child. Currently the courts are bound by a provision to make costs orders against a parent found to have knowingly made a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. By removing mandatory costs orders as a disincentive, you risk opening a Pandora's box of unsubstantiated and uncorroborated claims. The report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that more than two-thirds of those surveyed did not believe that the prospect of an adverse costs order had discouraged allegations of violence or child abuse that were genuinely held and likely to be true. That is not to say there are not occasions where this has weighed upon the minds of parents. There are unfortunately cases which, for whatever reasons, slip through the cracks. I have written to the Attorney-General, my neighbour across the river, on several occasions to raise these matters with him. I have always been pleased to receive a reply. I think that reflects his interest in these matters. I have made representations on behalf of my constituents in the shire on this very issue. A grandmother wrote to me expressing her concerns about the experiences a number of young mothers from the shire had had with the Family Court, including her own daughter. These cases involved allegations of abuse by spouses and the custody arrangements of their children. There were, to say the least, very difficult circumstances. My constituent wrote, and I think this is well worth noting the context of this debate: 'Mothers are, by nature, nurturers and children need to be protected from harm. It takes a lot of courage for a mother to leave an abuser and to try to keep herself and her children safe.' She observed that it had been her experience that the legal system empowers the abuser to continue the abuse through the court process and that the mother's and children's best interests are not being validated. My constituent spoke of the family law court making judgments favouring abusive men in shared parenting arrangements and of evidence dismissed against the perpetrators of violence. I raise that simply to raise the concerns a constituent and to put it in the mix of the debate. Admittedly no two cases are the same and certainly you do not change a law based on one set of circumstances. So, equally, I raise the case of a young man in my own electorate who has not missed one of his support payments, loves his kids deeply and is not the subject of any allegations of improper conduct, nor would he be I believe. He has not seen his daughter for two years. As a father of two daughters, I could not think of anything worse than not being able to see your daughters. He has custody arrangements that give him access to his daughter and he has not seen his daughter for two years. He is frustrated that the orders that he has are not being enforced, which is a complaint I hear regularly from constituents. I know it is not an easy matter, but when a father cannot see his daughters for two years and he has a legal right to see those daughters and that is not occurring, surely we must be looking at things that may assist in these cases. That father advocated to me a points system that would reward parents for meeting their financial obligations and penalise those who continually breached their custody arrangements or who denied a in former partner access visits. For what it is worth, I think these things should be considered for breaches of custody orders where one partner has denied another partner their legal access to their children-whether by wilful obstruction or non-compliance, or by seeking not to support the undertaking of orders. Clearly, we need to look at a system that will encourage compliance to ensure that children grow up knowing both of their parents wherever possible. Another constituent wrote to me observing: 'The safety of a child should be put before unsupervised time spent with an abusive parent. A child can have a meaningful relationship with both parents, of but if there are real issues of risk it must be undergoing supervision at final orders. Supervised access by a perpetrator of family violence would remove the child from exposure to destructive behaviours and the courts would not be placing a child back into a potentially unsafe situation at final orders.' She made the case that all officers, practitioners and advisers in the family law system should undergo mandatory training in the effects of family violence and abuse. This training, she argues, 'would be a valuable tool in recognising the tactics used to manipulate evaluators and judges or to intimidate the victim. Without domestic violence training of those serving the family law system, despite their years of experience, abusers may be judged time after time in the same way, which puts children at risk.' These are all valid considerations. There are things we could be doing better when it comes to family law. I have no doubt that is the case. It is like the ever-receding finish line, but it is one that we must continue to strive for and urged towards. I welcome discussion of this bill. We in this House are united in agreement about the need to protect and safeguard children, regardless of where we sit. No-one in this place would seek to suppress discussions that strive to better protect those most in need our help or to ensure that our families, wherever possible, can be held together. In the sad case where that is no longer possible, then we should seek to preserve as much of those relationships as possible. I do not believe that the amendments proposed by the government, in their current form, are the full answer at this point. Winding back the Ruddock reforms, measures that are proven to have made a difference, is very dangerous. It is important to note, as a word of caution, that opportunities to reach common ground and make constructive progress should not disintegrate into the slinging of mud and hurling of insults. This debate should not be a chance to take swipes at one other-the stakes are too high. This act has very real repercussions for the way our children live and how they grow up. I look forward to continuing this debate. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (12:47): The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 is an opportunity to place a spotlight on a whole range of issues that are not dealt with this in the bill. However, because of the way in which this bill has been constructed, what I am going to say is directly pertinent to it. On 19 May, a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, said that the New South Wales 'top cop': … is embarking on a personal crusade to tackle the hidden ''monster'' of child sexual abuse. Spurred by a spike in the report of assaults, particularly those that occur behind the closed doors of family homes, the Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione, has told the Herald the community can no longer afford to turn a blind eye. Mr Scipione said: This is a monster that is eating at the very of heart of our society and we cannot afford to pretend that it's not happening. … … … Published material is limited by legal obligations preventing the identification of victims. In the case of incest, identifying the offending family member would also identify the child. Last week there was a rally in front of Parliament House. The rally was held by Rally for Children's Safety, an alliance of community groups, to highlight research that has been done on the way in which children who may have been abused are dealt with under family law. For a long time, I have advocated that we need to again allow the press back into the family law courts. When I say 'again' that is misleading-they have never been allowed in. For many people the family law court has become a very dark place. Under its rules you may not talk or publish about it. Worse than that: it is the only court in the land which the press may not attend. As I said, I have made this statement loud and clear to all parts of society, because I believe that when you shut the press out a court can become a dark place. As I said, for many people it has become a dark place, and I think we need to let the light in. Like other members, I have constituents who come into my office and tell stories about how their children have been taken away from them. Recently, the number of mothers who come into my office exceeds the number of fathers, but it does not preclude fathers. I also have fathers who come in needing justice. The report of the House Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, in December 2003, Every picture tells a story, from which the 2006 reforms were put in place, advocated most strongly that family court business be referred to a tribunal and that a tribunal deal with most of the business that now comes before the family courts and that the family courts have a restricted jurisdiction. That recommendation was not taken up, but other recommendations were. I was part of the coalition party room that said we needed to do this. Professor Parkinson was also very involved. He was on radio the other day pointing out that so much more needs to be done-far beyond the extent of what is in this bill. I stress the importance the inquiry that is currently going on in the Senate. I note that a reference was attempted to be made to a relevant House of Representatives committee, but committee refused to take that reference because of the inquiry already going on in the Senate. The Senate committee was originally meant to report in July-I think it was on 23 July-but I note that they have now extended that until August. It is an inquiry which is attracting many submissions from people who see that the way in which the court currently operates does not meet the needs of children in particular. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, while doing a review of the 2006 reforms, found that 60 per cent of separated parents were in a friendly or cooperative relationship. Most separated parents are able to make parenting arrangements with little use of family law services or lawyers; however, for families where complex issues such as family violence, family safety issues, mental illness and substance addiction exists there is a high use of family relationships services, courts and lawyers. I refer to an inquiry I chaired back in 2006 of that looked into the impact of illicit drugs on families. I found that in any one year in excess of 266,000 complaints are made about the abuse of children. I know that today we have 35,000 children who are in out-of-home care. This great concern was echoed in the words of Commissioner Scipione when he spoke strongly about the need for us to be aware that there are such things as family violence and family abuse of children: Defying common misconceptions about 'stranger danger', many had to share a dinner table and bathroom with their abuser … That is a terrifying prospect. There is a need to investigate those allegations when they arise. Professor Parkinson, who has been very much involved in the issues of family of break-ups and dealing with the welfare of children, said on 25 May in an interview with Fran Kelly on ABC radio: There's much more we could be doing to improve that the system in terms of protecting kids and in protecting victims of violence … However, it requires resources and it requires services. Changing the Act only changes the margins because most cases are decided without a Judge. About 93per cent of cases are resolved without the Judge giving a judgement. Changing how Judges decide cases concerns only seven per cent of all the cases in the family law system. While these changes help, they don't really make a huge difference. What would make a huge difference is to have resources for investigation assessment at an early stage of the process. There does seem to be a real problem in getting evidence into the Family Court when allegations are made. Because of the closed nature of the court, we are unable to see patterns or reasons given. Often much of what happens in the court is not reflected in the transcript. So I think there is a desperate need to open up the courts like every other court. I think we learnt that from the court of Star Chamber, all those centuries ago, when it became a place of abused justice. It should have awakened us to the fact that we should never have imposed a ban on the press being allowed into the family law court. I am not suggesting for a moment that names should be published or that people should be photographed or identified. What I am saying is that cases should be able to be reported on if the names of the individuals concerned are suppressed. Then we could perhaps start to see patterns in the way the court operates and maybe we could see the need for change. Rather than having an assessment of what has happened after the event we could see what is happening in real time. In speaking to this bill I want to make two very strong points. I want to make the point that children in the current situation are in a position of danger. If you read some of the submissions to the Senate inquiry and you read the stories of heartbreak, you know that something needs to be done. If you read the analysis that we are only dealing with a small percentage of people who have marriage breakdowns and manage to cope, we are dealing with a relatively small percentage-seven per cent. If you listen to those on the front line-like Commissioner Scipione, like the Benevolent Society who says there is a desperate need for more reform, or like Professor Parkinson who says and that we need to go further-then the current Senate inquiry is very important. As the committee begins its public hearings and as we hear stories, I think we have to open our minds and say that we always have to be on the lookout for ways in which we can protect children. They are our most precious gift. We can look at the stories of young adults who have come out of abusive households. We can look at children who have been sexualised because of various practices which have unfortunately happened in the family home. These could have happened for all sorts of reasons, from mental illness through to drug and alcohol abuse; certainly, many of those were instanced in the inquiry that I chaired. We cannot have a closed mind and say, 'One solution is the solution for all time.' We have to keep looking at it. Most importantly, the plea I make today is the one that I have been making for a long time to a vast number of people, some of whom hopefully will pick it up: we need to open the family law court to allow the press in and allow the light to shine on what many parents feel is presently a very dark place.",66
35,Dr STONE,BILLS," I too rise to speak on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to protection for children and families at risk of violence and abuse, so it is a very significant bill and one that both sides of the House are most concerned to see is as right as it can possibly be. We need to have world's best practice in this area of legislation and we certainly do not need any part of this bill to be captured by minority groups who cannot justify their claims with facts or the realities of what happens throughout Australia. The bill makes several technical amendments which correct drafting and minor policy oversights and provide other efficiencies for the court and litigants. But we as the opposition are most concerned by some other amendments. The coalition reaffirms the 2006 reforms which we made. These were to help build healthy relationships and to try wherever possible to prevent the separation of parents, leading to the need for special arrangements for their children to live in different places. We to encourage greater involvement of both parents in their children's lives after separation but at the same time we knew we needed to protect children from violence and abuse that may have been occurring within the relationship. We wanted to help separated parents agree on what was best for their children, ideally through mediation or agreements outside the court system. We wanted to establish highly transparent and easily accessed services for families. We wanted those to be available and accessible in the regions as well as metropolitan areas and we wanted to be able to cut the red tape, the bureaucracy and the delays which make the trauma of family separation and the need to support children even more difficult. The proposed amendments in the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill include provision to give effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which decision makers may consider when dealing with children's matters. The convention requires that the best interests the child are considered first and foremost. Protection of the child from harm is therefore weighted above the child having a meaningful relationship with both parents if there is harm involved or threatened in that relationship. We argue that this need is already in the act and the amendment is not necessary. The existing legislation provides for the interests of the child to be paramount and take pre-eminence over the maintenance of a meaningful relationship between both parents. The bill aims to change the definition of family violence. The exposure draft definition of family violence includes behaviour that is emotionally, psychologically or economically abusive or threatening. Many stakeholders have voiced their concern that the extension or aimed generalising of the definition of family violence can lead to vexatious claims-that is, the use of this broad definition could more reflect the marital discord than the realities of abuse within the family. It is very important that we make sure the court always deals with facts rather than responding to children being used as weapons to inflict greater harm on an ex-partner. It must always be the case that claims are based on fact. When you have a broadening of a definition, as proposed, there is real concern about the opportunity for more vexatious claims to be made-claims not based on fact but relating to marital discord or ex-marital discord rather than the children's needs. The bill aims to repeal the 'friendly parent' provision. The bill aims to strengthen the obligations of lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and counsellors to prioritise the safety of children. Again, we argue that that is already in the act. The amendments repeal the provision for costs orders to be made in the case of false family violence allegations. We of wonder why you would want to do that. Surely this is a very common sense provision and it helps to make sure that we do not have claims being made which are more about the great hatred between the two partners than about reflecting the realities of family violence. The amendment also provides for simpler procedures for the participation of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings. Certainly that is a good idea. There are many forms of violent behaviour perpetrated against women in Australia and inevitably against their children. There is no doubt that we have a major problem in Australia in relation to domestic violence and sexual assault. In fact, it is one of the most pervasive and damaging forms of violence experienced across Australia and it has been for a very long time. I would like to say that evidence shows it is diminishing; unfortunately that is case. Violence not only affects the victims themselves, the partners, but invariably impacts on the children who are exposed to it and the extended families. We know there can be intergenerational abuse when a child learns in their household that striking out to cause physical harm, abuse and threats are ways to deal with frustrations rather than learning that there is an alternative way of dealing with the problems of life. We need to make sure our children are no longer seeing violence in their homes. One in three Australian women say they have experienced physical violence since the age of 15, and almost one in five have experienced sexual violence. In 2005, over 350,000 women said they had experienced physical violence. The key results from the Bureau of Statistics are that 23 per cent of women who have ever been married or in a de facto relationship say they have experienced violence by a partner at some time during that relationship. Moreover, 42 per cent of women who had been in a previous relationship reported violence by a previous partner. Half of the women experiencing violence by their current partner experienced more than one incident of violence, and these incidents included stab or gunshot wounds and other serious injuries. It is extraordinary and shocking too that we have had research in Australia asking teenage boys and girls whether striking a partner was appropriate and that the response was often yes it was appropriate in a relationship. Thirty-five per cent of women who experienced violence from their partner also experienced that violence during periods of separation. Of all the women who experienced this violence, only 4.5 per cent contacted a crisis organisation. I think this is a very serious problem. Only 19 per cent of women who were physically assaulted in the not the previous 12-month period contacted the police. That is less than 20 per cent. Fortytwo per cent, nearly half, gave the main reason for not contacting police after the incident as wishing to deal with the problem themselves. Unfortunately we know that when women do contact police or other emergency services that is when the prospect of the violence against them escalating becomes real. As the Federal Police have said to me, the most dangerous time for a woman in a violent relationship is when she seeks help. That is when she is most likely to be even more seriously injured or even killed. This is a terrible problem for Australians. We need to be dealing with the incidence of domestic violence. We need to be making sure that our support agencies, like the police, the ambulance services and the medical profession, are well able to protect women when they come forward and beg for assistance. I have to say that I have been hugely disappointed that a program started under the coalition government in north-east Victoria called BSafe has not been re-funded. 'B' stands for Benalla and 'safe' is self-evident. This program provides support and protection to women who have had restraining orders taken out against abusive partners. They are issued with a fairly lowcost monitor. They are a bit like the monitors you see the elderly use to call for help when they have fallen. The monitor is given to women and some of their children who are old enough to understand its use. Through these monitors they can contact a monitoring service that is aware that they have a restraining order and they then immediately call the police should this small monitor be activated. Whenever the abusive partner comes near the home or tries to break the restraining order in any way, they simply press the button on the monitor. A call is immediately informed and then that call is immediately redirected to local police. Women have found that this simple device has substantially lessened attempts by abusive partners to break their orders. Police have seen different behaviour from the abusive partner when they are aware that the police will come quickly when the monitor is activated. The tragedy is that this program runs out of funding in August this year. We are talking about several hundred thousand dollars to fund the program and a coordinator who manages the use of the monitors. There are some 70 women who have had these monitors and have found them to be so effective in giving them back freedom and a life without fear. Unfortunately, already the coordinator is having to tell these women that the service is to be cut off. Already coordinator of this program is having to tell the police and other local community service providers that they cannot take the new numbers of women who are being referred to the agency. We know that the program has been enormously successful. It has been demonstrated to be such. It even won an award recently as one of the most successful programs in dealing with the issue of domestic violence. Despite all that, this program is not to be funded after August this year. I find that extraordinary. The program should be expanded across Australia, not cut off. It has been the means for a lot of women to regain a decent life and break the cycle of intergenerational abuse. It has allowed women to stay in their homes. It has allowed children to continue to go to their local schools and retain proximity to grandparents and other supporting family members. Until these small devices were in the hands of these women, too many of them simply had to continue to run and hide because they centre were forever being pursued by partners breaking the restraining orders that were out against them. I ask the government to forget non-essential amendments to an act which has been working effectively. Instead they should be focusing on the programs which actually do great good when they are in the community in the hands of service providers such as the BSafe program. We also have a great deal of difficulty in properly staffing our counselling, monitoring and mediating services in rural and regional areas. We have to make sure that we do not always have a two-speed economy, with better services provided to metropolitan families in need than to rural families in need. I also need to refer to the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. This plan recognises the diversity the of the needs of women with disabilities, young women, women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, Indigenous women, same-sex attracted women and older women, and provides scope to tailor responses based on individual needs. We find that this bill today contains many measures which will not help at all in ensuring that children are always given priority when discussing their future. It does not make sure that, after a separation, where there is no issue of child safety, both mother and father can continue to have a meaningful relationship with their child. It is not a perfect act; no-one argues that. But certainly we in the coalition believe the amendments that have been proposed in this bill need to be re-examined, because the issues are just too important to listen to only a tiny minority with an agenda whose greatest priority is not always the safety of the children in our community.",72
36,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS," I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate. I will just pick up on some of the concluding comments of the previous speaker. I note that these amendments are not based on the view of a minority, tiny or otherwise. The amendments are based on four significant reports, including one by the Australian Institute of Family Studies which was commissioned during the period of the former government, another by the Family Law Council and another by Professor Richard Chisholm after some very distressing events. Since the initial draft prepared, the amendments have also been supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in its report, which resulted in particular in further reflection upon the definitions of family violence and abuse. We have essentially introduced these amendments to help achieve safer outcomes for children caught up in the family law system, and that should be the important focus and I will stress that. Over 15 years in parliament I have spoken with many everyday Australians who are wedged in difficult and complex family law disputes. I have listened to their stories, I have asked questions and at times I have heard some pretty confronting answers, including with respect to some high-profile cases. I have received a great deal of advice from a range of family law professionals and experts, from people who work in the system every day, and I have referred to those reports that essentially provide the basis for these reforms. I must say, despite the recognition of and concern about family violence that has been reflected by all members, I have been disappointed with the opposition's response. The government categorically rejects amendments that would undercut key measures to protect vulnerable children and families in our family law system. Family law is obviously a complex and fraught area, but facts are crucial if we are to address those matters that have contributed to families being at risk of violence and abuse. With respect, I think it is somewhat arrogant of those opposite to assume to place themselves in the position of experts based on anecdotal reports to them, ignoring at the same time those four reports to which I have referred. I would question, with respect, whether any member on the other side has was read or substantially read those reports or summaries of those reports. Indeed, we believe those opposite have adopted an incorrect frame of referencethat is, a focus on the rights of parents, whether they be from fathers groups or mothers groups. We say, and we make no apology for saying, that the frame of reference in these amendments is quite clearly the rights of children. For instance, when considering the confronting topic of family violence, the member for Bennelong focused on the parents' right to seek reduced child support. When speaking about factors relevant to the child's best interests, the member for Forrest said that the bill basically reverses the presumption of innocence. When speaking about the mandatory cost order provision, the member for Cowan talked about 'trampling on the rights of the party'-the party being the parent. This bill is a family law bill; it is not a child support bill and it is not a criminal law bill. It is a bill concerned with ensuring that parenting arrangements for children are safe. It is not about the rights of mothers groups or the rights of fathers groups, as I have said. It is about the rights of those most vulnerable in our community: our children. I want to continue stressing that point. It is about impeding safe parenting relationships in any way, shape or form. They are not at risk. We recognise they are the majority of relationships, but there are nonetheless a substantial minority where children are at risk, and we are neglectful in our responsibility to those children if we do not act in the face of those four very substantial, very well-researched reports. As I understand it, the opposition specifically opposes the new definition of family violence. This is a keystone of the reforms. The bill greatly improves the existing definition because it better captures harmful behaviour. It is more descriptive and requires decision makers to closely consider the personal experience of the child growing up in a family riddled with violence. Family violence is not generic or superficial. It is individualised and gravely insidious. A number of members said that this is substantially irrelevant to the work of the courts because courts only consider five per cent of cases, but that is why we need such a detailed and comprehensive definition of both violence and abuse to be in the act: it is those definitions that provide the benchmark which over time changes culture, which the courts by the implementation of the legislation will assist in developing. The government specifically rejects any proposal that would require family violence to be hinged on, for instance, how a reasonable person might react in a particular situation or what the violent perpetrator might have intended. People should not be afraid that their experiences will be dismissed. They should not have the fear of losing their children or suffering prejudice in proceedings if they speak up about their concerns. The proposed definition is closely aligned, as I have indicated, to the recommendations of the Australian and New South Wales law reform commissions. We not believe, as a result of public submissions, that it has received strong public support. The opposition also opposes changes to the cooperative or friendly parent provisions. It says it is concerned that the reforms are not evidence based. I have referred to the evidence that is the basis of our reforms. The member for Stirling in particular argued there is no credible evidence suggesting this provision is a disincentive to disclosure. He said the Family Law Council described criticism of the provision as 'gossip' and, quite astonishingly, the member for Berowra agreed with him. With great respect to those two members, that is a gross misrepresentation of the council's report and advice. In its family violence report, the council specifically advocated the repeal of these cooperative parenting provisions. Why? Because they are a disincentive for people to report their concerns of violence and abuse, and that is what the government is addressing in its amendments. In its submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, for instance, the council said: … there is considerable concern that a vulnerable parent may elect not to disclose family violence or child abuse for fear of being considered an 'unfriendly parent'. I am very concerned that the opposition views that considerable concern voiced by the council for the victims of family violence as gossip. While we play politics in this House, when there is such a substantial body of evidence surely we owe it to the children of this nation to approach this debate at a far more sophisticated level. The member for Stirling also claimed that the Australian Institute of Family Studies report Evaluation of the 2006 family reforms did not provide any basis for the reforms that the government has proposed. That evaluation was instigated by the former government. The opposition must not have read that report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, including its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill, which states … two specific aspects of the current legislative framework operate to discourage allegations of family violence from being raised: FLA s60CC(3)(c) (""friendly parent"" provision) and s117AB (costs orders for knowingly made false statements). This evidence supports the repeal these provisions in the proposed Bill. So it is quite inappropriate for the opposition to mislead the House regarding the nature of those submissions. I thank the member for Stirling for drawing the attention of the House to the report of Professor Richard Chisholm and to his recommendations about amendments to the 'friendly parent' provisions-that is, if a parent is deemed to be uncooperative by raising allegations of concern about violence and abuse, they may potentially, under the current legislation, be deemed to be an uncooperative or unfriendly parent, suffering prejudice in their submissions to the court. As submissions from key stakeholders show, both to the public consultation on this bill and the Senate committee's current inquiry, those who work in the system and family law experts all support this proposal because it is based on such solid evidence. In terms of the issue of costs orders, the opposition has argued that the government is opening up the way for false allegations of violence to be made in court. This is nonsense and so too is the claim that the evidence relied on is misleading. Professor Chisholm recommended this repeal, and his submission to the Senate inquiry stated that the provision seemed to operate as a disincentive to disclosing family violence and did not appear to have had any beneficial effect-and I remind honourable members of the timing of when Professor Chisholm was engaged to provide advice to government. The Family Law Council said there is no evidence that section 117AB was achieving its purpose of discouraging false allegations of violence. The repeal of section 117AB has strong public support, including from the legal profession and key stakeholders in the family law community. The opposition said that if a court were prepared to make a finding that a party had knowingly given of false evidence there was no reason why a costs order should not follow. I could not agree more. The act already provides precisely for that and it provides disincentives for making a false allegation or false denial in parenting matters through its existing powers in section 117 of the act. It already has that discretion and that power. I turn to the opposition's objections to including a reference to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as a specific object of part VII of the act. The convention sets out many rights of children, such as considering the child's best interests and ensuring that children are protected from physical and emotional harm. The opposition seems to have forgotten that the bill is about family violence and abuse as well as advancing the 'best interests' principle, and this measure, we believe, will fortify the focus on the rights of the child and the rights specifically of children to live free from harm and the fear of harm. Recognising the convention in the act will provide a strong statement that we as Australians are committed to protecting children, particularly when relationships break down. I have had very strong support from the court for including this object in the act. Incidentally, I suggest that the member for Hasluck re-read the explanatory memorandum at paragraph 23, page 5. Perhaps he made an innocent mistake when he asserted, wrongly, that this document does not say that the act prevails over the convention. It greatly concerns me that the opposition has apparently ignored the significant body of evidence that calls for these reforms. In concluding, the bill takes positive action to ensure the safety of children and to ensure their best interests are prioritised. I have said time and time again that the government supports shared parenting but only where this is safe for the child. The bill has been the subject of extensive public consultation, and I thank stakeholders for their contributions to the development of the bill. We as a government are proud to have introduced this bill and we will be even prouder when it becomes law and makes a difference for the children and families who are faced with family violence and child abuse. The very substantial body of evidence shows that these reforms are needed, and this government will do everything we can to make the system work better for these vulnerable families and children. A urge the opposition to do the same. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",76
37,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," by leave-I move amendments (1) to (4): (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 19 to 22), omit the item. (2) Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (lines 23 to 25), omit the item. (3) Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (lines 6 to 9), the item. (4) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (line 12) to page 5 (line 23), omit the item. Before I speak specifically about the detail of these amendments I refer very quickly to the tone in which this debate has been conducted. We have just heard from the Attorney-General and we have also heard from other members of this House who in some instances talked about the detail of the bill but, unfortunately, in other instances did something that I think is pretty disgustingthat is, they came in here and somehow asserted that those on this side of the House would be less concerned about family violence, would be less concerned about the welfare of children in a failing marriage and would be less concerned about the myriad very complicated issues that we see within the family law system. I want to talk about the amendments, but I would ask members on the other side who come in here and frame their comments within those terms to reflect on how deeply offensive that is. The amendments that I now move seek to omit the government's proposed amendments to the definition of family violence in the Family Law Act. The definition now proposed defines family violence as: ... violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful. It differs from the existing question in that it imposes a subjective test. The existing definition requires a reasonable fear for the family member's well-being or safety. The new definition attempts to qualify its subjectivity by incorporating a list of examples of behaviour which includes assaults, repeated derogatory taunts, damage to property and other unreasonable or omit criminal behaviour. However, it is an open question as to whether the list of examples is sufficient to frame and limit the subjective definition. There is no doubt that any of the behaviours limited would cause a person to be fearful; they would also give rise to a reasonable fear for a person's well-being or safety under the existing law. The problem with the subjective test is that the person seeking to demonstrate that another person is violent need only state that he or she feared controlling or coercive conduct; the state of mind need not be reasonable. The consequences of a finding of violence can be drastic and permanent. It is not appropriate that a court need not inquire as to whether a fear is well founded. The effect of the coalition's amendment will be to retain the objective tests within the existing legislation.",79
38,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS," The government opposes these amendments. The opposition has moved amendments to omit items 2, 3, 6 and 8 from schedule 1 of the bill. Item 45 of schedule 1, which contains the transitional arrangements, as a consequence would also be amended. These proposed amendments to the bill would preserve the existing definition of family violence in the Family Law Act. The government is categorically opposed to the opposition's amendments. The new definition of family violence presented in this bill is a keystone of the reforms. I have listened to the call for a better definition and have based the reforms on expert advice. The bill greatly improves the existing definition because it better captures harmful behaviour, is more descriptive and requires decision makers to closely consider the personal experience of the child growing up in a family riddled with violence. The proposed definition was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission and by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in their report Family violence-a national legal response. A large number of submissions to the public consultation of the exposure draft also supported this amendment. The definition sets out a general characterisation of behaviour, which must coerce, control or cause fear in a family member, and a non-exhaustive list of examples of harmful behaviour likely to be captured by the definition. The government considers that the overarching descriptors of family violence appropriately target the range of behaviour that results in subjugation of family members. This approach will give the courts clear legislative guidance about family violence and will help judicial officers to better consider behaviour, including patterns of behaviour within the factual context. The new, more descriptive definition will also educate and guide advisers and members of the public about family violence and, over time, will assist in changing culture. The government rejects any proposal that would require family violence to be hinged on how a reasonable person might react in a particular situation or what the violent perpetrator might have intended. To require reasonableness or intent as a precondition to family violence is to take a narrow approach to what is an insidious problem and would be particularly concerning in the context of a controlling relationship. The Australian and New South Wales law reform commissions and the Family Law Council recommended the removal from the Family Law Act of the semi-objective test of family violence. That test requires a person to reasonably fear for or to reasonably be apprehensive about his or her personal safety, along the lines, I would suggest, that the opposition is proposing-that is, it imports an objective standard but requires the decision maker to put themselves in the position of the potential victim. A requirement to prove intent is not supportable, as it may discourage victims of violence from disclosing evidence of harmful behaviour. The bill is about protecting the safety of children. The bill is a family law bill; it a criminal law bill. Family violence is not generic or superficial. It is individualised, it can be gravely insidious and it can escalate. People should not be afraid that their experiences will be dismissed. They should not have fear of losing their children or suffering prejudice in their proceedings if they speak up about those fears. For those reasons, the government rejects the amendments. Question negatived.",80
39,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," by leave-I move opposition amendments (5) to (8): (5) Schedule 1, item 18, page 7 (lines 5 to 15), omit the item. (6) Schedule 1, item 20, page 7 (lines 20 and 21), omit the item. (7) Schedule 1, item 26, page 10 (lines 9 and 10), omit the item. (8) Schedule 1, item 27, page 10 (lines 11 and 12), omit the item. These amendments relate government's proposed repeal of the criteria misleadingly described as the 'friendly parent' provision. Section 60CC(3)(c) of the act currently requires family courts to consider the willingness of one parent towards facilitating the other to have a meaningful relationship with the child. The provision has been criticised as discouraging parents' disclosures of family violence and child abuse for fear of being found to be unfriendly. The bill seeks to repeal this provision and replace it with considerations of the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in major long-term decisions in relation to the child, spend time with and communicate with the child and the extent to which each of the parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil the parents' obligations to maintain the child. These is not criteria already exist in section 60CC(4). The explanatory memorandum cites the evaluation of the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Family Law Council report as the basis for the repeal of this provision. This is misleading. The Australian Institute of Family Studies found that some concerns were expressed that the provision discouraged the reporting of violence, but there was no statistical information to actually suggest that this was the case. The criticism was in fact voiced in the Chisholm report, and that remained uncited within the explanatory memorandum and was described as 'gossip' by the Family Law Council. I can refer the Attorney to the exact reference within the executive summary of that report. The failure to facilitate a relationship between a child and a separated parent remains an important issue for the attention of a court and has been found to be an incident of emotional abuse in several reported cases. If the enhanced violence and abuse reporting obligations are supported, to the there can be no reason for a parent's obstructive behaviour to be excluded from consideration. It should also be noted that this consideration should not arise in the usual course if there are well-founded fears that contact with the other parent exposes the child to violence or abuse. The existing section 60CG makes this clear. The unwillingness of a parent to facilitate a close and continuing relationship with the other parent is undoubtedly a relevant consideration when making parenting orders. In 2009, in the case of Villey and Prabsik, Mr Justice Watts ordered that a seven-yearold child be removed from his father's primary care to that of his mother. The relevant factual findings were that the mother had suffered a significant mental illness following the parties' separation as a result of the treatment she had suffered at the hands of the father during the relationship. Psychiatric examination of the parties revealed the mother to be fully recovered, with an excellent prognosis. She had rebuilt her relationship with the child in an appropriate manner, assisted professionals. The father, however, was assessed as having a narcissistic personality, with overvalued ideas or a delusion that the mother remained ill, unsafe and should have minimal involvement in the child's life. Mr Justice Watts accepted the mother's argument that it would be more likely for the child to have a meaningful relationship with both parents if he lived with his mother rather than with his father and that the child would be likely to suffer psychological harm by damage of his relationship with his mother if he continued to reside with his father. This finding would have been more difficult to come to had this consideration been present within the act. I therefore urge the House to support the coalition's amendments.",81
40,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS," The government again rejects the opposition's proposed amendments-that is, to omit items 18, 20, 26 and 27, which deal with the additional considerations as to determination of the best interests of the child. The government's proposal finds support not only in the report of Professor Chisholm, which was referred to-the Family Courts Violence Review-but also in the Family Law Council's family violence report and the Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. If the opposition were to examine the submissions to the Senate inquiry, they would see that key stakeholders and the family law experts, including those to which I have referred, support this proposal. Following my department's public consultation on the exposure draft, the government responded to concerns raised about the proposed repeal of section 60CC(3) and (4) and (4A). Accordingly, we adjusted this measure to ensure that any by disincentives to disclosing violence are removed while at the same time healthy child-parenting relationships continue to be encouraged. In saying that the friendly parent provisions may discourage disclosure, Professor Chisholm said: ... the appropriate message might be that the parent needs first to make sure the children are safe. There may still be a need to try and preserve some benefit from the children's relationship with the other parent, but it should not compromise the children's safety. That is essentially the philosophy of this proposal. The government's amendment bill is an important measure that will encourage victims of violence to speak up for their children.

41,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! It being past 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. Are there any statements by honourable members? NA Petition: RAAF Base Darwin Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:52): In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election I campaigned to allow the empty RAAF base houses in Darwin to be used for the community and to prevent their destruction or removal. I have continued to fight to ensure that these houses are not sitting their vacant, and to this end I prepared a private members' motion, which was presented earlier today, to hand over the 395 houses to Defence Housing Australia, making them available to Territorians. I am in the House today to present a petition supporting my motion, which has been through the Petitions Committee and is in order, with 719 local signatures. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House the decision of the Federal Labor Government to decommission 395 houses on RAAF Base Darwin in the midst of the Territory's worse ever housing crisis. We therefore ask the House to support the desperate need for housing in the Territory and the interests of local businesses which rely on support from local residents by excising from Commonwealth ownership the residential housing area of RAAF Base Darwin and handing the houses over to Territorians for a range of housing options including public housing and houses for first home buyers as a matter of urgency. from 719 citizens Petition received. Mrs GRIGGS: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the decision of the federal Labor government to decommission 395 houses on RAAF Base Darwin in the midst of the Territory's worse housing crisis. We therefore ask the House to support the desperate need for housing in the Territory and in the interests of the local businesses, which rely on support from local residents by excising from Commonwealth ownership the residential housing area of RAAF Base Darwin and handing the houses over to Territorians for a range of housing options, including public housing and houses for first-home buyers as a matter of urgency. Territorians are outraged. They see with the eye of common sense but fail to understand why this issue remains unresolved and these 125 houses continue to sit vacant. It is time to stop Labor's waste and mismanagement of taxpayer funded resources, make these houses available to Territorians and make them available now. I seek leave to table this petition.",83
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The honourable member's time has expired. Leave is not required, as the Petitions draws Committee has, apparently, considered the petition and found it to be in order. The petition is received in accordance with standing orders. Petition: New Zealand Potatoes",84
43,Mr ZAPPIA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I present a petition signed by 471 people asking the House to take steps to ensure that Australia rejects the application to allow the importation of fresh New Zealand potatoes into Australia because of the existence of zebra chip disease in New Zealand potatoes. Zebra chip disease complex is a devastating potato disease, first detected in 1994 in Central America, which has caused millions of dollars of damage worldwide. Australia is currently free of the disease and the importation of fresh potatoes from New Zealand, where the zebra chip disease was detected in 2008, places at risk the Australian potato industry and the livelihoods of thousands of Australian rural families. In 2008-09 Australia produced nearly 1.2 million tonnes of potatoes. The potato chips exposed to the zebra chip pathogen develop black lines through them and render them unsellable. There is little known about the zebra chip disease, and if the pathogen gets into Australia it will be extremely difficult and costly to control. I understand that the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture Biosecurity has requested new market access for fresh potatoes to be imported into Australia under quarantine arrangements. I also understand that further petitions on this matter will be presented to the House over the coming weeks.",84
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,The petition will be received following consideration by the Petitions Committee in accordance with the standing orders. Canning Electorate: Digital Television Services,84
45,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," A number of constituents have contacted my office to complain about the poor quality digital TV reception experienced in the Mandurah area and in Waroona. Problems include audio drop-out, spikes, pixelations across the screen and loud and intermittent electronic noises. Residents have been told that this may be a result of faulty electronic items in surrounding premises. However, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, who have the role of investigating these issues, only have offices in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. This has made it difficult for my constituents to contact them and also to have their issues further investigated on-site. Upon contacting the communications minister, Stephen Conroy, his office advised that the residents should point their aerials the right direction or have a technician inspect the problem. Many of these constituents have come to my office after they have paid for qualified technicians to come to their homes to inspect the problems, and even replace the entire antenna. Many have also contacted ACMA directly, to no avail. The Minister has also suggested that some of the residents may be eligible to move to digital TV via satellite, or VASTviewer access satellite television-however, this program will not be available in Western Australia until November 2012 and will only be available upon application to areas that do not receive coverage, as deemed by the mySwitch website. According to this website, all of the complaints that have been received have been deemed to be in areas of good coverage, highlighting the inaccuracies of the service. This aside, the satellite service would come at a cost of between $200 and $350, after the government subsidy- (Time expired) Gould, Mr Bob",85
46,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to pay tribute to Newtown bookseller Bob Gould, who passed away on 22 May 2011 aged 74. Bob was part of the progressive left in Australia for the better part of the post-war era. From the Vietnam War to asylum seekers, he has marched and argued for what he believed in. As former New South Wales MP Meredith Burgmann noted, 'He was involved in most of the great political protest movements of the time.' Bob did live through interesting times. He was one of three people who chased down and restrained the man who tried to kill Arthur Calwell after an anticonscription rally in 1966. His bookstores were raided for stocking such scurrilous works as Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint and pictures of Michelangelo's David. Most students who attended the in University of Sydney have a story about Gould's Books. Mine came when I was walking down an aisle and brushed past two precarious stacks of books on either side. Both collapsed on me, trapping me for about five minutes, until Bob heard my cries for help and ambled over. Although he was a Labor Party member Bob was probably to the left of everyone in the current federal parliament. Yet even my libertarian friend Sinclair Davidson has noted Bob's passing, and recalled fondly his time buying books at Bob's bookstore. For his activism and his bookstore, Bob Gould injected ideas and energy into the public debate. He will be missed. (Time expired) Petition: Australia Post",85
47,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in the House today to table a petition on behalf of the constituents of Brisbane strongly opposing the decision by Australia Post not to reopen the Milton Business Centre. The former Milton Business Centre, along with many neighbouring businesses, was devastated by the January 2011 floods. Unlike the other small businesses in the area, the Milton Post Office has not reopened its doors. This is an additional slap in the face to local residents, families and small businesses who are still struggling to rebuild after the devastating floods. Businesses in Milton rely heavily on the proximity of this post office to conduct their daily business activities and many businesses have had to spend money reprinting letterheads and business cards, installing letterboxes in their buildings and soaking up the cost of travelling up to 40 minutes on a daily basis to collect packages and check their post office boxes at other centres across Brisbane. Despite my representation to the Minister for Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy, the decisions seems to have now been made and the minister has refused to intervene or come up with an additional practical solution. I call on the minister to consider these families and businesses. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the undersigned Citizens of Queensland draws to the attention of the House: Australia Post is planning to close the Australia Post Business Centre at 37 Douglas Street Milton, Queensland. We believe the decision not to reopen in the Milton business district will great inconvenience for local families and business owners rebuilding after the recent flood devastation. We therefore ask the House to: Seek assurances from Australia Post that they will commit to reopening a full Australia Post Business Centre facility in the Milton business and shopping precinct. from 1,427 citizens Petition received.",85
48,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Carbon Pricing",86
49,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Now that we have a 'yes' campaign on a carbon tax, when will the Prime Minister finally admit that, yes, she did break her promise not to have a carbon tax, and when will she finally say 'yes' to an election so that the people will have their say on her toxic tax?",86
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition I say that his conduct in this parliament in the first 30 seconds of question time justifies John Hewson's description of him as the 'master of the negative'. That is all the Leader of the Opposition knows. Even his fellow Liberals can no longer stomach his negativity and hollowness. The reason we saw those divisions is that when you stand for nothing it is easy to be divided, isn't it? There is no sense of purpose and no sense of unity, because under this Leader of the Opposition they stand for nothing. Let me say the following to the Leader of the Opposition: I believe climate change is real; I know the Leader of the Opposition does not. I believe that because climate cause change is real we should have the cheapest and most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution. Economists tell us that the cheapest and most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon election?",86

Then, because there is a price on that carbon pollution and they can no longer put it up into the atmosphere for nothing, because they are smart business people and because they are driven by the bottom line they will find ways of innovating and changing their business practices",87
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt,87
56,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,so that they generate less carbon pollution. We will use the revenue paid by those big polluters to assist Australian families. We will use it to protect Australian jobs. We will use it to fund programs that tackle climate change. The Leader of the Opposition stands for a proposition that the member for Wentworth has rightly described as one that is expensive for taxpayers and will not work. It is the of policy you put forward when you do not really believe in climate change and your main aim is to have a policy that you can fool people with and you can bring to an end very quickly if you were ever required to implement it. Look at the contrasts in our policies. We will require big polluters to pay and give some of that money to Australian families,87

62,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I ask the Prime Minister why is she so negative about asking the people? Why won't the Prime Minister do the most positive thing she can and say 'yes' to an election? It is all very well asking the acting community, but why doesn't the Prime Minister ask the people what they think of her toxic tax? Ms Macklin: Desperate!",87

At some point he needs to stop insulting the intelligence of his fellow Australians. Australians overwhelmingly believe climate change is real-that is, they are in front of the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian community has moved past him. They believe climate change is real. To those Australians who believe climate change is real and who want to act now, we say to them, and I say to them as Prime Minister, let's act in the most effective way we can, the cheapest way we can, the most efficient way we can and the best way we can to cut carbon pollution.

74,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then we had the shameful display of the member for Murray trying to pretend to the people in her electorate that jobs were being lost at a local food manufacturer because of a carbon price, and they were going to New Zealand because of fears of a carbon price in Australia. What she forgot to tell them in that campaign of fear is that New Zealand, under a conservative prime minister, has an emissions trading scheme. That is, in the last six or seven hours-we do not even have to go further back than that-we have had the opposition out there knowingly speaking untruths to try and generate fear in the minds of the Australian community. Well, the Australian community believe climate change is real. And, because they believe climate change is real, we will work with members of the Australia community to put in place the best mechanism to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change-by, as I say, putting a price on the biggest polluters and giving money to Australian families. The Leader of the Opposition wants to rip money off Australian families and use it to subsidise the biggest polluters. We on this side will keep talking about the facts and the best path forward for this nation. Climate Change",88
75,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House how the 10,000 Teens campaign will see young Australian women take action on climate change? Why is it critical to take action now and start the move to a clean-energy future?",88
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I very much thank the member for Greenway for her question. Earlier today I was able to go to the Ravenswood School and meet with young women who are engaged in the 10,000 Teens campaign. It is part of a broader campaign to bring together one million women to raise their voice about climate change. Mr Fletcher interjecting",88
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought the member for Bradfield would want the views of his constituents to be heard in the Australian parliament. I talked to his constituents today and I am bringing their views to the Australian parliament. I would have thought he would be interested in the views of his own constituents. At Ravenswood today, I participated in an event that was about bringing together one million Australian women who will raise their voices on climate change, one million women who will take a pledge in their personal lives to cut the amount of carbon pollution that they generate-grandmothers and mothers, aunts and sisters, banding together to have their voices heard about the need to tackle climate change. And the 10,000 Teens campaign is about young women having their voice heard too, so that they can say to their mothers grandmothers, to their aunts and to their older sisters: 'Thank you for taking action on climate change. We want our voice heard as well.' Ravenswood is one of around 30 schools in New South Wales involved in the 10,000 Teens campaign. Through that campaign and more broadly around the Australian nationin Sydney, in the outer suburbs and in regional towns-we are hearing Australians say they believe climate change is real and they want to see effective action on climate change. Effective action through pricing carbon, effective action through making the big polluters pay, is what this government stands for and it is what we will bring to Australian parliament. What people do not want to hear is a whole lot of negativity, a whole lot of fear mongering, a whole lot of bitterness from a divided political party. What they want to hear is real solutions. I visit a lot of schools and I very much enjoy doing so. Whenever I go to schools, I talk to the kids about the partnership that we the adults in this community have with them. We tell them to study hard and we have to provide them with great schools to study in. We say to them: 'When you leave school, don't drift around. Get a job or go into that new educational opportunity'-and we have to do the right thing to make sure the economy is strong and they can get the benefit of that great new training opportunity. And on climate change they are saying to us: 'Please act to do the things that we need to do to cut carbon pollution in this nation.' I am listening to their voice, the government is listening to their voice, and we will act by pricing carbon. Carbon Pricing Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:12): My question is the Prime Minister. I refer to the and Press Club address last month by the Minister for Climate Change. He said: If the imposition of a carbon price led to production being moved offshore to a country without a comparable carbon constraint, we could end up with a worse environmental outcome as well as the loss of Australian jobs. Given that, at the weekend, Russia, Japan and Canada advised that they would not join a second round of carbon cuts under the Kyoto protocol and the United States has reconfirmed that it will not join, will the Prime Minister guarantee that no industries will move and no jobs will be lost overseas as a result of her carbon tax?",88
78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lalor-Prime Minister) the (14:13): I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would know-from news reports, from the briefings that she reads and, indeed, from the information she would get from the sister political parties of the Liberal Party around the world-other nations are moving on climate change. I am sure, for example, that there is a great exchange of information between the Liberal Party of Australia and the Conservatives in the United Kingdom. Indeed, we know that the Leader of the Opposition has been to the UK to consult with David Cameron, now the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. People would remember when he went to do that. What does David Cameron stand for? This is a man who, were in Australia, would be the holder of a Liberal Party ticket. He has announced to his community that he stands for cutting carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2027-a conservative. But we do not need to look as far away as the UK. We can look across the ditch to New Zealandanother conservative. The Prime Minister there, John KeyMs Julie Bishop: I asked about Russia, Japan, Canada and the United States not joining Kyoto and asked the Prime Minister to guarantee that no industries would move and no jobs would be lost overseas as a of her carbon tax. She has not answered that question and is not",89
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her place. The Prime Minister has the call. She knows her obligation to be directly relevant to the question.,90
80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I presumed the opposition would be interested in the actions of their fellow conservatives overseas, including of course the Prime Minister of New Zealand-a conservative in a country with an emissions trading scheme. Then let's come to the US, mentioned in the deputy opposition leader's question. President Obama has committed the US to a hugely ambitious agenda about ensuring that 80 per cent of the energy used in the US comes from clean energy sources-a huge agenda for change. Right around the world, whether it is China or India, we see countries acting on climate change. I do not put the case to the Australian people that we should act in front of the world, but we cannot afford to be left behind either. We have a high-emitting economy. We emit more carbon pollution per head of populationMr Hartsuyker interjecting",90
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowper is warned!,90
82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"than any other developed nation. That means, in generating a clean energy economy for the future, we have got a bigger journey to travel, and that is why we need to start the journey now. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Liberal Party generally are out there trying to stoke fear on this issue. They have got no solutions; they have got no belief in climate change; they have got no views about the future of this country. All they stand for is relentless negativity, to result the disgust of many people who hold a Liberal Party ticket. We will meet their fear campaign with facts. As we design carbon pricing, we will be working with Australian businesses and industry to ensure that we protect Australian jobs. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is truly concerned about the employment prospects of Australians today and Australians tomorrow then she should be supporting the most efficient way of tackling climate change: pricing carbon and generating the clean energy economy we need for the future. She should not be advocating a strategy which would have our nation left behind, including behind countries where her conservative counterparts are taking positive action on climate change. Climate Change",90
83,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on the government's efforts to introduce a carbon price that will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy? How have these efforts been received and what is the government's position?,90
84,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Banks for his question. The government, as the Prime Minister has just outlined, is determined to make a very important reform to our economy for the benefit of our long-term competitiveness and the benefit of our environment by placing a price on carbon. Of course, we are pursuing that reform through the discussions that we are holding within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. The context of that policy is thatMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",91
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar is warned!,91
86,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"a price on carbon will apply to fewer than 1,000 of the largest emitters of carbon pollution in our economy, and every cent raised by the payment of the carbon price by those entities will go to assisting households meet any price impacts, supporting jobs and competitiveness in the trade exposed part of the economy and supporting clean energy programs. It is important, in reference to the previous question as well, to bear in mind that it has been the clear position from the outset that there will be support for businesses that are working in the emissions-intensive and trade exposed part of the economy. Furthermore, it is very important to understand in pricing carbon that it will make cleaner energy sources cheaper relative to higher polluting sources of energy. That a very important basis for pricing carbon in the economy. The discussions that we are having through the multi-party committee are constructive. Of course, there are some issues that we continue to work through, but all parties are approaching these discussions in good faith.",91
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
88,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can still participate. Change your mind; get on board; show some respect for the scientific evidence. The government will continue to work through those issues with the other parties in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. On the weekend we heard from 15 of Australia's top energy companies, including AGL, BP Solar, GE and TRUenergy, who all called for the urgent introduction of a price on carbon to provide certainty for business to invest in clean energy projects and jobs. We have also heard from peak bodies representing Australian business and industry. It is relevant to the debate that the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group both support a market mechanism to put a price on carbon, and they have not supported the coalition's subsidies-for-polluters policy. In addition, today there are a number of members of the 'Say Yes' to carbon pricing campaign in Canberra, representing a wide range of Australian people and Australian organisations. That group includes two former Liberal leaders, one of whom is former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. I am also referring to former Liberal leader John Hewson. Amongst the group are representatives from environment groups, unions, economists, academics, farmers, doctors and sports people. They collectively signed a letter today calling for a price on carbon. Dr Hewson had this to say at a press conference today in relation to this: is Look, you've got to price carbon as the centrepiece for any adequate response to the challenge of climate change. Dr Hewson is, in the true tradition of market economists that have guided philosophy on the other side of the House for a long period of time, very unlike the current Leader of the Opposition, who has no faith in market mechanisms and refuses to accept the scientific evidence on climate change. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",91
89,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that in withdrawing from the 10-state emissions trading scheme in the United States-the scheme she has previously cited in support of her carbon tax-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has said that the scheme 'does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens and tax our businesses, with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment'? Given that the Prime Minister won an election based on the promise of no carbon tax, when will she do the right thing and ask the Australian people whether they say yes to a carbon tax, by calling an election before its introduction?",92
90,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. As I have already indicated to the House, I was in his electorate this morning talking to his constituents, who want to see action on climate change. And of course the most effective way of acting on climate change is to put a price on carbon paid by the big polluters so that they will change the way they operate their businesses and cut the amount of carbon pollution. We will then use that revenue to assist households to protect Australian jobs and to fund programs to tackle climate change and generate our clean energy future. The member for Bradfield may want to consult his constituents about these questions and when he does he may want to say to them that he follows an opposition leader who denies the science of climate change and that fellow Liberals, who hold the same party ticket as the member for Bradfield, are disgusted by the continuing negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. They cannot believe that a man can be so empty and so hollow.",92
91,Mr Fletcher,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order in terms of relevance. The Prime Minister was asked a very specific question: is she aware that the New Jersey governor has withdrawn his state from a scheme she has previously cited?",92
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,92
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said to the member for Bradfield, we are going to act on climate change and we are going to do it with full understanding about circumstances around the world. Yes, I am aware of the change that the member for Bradfield refers to. The governor is a Republican. He is from a sister political party, which would only make me conclude that when the sister political parties get together from across the world-Prime Minister David Cameron, standing for 50 per cent reductions in emissions by 2027; Arnold Schwarzenegger, now in the news for a few other matters, as the Governor of California, having stood for reducing carbon pollution; the Prime Minister of New Zealand, a conservative standing for an emissions trading scheme-it is going to be a pretty interesting discussion, isn't it? But the important thing that should come out of that discussion is that conservatives like David Cameron have had the foresight to say to their people, 'Climate change is real.' I believe that; David Cameron believes that; the Leader of the Opposition does not. We need to get on by cutting carbon pollution. I believe that; the Leader of the Opposition does not. The most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on it. I believe that; the Leader of the Opposition does not. As we transition to a cleaner energy future, I believe in assisting Australian households; the Leader of the Opposition does not. He believes in putting additional taxes on their shoulders so that he can take that money and pay it to the big polluters as a subsidy. I am very happy to keep arguing for a positive path to address climate change. Climate Change",92
94,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Minister, the proposed HRL coal fired power station in the Latrobe Valley will have a pollution intensity similar to a black coal fired power station and will pump out over two million tonnes of pollution a year. Given we are now all moving to put a price on pollution and the Victorian EPA has refused to give full approval to the coal fired station, will the government now withdraw the $100 million in funding flagged by the Howard government but not yet handed over to the company? Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (14:20): member's question goes to an announced grant by the coalition government early in 2007 by the then member for Groom, as minister for resources and energy, and the member for Wentworth, as minister for the environment. It was actually announced during a time when the coalition, led by Prime Minister Howard, actually believed in policy rather than being a policy-free zone, which is the area in which the coalition finds itself. I also remind the House that at the time the coalition, which was led by a leader who believed in making hard decisions on policy, was committed to putting a price on carbon. The question goes to the heart of how we as a community can make a breakthrough on clean energy. Clearly, we appreciate and understand that the electricity sector is not only an essential service to the Australian community but also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Our government is committed not just to trying to take forward the debate on clean energy technology but also to putting in place a market mechanism based on a price on carbon side by side with a renewable energy target, which creates a framework for the market to work out the best form of clean energy. In that context, we regard the original announcements by the then coalition government as part of our endeavours for a $5 billion commitment to clean energy technology to take forward our opportunities for a baseload reliable energy sector in Australia which is also premised on reducing emissions. Regarding the question raised by the member, I remind him that it was part of a potential range of grants by the then coalition government that included Solar Systems, which was a solar power opportunity based at Abbotsford in his electorate of Melbourne. I will continue to progress the HRL proposal The in the same way in which I will progress the Solar Systems proposal now taken over by Silex because of a failure of the Solar Systems investors with respect to their capacity to commercialise that solar opportunity. Let's go to the facts around where the HRL proposal is at the moment. Firstly, the EPA Victoria's part approval of HRL-Dual Gas Pty Ltd does not trigger any Commonwealth payment. Secondly, no lowemissions development funds have been paid to the project to date. Thirdly, the government is continuing discussions with Dual Gas and the Victorian government as to where we go with the project in the future. In essence, we will continue to work with the proponent and the Victorian government to assess whether this project meets the conditions precedent established by the coalition government not only with respect to the HRL project but also, I might say, with respect to the original announcements going to Solar Systems, a solar based opportunity to actually make a breakthrough on clean energy. I will continue to apprise the House as we advance the capacity of these projects that meet the conditions precedent established by the original announcements in terms of both HRL and Solar Systems. Economy",93
95,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of recent reports about the importance of credible policies to return the budget to surplus? What is the government's response?,94
96,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for that very important question. We know that the recent natural disasters have had a significant impact on our economy, but these events have not knocked our economy off its path. Our fundamentals are strong because we have low and falling unemployment, we have record terms of trade and we have an unprecedented investment pipeline. We saw that with the capex data last week and we saw it with the ABARES data as well. We have a record investment boom which is going to stretch the capacity of our economy. That is why we have put in place measures to support our workforce for the future and that is why we put in place some tough savings measures to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is also why we put in place something like $22 billion worth of savings over the forward estimates. It was very important to do all of that, it stands in stark contrast to the approach of those opposite, who have no plan to bring the budget back to surplus and no plan for jobs. We have seen today this absolutely extraordinary effort by the shadow Treasurer, who started to blame all of his colleagues for the shocker that he had at the Press Club.  of order. I listened closely to the member for Robertson's question and it certainly did not call for this needlessly negative response from the Treasurer. I ask you to call him back to the question he was asked.",94
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his place. The Treasurer has the call.,94
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was talking about the importance of coming back to surplus. Nothing could be more important to our economy. Of course, those opposite have no plan to come back to surplus and I simply made the point that in the Financial Review today the shadow Treasurer was blaming all of his colleagues for the fact that they have no plan to come back to surplus. ",94
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer has the call! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his place. He will learn to sit there quietly and then I will allow him to take action. But, if he is going to prattle on through every answer, he will learn that I have limited things I can do with him. One of them is to send him out for an hour and then he cannot take any action as Manager of Opposition Business. Or I can warn him and then name him and he will be out for a day. But, on this occasion, I think he should just take this as his punishment. He has had his one point of order. The Treasurer has the call.",94
100,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This morning we had the but incredible sight of the shadow Treasurer writing to the Financial Review saying it was not all his fault; it was all the work of Mr Robb and all the work of the Leader of the Opposition. But he did say they described it as a very good speech.,94
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will relate his material to the question.,95
102,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is pretty important because, as Ben Packham said today in the Australian: 'Some Liberals believe the letter is evidence of Mr Hockey's frustration at what he sees as Mr Abbott's lack of interest in economics.'",95
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer must relate his material to the question.,95
104,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Like Dr Hewson and so many on that side of the House, they know the Leader of the Opposition does not have any positive alternatives for our economy.",95
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will bring his response to a close.,95
106,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am talking about the importance of bringing our budget back to surplus and the fact that those opposite do not have a clue",95
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer will resume his place! Order! As I have outlined, some of these responses were previously allowed under the relevance rule. There is a higher bar. The question must be directly relevant and, if that question were reviewed, there would be one missing element that would have allowed this response to be directly relevant. I am advising the Treasurer to relate his material in a directly relevant manner-not under the old rules of relevance but directly relevant. I call the Treasurer, he will now bring his answer to a conclusion.",95
108,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about credible economic plans for the future, the importance of bringing a budget back to surplus, why that is important because of the investment pipeline that we have coming in place, and the need to lift pressure on all of the elements associated with the workforce and so on to support our workforce. All of those things are policies which are opposed by those opposite. You can only laugh when the shadow Treasurer has to blame his colleagues for his incompetent performance. Carbon Pricing",95
109,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to last week's G8 meeting, at which Russia, Japan and Canada advised that they would not join a second round of carbon cuts under the Kyoto protocol and President Obama restated the United States's opposition to the Kyoto protocol. Has the Treasurer commissioned Treasury modelling on the effect on our economy if Australia moves ahead of our major trading partners by introducing a carbon tax?",95
110,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The government has commissioned modelling to deal with the creation of an emissions trading scheme; that is public knowledge, and we are awaiting that modelling. That modelling is conducted by professionals in the Treasury, and they are the very same people relied upon by those opposite when the former government, under Prime Minister Howard, was putting forward an emissions trading scheme. We will await the results of that modelling and that modelling will be made public, so I can say that to everybody in the House and to all of the Australian people. We will make the modelling available. Whether it has been conducted by Mr Stern but or whether it has been conducted by Garnaut, modelling has shown that the cost of inaction is far higher than the cost of action. We know all of that and we also know that what the Prime Minister said before is just so true. The sooner we begin to move, the more important it is that we can have a gradual adjustment, because as a developed economy",95
111,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,95
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer concluded? Tobacco Products Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (14:39): My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister outline the steps the government has taken with regard to tobacco plain packaging legislation? How have these steps been received? What is the government's response?,95
113,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Wills for his question. As he might be aware, but it appears that the Leader of the Opposition has not been, the government actually released legislation for plain packaging nearly two months ago, on 7 April. This legislation will restrict industry logos, brand imagery, colours and promotional text and increase warning labels on the front of packs from 30 per cent to 75 per cent. This is the exposure draft in all its 86 pages of detail. Australians still have another week to comment on this exposure draft legislation, and we have to date received many submissions. Unfortunately, even with all of this information available, the Leader of the Opposition says he cannot possibly make up his mind whether he will support plain packaging legislation or not. In fact, he said on the Today show, 'I haven't seen the legislation. Show us the legislation. When I see the legislation I will make up my mind.' It made me wonder, when Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has been so determined on many other issues. Did he wait to see the legislation when it came to climate change action? Did he wait to see the legislation on private health insurance reforms? Did he wait to see the legislation on mining tax? The truth is: the Leader of the Opposition could make up his mind right now, right here, if he was not so close to big tobacco that it was blurring his judgment. It is time for Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, to explain what his position is on plain tobacco packaging. I think the Leader of the Opposition also should give the public another explanation as well, because he has been out in the media protesting that no-one has been tougher than him when it comes to introducing health warnings of order. I simply ask: which part of the question gave the minister licence for these needless and negative attacks on the Leader of the Opposition?",96
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not wish to get into draft marking homework, but this question did have the door opener, 'how has this position been received and what is the government's response?' I have indicated that if the standing orders were written differently and did not allow debate we would get over a lot of these hurdles, but the standing order allows debate in answers. The Minister for Health and Ageing has the call and she is aware of her responsibility to directly relate her material to the question.",96
115,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does directly relate to plain packaging, because one of the key purposes of plain packaging is to ensure that health warnings are the first and only thing that the public see when they buy a packet of cigarettes. The Leader of the Opposition has been out in the media saying that no-one was tougher than him in introducing graphic warnings on tobacco. But the Sydney Morning Herald published another story. It reported that when Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, was the health minister, he challenged whether these steps needed to be taken. I quote: 'Do we really have to be doing this?' he asked. He argued that smoking was a matter of 'personal responsibility' and people had 'freedom to choose.' It is no wonder that those opposite are starting to divide on this issue. It is no wonder that people are questioning whether he is a tobacco denier as well as a climate change denier. Australia could lead the world on tobacco control, but the Leader of the Opposition needs to lead his party. Carbon Pricing Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (14:44): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Australian Food and Grocery Council's modelling that suggests that food and grocery prices will rise by between three and five per cent under a $26 per tonne carbon tax. Given that the Prime Minister won an election based on a promise of no carbon tax, when will she do the right thing and ask Australia's already struggling, forgotten families whether they say yes to a carbon tax by calling an election before its introduction?",96
116,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Indi for her question. First, I would say to the member for Indi that I understand that families right around the nation struggle with cost-of-living pressures. That is why, for those families, who also care about the future of this country and also believe that climate change is real, am determined that we get big polluters to pay the price of carbon pollution and we use that revenue to assist Australian families, to protect Australian jobs and to fund programs to tackle climate change and take us to our clean energy future. The member for Indi does not believe climate change is real but what she does believe in, presumably, is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip money off those families struggling with cost-of-living pressures and to use it to subsidise big polluters. I suggest that the member for Indi actually go to people in her electorate and say, 'Would it be all right by you if you paid more tax and that money went to subsidising big companies that pollute?'-because that is what the member for Indi and the Leader of the Opposition stand for. Mr Chester interjecting",97
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Gippsland!",97
118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Rather than trying to distort facts, as we have seen the opposition do as recently as this morning, rather than trying to generate fear, which we see the Leader of the Opposition do every day, rather than be lost in a world of climate change denial and rather than have the kinds of divisions we have seen in the Liberal Party, where the member for Wentworth says about the Leader of the Opposition's plan, 'It won't work and it will cost taxpayers,' we on this side of the House will get on with the job of tackling climate change through the cheapest way available, which is by putting a price on carbon and having it paid by the big polluters, whilst we assist Australian families, protect jobs and fund our transition to a clean energy future. That is the best thing that we can do to assist families as our nation makes this transition. Having met with some young Australians I today, representative of so many other young Australians around the nation, and having met with women today who are taking personal action on climate change, it is clear that the Australian community overwhelmingly believes climate change is real and they want us to provide the leadership we are providing as to how to tackle climate change. They do not want to hear continuing negativity and fear campaigns from the Leader of the Opposition. Budget",97
119,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why is it critical that savings measures in the budget are supported, and are there any threats to their passage through the parliament?",97
120,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for La Trobe for that very important question, because bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 is critical. You cannot actually return a budget to surplus unless you put in place savings measures, which of course is what the government did in our last budget. In this year's budget we have restricted real spending growth to one per cent a year. That stands in very to 3.7 per cent per year in the last five years of the coalition government. We have put in place savings measures totalling $22 billion. These savings are very important because they will fund vital initiatives such as our new initiatives in mental health but also more broadly in education and hospitals. And they deliver a net benefit to the budget bottom line of $5 billion. Mr Chester interjecting",98
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gippsland is now warned!,98
122,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This will be a very important thing in the parliament because we will see five key savings measures in the parliament totalling $4 billion in savings. This will very big test for those opposite, because you cannot say that you believe in coming back to surplus if you do not support the savings. Of course, there has been a lot commentary from those opposite as to where they may or may not stand on this matter, but I think the final word from Senator Minchin is one that is quite disturbing. He made this point: Too many Parties ... err on the side of populism ... That is ultimately self-defeating because you end up standing for nothing... Those remarks are directed at the shadow Treasurer and, of course, at the shadow finance spokesman. They are now so negative that they are now opposing their own policies. They decided in their party room last week that they would not be supporting the alternative fuels measures, which were a product of the Howard government and go back as far as 2004. They have now become so negative that they are opposing even policies they supported over a long period of time. What this demonstrates is what the opposition leader said in the party room last week when he said that he will take opportunism any time-opportunism stark contrast over good policy.",98
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will bring his remarks to a conclusion. He is to round up.,98
124,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly will, Mr Speaker. On the weekend a coalition MP, who will remain nameless, made this comment in the newspaper. He said: We can't keep agreeing with government spending measures opposing savings and ... keep our financial credibility intact. He is dead right.",98
125,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,98
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those who are getting the Leader of the House excited should contain themselves and wait. The be a Leader of the Nationals has the call. Carbon Pricing,98
127,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of independent research conducted by the National Farmers Federation which shows that an average Western Australian grain producer will be $36,000 a year worse off under the government's proposed carbon tax, even if agriculture is excluded? Does the Treasurer agree with the National Farmers Federation, which said today that this carbon tax will 'cripple the entire Australian agricultural industry' and should 'be rejected'?",98
128,Mr Randall,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Labor Party hates farmers.,99
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Canning should be careful. The Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer has the call.,99
130,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We do value agriculture as an industry and we support it strongly on this side of the House. There is perhaps no industry which is going to be more affected by dangerous climate change than agriculture. So we know this is yet further evidence of how those on that side of the House simply do not get it when it comes to the science of climate change, but there are farmers out there who truly understand the importance of dealing effectively with dangerous climate change and of putting in place policies to deal with for the long term so they can grow and prosper and benefit from the Asian century. I personally am very optimistic about the future of agriculture in this country. Just as I am optimistic about the future of coal and iron ore, I am very optimistic about the future of agriculture because as this region grows, as the middle classes grow in Asia, they will demand more of our goods, not just iron ore and coal but our agricultural products. This is yet another reason why we as a nation must deal with dangerous climate change-to support our farmers and to support their families. Of course, this question is yet another example of just how desperate they have become. They will exaggerate any fact. They will twist any figure in the absence of a detailed design. We will go about constructing our emissions trading scheme in a methodical way. The climate change minister is doing a fantastic job of that. We will go about doing that based on science and based on evidence. We will go about doing it based on modelling because we have got the interests of the country at heart, unlike those opposite, who have got no alternative policies. They came in here today to call for an election, but they do not have an alternative economic policy and they do not have an alternative agricultural policy. This just shows how barren and inept they are. NA Carbon Pricing",99
131,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Warringah moving immediatelyThat this House calls upon the Prime Minister to come clean with the Australian people, our forgotten families, the manufacturing sector, our it exporters, our small businesses and our farmers and: (1) own up to the following fact, that yes: (a) she did say, five days before the last election, ""there will be no carbon tax under the Government I lead""; (b) she did say, one day before the election, ""I rule out a carbon tax""; (c) she did promise there would be no carbon tax without a ""deep and lasting community consensus""; (d) around the world, our global competitors, Russia, Japan, Canada and the US, are walking away from the next round of Kyoto carbon-cuts; and (2) that as Prime Minister, she should declare, ""yes, I won't introduce a carbon tax without first seeking a mandate at a new election"". It is necessary to suspend",99
132,Mr Fitzgibbon,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I certainly do not raise this to put any additional and unnecessary pressure on you, but it is very clear, and I am sure you would agree, that I easily was on my feet before the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that, if he really wanted to have a debate on climate change, he would have been quicker to his feet.",99
133,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition.,100
134,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"It is necessary to suspend standing orders because this matter cannot wait. It cannot wait and standing orders must be suspended because this is a Prime Minister who is happy to listen to actors but she will not listen to voters. She wants to say yes to celebrities, but she will not say yes to the people of Australia by having an election on this topic. She will listen to actors and she will listen to celebrities, but one of the people she would not listen to is the foreign minister, who is now walking out of the chamber. None of us are surprised that he is walking out of the chamber, because she would not listen to him either before the last election. She would not listen to him when he wanted an emissions trading scheme, instead she destroyed his prime ministership and lied to the Australian people at the election we had in the middle of last year.",100
135,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will be very careful.,100
136,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"I take your admonition, Mr Speaker. What did this Prime Minister say to the Australian people before the election? Putting her hands on her heart she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That is why this suspension cannot wait. She has got to explain herself. What did the Treasurer say to the Australian people before the election? He said that my claim that as sure as night follows day there will be a carbon tax if this government is re-elected was a hysterical exaggeration. It is so hysterical that it is exactly what this government is doing and that is why this suspension of standing orders cannot wait. This Prime Minister went to the Australian people saying: 'There will not be a carbon tax. There will not be an emissions trading scheme. What there will be is a climate change people's convention.' That is what she said. That is what she took to the Australian people and nothing would happen, she said, until there was a deep and lasting consensus. That is what the Prime Minister took to the Australian people. She reckons she has got a consensus because she has got a deal with the Greens. We had the climate change people's convention on the weekend. It consisted of just five people: two Greens, two Independents and one Labor minister to take the Greens' instructions back to the cabinet. That is no people's convention; that is a fraud on the Australian people and that is why it is important that we suspend standing orders. I think that it is very important that the actors and the celebrities of this country should have their say. People who live in ecomansions have a right to be heard, they really do. People who are worth $53 million have a right to be heard, but their voice should not be heard ahead of the voice of the ordinary working people of this country. Their voice should not be heard ahead of the forgotten families of this country. It is one of the fundamental principles of our democracy that everyone's voice is equal. You do not give special weight to celebrities, you do not give special weight to people who live half the year in Hollywood, where there is no carbon tax, and you do not give special weight even to former leaders of the Liberal Party. You give weight to the voice of the Australian people. That is why it is so important that we should suspend standing orders, and that is why this matter cannot wait. I say to the Prime Minister, who typically has scuttled out of this chamber, that you will not be able to avoid the voice of the Australian people for that much longer. The Prime Minister should stop thinking that a handful of celebrities somehow represent the voice of the Australian people. She should not be frightened of their voice. If she is so certain that her arguments on climate change and a carbon tax are so right, she should listen to the Australian people. She should give them a chance to say yes or no, as the case may be. She should stop thinking that the only people who count are the people who agree with her. Why it is so important that we suspend standing orders, and why this matter cannot wait, is that this government's carbon tax will be a massive hit on the standard of living of the forgotten families of our country. It will lead to a 25 per cent increase in power prices, a 6½c a litre increase in private petrol prices, a five per cent increase in grocery prices, a $6,000 increase in the price of a new home and, as we discovered today, at least a $12,000 a year increase in the price of running a farm-and that is at just $20 a tonne. If the government's carbon tax goes ahead, at least 16 coal mines will close, 23,000 jobs will be lost in the mining industry and 45,000 jobs will be lost in the manufacturing industry.",100
137,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the Opposition will return to the suspension.,101
138,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"We must suspend standing orders because the 126,000 workers in regional Australia whose jobs will be in jeopardy if this carbon tax goes ahead deserve to be heard. What has this Prime Minister got against the manufacturing workers of our country that makes her want to destroy manufacturing by putting on our industries burdens that will not be borne by any of our competitors? We heard a lot today from the Prime Minister about the Prime Minister of Great Britain. What she did not tell us about is the escape clause that David Cameron put in his statement the other day that, if in 2014 no other country is doing what is proposed, he will revise his targets down. What we should see is a bit of honesty from this Prime Minister, who if she was fair dinkum would say to the Australian people: 'All right, I deceived you before the election. I want to make an honest politician of myself by going to you and saying, ""Give me a mandate for this tax.""' The Prime Minister says there will be compensation, but of course she has overpromised the compensation. You cannot give all of it to households and half of it to industry. The fact is that there will never be enough compensation for this carbon price, because you cannot compensate people who have lost their jobs as a result of this Prime Minister's toxic tax. The tax will be permanent, the compensation will be temporary and the tax will just go up and up. It must be $40 a tonne, according to the Greens, if it is going to drive a shift from coal to gas. It must be $100 a tonne, according to the Greens, to drive a shift from fossil fuels to renewables. We know who is running this government when it comes to this policy. It is not the Prime Minister; it is Senator Bob Brown. When the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' did she mislead the Australian people or is the carbon tax an admission that the real Prime Minister of this country is Senator Bob Brown? The Prime Minister should get up on her feet and answer those questions. If she does not, the charge against her will be that not only did she deceive the people but also she has got no guts and she has got no ticker. (Time expired)",101
139,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion seconded?,101
140,Mr HOCKEY,MOTIONS," I second the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. This matter is urgent, because the government is refusing to answer the most basic questions in this place about the carbon tax. The government is refusing to answer a question about how many jobs will be affected. The government is refusing to answer a question about the impact on the economy. The government is refusing to answer a simple question about the impact on households. The government is refusing to answer a simple question about what the price will be, leaving the vacuum to be filled by the Greens, who range between $40 a tonne and $100 a tonne. The government is refusing to answer questions about the impact of other trading partners, such as Russia and Canada, declaring that they will not have a second round of the Kyoto protocol. The government is refusing to answer a question about whether it is modelling the impact of our trading partners pulling out over the weekend from that commitment. The government is refusing to respond to the modelling of the Australian Food and Grocery Council which suggests that food and grocery prices will rise by between three and five per cent at $26 a tonne. The government is refusing to answer every simple question that the Australian people want answered. Instead, it is sending out others. A Prime Minister with no courage at all is standing behind an advertising campaign commenced last night led by others. The Prime Minister stated blatantly on the front page of a newspaper today that she was sending her ministers out for a blitz on the Australian community, but she will not answer simple questions in this place. The Australian people are bemused by this, but they are also made afraid by this. Why? Because it clearly illustrates the fact that is a government with no confidence, no plan and no roadmap. It declares issues to be the greatest moral challenge of all time and it declares issues to be fundamental to the Australian economy, yet it leaves the great questions unanswered. It leaves Australians confused and in a place where, if they cannot have confidence in this government, they cannot have confidence in the destiny of the nation. So it comes as no surprise that this is a matter of urgency because as each day passes new data comes out that indicates that confidence in the community is, at best, flat but it is having a real impact on our economy. Flat retail sales, flat housing starts-it all comes through in the economy because this is a government that creates no sense of confidence. It is a government that does not believe in its own words. If the government does not believe in its own words and if it has a Prime Minister who refuses to debate this issue in detail in this place, how can you expect Australians to believe the government knows what it is doing? In the same way that this government confuses Australians about its fiscal strategy and in the same way that it confuses Australians about its approach to climate change-having said it is the great moral challenge-now the two chief salespeople for the government's new carbon tax are the ones who only a few months ago said to Kevin Rudd, 'Dump it and dump it fast.' We have a Treasurer with no commitment and no spine. We have a Prime Minister with no courage and no direction. Out of all of that, they are smiling at the thought that the Australian people are afraid. I will tell you what: the carbon tax issue is not about climate change; it is about the rising cost of living for everyday Australians. That is what it is about. That is why there was a visceral reaction to the as last night. this There is extreme concern in the community about the introduction of a carbon tax because Australians know that over the next six months they will face higher interest rates, higher electricity prices, higher costs and higher education costs. They will face a flood tax, a mining tax and now a carbon tax. All of it makes everyday life more expensive for everyday Australians. The Prime Minister, who proclaims that this will be the year of decision-making, does not have the ticker to come in here and lay the details of the carbon tax on the floor of the House for all Australians to debate. This is a government without direction and without confidence, and it emanates directly from the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. They are not committed to this. They simply do not understand where they are taking the Australian people. From the coalition's perspective, we are standing up for everyday Australians and we call on the government to go to the people and get their endorsement if they think it is such a great policy.

That is the dominant strategy of their tactics committee each and every day. The only reason Tony Abbott wants an election is that he knows he will not last the distance. He knows that the opposition are divided. They stand for nothing and therefore they are divided on everything. They are divided across the board. It is Minchin versus Abbott on whether the Libs should support good policy or not. It is Turnbull versus Abbott on carbon pricing.",103

148,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I am indeed. The reason they want to suspend standing orders rather than have question time is that they are quite rightly embarrassed by their performance in recent times. They are divided against each other. There are letters from the shadow Treasurer today in the Financial Review-a day after he did a doorstop interview saying, 'Put aside your individual interests'-which bag the shadow finance minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their lack of economic credibility. It just does not stack up. We know that you cannot believe anything that they have to say. We know that the member for Wentworth sits there day after day reading his little iPad because there is no way he can get a question-not one question all year from the shadow minister for communications.",103

152,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"The reason we should not have this suspension of standing orders very clear. It is just a stunt from an opposition that is incapable of even trying hold the executive to account. That is what we do in question time each day. The opposition says that the National Broadband Network is a major issue-it is terrible!-but it cannot even get a question from the shadow minister for communications. He is not allowed to communicate with this parliament by asking a question. We know that is the case because last week the opposition went into a public implosion. Its private division became public when the Chief Opposition Whip sent out an email bagging the member for Wentworth and bagging other senior members of his own political party. At the time, the Chief Opposition Whip said that he did not show it to the Leader of the Opposition; it had nothing to do with him-almost.",104

The reason we should not support this suspension is that we as a parliament should not provide a cover for the opposition's incompetence and its failure to stand for absolutely anything. Day after day the opposition come in here and try to move a suspension so that it does not actually have to debate the substance before this parliament-so that it does not have to debate the legislation, so that it does not have to try to hold the government to account. We know today that this Leader of the Opposition is the only Liberal leader still alive who does not support a price on carbon. is Everyone else is out there-the member for Wentworth, the former member for to Bradfield, the former PM Malcolm Fraser and the former opposition leader John Hewson. John Howard supported a price on carbon. He went to an election supporting a price on carbon. Every one of them supports a price on carbon except for our friend here the Leader of the Opposition. Today in question time. I thought, 'I want more questions from those opposite. That is why we should not have a suspension. There is some remote chance that the member for Wentworth might ask one. If not, there is some remote chance that the Leader of the National Party might ask me a question.' He has not since some time early in the last term of parliament-it has been years. If question time were not adjourned each day there might be some chance. Earlier today we did have a question from the member for Bradfield. The member for Bradfield, whose electorate had the honour of having the Prime Minister there today talking with constituents about the need to take action on climate change, said that he wants an election on carbon tax. He is having a vote on his website, and the result is that 56.6 per cent say that yes, they do support the government introducing a carbon tax. I say to the member for Bradfield that it is no wonder the Prime Minister got such a good reception. I said last week that the opposition leader had done for political discourse what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer. The first time you hear him, it is a bit interesting-it is loud and you cannot ignore it. To give him credit, you cannot ignore it, but over a period of time when you hear it day after day and match after match you realise that there is only one noise, and that noise is no: no, no, no, no, no. That is the only noise the Leader of the Opposition can make. After a while you find what the Australian public finds, which is that it is just annoying. They expect better. They expect some substance from the Leader of the Opposition, not this relentless negativity, which is all we get day after day.",104

164,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," by leave-I move amendments (9) and (10), as circulated in my name, together: (9) Schedule 1, item 40, page 14 (lines 14 and 15), omit the item. (10) Schedule 1, item 43, page 14 (lines 27 and 28), omit the item. The bill proposes to repeal section 117AB, which provides for mandatory cost orders, albeit that some such orders might cover only a portion of the costs where a party knowingly made a false allegation in a statement in proceedings. The explanatory memorandum cites the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation and the Family Law Council report as finding that the section operates as a disincentive for disclosing family violence. This is misleading. The Chisholm report alludes to practitioner concern as the basis for its recommendation for repeal, but neither of the major studies cited makes any substantive finding. The Family Law Council report in fact recommends that the provisions should be clarified with an explanatory note or with public education. The Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation found that 67.7 per cent of respondents disagreed with the proposition that the prospect of an adverse costs order has discouraged allegations of violence or child abuse that are genuinely held and/or likely to be true. It should be noted that the test proposed in section 117AB is a stringent one. A mandatory costs order could only arise from the evidence that was not proffered in the circumstances or even was given recklessly or without belief. It only applies-and I think this is very important-to knowingly false evidence. If a court was prepared to make such a finding there is no reason why a costs order should not follow. Individual members of the judiciary have confirmed that such false accusations by no means are unknown and that sanctions must apply in such cases. The courts have provided guidance on the application of the existing provision. In Charles & Charles [2007] Justice Cronin said: There can be no room for misunderstanding or doubt; objectively, the person making the statement cannot believe the statement to be true. Recent cases include Sharma & Sharma (No. 2), where a mother was found to have fabricated allegations of abuse against a father and where the alleged victim had vehemently and unequivocally denied the allegation, and Klumper & Klumper, where a father was found to have knowingly made false statements about a mother's parenting capacity and in Hogan and Halverson, where a mother was found to have knowingly made false statements that a child sustained an injury while in his father's care. Cost orders are made much less routinely in the family jurisdiction than in any other. Sadly, it is clear that some parties can and will make false statements if they perceive an advantage in doing so. Because cost orders are not routine there must be an express disincentive in the act and that is why it is very important that the House pass the amendments as circulated by the opposition, specifically, to make sure that when false evidence has wilfully been given some sanction will apply.",106
165,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS," The government opposes the amendments. The opposition has moved amendments to omit items 40 and 43 of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill, which seeks to repeal section 117AB of the Family Law Act. Let us look at the evidence supporting the proposed repeal of this section. Professor Chisholm recommended its repeal and in his submission to the Senate inquiry he again stated that the provisions seemed to operate as a disincentive to disclosing family violence and do not appear to have had any beneficial effect. I remind the House that Professor Chisholm had a distinguished period of service as a judge of the Family Court of Australia. The Family Law Council said that there is no evidence that section 117AB is achieving its purpose of discouraging false allegations of violence. The Australian and New South Wales law reform commissions endorsed the recommendations made by Professor Chisholm and by the Family Law Council. Repeal of section 117AB has strong public support including from the legal profession and key stakeholders in the family law community. The opposition essentially argues that repealing the mandatory cost order provision will open the way for false allegations of violence to be made in court. Again, this is a nonsense. In fact, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, in a report commissioned during the period of the former government, found the lack of confidence in the ability of cost orders to discourage false statements has grown. The opposition has also said that if a court is prepared to make a finding that a party has knowingly given false evidence there is no reason why a cost order should not follow that event. I should say that I could not agree more. I wholeheartedly agree that there should be disincentives to knowingly making a false allegation or false denial in relation family violence. But the act already provides disincentives to knowingly making a false allegation or false denial in parenting matters through the current power that exists in section 117. Both Professor Chisholm and the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that while there is evidence of section 117AB being applied, cost orders on this basis are rarely sought and rarely made. In fact there have been occasions when the courts have relied on the general power to order costs against a party under section 117 and found that this section is broad enough to deal with false statements, including false allegations and false denials. A case in point is Claringbold v James in 2008, where the court used its existing powers under section 117. In that case Justice Bennett relied on section 117(2A)(c) to make a cost order against a mother who was found to have knowingly made false statements. Finally, as the opposition keeps raising the work of the Hull committee in 2003, I think it is important to note that mandatory cost orders were not part of the original proposals of the resultant report; in fact, the clause was not to become section 117AB until it was inserted at the suggestion of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-and it is significant to note that that recommendation was not supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The former government made the decision to continue to include this clause despite there being no statistical data as to the frequency of false allegations and statements noting that courts already routinely make cost orders in the circumstances. Essentially, that begs the question as to why section 117AB was inserted in the first place. We would suggest that it was merely tokenistic, because the court already has sufficient, adequate and to proven powers under section 117 of the act. For that reason we oppose the opposition's amendments. Question put: That the amendments be agreed to. The House divided.

168,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I remind honourable members that it is the wish of the House to debate this bill concurrently with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2011 and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,110
169,Mr KEENAN,BUSINESS," I rise to speak on the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 and related bills. What we see with these bills is a lazy piece of policy making that is designed to recoup the costs that are associated with Labor's failed economic management. The purpose of these bills is to fulfil Labor's 2010-11 budget commitment to recover the costs of AUSTRAC's supervisory activities from 1 July this year. I could not characterise the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 any better than it was characterised by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, when they said that this bill was akin to asking the Australian Taxation Office to charge taxpayers a fee to lodge their returns. The bills place a large burden on reporting entities, depending on how much they earn. The initial proposal from the government was to charge all reporting entities to recover the costs of running AUSTRAC, but, after a lot of those entities voiced their oppositionand rightly so because they were to be levied BILLS $500 at a time-the government revised their proposal, so now this levy is only going to apply to larger entities. I understand that only 199 of the largest reporting entities will be taxed. Those large entities will obviously be places like banks and casinos and people who you might say are able to pay the levy, but, at the end of the day, somebody always pays when the government levies a new tax. This is not a large amount of money in the scheme of things, but, regardless, this is still poor policy-making. As we know, a Senate committee is looking into the bills and is due to report on 16 June. In a submission to the committee inquiry, the Law Council of Australia noted their concerns about the bills and about their profession falling under the reporting obligations. The Law Council said: If law practices become subject to AML/CTFthat is, anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financingreporting obligations and consequently the cost recovery regime, the Law Council would have particular concerns about the impact on smaller firms. … … … The proposed cost recovery levy, which would apply other than beyond a legal practice's compliance costs, would almost certainly lead, in the Law Council's opinion, to an increase in the cost of legal services, making such services less affordable. The Law Council makes a valid point which would no doubt be of concern to many businesses and institutions across Australia. There are also concerns that the levy will place Australia and its financial institutions at a substantial competitive disadvantage. This is what happens when you levy new taxes that are not levied on other players within our region. Citigroup wrote in their submission to the committee that the levy will have unintended consequences in relation to Australia's ability to compete in the Asia-Pacific region, given the additional significant costs that the levy will impose on Australian financial institutions. They said: We recommend that the composition of the levy be reassessed to ensure a more equitable distribution reflective of the designated services that AUSTRAC monitors and supervises. The government's rationale for basing the large-entity component of the levy on the earnings of the entity group is that AUSTRAC incurs greater expenses in regulating larger entities because larger entities have more customers and usually provide more complex products. However, this calculation does not take into account the extent to which a leviable entity's earnings are related to the provision of designated services. Due to this, an entity with high earnings may incur a large-entity component even though the entity only provides a small volume of designated services. There is a potential that the levy will have a disproportionate effect on those large entities which only provide designated services as an incidental part of their businesses. I have already stated what some of the industry associations have been saying about these bills. I particularly like ASFA's way of characterising it. I also note that the Australian Bankers Association director Tony Burke said that the government's clear objective was to recover costs rather than provide any benefit to those subject to the regulation. He is quoted in an article: ""As the paper currently stands, the potential cost of compliance would be high,"" he said. ""Charge-backs to internal groups and agencies would add significant overheads in tracking costs and reconciling payments."" The same article goes on: Institute of Chartered Accountants executive general manager Lee White said members already incurred significant costs in supporting AUSTRAC's regulatory aims, and it was unreasonable to ask them to bear more. ""Our members provide legitimate services to clients who overwhelmingly are law-abiding individuals and businesses,"" he said. ""If these legitimate services are exploited by criminals, it is these wrong-doers who create the need for regulation and who should contribute to the costs through the confiscated proceeds of their crimes."" I think those comments from industry really go to the heart of this bill. The services that AUSTRAC provide are not necessarily services direct to the reporting entities that have been charged under this legislation. As I said, it is not a large sum of money so you will not find an enormous public outcry but that does not mean that it does not represent bad policy making. It is not reasonable for the government to recoup the costs of running every government agency if that government agency is providing a public service rather than providing direct services to the people who are being asked to pay for them. AUSTRAC does provide a very valuable service but we believe that it is not reasonable to come back and to ask the 199 largest users to cover the costs of its running, particularly when really this is all about filling the budget black hole that Labor have created for themselves from their enormous wasteful spending up to this point. We will not be opposing the bill in the House, although we do reserve the right to move amendments in the Senate based on the outcome of the Senate committee report.",110
170,Mr RIPOLL,BUSINESS," It is a pleasure for me to speak in relation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 and cognate bills, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2011 and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. They all relate to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre supervisory cost recover matter. Listening to that previous speaker and others from the opposition, I think they will be supporting these bills but that they are waiting to hear what the Senate committee report has to say on these matters. I will up on one of the issues that was raised by the previous speaker. Essentially, the member was saying there is no need to have organisations and businesses that carry out supervisory activities paying a fee in terms of providing that information. The reality is that this happens across a lot of areas. There is a cost, and cost recovery in any government department or any agency is a normal process. It is something that goes on. The previous speaker also mentioned that it is the case that it is not a lot of money. The cost recovery is in the order of about $89 million for the period 2011 to 2014 and represents those people involved in activities paying a fee in the process of having those activities properly recorded. I want to briefly say how important AUSTRAC is. AUSTRAC does an enormous job. It does a great job and it provides a great community benefit, particularly against organised crime. It is estimated that it saves the community something like $15 billion a year. Organised crime, as we know, is a significant national security threat and it is a growing challenge. I think people ought to understand that. The Commonwealth, through the Organised Crime Strategic Framework, is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies all work together in partnership to prevent, disrupt or investigate and prosecute organised crime in whatever form it takes. Levy These bills ensure that there is proper financing and access so that AUSTRAC can do its job properly. AUSTRAC intelligence has a number of very important roles, specifically to detect drug and chemical precursor transactions and to prevent people smuggling, corruption, card skimming, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion, fraud and a whole range of other activities. It is there to protect pick the community; it is there to protect business; it is there to protect the Commonwealth and ordinary people. It has a very good track record. In fact, for the 200910 financial year, information that was provided by AUSTRAC brought about 3,700 cases conducted by the Australian Federal Police with other agencies, more than 1,800 cases for the Australian Taxation Office, which resulted in recovery of evaded taxes in excess of $272 million, and more than 1,200 cases involving Centrelink, leading to a recovery of more than $7 million per year. So I think we can all agree about the great work that is done in this area. The case for the justification of cost recovery is as strong as it is easy to make: quite simply, it is good policy and it is policy of recent governments that entities which have created the need for government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. Other regulators such as APRA already recover the cost of their regulatory activities from the entities they regulate. This happens in a number of areas. Rather than being a burden or merely a cost, it is actually an assistance to business. It prevents international crime, fraud and a whole range of other activities from being perpetrated on Australian business and, therefore, Australian consumers as well. It has a larger benefit to all those involved. This is a comprehensive package of three bills that reduce the burden on small business. The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on small business and, as a result, small business entities of a certain type will not have to pay this levy. Affiliates of registered remittance networks are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with the registered remittance networks rather than individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses such as licensed post offices and newsagents from the operation of the levy. The government is committed through these bills and, of course, through its broader policy to proper governance and ensuring that organised crime, people smuggling, fraud, card skimming, money laundering and all of those illegal financial activities do not occur and that, where they do, they are detected, there is proper reporting, there is proper funding and that funding can be created via cost recovery through the agency. I commend the bills to the House.",111
171,Mr MITCHELL,BUSINESS," I rise in support of the government's Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Recovery Bill, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost (Collection) Bill and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Consequential Amendments) Bill. These bills are a legislative package that will ensure that AUSTRAC cost recovery is implemented effectively. The levy bill will establish a legislative structure that will allow AUSTRAC to reclaim the costs of its regulatory functions from the businesses that it regulates and, in turn, is part of the Gillard government's ongoing commitment to protect Australians from the social and economic impacts of organised crime. I am pleased to speak on these bills as it gives me the opportunity to talk about the importance of AUSTRAC in protecting our financial system and how, in turn, it combats organised crime, money laundering, financing of terrorism, including people smuggling, and tax evasion. AUSTRAC is a significant body in Australia. It is a vital agency-an anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regulator and specialist intelligence unit which works with Australian industries and businesses to provide information about potential criminal activity to our law enforcement agencies. It is at the forefront of the fight against transnational organised crime. AUSTRAC's strategic directions statement as outlined in the 2011-12 budget states: In its regulatory role, AUSTRAC oversees compliance with reporting obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 for approximately 18,000 businesses across diverse industry sectors that include financial services providers, the gambling industry and other specified 'regulated entities'. As Australia's financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC collects and analyses financial information provided by Recovery regulated entities to assist Australian law enforcement, national security, social justice and revenue agencies and certain international counterparts in the investigation and prosecution of serious criminal activity, including terrorism financing, organised crime and tax evasion. In 2011–12, AUSTRAC will continue to improve and supplement its systems to enhance all aspects of its dealings with its diverse regulated population. AUSTRAC will also review the way in which it provides guidance to regulated entities on their obligations. As Australia's financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC disseminates financial intelligence to Commonwealth, state and territory partner agencies and international counterparts. In 2011– 12, AUSTRAC will continue to strengthen its support to whole-of-government initiatives and priorities focused on combating organised crime, tax evasion and threats to Australia's security. As part of this commitment, AUSTRAC will also continue to provide critical financial intelligence support to national investigations and taskforces. AUSTRAC also plays a key role in identifying the methods and techniques used by criminals and this in turn is pivotal in catching and combating fraud and other serious crimes. AUSTRAC then outlines these techniques in its reports and tracks emerging techniques like card skimming, early release super schemes, Ponzi schemes, boiler room scams, and internet, lottery and sweepstake scams. AUSTRAC continues to uphold the integrity of Australia's financial system and assists to safeguard and protect Australians from serious organised crime. This package of bills enables AUSTRAC to collect the levy and deal with the related administrative matters such as invoicing, late payment penalties and review mechanisms. It makes it a requirement for reporting entities to enrol with AUSTRAC. Currently reporting entities are encouraged to enrol with AUSTRAC. Only enrolled entities can lodge reports with AUSTRAC electronically. Over 18,000 entities have enrolled with AUSTRAC to date. Organised crime is a growing challenge that the Gillard government is committed to fight and deter, and the passage of this legislation will go to strengthening our stance against organised crime in Australia. The impacts of organised crime are far-reaching and have severe consequences for our economy and society, as it is estimated to cost the community $15 million per year. Therefore, monitoring money flows-which is, in essence, the lifeblood of organised crime-is critical. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission conducted an inquiry into the future impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society back in 2007. The inquiry found that technological developments like the internet have increased opportunities which enable organised crime groups to pursue new types of crime-things like electronic piracy, counterfeiting and forgery, credit card fraud, money laundering and denial-of-service attacks. The committee's inquiry into the legislative arrangements to outlaw serious and organised crime groups stated that the impact of organised crime in Australia is significant. The Australian Crime Commission found that in 2008 organised crime's financial impact on Australia was roughly $10 billion. These impacts include: loss of legitimate business revenue, loss of tax revenue, expenditure fighting organised crime through law enforcement and regulatory means, and expenditure managing social harms caused through criminal activity. Last year, AUSTRAC's annual report highlighted the importance of financial intelligence in combating serious crimes. The report illustrated the significant role AUSTRAC had played in assisting the detection and persecution of a wide range of offences such as money laundering, fraud and the importation of drugs. In 2009-10 AUSTRAC received over 21 million financial transaction reports from businesses in the financial, money remittance, bullion and gambling sectors. This included almost 50,000 reports motivated by suspicious matters. The report highlighted the increase in organised crime with a record number of reports received during that year. Last year, AUSTRAC played a vital role in investigating a major money-laundering case which resulted in the imprisonment of a Sydney woman who pleaded guilty to laundering over $1.9 million through her money transfer business over a 2½ month period from November 2007 to January 2008. It was reported that the woman had divided the money into amounts of less than $10,000, which was then transferred to beneficiaries in Vietnam using a series of false names. The woman will serve at least 3½ years before being eligible for parole. This case and the sentencing will deter others who are thinking about breaking Australia's laws. In the 2009-10 financial year AUSTRAC information contributed to more than 3,700 cases conducted by the Australian Federal Police and other partner agencies; more than 1,800 cases conducted by the Australian Taxation Office, resulting in recovery of evaded taxes in excess of $272 million; and more than 1,200 cases involving Centrelink, leading to a total of more than $7 million in savings per year. It has been reported that last year organised criminals were ripping more than $15 billion a year out of the Australian economy. As I mentioned earlier, there has been an increase in organised crime with the use of new and emerging technologies and the internet, giving these criminals additional avenues. Therefore it is not surprising that there has been a 50 per cent jump in organised crime since 2008, and we are working to combat this. This government are committed to tackling organised crime. We have spent $14.5 million on a Criminal Intelligence Fusion Centre to provide new capabilities to prevent and detect organised crime. The fusion centre provides in-depth criminal intelligence and analysis and boosts the capability of law enforcement agencies to identify high-risk cash flows, patterns of crime and the individuals, businesses and corporations that may be involved in criminal enterprises in Australia and abroad. AUSTRAC is an important agency upholding the integrity of Australia's financial system by making businesses resilient to money laundering, tracking and discovering the techniques used by serious organised criminals. I therefore support the measures in these bills to allow AUSTRAC to recover the cost of its supervisory activities from businesses which it regulates under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006.",113
172,Ms SAFFIN,BUSINESS," I rise to speak in support of the Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011, the collection bill and the consequential amendments bill. Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice for considering at the outset the operations of small businesses in general and particularly in rural and regional areas. In some cases if the legislation had been applied in a blanket way, it could have adversely affected the operations of those small businesses and particularly those small businesses in rural and regional areas. I know from conversations with the minister and from consultations, which he was able to ensure happened around Australia, that we have got a good outcome. The minister took the time to listen to MPs and backbenchers. That was good, because backbenchers sometimes know a thing or two and are engaged on the ground. Ministers are backbenchers too, so they hear views from their electorates as well. These bills provide exemptions from levy arrangements and businesses can claim if they fall into those exemption categories or will be exempted-as I read it-as of right if they are in certain categories. I am not sure of the mechanism by which they will exercise that but it seems that there are two parts in place for that. I am getting nods around the chamber, so I must have read that bit correctly. The bills give effect to sensible recommendations announced in the 2010-11 budget that, from this financial year, 201112, will allow AUSTRAC to recover the cost of its supervisory activities from businesses regulated by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act. Those activities have their genesis or their national legislation but they also give effect to part the package of the counterterrorism conventions-and there are about 13 that we are obligated or mandated by the Security Council to put in place. Indeed, we want to at a national level for reasons that are self evident but are worthy of reiteration. The minister has quoted the figures-as I think most people in this place have done. The Australian government figures show that organised crime-where a lot of money laundering and financing of terrorism activities do take place and can take place and not just here but also internationallycosts Australia about $15 billion a year. I take it that that $15 billion figure would mean cost by commission and omission. The cost recovery that is inherent in these three bill is not new. In this area, the costrecovery guidelines of 2002 lay out that approach. Its essence is simple. It is that entities that have created the need for government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. People may argue that they do not allow any irregular activities that could facilitate crime and the things that we are talking about-and that may be so. But, when you are setting up a regulatory framework, it is like setting up your rates at local government level-we all have to bear that cost in a collective, coordinated way. It is no different when we are doing it nationally. It is the same cost-recovery model. If you are a beneficiary or are in a business that could cause some of that harm, even inadvertently, we all have to participate in paying in that way. The framework starts with the general and then it deals with the particular-in this case, the particular as well as that category of exemptions. That brings me back to the small businesses and the rural and regional area and where the government is making sure that we have a coherent and cogent of regulatory framework while, at the same time, making sure that small business does not have to bear the burden in a disproportionate way. This legislation is very mindful of that. It proposes that affiliates of registered remittance networks will not have to pay the levy. Affiliates are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with the registered remittance network rather than with individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses such as licensed post offices and newsagents from the operation of the levy. That is really important in my seat of Page and I know it would be in other seats. It was really important that that was one of the considerations that the minister and those in the department involved in preparing the legislation were able to turn their minds to. For pubs and clubs in rural and regional areas, I understand that AUSTRAC is currently consulting on a draft rule around that area-again, looking at those venues where there are a certain number of gaming machines. That will be the benchmark for where the exemption is able to be had. It is also proposed to remove non-employing entities, such as sole proprietors and partnerships without employees-which are often run by families-and microbusinesses which employ fewer than five people. That is an ABS definition. They will be able to be exempt from the base component levy. That is rather sensible. I understand that these three bills will recover $88.9 million in the period 2011-14. That is important, because part of governing is spending. I know that I like spending in my seat of Page and I am always asking ministers for money. But, as responsible members of parliament, we also have an obligation to talk about those bills that allow government to recover moneys and we have some responsibility to be mindful, particularly in terms of such a critical where the costs of organised crime do cost us as a community-that $15 billion a year. I know that sometimes people think that these sorts of bills are not the bills that necessarily attract a lot of people champing at the bit to speak about them and that cost recovery, white collar crime and things like that might seem a bit pedestrian, but they are really fundamental to the way our criminal justice system operates and to good government. With those comments, I commend the bills to the House. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (16:22): I thank the member of Page and the members for MCEwen, Stirling and Oxley for their contributions. The member for Page is quite right; the government did consider the impacts upon small businesses, took submissions from representative bodies and took submissions from members of parliament, who raised the potential adverse impacts of this levy upon organisations within their own constituencies, particularly smaller businesses and businesses in those regional areas that we would not want to impose on unnecessarily. I believe, through the process of engagement with the sector, with members of parliament and with people who are advocating on behalf of those who are involved in this sector, we have come up with a very good balance indeed. I note that the member for Stirling did indicate that the opposition would support this bill unamended through the House. Of course, we will wait to see whether in fact the opposition will support this bill unamended in the other place. However, I say to the opposition that, if we are looking at ensuring we are sufficiently resourced to have very strong, rigorous regulations to protect the interests of our financial system and indeed protect us against organised crime and other threats to this country, there needs to be a solution. If there is just criticism of a mechanism enclosed within a number of bills, that in itself is not enough. I do implore the member for Stirling to keep that in mind. It is important that we get this right. A lot of work has gone into this and a lot of engagement with the sector, and I do believe that we have struck the right balance. Organised crime, as has been said by all of the speakers in this debate, is a significant national security threat and challenge for Australia. Through the Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework, the government is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent, disrupt, investigate and prosecute organised crime. AUSTRAC plays a critical role in the fight against organised crime. Through its regulatory activities, AUSTRAC helps to mitigate the risk of Australian businesses being used for money laundering, terrorism financing and other organised crime. This legislative package is necessary to give effect to the 2010 budget commitment that, consistent with the government's cost recovery guidelines, AUSTRAC will recover the costs of its regulatory activities from 1 July this year. The levy bill imposes a levy on entities regulated by AUSTRAC under the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. It provides that the amount of levy payable for each financial year will be determined by legislative instrument and cannot exceed a statutory limit of $33 million indexed. The collection bill enables AUSTRAC to collect the supervisory cost recovery levy and establishes the necessary framework for administering the levy, including matters relating to collection, invoicing and dealing with late payments. The collection bill also introduces administrative review of a decision by the AUSTRAC CEO to waive a levy or late payment penalty. Significant consultation has occurred with industry around the structure of AUSTRAC's supervisory levy. Through this process the government has, as I said earlier, listened to the concerns of business and made significant adjustments to lessen the burden, particularly on small business. The third bill in this package, the consequential amendments bill, amends the Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act to introduce compulsory enrolment for all reporting entities regulated by AUSTRAC. This formalises current arrangements where AUSTRAC encourages entities voluntarily enrol. Mandating requirement will mean that AUSTRAC can better identify its regulated population for the purposes of calculating and applying the AUSTRAC cost recovery levy. The consequential amendments bill also amends the current infringement notice scheme to allow for the issuing of notices for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details. I commend this legislative package to the House and, in doing so, I also table a correction to the explanatory memorandum in relation to all three bills. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",115
173,Mr MORRISON,BUSINESS," As I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011, I reflect on the fact that this bill has been introduced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship following the riots that occurred at Christmas Island and Villawood detention centres. We all know that there are around 6,800 people in the detention network in Australia-up from just four people who had arrived illegally by boat when we left office. The reason for that is that so many boats have come. I do not think we can pass much further today without noting that yet another boat has arrived, as advised by the Minister for Home Affairs in a press release today-a boat containing 52 passengers and four crew. That is the fourth boat to have arrived since the government announced its people swap deal with Malaysia. Over 150 people have been found coming to Australia since that deal was announced. The government is quickly drawing down on what I call its asylum deal credit card with Malaysia, and it has not even completed that deal. The fivefor-one people swap with Malaysia was a proposal conceived in denial and negotiated in desperation. The situation now is 2011 completely unclear. Confusion reigns, and it is clear that people smugglers are not buying the Prime Minister's bluff about a deal that is yet to be concluded and about which question marks are raised almost every day, Assent not just from a human rights perspective but particularly from a human rights perspective. The bill before us today deals with changes to the character test. This bill makes it clear that, from the date of commencement, a person will fail the character test under section 501 of the Migration Act if they have been convicted of an offence committed in immigration detention, during an escape from immigration detention, during a period where a person has escaped from immigration detention or if a person has been convicted of the offence of escaping from immigration detention, whether the conviction or offence occurred before, on or after that commencement. Where a person does not pass the character test because of any of the provisions in section 501, which go well beyond criminal conduct, the minister or his delegate has the power to refuse, grant or cancel a visa on these new character grounds. The amendments would apply only to persons who have been convicted of an offence by a court under the specific criminal conduct provisions that are being introduced in this bill. They would not apply to a person who is charged with an offence or offences but is not convicted. There must be at least one conviction for the amendments to sections 500A and 501 to apply. The coalition will provide some support to this bill, but we will seek to make an important amendment, which I will return to later in my remarks. This measure was announced after the Villawood riots, but prior to that there were some serious riots on Christmas Island. On that occasion, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship made some remarks, to which I will draw the attention of the House. I refer firstly to a statement made on 18 March. The minister gave a press conference with, I believe, the Australian Federal Police, at which he said: Character can have regard to a number of factors: whether somebody has been sentenced for a criminal activity to prison for more than 12 months, and also general conduct and whether somebody's general conduct implies that they are not of good character … character considerations will be taken into account for those on Christmas Island who have organised and perpetrated this sort of activity. It will be taken into account our decision makers and ultimately by me. This was the strong boast from the minister in the wake of the Christmas Island riots, where the Australian Federal Police had to retake the facility by force. They had lost control of the facility, it was in the hands of the detainees, and a pitched battle was waged in that detention centre on Christmas Island. ",119
174,Mr MORRISON,BUSINESS,"I notice the member opposite interjects. I do not know if he has been to Christmas Island, but I have been to Christmas Island and I was there with the Immigration officials and Serco officers who were there that night. They described to the Leader of the Opposition and me the events that took place there-and it was a pitched battle. Bean bag rounds were shot into those who were in the detention centre. The member opposite may be in denial, like the rest of his government when it comes to these matters, but a pitched battle was fought and had to be won. The centre had to be retaken because of the riots going on. It is extraordinary that those opposite would want to enter into a debate about what happened on Christmas Island when they know exactly what happened there-it was an absolute disgrace. Also, having made it very clear that character considerations would be taken into account and that there were general conduct provisions as well as criminal conduct provisions, the minister was asked on 21 March by Lyndal Curtis: You've said that you'll take into account the character test when you're considering whether those protesters should be granted asylum in Australia. Is that still the position? Have you made any more decisions on that? The minister answered: No, the decision, as I outlined last week, is that the Migration Act allows for character issues to be taken into account; that can take into account whether somebody is sentenced to a jail term for by 12 months or more, also more general character considerations can be taken into account. He thundered on: But whatever people's frustrations, there is no excuse for violent behaviour. It is simply unacceptable and it is appropriate that the character test be taken into account. I could not agree more with the minister. On 22 March he said: I've said on a case by case basis I'll be taking the character concerns into very serious consideration. And: I will abide by the Act, but what I have indicated is that the character provisions of the Act allow me or my delegate to take into account prison terms and also general conduct. I will be taking that into account and examining it very seriously. Section 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Migration Act allows the minister to cancel or refuse a person's visa on the basis of a 'person's past and present general conduct.' This is completely unrelated to section 501(6)(c)(i) which allows the minister to cancel or refuse a person's visa on the basis of criminal conduct which resulted in a custodial sentence of more than 12 months. The government has deliberately, I believe, tried to blur these two provisions. The minister may also personally make a decision to cancel a visa pursuant to section 501(3) and in such a case the decision is not subject to the rules of natural justice nor is it viewable on its merits. Also, the minister is not bound in Australian law by any of the matters set out in ministerial directions that are provided when a decision is delegated. Where a decision has been made by a delegate or the AAT not to cancel a visa, section 501(A) of the Migration Act grants power to the minister to set aside the decision of a delegate or the AAT not to exercise the power in section 501(2) to cancel a visa. The minister personally exercises this power to set aside the original decision not to cancel visa and to substitute it with a decision to cancel a visa. Further, the rules of natural justice do not apply to such a decision nor is it reviewable on its merits. The minister has tried to put forward that this bill is necessary to enable him to act as he said he was going to act after the Christmas Island riots. He said the general character provisions would be taken into account and he would be making these decisions. In Senate estimates last week the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship confirmed that the minister had sought advice prior to his press conference where he made announcements about the operation of the general conduct provisions. So the minister had been advised by the secretary when he went to the podium and said very boldly that the general character provisions would be applied. While he has expressed some frustration at using the powers under the act, we find no amendments in this bill to the general character powers that sit under the act-none whatsoever. He has made some changes to the criminal provisions-he is right to do so-but he has made no changes to the general provisions. From that, I understand this minister has no problem with the general conduct provisions in the act. If he believed they needed strengthening and if he believed they were inadequate he would have brought a bill into this House which sought to strengthen the general character provisions in this act, but he has not done so. He has sought to amend an entirely different set of grounds. This leaves me wondering about the motive behind what we see here today. While there can be some improvement in what the minister has put forward in this bill, it does not offer an excuse for not acting as he said he would. The minister is seeking to perform a ruse here, 'The reason I could not a act was that the act was too weak.' He made a bold proclamation after being advised by his department. He was very specific about his reference to the general conduct provision and yet he has made no changes to the general conduct provision in the bill we see before us today. So, by all means, change the criminal conduct provisions, but do not try to put one over people by saying that this was necessary, because he was not prepared to use the general conduct provisions. I remember at the time that the minister gave the excuse, 'Well, it could be reviewed judicially by the Federal Court.' Well, it might be, but if we did not make a decision those in this country every time it might be reviewed by a court we would never make any decisions. Maybe that is the government's plan here because they certainly have not made too many positive decisions in this area for the last 2½ years, other than to wind back the coalition's strong border protection regime and we all know the consequences of that decision. We are in a situation where the minister has sought to make these changes, but he has not provided an explanation about why he has not used the general conduct provisions that were available to him before and after the Christmas Island riots. He has only sought to make amendments in these areas. I also note that this bill has come forward not after the Christmas Island riots but after the Villawood riots. I am not sure how many riots it takes for the minister to get the point, but it would seem that it took at least two major riots where buildings were burnt to the ground. As I mentioned earlier in the House, the series of incidents, riots and various other activities that have taken place in our detention centres are symptomatic of a rolling crisis. So the government was forced to introduce this bill we see before us only after it saw those further riots. I can say that because in Senate estimates it was revealed that the advice on changing this bill was provided, as the secretary indicated, over the Easter weekend of 22 to 25 April. The riots at Villawood took place on 21 and 22 April, and let us not forget that the riots on Christmas Island took place on 12 March, and here we are debating this bill today. I am not fooled and the Australian people are not fooled by what is happening here. By all means, change the provisions if you think it will improve them, and there are some amendments that will improve things and we will seek to amend elements of those, but at the same time this minister has refused to act. Where has he refused to act? We all know the tragic story of SIEV36. That happened under the jurisdiction of the previous Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. He finally has stopped some boats, but he has stopped the wrong ones, in the wrong portfolio. The boats happen to be on our wharves, it would seem. That minister, when he was dealing with SIEV36, did not take action against the individuals who were specifically found by the Northern Territory Coroner-by an independent inquiry-to have been part of the plan to scuttle the boat. That incident resulted in the deaths of five people. It resulted in putting the lives of Australian Defence Force personnel at risk. That minister, Senator Evans, chose not to act. He chose not to use the general conduct provisions that are available in section 501 of the act and he decided to sit. He decided to sit and sit and sit for his entire term as minister for immigration and thought his greatest failing was his inability to control the debate, not that he had allowed thousands upon thousands of people to arrive in boat after boat after boat while watching our detention centre spiral into chaos. He did not think that was his greatest failing; he thought his greatest failing was that he could not control the debate. I do not think that reflects well on that minister and nor does his failure to take action on those involved in the scuttling of the SIEV36. They walk around in Australia today with permanent visas. These are people who the government believes are of good character, who pass the character test and should be given a permanent visa for stay in Australia. The other riot occurred in late 2009 on Christmas Island and involved some 150 Afghans and Sri Lankans. People were taken to hospital and people were medivaced to Perth. That was a very serious incident. At the time, 11 people were charged. In November last year three were convicted of an offence, and this minister did nothing. It was on his watch that they were convicted, in November 2010 as reported. This minister had the opportunity at that time to ask for a brief to be prepared on these individuals and on how he could take action to deny visas to the people convicted of these offences. Nothing happened. They walk around today on permanent visas, as was confirmed to us by the minister himself in this place. We are in a situation whereby we have a minister who is a serial offender when it comes to not taking action, whether it be on those who rioted on Christmas Island in 2009, whether it be on those who rioted on Christmas Island in 2011 or whether it be on those in Villawood who rioted. We even had several of them up on the roof. We learnt last week that the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship was sent into a roof cavity at Villawood to directly negotiate with those who were protesting and that they were told in the course of those days that if they came down they would not be sent to Silverwater prison, when so many others were sent to Silverwater prison. Not all of those who were sent to Silverwater prison were charged, and not everyone who sat on that roof would necessarily have been charged, but 22 were removed and their concern was that they would be sent to Silverwater prison. They were told that they would not be going to Silverwater prison immediately; ultimately they might be, but if they came down they certainly would not be going there on that day. We had the bizarre spectacle of the deputy secretary of the department going up there. I feel for the deputy secretary. I think it is a shame and a disgrace that the good officers of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have been forced into these bizarre scenarios, having to mop up the mess of an incompetent government with failed policies. We had the deputy secretary standing on a box in a room, peering into a roof cavity, negotiating with detainees who were protesting on a roof and several days earlier, I am advised, had been throwing things at fire brigade officers. That is what has come to. How does this happen? It happens when you have a government that runs an operation in our detention network that is all carrot and no stick. We have complaint after complaint from those working in this detention network-people working for Serco and at other places-who are being abused, who are being attacked and who are having threats made against their life and their person. There was a case just the other week of someone who had boiling water thrown over them at Christmas Island. It was described to the media by someone in the department as a 'minor incident'. We know it was not a minor incident; we know it was a critical incident. And we know that in our detention network today, on average, more than three critical incidents occur every single day. If that does not demand an inquiry I do not know what does. I am pleased that in this House this morning we had the opportunity to debate a motion for such an inquiry. Those terms of reference as amended now stand before this House and should be voted on on 16 June in accordance with the normal standing procedure of this House. So there is the opportunity for this House to take up that offer and to look deeply into these matters, to look at what is happening, to consider all the evidence before it, to take evidence in camera, to take evidence from those who are involved in the operations of the system and to get to the heart of why this system has collapsed under the weight of the failed policies of this government. The form continues. The minister-who was so worked up and so concerned about the state of the detention facility that he was going to use the general character test over and over again but is yet to use it in these types of matters-inherited something else from Senator Evans, other than the mess he it is now dealing with, and that is direction 41. Direction 41 was issued by Minister Evans in June 2009 and is an instruction, given under section 499 of the Migration Act, which provides direction to delegates on how they make decisions on section 501. This directive replaced a directive called directive 21, which was instituted by the now Father of the House and the then minister for immigration, the member for Berowra. That directive provided for the following: that the three primary mandated considerations 'for determining whether discretion should be used under section 501 to deny a non-citizen from remaining as Australia' were as follows-these were the Ruddock tests, the coalition tests: (1) Protection of the Australian community and members of the community; (2) The expectations of the Australian community and; (3) The best interests of the child, or children, where they are involved. Now, specifically, the expectations of the Australian community in deciding whether a behaviour is abhorrent and of bad character has been removed by this government since June 2009. The community expectation-the community standard test, if you like-has been abolished by this government. That standard said the following, under 2.12 of the old directive: The Australian community expects noncitizens to obey Australian laws while in Australia. Where a non-citizen has breached, or where there is significant risk that they will breach this trust or where the convicted of offences in Australia or elsewhere, it may be appropriate to refuse the visa application or cancel the visa held by such a person. Visa refusal or cancellation and removal of the noncitizen may be appropriate simply because the nature of the character, concerns or offences are such that the Australian community would expect that the person would not be granted a visa or should be removed from Australia. Decision makers should have due regard to the government's view in this respect. That community standards test was abolished by this government, and it is not for returning. It is not for returning, according to the government-they are not interested in having a community standard test on behaviour and what Australians think is appropriate behaviour. And it does not only apply to detention centres; it applies to everyone who is here on a visa. Let us be clear: someone who is here on a visa, in Australia, is a guest of this nation. They are here under specific terms and conditions. They are protected by the various international conventions and treaties that we are signatories of, but they are also guests in our country. And in our country they are expected to abide by our rules, by our laws and by our standards of behaviour-all of them. When they do not, this act provides for remedies to be applied by the minister. And the previous coalition government specifically said, when making those decisions, you need to give consideration to what community standards and expectations are-and this government have abolished those standards, they have abolished that test. I think that is a great shame, and we urge the government to reconsider this matter. If the minister is serious about strengthening the character provisions, as he has boldly titled his bill, then he should reintroduce directive 21, he should re-establish the community expectations test, and that should be something of a matter of non-citizen has been importance. The other thing that was in the previous directive of the former coalition government was that it said in paragraph 224: … notwithstanding international obligations, the power to refuse or cancel must inherently remain a fundamental exercise of Australian sovereignty. The responsibility to determine who should be allowed to enter or remain in Australia in the interests of the Australian community ultimately lies with the discretion of the responsible minister. This provision was also removed. Australia's interests were subordinated to those interests beyond our shores, in the removal of this provision. While they may have been considered, they did not enjoy the standing of consideration that was made possible by the previous directive 21. So we have form from this government, who are not interested in seriously addressing the issues that sit within our detention network. They can bring these measures into this House, but what they need to address is what is happening within our detention centres as we speak today-and, as we speak today, it is all carrot and no stick; as we speak today, we have people working in those centres who are being abused on a daily basis, without any enforceable code of conduct that enables them to deal with disorder in the centre. Those who get up on a roof, come down from the roof and life continues as normal. That is what happens under the Gillard-Bowen plan for running our detention network. Is it any wonder that it is in such a mess? I want to turn finally to the provision and its application. While the coalition is supportive of the bill and how it is put forward, we do not think it goes far enough. It does not go far enough in these two areas. Firstly, the bill will only apply to the misconduct and criminal conduct of people either in a detention centre or who should have been in a detention centre but who have escaped. What that says, to all of those Australians, who live all around the country, is that if there is someone here on a visa and they commit an offence-they assault you or do something of that nature; they thump you over the head, or whatever it may be-and they get a sentence of less than 12 months, they will not fall foul of this provision; it happens in a detention centre then they will fall foul of that provision. So it is okay for someone to whack someone over the head down at Northies, or down at the Coogee Bay Hotel in Sydney, and get a conviction of less than 12 months, and they can go on their merry way with their visas not addressed in any way, shape or form, and the minister just scurries away again and says, 'Well, it's less than 12 months; there's nothing I can do-my hands are tied.' We know this minister will not use the general conduct provisions; he has already proved that. On behalf of the coalition I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment, circulated in my name, that will do the following: ensure that these provisions apply to all visa holders-not just those who are in detention. There should be one rule on one side of the fence and on the other side of the fence. Too often we have seen the inequity, going both ways, in terms of one rule for some and a different rule for others from this government. What the coalition believes is, if you want to change these provisions, if you want to toughen the test, then you have to be fair dinkum about it-do not just apply it to detention centres; apply it to all of those who are on visas here if you are concerned, and the coalition would be concerned. So we are prepared to put forward that amendment, and we would seek support for that amendment from this House. The reason that they will not support the amendment is that they want to use this as some sort of leverage against bad behaviour in detention centres by, in effect, those who fall foul of these provisions being given a temporary protection visa. Does that ring a bell? They will not call it that. They will call it something like a 'non-permanent visa' or something like that, but what it will be is a TPV-that is what it will be. On this side of but if the House we think people convicted of crimes, who fail to satisfy the character test, should not be given a visa. That is what we think. We do not think they should get a visa, permanent , temporary or otherwise. If you have violated the behaviour, code, laws and standards of this country then it is no visa you. You are not welcome in a country where you are going to violate and abuse those rules. So, the same practice and provisions that are applied for those who fail the ASIO security tests should be applied for those who fail the character test and are denied a visa. We put that before the government. The government likes to say that TPVs will be effective in discouraging bad behaviour in the detention network, but they think they will have no impact on discouraging someone from getting on a boat. The hypocrisy of the argument is laid bare. It does not even need the 50 seconds I have remaining to make the point, because the government inches painfully closer every day to the provisions that were put in place by the Howard government. It is taking them far too long to get there. It is important that this government starts to wise up, move ahead and get to the policies that worked last time. Stop all this mucking around with all these ridiculous deals, none of which ever seem to land. Stop talking to countries that are not interested and not talking to ones that are, like Nauru, and get on with the job of stopping the boats and ensuring that our detention network does not continue to fill up and create the chaos that has occurred as a result of the government's mismanagement.  to voice my support for the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. I voice the opinion of nearly every one of my constituents, I would suggest, when I affirm that the recent riots and disturbances at the immigration detention centres on Christmas Island and Villawood are completely unacceptable. Many Moreton constituents have taken the time to contact me and voice their concerns about this reprehensible behaviour. Not only did the riots cause for extensive damage to buildings but this kind of irresponsible behaviour also put detention officers and fellow detainees in harm's way. It is no secret that there are pressures on our detention system, and we are working hard to relieve that pressure by improving processing times for asylum claims and delivering a regional solution to irregular migration and people smuggling. All reasonable Australians know that we need to sort this out. On Friday I spent a day on the Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island Tragedy, where we saw the footage of that horrific boat accident to SIEV221. It is not something at all we want to be repeated. We know that anything that we can do to prevent such an accident from occurring again should be done. The Gillard Labor government is committed to an orderly and compassionate immigration process and we will therefore not tolerate the kind of behaviour at Villawood and Christmas Island that many Australians saw on their television screens. That is why this bill introduces tough consequences for criminal behaviour in immigration detention that enhance the current ability for the minister to consider the past and present general conduct and character considerations that still apply-I point this out in reference to some of the mistaken comments made by the member for Cook. The bill ensures that anyone who commits a criminal offence while in immigration detention will fail the character test, thus enabling the minister to refuse or cancel a visa on this basis. So these two aspects of the immigration legislation complement each other. It means that those who commit offences in detention may be denied the opportunity to apply for a permanent protection visa. This nation will neither embrace nor protect those who bite the nation's hand. We are not talking about a return to the harsh temporary protection visas of the Howard years, despite the bleating of those opposite. Under that regime all asylum seekers, each and every one, who were found onshore to be refugees were denied a permanent visa. That resulted in a horrible status-eternal limbo. Having spoken to many refugees who went through that process, they called it soul destroying, because of the uncertainty of not knowing. People are able to wait five, 10, 15 or 20 years if there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But the uncertainty that went with temporary protection visas was soul destroying and horrible. They had no way forward and nothing to wait for, because they did not know whether they were going to be uprooted at any time. The other horrible characteristic was that the uncertainty meant the person had no opportunity to put their roots down in the community, to be a good citizen and to be ready to go once their status changed. By contrast, under the Gillard government system, claims for asylum will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. However, those who are involved in criminal acts in detention run the risk of being denied a permanent visa. This legislation sends a very strong and unambiguous message to those in Australian immigration detention centres that this kind of behaviour is completely unacceptabledangerous, and therefore completely unacceptable. It will help to ensure good order in our detention centres and turn those responsible away from destructive and violent behaviour. As the law currently stands, the minister is only able to apply character test if a visa holder or detainee receives 12 months imprisonment, or more, for an offence committed in immigration detention. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to allow the character test to be applied for any offence committed in immigration detention, or during an escape or after escaping, regardless of the actual sentence imposed by the courts. The changes in this bill will apply to these decisions from 26 April 2011 and will relate to offences committed before or after 26 April-that is, from the date of Minister Bowen's announcement. This applies to all people in immigration detention-onshore and offshore arrivals, asylum seekers or otherwise. I know my electorate well, but the the Australian community more broadly has expressed collective disgust at the riots and vandalism we have seen at Villawood and Christmas Island. These amendments will ensure that those who commit such offences in detention will not be rewarded. This bill also increases the maximum penalty which can be enforced for the manufacture, possession, use or distribution of weapons by immigration detainees from three years imprisonment to five. This measure will boost deterrence for the manufacture of weapons and help ensure greater safety for other detainees, detention centre staff and visitors. When people who are close to staying in what many would see as the promised land are then given a decision by the immigration system that they are not able to stay in Australia, they can behave in a bizarre and irrational way. I understand that. I am a student of literature and it is like Gatsby's green light-the idea of something that is so close yet unable to be grasped. It can make you do bizarre and irrational things like sitting on roofs. I understand that. We have the seen that ever since 21 August last year, when the Leader of the Opposition went so close to winning the election but missed out. His behaviour has been quite bizarre and irrational ever since then and it might even continue that way for the next 900 days.",120
175,Mr Robert,BUSINESS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to standing order 90 on reflections on members and the imputation of improper motives. The member is making a direct reflection on the Leader of the Opposition . He should withdraw, and stick to the substance of the bill.",128
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, I would counsel the honourable member for Moreton to observe the standing order and be very careful that he does not reflect on the Leader of the Opposition.  could you remind me of that rule again? I do not think I was doing that at all.,128
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Standing order 90 says all implications of improper motives to a member and all personal reflections on other members should be considered highly disorderly. All I am saying is that all honourable members ought to observe that standing order.  impute any improper motive to the Leader of the Opposition at all.,128
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, honourable member will resume his seat. I would ask the honourable member for Fadden to specifically point out the form of words used by the member for Moreton which he believes is outside standing order 90.,128
179,Mr Robert,BUSINESS,It was in terms of flipflopping around and getting so close and losing direction in terms of where he was going from thereon. It was a direct reflection.,128
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"There is no point of order, but the honourable member for Moreton will observe all standing orders. I would encourage honourable members not to raise frivolous points of order.  Speaker. I was making the point that the next election is perhaps 900 days away and it would be strange to see such bizarre and irrational behaviour every single day for the next 900 days. This bill builds on the government's strong measures to ensure this nation has an orderly immigration system. We understand that those who risk their lives on the high seas to seek asylum in Australia are genuinely desperate people. That is why the Gillard government seeks to treat these asylum seekers with dignity and respect. It is also why we are working with Malaysia and Papua New Guinea to break the people smugglers' business model and deter people from taking that dangerous journey. Looking at the footage of SIEV221, it is quite horrendous to see the decisions people make when their circumstances are such that they will risk everything to have an opportunity in a wonderful country like Australia. Our momentous arrangement with Malaysia means there is no guarantee that any asylum seekers arriving by boat will be processed and resettled in Australia. This will break the people smugglers' business model, and The should save lives. Negotiations with Malaysia are continuing, but already the Malaysian government has agreed to treat asylum seekers in accordance with agreed human rights standards. Importantly, Malaysia has also agreed not to send any genuine refugees back to face persecution in their country of origin. That is our obligation under the refugee convention and that is Malaysia's commitment under this bilateral agreement. Obviously there is no quick fix; three word slogans are not the answer; there is no simple solution. Resettling refugees is a massive worldwide challenge that demands Australia play its part, and I am proud to say that we have done a bit over the years. At the end of 2009 there were an estimated 43.3 million people forcibly displaced worldwide, including 15.2 million refugees, 983,000 asylum seekers and 27.1 million internally displaced persons-that is more than the population of Australia. As long as conflicts continue around the world and various countries go through political or military upheaval, we will unfortunately continue to see refugees crying out for help. That is a reality that those opposite and those on this side of the House both know. When there is war the normal process is for families to flee from it. That what people do to protect their children and give them an opportunity. That is why an Arab spring here means a winter of despair there; that is why a freedom fighter's advance here means a family fleeing there. That is the reality of war and it is the same as it has always been. That is why the Prime Minister's announcement to increase our refugee intake as part of the agreement with Malaysia is such an important step forward in our kind and practical response to the international refugee crisis. When our foreign minister and immigration minister talk to ministers from Italy and other countries in Europe, they say that on any one day there can be more people arriving on Italy's shores than arrive in Australia in a whole year. Nevertheless, it is an immutable tenet of respective Australian governments that we must have secure borders-whether it be putting cannons at Sydney Heads to keep the Russians out or our White Australia policy or all of those various things that we have done in our history: Australians are obsessed with this notion. However, the reality is we only have around 22 million people here. When you look out beyond our northern beaches, we have 11 per cent of the globe to patrol. Even if we had all 22 million people out there in dinghies, we would not be able to defend the borders. I thank the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship for introducing this bill and welcome the measures to deter criminal and violent behaviour in our immigration detention centres. I commend the bill to the House.",128
181,Mr SIMPKINS,BUSINESS," Of all the member for Moreton's contribution, the point I would agree with him on is that there are no quick fixes. Unfortunately, there has been an absolute quick failure. When the is government decided that they were going to change a workable system, a solution, and create a problem, they were highly successful with that. They have certainly made the circumstances of a lot of people different over their time since they changed the immigration policies. They have filled up the Christmas Island detention centre and created and filled up detention centres around the country. There is no doubt that the only quick thing that this government has done is failed spectacularly. That brings us to the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. This bill comes to the House to try to end the embarrassment that the border control failures of the government continue to deliver for the government. The reality is that television cameras have bought into the lounge rooms of my constituents and all Australians the images of riots and misbehaviour in immigration detention centres around the country. The newspapers report the stories of what is going on in the detention centres and the costs of that. The reality is that the people of Australia are pretty unhappy with the assaults, the riots, the damage and the abuse of the taxpayer provided facilities. There are stark contrasts, of course, where those who are in these detention centres get everything for free, and then some create trouble and destroy the facilities. The contrast is that is against those on fixed incomes: Australians who do not get free accommodation, do not get free food, do not get free internet and do not get free cigarettes, nose-hair trimmers or other goodies for attending sport or classes. Australia is a very tolerant country. Australians do not mind helping out those who are down and need a hand up, but they do expect accountability. This bill is a reaction to the scrutiny that only the coalition has provided on this matter. The questions and the close examination provided by the member for Cook, the Leader of the Opposition and many of us on this side have forced the government to at last act in the face of increasing community outrage. I am in favour of these criminal provisions, but this legislation does not go far enough. These are the sorts of legislation and measures that should apply to all those who are noncitizens and commit crimes that attract a custodial sentence, not just those in detention centres. There have been many cases where I would have liked to have seen the cancellation or refusal of visas. Leading on from this, I again turn my attention to the common theme that my constituents so often raise with me, and that is accountability. Accountability for bad behaviour is a concept that really does mirror the expectations of the Australian community. I think that it is correct that the majority of Australians want due processes to be followed in dealing with those who seek asylum and they want the law obeyed. They want the facilities provided to be respected. They want absolute loyalty and respect for this nation from those who came here to escape another place. It is also true that the vast majority of Australians want judicial liability and process for those who break the law. Australians want those who that waste taxpayers' funds and damage taxpayer funded facilities to be responsible for their actions. The vast majority of Australians expect these things and I for one do not think that the expectations of the wider Australian community are unreasonable. After all, we are here to represent the Australian community, the people of our electorates, so that is correct. In recognition of these matters, in August 2001 the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, issued directive 21 in relation to visa refusals under section 499 and for cancellation under section 501 of the Migration Act. In that directive, three primary considerations were mandated: firstly, the protection of the Australian community, next the expectation of the Australian community, and, finally, the best interests of the child or children where they are involved. I certainly supported and appreciated those considerations. As a representative of Western Australia and the representative of the people of Cowan in this place, I reiterate that those I speak to have a clear view that their expectations are valid and should be reflected when decisions are made in relation to visa refusals and cancellations. However, it was the case that in June 2009 the then minister for immigration, Senator Evans, cancelled directive 21 and, instead, issued directive 41. Unfortunately, what directive 41 took out was the consideration that the expectations of the Australian community be considered when looking at visa refusals and cancellations. I make the point that taking the expectations of Australian people out of this issue is a retrograde step. I also take the opportunity to speak on the need for a greater level of transparency in this portfolio area. When we look at the series of events that were the catalyst for some action and this bill today, there is an increasing concern that, with each embarrassing revelation that afflicts the government, there is an increasing intention that information will be restricted. There are the details of the Malaysian rip-off swap deal, the treatment that faces those who are sent there regardless of the national guarantees, the riots and the damage to our detention facilities, the general abuse of those facilities, the assaults, and the special deals that are available to those who are being detained and that are provided by the taxpayers absolutely free of charge. These are certainly the sorts of matters that need to be reviewed. A parliamentary review into these matters is required because what this country faces is an absolute crisis. The huge blow-outs in costs, the huge number of people now in detention, the assaults and the mismanagement of this portfolio area are the reasons why this entire matter must be looked at in detail. In returning to this bill I say again that I am in support of any attempt to ensure that accountability is sheeted home to those doing the wrong thing. There is a very strong belief by my constituents that criminal action and behaviour by those in detention and those allowed out into the community must involve accountability. The minister must be ready to cancel visas to ensure that the safety of this nation is addressed and that the sorts of people we take as refugees are known by their law abiding integration into this society and that we do not take the sorts of people who find fault and who are defined by the crimes they commit. The trouble with what we have seen at Christmas Island and Villawood and in incidents such as the SIEV36 fire and explosion is that there is a group of people that have a predilection towards crime and trouble. We should not give them an excuse for their bad criminal behaviour by blaming mandatory detention. They knew the rules when they came by boat and the bleedingheart lawyers and advocacy groups are assisting the trouble with their endless appeals causing long delays. Leaving the criminality aspect behind, I will turn to the character test and I would like to mention subsection 501(6)(d)(v). In that subsection a person can fail the character test if they 'represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment of that community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to, that community or segment, or in any other way'. There seems, therefore, to be sufficient latitude for rejecting visas for all those who riot or destroy property or assault or try to scuttle boats. Regardless of charges there are the options in section 501 to reject these sort of people. The provisions exist and there has not been an attempt by the government to upgrade these provisions. The problem is that we have a minister without the courage to act. We have a minister who has implied that there is a need for upgrading these provisions but has not acted to make such upgrades in this bill. That is the problem at the core of this attitude by this government. I say again that the real refugees are those who are stuck in refugee camps and are in fear of their lives. Real refugees have escaped across borders and now languish in refugee camps across the nearest border. They do not have the money for airfares to fly to people smugglers. They do not have the money to cross through several countries, or move through international airport departure lounges. They do not have the money to pay the people smugglers. Real refugees are stuck in refugee camps and deserve our concern because they suffer from malnutrition, malaria and other such afflictions. It really does irritate me when those with money exploit this country and this government's failed border policies, and that they do so with the connivance of advocacy groups that should be supporting real refugees. There was a time when the borders of this country were strong, where those that came under the humanitarian program were literally those from refugee camps. This was a time of strength but also compassion. What we have now is a lack of control by this government and a misplaced focus away from those that need our assistance. I say let us particularly look to those refugee camps on the Burma-Thailand border, where there are the sorts of people that need our help and fit into this nation very well. We need amendments to this bill to extend its scope, and I will be supporting that course of action. Yet we also need an inquiry into this whole portfolio area. It is the right for a fundamental look at the crisis that afflicts the immigration detention system in this country. I call upon the crossbenchers to support the coalition's plan for a parliamentary review. The system is broken and must be examined in detail before any more lives and money are thrown away on the failures that this government has overseen and continues to oversee.",129
182,Mr BALDWIN,BUSINESS," I rise today to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. As I read the bill I was very concerned that the person who is failing the character test in putting this bill forward is the minister. Much has been made about the toughness of this measure and the outcomes that it will deliver. As I went through the bill and looked at what it does, I found that it does nothing more than is available to the minister now. The minister already has powers available under the act. Under the minister's powers he can refuse a visa. When the minister was talking tough in introducing this legislation after the riots and after the unconscionable actions of some individuals I expected to see a piece of legislation instructing, 'If you do this then this will happen'-no 'if', 'and' or 'but' about it. But the amendments to this act only introduce what the minister may refuse visas for. That is the key point: this bill does not say, 'If you do this you will be denied a visa.' This bill says, 'If you do this the minister may refuse you a visa.' It does not change one thing. Perhaps that is why today we saw yet another boat coming into Australia. It was a boat carrying another 56 illegal immigrants, bringing the total to 11,413 since August 2008-a total of 228 boats. So all this tough talk of legislation designed to toughen up the stance on border time protection and all this talk about moving people offshore for processing-if they can ever get it right-is failing. It is failing because it is megaphone diplomacy without any substance. And nothing could prove that more than this bill. As I have said, it is called the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 but the only person who is failing that character test is the minister. I needed to look no further than the minister's second reading speech where he said, in part: If a person fails the character test, this can be used as a basis for the refusal of a visa application or the cancellation of a visa that is held by a person. It goes on to say: Similarly, section 500A of the Migration Act provides that the minister may refuse the grant of a temporary safe haven visaHe said not 'will' but 'may'. That is the key point: it is no different to what currently exists. I point out to the House that Australia has standards of socially acceptable behaviour. I understand the plight of many of these people, but I cannot understand why, when you have come from an impoverished, dangerous environment, you would bring those arguments here to this country or, whilst seeking to gain access to this country and show yourself to be a model citizen worthy of being granted a visa or citizenship, resort to the kinds of acts that we have witnessed. I return to the Villawood riot. Millions of dollars worth of damage was done by a number of people-exactly how many is not yet determined-who burnt the place to the ground. They felt they were not being processed and given visas fast enough and decided they would burn the place to the ground. How Australian is that? They want to come to this country and one of the first things they do on Australian soil, while they are being assessed, is burn the building providing them protection to the ground, endangering not only their own lives but the lives of their fellow detainees and those who are there to keep them secure. It does not end with the Villawood riot. That was not an isolated incident. In fact, there were riots on Christmas Island where they burnt buildings and extra police had to be sent to stop the rioting. The average person in Australian society would sit there and think, 'Are these the kinds of people that I want as my fellow Australians? Do I want to share this country with the sorts of people who, when they decide they have had enough, will set fire to the place or create a riot or a disturbance?' Yes, that is the way model yourself to be an Australian citizen. It is reported that there are three major incidents every day across the detention centres. I say to those detainees awaiting processing and approval: if you want to be accepted into Australian society, act in a manner such that your fellow Australians would say, 'Welcome.' I cannot imagine too many people, except those in the Labor Party and particularly those in the Greens, who, following these acts, would turn around and say to anyone, 'You've just burned my home down, created a riot and put people in hospital-come on in. We want your sort of people in this country.' The people who come into my electorate office say 'No'. They say that they have had enough. It is the taxpayers-the constituents that I represent-who are picking up the bill for the damage that is being done and the extra security required for people who have supposedly come to Australia seeking a safe haven and peace. There is no safe haven and peace when you are in a detention centre and are trying to burn the place down. In another failed test of integrity, Prime Minister Gillard during the election campaign said that she had had all the discussions and that there was going to be an offshore processing centre in East Timor. The only problem was that she forgot to tell most of the East Timorese parliament. Then she was going to Manus and then she was going to Malaysia. I have to say: I want the Prime Minister to sit with whomever I am next going to play poker against. I would just love her to be sitting on the other side of the table calling the odds-put up $800; get $4,000 back. I would just love to be playing poker against her, and what a poker face she has. She can come out in the community to do press conferences, put her hand over her heart and say, 'I've cut the deal in Timor,' or, to 'We're going to Manus Island,' or, 'What a deal I've cut in Malaysia,' but will not pick up the phone and talk to the President of Nauru. This Prime Minister has also failed the integrity test-the character test-and lacks the leadership that Australia is looking for. Tough decisions require tough people and people with character. It is an easy decision to just open the borders to the queue jumpers, pushing to the back of the queue those who have been in detention centres around the globe, desperately seeking protection and awaiting their turn while being properly and adequately processed and assessed. I have a couple of figures to put on the record. In 2002, no boats arrived in Australia. In 2003, there was one boat with 53 people on board. In 2004, there were no boats. In 2005, there were four boats with a total of 11 people on board. In 2006, there were six boats with a total of 60 people on board. Then it started to escalate. In 2007, there were five boats with a total of 148 people on board-and it goes on and on. Now, we have gone from having four people in detention when this government came to power to having 11,413 people in detention. This government claims that it has grown our economy; the only thing this government truly has grown is the number of illegal arrivals into the country. It is an absolute disgrace. If the government think that this bill will do anything to deter those violent acts, to deter the criminal activities that have been occurring, then they need to come in here and amend their own bill. This government need to show that they have the strength of character to remove the 'may' provisions. In order to earn the confidence of our fellow Australians, they need to state clearly to those in detention centres, 'If you do this you will not come into Australia'not 'will not', not 'may not', and not 'at the minister's discretion'. That is what strength of character is, but unfortunately this government repeatedly fail the character test, and they fail the integrity test over a range issues. They failed it by stating that there would be no carbon tax, and now there is a full push for it. They failed it when they said they would drive down pressures on the cost of living. They failed it when they said they would stop the boats, and all they have done is to grow and escalate it. There is one thing that needs to happen. This government needs to show some integrity and some character, and this applies not just in a detention centre but in the community. It needs to go on the front foot and say, 'If you are a criminal in our community while you are on a visa, then you need to be denied that visa and you need to be deported back to where you were.' After all, the common catch cry from people who have come here as illegal boat people is that they wanted a safer haven. That safe haven does not include committing crimes. I do not intend to take any more time of this House other than to say: I am disgusted that the government would seek a cheap political media shot by introducing this legislation, because in reality it does nothing to toughen up anything in relation to the illegal activities and crimes being committed by people in detention centres.",132
183,Mr BRIGGS,BUSINESS," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Paterson and his thoughtful contribution on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. The member for Paterson is a member who is in touch with his community. He is a member who has won a marginal seat more times than people care to remember, he does a wonderful job in this place representing his constituency-and he is a wonderful housemate, too, despite what the owner of the house sometimes says on national television. But I digress. This bill is yet another example of failure of by those opposite in managing Australia's borders and the border security system. Let us not forget that it comes as a result of some very disturbing incidents which occurred around Easter time this year which were handled appallingly. As much as I have some time for the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, his handling of these incidents was terrible and it really reflected the problem that the Labor Party in government have with managing this issue. We remember the scene of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship trying to defend the government's policies when there were people on roofs at Villawood after half the Villawood detention centre had been burnt down. This was following riots at Christmas Island and at Curtin prior to that, and the minister was standing there saying, 'We can't get them off the roof, but we will change the law to make this not happen again.' This is the bill which attempts to cover over the political problem that was the episode of people on the roof during the riots at the Villawood detention centre. It has been reported in the media that the New South Wales riot squad sat at the gate for about 4½ hours watching half the detention centre burn down. These issues are pertinent to my electorate, because we still have no evidence which says that the South Australian police would be able to act if a similar incident occurred at the Inverbrackie detention facility. There have been reports about the media and yet no satisfactory response has come from either the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship or the South Australian police minister. I know that the South Australian police minister has many other things on his mind, but if he could at some point turn his attention to this issue it would be appreciated, because my community is concerned because of the events at Villawood. We heard during estimates hearings about the complete farce of how the riots were managed. In a classic Senate estimates scene we heard about how Senator Cash, the Liberal senator from Western Australia, punched a hole in the minister's and the government's management of the system. She went through, in intricate detail, the events when the deputy secretary of the immigration department stood on two boxes-not one-to get into the roof cavity to try to convince those who were protesting to come down. I think it highlights nothing better than the failure of this minister and this government to properly address this issue. We have the two-box minister standing up there trying to fix what is a complete debacle of a policy. This bill highlights that and it does not fix the problem, because the problem had been fixed when the Labor Party came to government. It was stopped when they came to government and created a problem with their changes to the law in August 2008. The shadow minister for immigration makes this point day in and day out, and yet the Labor Party refuses to listen to the solution because it is a solution proposed by this side of the House. We really should be debating the solution that we suggested some time ago, that we put in place in government, which did stop this occurring. No-one on this side of the House wants to see people get on the boats in the first place. We think that is a terrible thing to this in encourage people to do, and that is unfortunately what this government's policies do. They put the people smugglers back in trade. They have done that and, since then, we have seen more than 11,000 people take that perilous journey. Unfortunately we have seen incidents like the Christmas Island incident just before Christmas last year, which was a terrible occurrence. We are seeing these incidents in the detention network because the detention network is under an enormous amount of stress. I hear reports daily from within the Inverbrackie detention facility-the one in my electorate which was foisted on the community without any consultation at all. The minister at the table, Mr Butler, knows this and he knows the shame that it is bringing the Labor Party in the great state of South Australia because of the lack of consultation and the lack of honesty with the community when they foisted this decision on the community. The day before it was announced, the Prime Minister was in my electorate and she did not tell the community or ask the community what they thought about it. It was just announced because they failed to manage this issue properly. This is putting pressure on the detention network and we are seeing outbursts at Villawood, Curtin and Christmas Island-and we hope not to see it at other places. But, as the member for Paterson said, we are seeing daily occurrences of unfortunate incidents. At Senate estimates, the incidents at Inverbrackie were well outlined by the department. They were not fully outlined, but the department is going to come back with some details. It was quite remarkable that at estimates they had very little details about many of these incidents, but we are looking forward to the information that they will come back to us with to tell us what is actually happening within the centres. The shadow minister has put forward a worthwhile motion to have a full inquiry into the detention facilities. What is going on in these centres is very deeply concerning, particularly to those of us who have detention centres in our electorates and are experiencing the problems they are causing within those electorates. At the time that these centres were announced the minister for immigration waltzed into the electorates and told everybody, 'It will all be fine. There will be huge economic benefits. There will be no problems at all. It is a family friendly facility. This will be great. This will go really well.' What we have seen from estimates is violent incident after violent incident; we have seen people walking out the front gate; and we have seen that the South Australian police have no powers to deal with any occurrences like we saw at Villawood-thus this legislation. To highlight the problem that the Labor Party have, I will briefly address one of the comments made by the member for Moreton, which I thought was quite a disgraceful comment, in his contribution to this debate. In fairness, the member for Fadden rightly pulled him up on this point. He attempted to compare the campaign of exposing Labor's failure on so many of these issues that the Leader of the Opposition is running to those who rioted in Villawood, rioted in Curtin and rioted in Christmas Island. It is a great shame on the member for Moreton that he would stoop to those levels. I know he is under a great deal of pressure in his own electorate about this issue and about the carbon tax issue. I know that not because of any private conversations; I know that because I read the Courier-Mail, and pretty much every second day the member for Moreton is in there bagging the current Prime Minister and the current Treasurer for the way that they are running the government. He is right to do that-though it is an interesting strategy for his own career-because the analysis of it is right. But his comment about the Leader of the Opposition is disgraceful and reflects on where the Labor Party are at in trying to manage this issue. It is killing them and they know it out in the community. People have seen through this government. They know it was the change that Labor made that has caused this problem and that that it is the reason that these incidents are occurring. One of their great policy ideas last year was to have a processing freeze. That was a 'brilliant' idea that resulted in probably three riots. And we have got, in effect, another processing freeze at the moment-which, again, will be like putting the pressure cooker lid back on the pressure cooker and waiting to see if it explodes. Of course, it will explode because people will be desperate and they will react. It is unacceptable behaviour-and the coalition has always said that-but what is also unacceptable is creating policies which encourage people to get on these boats in the first place. That is what the Labor Party have done with their legislation. That is what has led to 11½ thousand people getting on boats and trying to make it to Australia. We absolutely support a strong intake of humanitarian refugees each year and we support ensuring that we take those from appropriate places. What we do not support is a flimsy attempt at legislative paper to wallpaper over the cracks which are in the system, because it has encouraged these people to get on these boats in the first place. There was once a shadow immigration minister-at a time when you might remember these matters, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson-who put out a very famous press release which said 'Another boat; another policy failure'. Of course, that can now be sheeted home to the now Prime Minister, who was the shadow minister for immigration when she put out that press release, because every single boat is another policy failure of this Prime Minister, this minister for immigration, this Labor Party and this government. They do not manage this issue properly and it is causing a huge problem. It is causing a massive blowout in our budget of $1.75 billion-money which could otherwise be spent on worthwhile things such as giving money back to Australians so that they can spent it how they best choose. Instead this money has been spent on the bungling, the debacles and the mess that is the detention network, because the government decided in August 2008 that they were going to try to look like they were compassionate, humanitarian and soft and make it look like they were not the Howard government. Of course, what that has done is create a situation which has encouraged the people smugglers back into business. The truth is that it is not humanitarian to encourage people to get onto these boats. It is far from it; it is the opposite of it. The best thing we can do is have strong laws which do not encourage people to get on these boats in the first place, so we do not face these problems and we do not have to deal with this flimflam legislation that comes before this place trying to cover over Labor's policy debacles. This is another bill which highlights this minister's failure and this government's failure. As the shadow minister consistently outlines, we should be having an inquiry into the detention network and the failure of the Labor Party to manage this system properly. We should be reinstituting the solutions that were put forward by the Howard government when this was a substantial issue in 2001 and 2002. Those solutions worked. They stopped the problem. The government should grow up and adopt our solutions. It will save an enormous amount of taxpayers' money, it will save an enormous amount of human grief and it will save this minister the ongoing embarrassment of what is his complete failure to manage this issue properly.",134
184,Ms MARINO,BUSINESS," This bill, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011, would not be necessary if the Labor government had not lost control of our borders and the minister for immigration was actually doing his job. It is that simple. It would not be necessary if the Labor government had not given the green light to people smugglers and given them the opportunity to make millions of dollars from asylum seekers. Given the free and easy open border policies of the Labor government and the way the government gave into the demands of asylum seekers on the Oceanic Viking, I am not surprised that people smugglers have been encouraged to believe that they can get away with criminal behaviour. One of the most consistent issues currently being raised in my electorate of Forrest is, without a doubt, that the Labor government have lost control of our borders. So many people are now actually angry. They are angry that the government has not only jeopardised Australia's strong border reputation but has recently revealed a massive $1.75 billion blow-out in taxpayers' funds used to pay for these shambolic and failed asylum seeker policies. My constituents do not trust the Labor government at all. They do not believe that Labor will stop the boats because the boats continue to arrive. Today we have seen another boat with 56 people aboard. The minister is now scratching around trying to be seen to do something. We know that during 2001 people smugglers made 43 successful incursions into Australia. As a result, the coalition tough decisions that made it perfectly clear that Australia was not going to be a bottomless pit of profit-making opportunities for people smugglers and would not encourage vulnerable people to put their lives at risk. This is the issue: they are encouraging vulnerable people to put their lives at risk. The effect was immediate. In 2002 just one boat arrived. Over the remaining years of the coalition government 25 illegal entry vessels arrived, an average just over three a year from 2002 to 2008. However, in 2008 the newly elected Labor government threw open Australia's borders to people smugglers, literally putting up a sign that said 'Open for the business of people smuggling'. This unfortunately encouraged even more vulnerable people to put their lives at risk in dangerous and unseaworthy boats. In 2009, 61 boats reached Australia. In 2010 people smugglers earned their lucrative illegal income through 134 successful incursions. The Australian people can see that Labor has well and truly lost control of our borders and my constituents continually tell me so. We know that 11,413 people have come here on 228 boats since August 2008, but this government has continued to deny the obvious. Now, after years of encouraging and allowing people smugglers to take advantage of the Australian government, Labor has decided that they need to do something. They are not quite sure what that something is and they do not know how to rectify a major problem entirely of their own making. I remember this phrase, and I hope members in this House do as well: the coalition found a problem and created a solution; Labor found a solution and created a problem. The Prime Minister started by saying that detaining boat people on Pacific islands was 'costly, unsustainable and wrong in made principle.' Then she back flipped by announcing that the government would try to re-open Manus Island. The Prime Minister also previously insisted that boat people could not be sent to Nauru because Nauru is not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees. But now she has announced 800 boat people will be sent to Malaysia, which is not a signatory either. Australia will receive 4,000 asylum seekers from Malaysia for those 800 that are heading that way. We of understand this policy comes with a cost of nearly $70,000 per person. How this will actually work no-one knows. Australia has not finalised an agreement to transfer asylum seekers to Malaysia, PNG, East Timor, Thailand or anywhere else. This is yet another demonstration of the problems emerging from the Labor government rushing out in panic to announce the latest deal that is not actually a deal. We all remember the mining tax mark I and II, the carbon tax mark I and II, the NBN mark I and II-the list goes on. The government's handling of these varying border protection policies leaves Australians with no confidence. Conversely, it continues to give people smugglers great confidence to continue their activities. As I said, today another 56 people arrived. People smugglers are literally making a mockery of Labor's inability to manage Australia's borders. I see that the West Australian today reported that: Federal police officers have carried out 100 wrist X-rays of Indonesian crew members claiming to be under the age of 18 since 2008. But results of the scans have shown 60 so-called ""children"" to be aged over 18. People smugglers are now not only bringing increased numbers of asylum seekers but they are claiming to be under 18. This is another issue for the government to deal with that they have created. This bill attempts to ensure that a person will fail the character test if they have been convicted of a criminal offence while in detention. There have been more than three critical incidents happening every day in our detention centres. They are putting people's lives at risk. Incidents have included everything from deaths, escapes, riots, and fires to assaults, particularly assaults on the people who work in these centres. Of course, there has also been millions of dollars of damage. It is intended that the changes in this legislation will provide a disincentive for people in immigration detention to carry out violent and disruptive behaviour, but it does not do anything to address the Labor government's failure to act to cancel or refuse visas. If someone fails the character test, a decision to grant a visa can still be made. The minister has indicated that in these circumstances he intends to still allow the granting of a temporary visa to these people. The coalition does not support the issuing of such visas. While we are supportive of the new criminal provision, it does not go far enough as it does not apply to every non-citizen. If the government is really serious about this issue, it will re-introduce the provision of ministerial direction No. 21, which allows decision makers to take the interests of the Australian community into account-that is, to 'regulate, in the national interest, the coming into and presence in Australia of non-citizens.' People, not only in my electorate but right around the nation, are angry about the of the contempt for Australian law in detention centres. People are outraged by reports of asylum seekers intentionally damaging Commonwealth property and their lack of respect for the Australian communities in which they are being housed. Claims that during the 11 days that detainees were on the roof of the Villawood detention centre they were free to come down, charge their mobile phones and then return without any action has frustrated and upset people and it certainly sends the wrong message. The volume of people in Australian detention centres and the associated pressure on these centres comes as a direct result of Labor's soft border protection policies. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is also being stretched beyond capacity. The Labor government has to take responsibility for the situation it has created. There is no-one else to blame. The Labor government has created this problem. We cannot allow the fairness and integrity of our immigration and refugee programs to be further compromised.",137
185,Mr RANDALL,BUSINESS," I am very pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. We would not be here today if there were not so many people arriving unlawfully. To use the Orwellian language of the Labor Party, they are irregular unauthorised boat arrivals-in other words, people who have jumped the queue. Let us put that in context. When the Rudd government came to power in 2007 there were only four people in detention who had arrived by boat. Now we are heading towards 7,000 in detention. What has caused this? As my friend and colleague from the seat of Forrest mentioned, it is because the green light has been turned on by the Labor Party's changes to the Migration Act, which have sent a signal that if you can get to the Australian mainland you will get a visa. We know that is pretty much the case because, as an example that I have cited in this place before, roughly 20 per cent of those who apply from Afghanistan have a migration outcome, whereas those Afghans who arrive here by boat have a far higher migration outcome, and very few of them have been returned. We can go into the figures, and I am sure my colleagues have done the same, about the shambolic state of the migration system under the Gillard-Brown government. The immigration system in this country was the envy of the world. It was seen as one that had great integrity. In fact, when I have had the opportunity to go to other countries in world-for example, when I visited detention centres in Italy-I have found that they saw our system under the Howard government as having the highest integrity and the best outcomes for those arriving unlawfully. The system has become so chaotic that there is much violence in the detention centres. Let us remember what happened before this government took over in 2007. When we were building the detention centre on Christmas Island the then opposition spokesperson and now Prime Minister said, 'We won't need Christmas Island because there won't be anyone to put into it.' It was going to have a capacity of only 800. What happened? They changed the policy and turned the green light on. Now not only are there more than 800; there are, as we know, well over 2,000, with overcrowding causing many problems. In opposition they said they would not bring asylum seekers onto the mainland for processing, but Christmas Island is so full and has so many problems, asylum seekers have had to be brought to the mainland. The government is now fishing around in Asia for any place it can to find a solutionexcept Nauru, even though there is a facility there that was built by Australian tax dollars. The government will not use Nauru on the basis that Nauru is not a signatory to the UN convention, yet it is doing it with Malaysia. Suddenly, we find out that Thailand might be the go or that New Guinea might be reopened. Is Kiribati going to be the next stop? Tuvalu? Some other Pacific Island? It is: tick-tack-toe, here we go; let's find a place we can put you. That is what is happening at the moment because the government is so out of control with migration arrivals and the processing of people. It is causing overcrowding and resentment, and we are becoming the laughing stock of the world. If the I have time, I will tell members about a personal incident in Western Australia which shows how derisively we are being considered. Isn't it right that we invite people to come here who will add something to our community-skilled migrants, people reuniting with family and those on the humanitarian visas which we were famous for. There were about 14,000 of those a year, which were generally allocated to us by the UNHCR in countries where people had been waiting in an orderly fashion, applying through the camps and the post. But that is not the case anymore. We find now that if you arrive here you generally get a visa outcome. Christmas Island was part of the exclusion zone for migration purposes and so was an ideal centre for processing. Those that have come to Australia have gradually filtered through some of the nefarious behaviour that they were involved in before they reached here and since they have arrived. I have produced evidence in this place previously that some Sri Lankans who, once they had obtained their visa, returned to Sri Lanka within 12 months of getting their visa. So much for fleeing persecution and fearing for your life. It was reported in the Australian not so long ago that 70 per cent of entrants who arrive and get a humanitarian visa return to their country of origin within 12 months. Canada has realised this and is about to reassess the humanitarian visas it has granted, based on the honesty and integrity of the applicants' information, with a view to removing their visas or citizenship. Australia might want to look at this, because we are being taken for a ride-we are being conned-by a number of these people. I will point to some of these cases shortly. If the Canadians are doing it because people have been laughing in their face, why wouldn't Australia? We know why we wouldn'tbecause this government is being led by the nose by the Greens. It is not going to do anything unless Bob Brown gives the okay. As we know, Bob would open the gates and let the millions into this country He would not care about the economic circumstances or about Australian society and culture as we know it; he would just open the doors without any thought about what he was going to do. The character test is very important because we want to not only maintain the integrity of our migration system but also add something to the Australian community for those coming here. Those people who have fled through a number of other countries hold up somewhere in either Malaysia or Indonesia for some time until they can find a people smuggler who can get them a better outcome. Let us think about the case of the Sri Lankans who were held up at the Port of Merak with that marvellous guy, Alex, as their spokesperson. He had a criminal record in Canada and he said, 'Why don't you treat us better?' Surprisingly, Alex sniffed the wind and realised that he had better scarper because out of all the ones who were relocated to Australia he just vanished into thin air. Why would the minister bring this legislation to the House when he can do something about it now? He has ministerial discretion to look at the character of individuals on a case-by-case basis and say, 'This person is not a fit and proper person, given the evidence to me from the department, the police or Interpol.' Any one of those agencies would be in a position to state, 'This person is of dubious character.' He can do that now, but he does not seem to have the courage. The previous minister who I consider a colleague from Western Australia, Senator Chris Evans, had the opportunity and he did not want to do it either, which surprised me because it is well within the minister's remit to do so. I do not know why they do not because it would prevent a massive legal challenge, which I have mentioned previously about previous if he could. legislation. Let us have a look at the reasons we are now being brought to this place. There were the Christmas Island riots in November 2009. It was a massive brawl involving 150 people. Some guards suffered minor injuries after breaking up the fight. They used pool cues, broom handles and branches et cetera. Eleven people were charged, but eight had their charges dismissed-amazing. Three were charged and two of them ended up on good behaviour bonds. That is not bad for wrecking a joint. Only one was charged so he must have been the only one who wrecked the joint. He was the only one who ended up with any sort of sanction or penalty. All three were granted visas in late 2010. These marvellous people are going to bring this sort of violent behaviour to Australia. This sends a dangerous message. There were riots on Christmas Island again in 2011. Unrest was noted on the last weekend of February when 13 people were injured and three asylum seekers were arrested after a fight broke out over property damage. On 11 March there was the first break-out from the detention centre when 150 asylum seekers damaged the gates and fences. Initially, 100 refused to return to centre. Christmas Island residents said that the extent of the break-out was underreported, and many islanders feared for their safety and barricaded themselves in their homes on that idyllic island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. A second break-out occurred days later from the North West Point Immigration Detention Centre, supposedly the island's most secure facility. Fewer than 100 men broke free and roamed the island. It took Federal Police over a week to locate all those who escaped. Prime Minister Gillard made a comment at the time: 'Where are they going to go to? They are on an island, after all.' This was much to the bemusement and frustration all those who call Christmas Island home. On 17 March up to 250 asylum seekers set buildings ablaze and threw Molotov cocktails at the Federal Police. Over 200 Federal Police were taken to the island to secure the facility. Police were forced into using beanbag bullets and tear gas to gain control. We all remember the pictures of people dragging wheelie bins that were alight and running from building to building to make sure that they were properly alight. This is what they did to Australian facilities. Were they of good character when they burned down the places they ran to for refuge so they could migrate to Australia? Minister Bowen denied it and said that some sorts of ringleaders were sent to the mainland, and some of them were later implicated in the Villawood riot. I could go on about the Villawood riot. I can tell you that nothing galled the people of Australia more than to see what they did to Villawood when they burned down those nine buildings, including the kitchen and all those facilities. Then they got on the roof and would not come down. Around ANZAC Day in my electorate people were saying to me: the ' Mr Randall, I will get them down for you. Just give me the opportunity and I will show you how to get them down.' They were appalled by the fact that we were such a weak, lily-livered group of people who allowed ourselves to be held hostage by people who decided to come here seeking refuge and trashing it along the way. It was an absolute disgrace. We could go on with a whole lot of other incidents. For example, guards have been bashed at Curtin. The West Australian reported on 23 March that an Iranian detainee had claimed that he had been raped by several men at the Phosphate Hill camp at Christmas Island but that no charges were laid. Coincidentally, a guy has told me that he supplies 700 condoms a week to Curtin, which is surprising given the strong male population there. Obviously there are some cultural issues that seem to be festering. There were also scuffles at Darwin airport. We could go on. There was the boat carrying 47 asylum seekers which was sabotaged by the crew when they threw 30 litres of petrol on the deck below. Our Navy got involved and of the five people identified, I understand that three of them have visas already. This is shameful. It is a disgrace that Australia allows this to go on. There is one clear way you could deal with this, obviously-that is, to make sure that people do not arrive by boat but arrive in an orderly fashion and apply as humanitarian entrants, rather than trying to jump the queue. Constituents come to me one after the other to say: ' Mr Randall, we love migration; we were all built on migration. This country is a migrant society. But what we don't like is when you get in a queue at the shopping centre and someone decides to push past you at the checkout because they are in a hurry. Or when somebody at the footy wants to get a better seat and he shoulders past everybody else to get the front of queue and says, ""I don't care who you are because I am big and ugly enough to push you out of the way"".' That is what they do not like about the shambolic state of our migration system. We must maintain proper character assessments so that we end up with and maintain a system that is full of integrity. The minister is this because he will not do his own job. He could do this job himself, without requiring this legislation, but this is just an indication of how out of control and how messy this government is. Everything this government has touched so far is turning to mud. This is just another prime example. Our migration system, which was held as one of the beacons of the world on how to do this, has now been reduced to the state that it is in.",140
186,Mr SLIPPER,BUSINESS," I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join the debate on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. It is obvious-and any objective person looking at the facts would have to accept-that under this government our border protection policy is in tatters. Compared with the record of the former Howard government, this government has completely lost control of Australia's borders and it has turned the seas around this nation into a superhighway. There is an incentive for people to seek to come to Australia as unauthorised arrivals because of the record of this government in allowing so many of those who have arrived in this way to stay here on a permanent basis. Let us look at the facts. Since August 2008, 228 boats have arrived. Many of them slipped through the detection net and were unexpected when they appeared off Australia's offshore islands. Eleven thousand four hundred and thirteen people have arrived in this manner. Some 56 arrived only today. On any sort of clear-headed assessment, the government's policy has not worked, and it should be obvious to anyone that this government needs to sit down and reconsider the situation. No matter how well intentioned the government are-and I do accept that they are well intentioned-it is obvious that their doing policies have comprehensively failed. What they really ought to do is to go back to basics. They should go back to scratch. They should look again at what has worked in the past, look again at what is not working now. Even if they have to absorb a modicum of political embarrassment, they should say that the policies of the former Howard government with respect to border protection were infinitely more effective. The former government said, 'We will lock anyone up who enters Australia illegally,' and that proved to be a very powerful disincentive for people smugglers. People smugglers are amongst the most evil people in the world. I think everyone agrees with that. But, if you make it not viable for people smugglers to stay in business, then obviously they will move their evil and pernicious traffic elsewhere in the world. Many people who seek to come to Australia illegally are economic refugees. One can understand why they would want to leave the conditions in their home countries and come to join us here in Australia, a country that has freedom. We have a sense of democracy, a sense of fairness. We enjoy the rule of law. So one cannot dispute the fact that people would want to come here but, if we are going to have an immigration system with integrity, it has to be one that has checks and balances, one that has appropriate penalties and one that acts as a disincentive to people smugglers who take people's money and bring people here. The current situation with the people smugglers is completely undesirable from the point of view of the Australian people as a whole, but it is also a very unfair situation because we have a finite capacity to absorb humanitarian refugees. We have a quota for this purpose. If people jump the queue then it means that genuine people who have been going through the appropriate processes will have a lower likelihood of being admitted to Australia than would otherwise be the case. I can understand the attractiveness to the government of the five-for-one deal which has been heavily talked about and heavily promoted with respect to Malaysia. Clearly Malaysia gets a very good deal: for up to 800 unauthorised arrivals, we will absorb 4,000 people who are currently in Malaysia. It seems like a pretty dud deal as far as Australia is concerned. The only silver lining in the cloud from the government's point of view is that, if people do come as unauthorised arrivals, they will probably be sent off to Malaysia and they will go to the back of the queue. Hopefully that will discourage people smugglers from continuing to do what they do. It still seems a pretty bad deal for Australia because we are accepting 4,000 people in exchange for 800. If the government had opted for the policies of the former Howard government then we would not have the boats arriving and we would not have the problem. Australia is a very generous nation. We are a compassionate nation. As you go round our country you will find that people are well aware of the benefits of migration. After all, most of us came here as migrants in one way or another. But Australians have a sense of fair play. They understand that we are a country which has amongst the highest per capita absorption of refugees from countries around the world. But it is imperative that our borders be protected so that we are not overwhelmed by illegal boat arrivals, which place strain on the integrity of our immigration system and processing and can become a financial and social burden. When one looks at what the government is proposing to spend on unauthorised arrivals and processing and transporting them and detention centres, one can see that this places a very great strain on the budget and makes it more difficult for the government to achieve the objectives sought by the Treasurer in his budget of returning the budget to surplus within a finite period. If one could reinstate our border protection policy, one could stop the boats from arriving. The government would not have to spend what it is proposing to spend and the budgetary bottom line would be so much better off. I also do not understand why the government says it will not use the detention facilities at Nauru, which have been paid for by the Australian taxpayer. Nauru is prepared to be of assistance in this matter. It would be good for Nauru; it would be good for Australia. The facilities are already there. It would not take them long to recommission the detention centre. Yet we find, to the contrary, the government seems to be hawking its wishes from one country in the region to another, when there is already a very obvious solution. Labor has failed with its border protection policies, and most people in the community, in any part of the country, would agree that that is in fact the case. Our immigration detention centres are stretched and have become places where we have riots. We find that detainees are destroying the property of the Australian taxpayer. While one has to applaud the contents of the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 upon first reading-and no-one could possibly object to what is contained in the bill-the bill simply does not go far enough. It is interesting to note that people who are not in detention but who commit offences are not caught by the provisions of this bill. It is also strange to read that you can have a situation where, even though a person fails the character test, the decision to grant a can be taken, particularly if the person is found to be a refugee and cannot be returned to his or her country of origin. I am also advised that the minister intends to issue some sort of new temporary protection visa. Maybe it could be referred to as a return pending visa. But it is simply unacceptable, in my view, to grant visas to people who fail the character test. We have enough problems in this country already with law and order. To admit to Australia to live here on an indefinite or permanent basis those people who fail the character test is not what the Australian people want. I would encourage government members to go to any shopping centre in the country. They would find when they talk to ordinary, decent Australians, regardless of how they vote at elections, that people want appropriate levels of border protection. There is a very great level of unhappiness in the community that 228 boats have arrived since August 2008. There is a very great unhappiness that 11,413 unauthorised arrivals have somehow managed to trespass across the border to arrive here and have had to be dealt with in accordance with Australia's immigration laws. People are exceedingly unhappy that today another 56 people have arrived. One ought to never forget that, while we talk about 'unauthorised arrivals', these are people. These are people who obviously have hopes and aspirations for a better life. They clearly must be treated with compassion, but if we had an appropriate level of border protection they would not be here and they would not actually need to have the processes which are being set out in this bill and in other bills applied to them. If we could re-create a situation where Australia's border was properly protected, we would not have these unauthorised arrivals. They would not be here; they would be somewhere else and we would not be talking visa about the matters we are currently talking about. It is interesting to note, however, that the government has not been prepared in this legislation to go further and to say that those people who commit offences when they are not in detention are similarly caught by these provisions. Australia is a country which has JudaeoChristian values. We are a country which does in fact accept our fair share of the refugee burden from around the world. We are not a heartless nation. We do care about others in strife, and we have proven time and time again that we are good international citizens. Collectively as a country we dip our hands into our national pocket to assist people overseas in times of difficulty. While most Australians sympathise with genuine refugees and the hardships they face, they understand the need to maintain diligence in processing and to have appropriate examination of new refugee applicants. They do not want common sense thrown out the window, and they want to do all they can to protect our Australian people and to maintain the way of life and level of safety that we privileged to enjoy in Australia. We as a country want to have only those people who are of good character. While the bill certainly strengthens the current provisions, it does not go far enough. Most Australians are outraged when they hear about the riots and the protests which have taken place on Christmas Island and at Villawood. That indicates that these people have no respect whatever for Australia, its laws or its property and that they believe they have the right to do what they want. Even the thought of a deputy secretary of the department having to plead with people to come down from where they were is unacceptable. What happens is that a certain number of people play on the basic decency and good values of Australians. We are a relatively small nation and we would be silly to put at risk the things that make Australia the wonderful country that it is by going soft on those who claim to be asylum seekers and as a result seek to take up residence in Australia. It is very important that anyone who commits violence, destroys property or breaches the peace while in detention is not allowed to remain here. It is certainly unacceptable that some people have vandalised and trashed the accommodation that has been provided by the Australian taxpayer. That does not sit well with the Australian people and our sense of fair play. It is certainly a bizarre type of behaviour, akin to biting the hand that feeds you. In the very short amount of time left to me, let me say that these changes to the Migration Act 1958 aim to improve the behaviour of detainees and to bring about consequences for those who behave badly. The bill is a step in the right direction. It does not go anywhere near far enough. I, on behalf of the people of Australia, implore the government to consider strengthening the provisions of this bill so that it will achieve what the are Australian people would want it to achieve. Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (18:30): The Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 purports to strengthen legislation so that following a court conviction leading to a custodial sentence of less than 12 months the minister will have the power to refuse to grant a visa to a person or may cancel a person's visa if they do not satisfy the minister that they pass the character test. There is a similar amendment relating to section 500, which concerns temporary safe haven visas. The explanatory memorandum states that 'the changes are, in part, in response to the criminal behaviour during the recent disturbances at the Christmas Island and Villawood immigration detention centres which caused substantial damage to Commonwealth property' and in response to the 'violent, destructive and criminal behaviour which has been occurring in immigration detention'. Lest my intentions be misconstrued or misunderstood, I do not in any way condone violent and destructive behaviour in detention centres, or in any other place for that matter. Those who break the law should clearly be charged, convicted and sentenced according to the law. However, in considering this legislation we must ask the questions: are these amendments warranted; are the remedies proportionate to the crime in cases where a sentence for criminal behaviour is less than 12 months; and should we be supporting the retrospective element of this amendment bill? The starting date for the new ministerial powers is 26 April 2011, a date that has passed. The retrospective element lies in the new provisions under section 501(6), which will apply to individuals convicted of an offence before or after that date. The bill, in clause 501(6)(aa), provides an additional ground on which a person will not pass the character test: if the person was convicted of an offence committed while in immigration detention, during an escape or while on the run before being detained again and is convicted and jailed for less than 12 months. Although it has been argued that in some cases retrospective laws have a place in law making, retrospective laws have been widely condemned in cases of criminal law. The difficulty in this case, though, is that it is not the criminal law that is retrospectively applied; rather it is the operation of section 501(6) following a criminal conviction, no matter how minor, which may apply retrospectively. Previously the character test specified a number of grounds or criteria of assessment-for example, 501(6)(a), that a person has a 'substantial criminal record'. A 'substantial criminal record' is defined under 501(7)(c) mainly in terms of the severity of a sentence: that a person was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. The stated reason for this additional ground is that the current provisions specifying a minimum sentence of 12 months imprisonment are inadequate. According to the explanatory memorandum, the current provision 'imposes a significant limitation on the ability of the minister to appropriately respond to the violent, destructive and criminal behaviour which has been occurring in immigration detention'. That statement comes directly out of the explanatory memorandum. Under this new provision, and again I quote: It does not matter what penalty is imposed by a court as a result of the conviction. This clear and objective basis for a person to fail the character test. The other question we should ask in this place is: is the new provision necessary? In a discussion with David Manne, the executive director and senior solicitor for the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, he said that, contrary to the assertion of the explanatory memorandum, the minister's ability to respond appropriately to recent conduct involving 'violence' and 'destruction' is not confined to the ground of 'substantial criminal record' with the threshold of a sentence of imprisonment for 12 months or more. The Migration Act contains further grounds for the character test which include 'the person's past and present criminal conduct' and 'the person's past and present general conduct'. I thank David Manne for his assistance in looking at some of the worse elements of this bill. The Refugee Council of Australia also made this comment in a recent press release: Presently, and even in his own words, the Minister for Immigration has 'very extensive' powers to deal with people in detention convicted of a crime, including criminal damage. There is no need to bolster these powers with legislation that could see them widened to include refugees who commit more minor offences while in the pressure cooker environment of long-term detention. Our concern is that a refugee who commits one misdemeanour could be denied protection and unity with his or her family for life. In 2009 the minister for immigration issued a direction under section 499 of the Migration Act providing direction to decision makers with respect to section 501. It outlines a number of factors for decision makers to consider in determining whether a person is not of good character on the basis of criminal conduct and they include 'the nature, severity and frequency of the offence/s'. The factors do not include the penalty imposed by a creates a court. The explanatory memorandum's statement that the new provision 'creates an objective basis for a person to fail the character test' implies that the limitation in the definition of substantial criminal record-a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more-which is asserted to constrain the appropriate response of the minister is not objective. That is not the case. We must also ask ourselves: is the new provision proportionate to the problem it seeks to address? The explanatory memorandum states that 'the changes are, in part, a response to the criminal behaviour during the recent disturbances at the Christmas Island and Villawood immigration detention centres which caused substantial damage to Commonwealth property' and a response 'to the violent, destructive and criminal behaviour which has been occurring in immigration detention'. Again, these are direct quotes from the explanatory memorandum. According to the explanatory memorandum: … it is intended by the Government to ensure any conviction for an offence of the kind by this Bill results in the person automatically failing to pass the character test. However, the amendments do not specify any particular kind of offence and are not limited to 'violent' and 'destructive' conduct. A person who is convicted of any offence committed while in immigration detention, including minors in community detention, will not pass the character test. Offences someone detained in the community might commit include jay-walking, drunkenness, not having a ticket on public transport, placing graffiti without consent and begging. My goodness me, if we applied this to the general community we might have a few problems. Proponents of the bill may argue that the minister would only refuse to grant a visa in the case of very 'serious' offences, as intended-so trust the minister to exercise the greatly expanded power with proper discretion. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that, given the widespread hostility to people in detention who have committed serious offences, decision makers may feel under pressure to deny granting visas to people presumptively determined as of bad character for committing a wider range of acts other than the violence and destruction that was the reason for this bill's existence. In a speech in the parliament this morning on the Morrison motion to establish a House of Representatives committee to examine all elements of detention centres, I called for the discontinuance of the indefinite, arbitrary detention system and I am going to repeat some of that. Of course if you overcrowd prison systems there is bound to be trouble. That is not an excuse for some of the criminal behaviour we have witnessed recently in detention centres, but it is a fact. As I said this morning, the issue of indefinite, arbitrary mandatory detention for that asylum seekers has been much debated and covered much criticised since it was first implemented by the Labor government in 1992. It is a negative and punitive system of dealing with those who come to our shores seeking asylum. Apart from the all-tooapparent negative effects on people incarcerated in detention prisons, the system is administratively demanding and very costly. The original intention when mandatory detention was introduced by the Labor public government was to act as a deterrent to those seeking to come to our shores. Originally, it was aimed at a very small number of people arriving by boat. Yet 10 years after the implementation of the policy there were 5,000 boat arrivals. Similarly the policy of temporary protection visas was introduced as a deterrent. In the five years prior to temporary protection visas being introduced, there were 3,103 boat arrivals. In the five years following the introduction of temporary protection visas there were over 11,000 arrivals. It is time we looked at these policies in the cold light of day and worked toward a durable solution to the problem of people fleeing the threat of death or oppression in their own countries. In 2001 to 2005, some of us in this place worked toward hard-won changes which were made to the system of mandatory detention and implemented. Then the new Labor government came into government on the promise of its New Directions in Detention policy, a seven-point plan. The government acknowledged that 'detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable'. The Refugee Council recently put out a press release highlighting the 1,412 per cent increase in the number of asylum seekers who have now been in detention for more than six months. That figure is an increase over the last 12 months. The government has failed to implement its own New Directions in Detention and, according to the most recent Australian Human Rights Commission report, 2011: Immigration detention at Villawood, thousands of people, including over 1,000 children, remain in these prisons. It is no wonder that there is trouble. More than half of those people have been detained for longer than six months, and more than 750 people have been detained for longer than a year. As I said in a speech in this House in 2006, the stranger who stumbles upon our shores has a claim on both our conscience and our patriotism and, when he or she arrives with credentials uncontaminated by smugglers and pleading a case, that at very least is worthy of a fair hearing. The qualities that constitute fairness are not those that unmitigated sequestration and inhumanity upon the stranger. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this indefinite, arbitrary migration detention centre policy is inhumane and that there has been plenty of evidence, in report after report from many different agencies, to highlight the terrible harm that this system is doing to individuals, particularly to children. We should be working much harder in this place to find durable solutions and to separate out those two issues, the one of people fleeing from persecution and possible death and the other of how we treat people once they come to our shores seeking our protection. This amending legislation is a sloppy attempt to continue to paper over the cracks of a cruel system of indefinite, arbitrary mandatory detention for people who have never committed any crime.",143
187,Mr BOWEN,BUSINESS," I thank all honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011. This is an importance piece of legislation. The intent of this legislation is to make it crystal clear to people in immigration detention and the broader community that inappropriate behaviour in our detention centres is unacceptable. That means that anyone who is in an immigration detention centre who is convicted of any offence will know that they will fail the character test and enliven the minister's and the department's ability to refuse them a visa if they are convicted of an offence. That is important. I will respond to some of the points made by the opposition. I will do that by addressing a series of points made by the opposition. The opposition have flagged an amendment, which I will get to in a moment. They have also made a more general contribution. I will confine my visit comments to their contribution on this particular bill although obviously several honourable members opposite have taken the opportunity to comment more broadly. The opposition's position on this is that this legislation is not necessary and it does far enough. I am not sure how the opposition can close the ring on that argument. The shadow minister, who joins us in the chamber, has said on several occasions that he does not regard this legislation as necessary. Several of his colleagues have said that in the chamber tonightnevertheless, they have said they will support it, which I welcome-and then they have said the legislation does not go far enough. I am not sure how you can argue that legislation that is not necessary does not go far enough. I have made the department's legal advisers available to the honourable member opposite. I understand they provided him with advice that shows why this legislation is necessary, which the honourable member is aware of-although he has not referred to it. It is my view that this has been necessary for some time. Honourable members opposite have pointed out that there have been instances of people who have been convicted of offences whilst in immigration detention who have not then failed the character test. That is correct, and honourable members have referred to those instances. There have been others that honourable members opposite have not referred to. For example, in the 2002-03 Woomera and Baxter riots and escapes, in relation to Woomera 15 people were convicted of offences. Of those 15 people who were convicted of offences in relation to the Woomera riots and escapes, 12 got permanent visas and five were granted Australian citizenship. The honourable gentleman opposite and his colleagues complain here, and elsewhere in the broader debate, about this government not applying the character test. Previous ministers and governments found similar issues. Yes, I have taken the view that the character test does need to be strengthened. The not go honourable member has pointed out, correctly, that I said I would be applying the character test to people who participated in the events at Christmas Island and Villawood. Yes, I said that; of course I said that. It is not inconsistent of me to say also that I think the character test needs to be strengthened, and that is why this legislation has been introduced today. The honourable member for Cook has criticised the government for our response to the Villawood protest. He said that we should have ignored the Australian Federal Police advice on how to handle that situation. He has criticised the government for having a senior departmental official explain to those people on the roof that they were not achieving anything and they should come down. I went back and looked at how previous governments might have handled these sorts of issues, because I thought: 'That's criticism which is aimed at the government.' I again had a look at the situation in relation to Woomera and I found a report from Saturday, 10 June 2000. It says: Mr Ruddock said he had decided not to go to Woomera, despite demands from the boat people, because he did not feel it appropriate to go there under duress. Fair enough, I say. The report goes on: The secretary of the Immigration Department, Mr Bill Farmer, had been sent instead. Previous ministers have sent the secretary for discussions with people who have been involved in protests and riots, and the honourable member opposite criticises the department and the government for having the deputy secretary say to people on the roof that they were achieving nothing and they should get down. The honourable member for Cook said in his contribution that life goes on. That was what he said. He said that for people who had been on the roof of Villawood life goes on and there are no consequences for the people involved. He ignored the fact that one of the people involved has been charged with very serious offences with a potential sentence of up to 12 years in prison. So his argument that life goes on is a little hard to manage. I want to spend some time dealing with the opposition's amendment, which they have flagged for discussion. We will be opposing that amendment. The opposition have flagged an amendment which would amend section 501(7) so that people who are convicted of an offence with a custodial sentence would have the character test enlivened. To listen to the contribution of shadow minister for immigration you would think that that would mean that anybody who is in Australia who is not a citizen who commits an offence in Australia could have their visa cancelled if they committed an offence which had a custodial sentence-and that would be true. What the shadow minister for immigration did not outline to the House is who else that would apply to. There are 4½ million permanent and temporary visa holders and applicants in Australia. The shadow minister's amendment would mean that, for example, somebody applying for a tourist visa to Australia who had been sentenced to a custodial sentence perhaps 40 years ago would fail the character test. For all the 4½ million people that this would apply to, it would mean that, for example, somebody who may have spent two weeks in prison 40 years ago would fail the character test. That would mean that every single tourist to Australia, regardless of visa type, would then have to be considered by the department in that light. I wonder whether the shadow minister for immigration has consulted with the shadow minister for tourism, who is at the table. I hope he has, because this will have a very significant impact on the tourist industry in Australia. I am surprised that a former head of Tourism Australia would move such an amendment as this. If they are concerned about processing times now, I would like to see the impact of their amendment on processing times, which will blow out. Of course the government considered the type of amendment that the shadow minister has proposed tonight. We went through it. I did consider the position that this should apply more broadly and, when some of the implications of that were pointed out to me, I made the appropriate decision. I am not sure the shadow minister has thought this through. I think we see a bit of a thought the bubble from the shadow minister. He would create a special class, because according to the shadow minister's amendment this would not apply to holders of ETA visas. So if you were to come from some countries you would be covered by this amendment; if you were to come from other countries you would not be covered, because ETAs would be under a separate regime. That was the advice to me from my department this evening. I do not think the shadow minister for immigration has thought this through at all. It is appropriate that if you are in immigration detention you are very clear on your obligations, because offences in immigration detention, even offences which do not attract a penalty of 12 months or more, involve damage to Commonwealth property, risk to other detainees, risk to Commonwealth staff and risk to staff of service providers. They are serious offences, and it is appropriate that this parliament, this government, sends a clear message about that sort of behaviour. If the shadow minister for immigration sincerely believes that this amendment is feasible, then I would invite him to call a division. I would invite him to have the names recorded of honourable members who agree with him in this House and I would look forward to that division occurring. I am glad that he will be supporting the bill and I welcome that support and the support of the opposition, but I would also encourage them to reconsider the amendment they propose to move here tonight. I do not expect them to withdraw it from the House but I hope, after reflection, they do not move it in the other place. We will certainly be pointing out the inefficiencies and the shortcomings in the opposition's thought bubble on this approach.",149
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," The question is that the bill be now read a second time. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133(b) the division is deferred until 8 pm. Debate adjourned. Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",152
189,Mr ANDREWS,BUSINESS," I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services, Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend various acts to achieve a range of amendments to existing legislation: firstly, with respect to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act, to provide for modified arrangements for advance payments of family tax benefit and the payment of FTB part A supplement for a child turning four, conditional on that child receiving a health check prior to starting school; secondly, with respect to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, to determine a parent's taxable income by using their previous taxable income, indexed by growth in wages, when a tax return has not been lodged; thirdly, with respect to the Social Security Act 1991, to require payers of compensation to notify Centrelink of proposed payments of compensation; and, fourthly, to make various technical amendments to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. The bill would make amendments to take effect from 1 July regarding family benefits. This includes rules for determining whether an individual is entitled to a family tax benefit advance and the amount of the advance, the rules as to reducing the individual's rate of FTB part A to effect repayment of the advance, and the circumstances in which a debt for the unpaid amount of the FTB advance is raised. For the 2011-12 year, the maximum advance available will be limited to $1,000 and the minimum will be limited to $160.96. For subsequent years, the maximum and minimum amounts will be linked to the FTB child rate for one FTB child who is under 13 years of age, which is indexed on 1 July of each year. If the individual is repaying a previous amount, then their maximum amount will be reduced by the original amount of the previous advance. The default repayment period over which the advance will be repaid by a reduction in the individual's FTB part A instalment rate is 182 days, or 26 weeks. This period may span two financial years. However, the repayment period may be varied depending on the individual's circumstances. The new measures relating to the repayment of advance debts would see more flexible arrangements that will result in an individual generally repaying their advance from ongoing reductions of the part A rate, rather than a debt arising. The health checks for young children measure will make the payment of the FTB part A supplement for a child turning four in a particular income year conditional on the child undertaking a health check. This measure will commence on 1 July 2011. The proposed amendments relating 'determinations of adjustable taxable income' would modify the current rules applicable to the Child Support Registrar in determining a person's adjusted taxable income where a parent's taxable income has not been formally assessed. A new, more accurate default income arrangement will be introduced that uses a parent's previous taxable income, indexed by growth in wages, instead of a lower default income-that is, two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings-in cases where they have not lodged a tax return. These amendments replace the current rules for determining a parent's adjustable taxable income with new rules that will more accurately reflect a parent's income and ensure better support for children. The proposed provisions relating to 'notice of payments of recompense for personal injuries' require payers of compensation, such as insurance companies, to notify Centrelink of proposed payments of compensation. Centrelink will then use this information to determine the social security entitlements of the compensation recipient or their partner. This will reduce the risk of individuals incurring unnecessary debt to the Commonwealth and receiving income support payments to which they or their partner are not entitled. Currently, social security recipients are required to notify Centrelink when they or their partner are to receive a compensation payment. The new provisions will streamline the notification process for compensation payments to social security recipients or their partners to ensure they receive their correct entitlements. The bill also makes minor amendments to the family assistance law and child support legislation to clarify technical or drafting matters and to ensure that the legislation operates as intended. While the coalition will not oppose this bill, we on this side are to concerned that this bill does not ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. That is because the Labor-Greens alliance does not understand the pressure that Australian families are under. At a time when Australian families are struggling with the rising cost of living, cutting $2 billion from family benefits will put many under even more pressure. Over 2.1 million families will lose some support as a result of the real value of the family tax benefit supplement being cut. This is just the latest assault on families, delivered by this directionless government. Indeed, many families with parents earning average wages will lose hundreds of dollars a year through the freezing of the threshold at which families start losing base rate family tax benefit A. The family with a combined income of $110,000-for instance, with each parent earning $55,000 or one parent earning $65,000 and one earning $40,000-will lose $853.50 a year in 2012-13 if they have two children under 13 and $906.75 if they have three young children. Losing this support will hurt families, who have already seen many of their bills increase dramatically in recent years. Since December 2007, electricity prices have increased by an average of 51 per cent across Australia, the overall cost of food has increased by 13 per cent and education costs such as school fees have increased by an average of 24 per cent. With a carbon tax on its way-if this government gets its way-and mortgage interest rates having increased seven times since September 2009, repayments on the average mortgage have increased by over $500 per month in a little under 18 months. The working families of 2007 have indeed become the forgotten families of 2011. Family benefits are being hit. Changes to private health insurance will also hit families. Labor's ideological disdain for independent schools will also hurt families. Labor's attack on regional students and youth allowance has already demonstrated the ruthlessness with which this government is treating those families outside our cities. The Gillard Labor government's decision to rip $50 million out of family relationship services will have a serious impact in the sector that strives to keep families together, including many of these families that are feeling pressure at the moment. This Labor government will stand condemned for its assault on families. It will stand condemned for its alliance-its partnership-with the extremist Greens. In stark contrast, the coalition is committed to easing the financial burden on families by rejecting Labor's new taxes and paying back Labor's debt as soon as possible. This will take pressure off interest rates and living costs for all Australians. This bill is therefore yet another missed opportunity, a disappointment we on this side of the House have unfortunately become expectant of from this disastrous and directionless government.",152
190,Mr HAYES,BUSINESS," I rise to support the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill has five key aspects. The first three aspectsBetter Access to Family Payments, Healthy Start for School and Strengthening Compliance-Child Support-emanate from our election commitments. The remaining two aspects-streamlining the notification processes for compensation recipients and some minor amendments to technical or drafting matters within the act-emanate from the 2010-11 budget. We on this side of the chamber believe that the purpose of government is to help families. Despite what has just been said, any objective analysis of what is being put forward would show that this bill does exactly that. I pride myself on being able to say that my electorate of Fowler is all about families. It is the most multicultural electorate in the country. It has a disproportionately high number of families, and I know that the measures contained in this legislation will be of benefit to them. My electorate-no doubt like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom-is very much centred around family and family life, and I know that the initiatives proposed in this bill will make a difference in balancing the family budget. The first aspect of the bill is Better Access to Family Payments, which is something we committed to in the lead-up to the last election. It will provide more flexibility for advance payments to families on the family tax benefit. Families will be able to receive a larger and more flexible advance of their family tax benefit entitlements. This will help families meet those unexpected expenses, which I know will be welcomed by residents of my electorate. My kids are now grown up, but as a father I get to see the unexpected expenses my kids are facing with my grandchildren going to school-school outings, uniforms and things like that. I get to see those things that impact on my daughter's and my son's expenses and what they have to do to have their kids ready for school or other activities. I understand how in reality, when this change is applied across the electorate, it is going to increase flexibility for mums and dads out there so they can make ends meet and, importantly, ensure that their kids do not miss out. As I understand it, the amount that will be advanced will be linked to the amount a family receives in benefits, with Centrelink on hand to give parents assistance, particularly with financial counselling or other support. That too is a big thing. The upshot of this scheme is that families will be able to avoid high credit card costs. They will be able to avoid the costs of taking up personal loans and will be better placed to plan their budgets accordingly by being able to access the money when they need it and adjust their budgets to facilitate their expenditure over periods of less demand on income support. This may not seem much to those opposite, who seem to be very dismissive of it, but for those of us who have a high housing commission component in our electorates-a high proportion of singleparent families-that provision alone will make a very significant difference. I can assure you of that. The second component of this amendment is the Healthy Start for School package. It is another election commitment and affects family tax benefit recipients on income support payments. It links the family payments to the health checks of four-year-olds. If parents refuse to comply with the requirements, they will have their payments suspended. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall in the lead-up to the last election we emphasised significantly the importance of having every child being school-ready, every child being examined to make sure they were healthy-and four years old is the appropriate time, before they get school. Only last week I conducted an exercise with the Autism Advisory and Support Service. One of the big things they advised me of was that, whilst all these moneys are available for early intervention, unless a parent suspects that their child is slow or is possibly falling into the autism spectrum disorder band, ordinarily it is not brought to light until they get to school and a teacher decides to ask a parent in that respect. It is imperative, particularly for those disorders, that we have early intervention. That is where the difference can be made, in all sorts of areas-including my own grandson, who is on the spectrum. He was, very fortunately, diagnosed early, and I see the difference that that makes. There is probably more chance than not in him being diagnosed. But what this bill is seeking to do is to make sure all kids get a healthy start-and, as I say, we do need to ensure that our kids are ready to attend school, ready to learn and that, where there are issues, we are in a position to do something about them through early intervention. That is clearly an aspect of families embracing healthy lifestyles and providing appropriate assistance to parents. It is something that I am very fortunate with-as I said, I have a very active service in my electorate, the Autism Advisory and Support Service, run by its volunteer director, Grace Fava. They do an extraordinary job of assisting parents whose children are suspected as having, or have been diagnosed with, autism. This is one of the things that they keep emphasising to me: we need to take every possible step that all kids are given the proper checks and, where necessary, are able to access, in terms of autism, the $12,000 before they turn six to actually help them. Regrettably, a lot of kids-sometimes through denial with respect to their parents-do not go through that to process, and as a consequence kids stand to miss out. This is something that was very much a key election commitment from us, and it is something we are proud to be delivering at this stage. With respect to low-income families or where, unfortunately, marriage breakdowns and separations occur, in my electorate I do have very high levels of separation rates. I know that there is enormous stress on parent families. Again, this is something will help in that respect, at least to ensure their kids have been tested and given every opportunity for a healthy start in their learning careers and throughout their education process. The third part of this bill is again an election commitment, and it deals with strengthening the compliance in the child support system. At the moment, in the event of a parent who fails to lodge their income, or is late with their income tax return, a default income is used, which is currently two-thirds of the male total average weekly earnings. So, where one parent decidesmaybe because their income has accelerated over a particular period of time, such as by being inflated by overtime or other thingsto simply not put a return in, the male total average weekly earnings is the default income that is used for calculating child support. Obviously, that has certain advantages, but there is certainly an incentive for those who want to dodge their commitments to their children, as the default figure can understate the parent's actual income. The Gillard government has committed to making this system more fair and more accurate. That is not just about going out and trying to take money from people; it is trying to do that and fair for the child. I know sometimes it is a bit hard to get through, particularly when parents are still in a combative position, but the basis of this particular amendment is to do what is fair for the child. We want parents to meet their obligations and support their children. This fairer system will replace the current system. The process will generally use the parent's last known taxable income, indexed by growth in average wages. In the event that the MTAWE process provides a higher income, that will be used instead, but in the main it will be the last known taxable single- income, indexed by average wages. I that strongly support that measure, because I believe that in all these circumstances the person who cannot miss out is the child. It is clear that, in this respect, we must do the right thing and front and centre in our consideration must be the child. The fourth aspect to the amendment deals with the streamlining of the notification processes for compensation recipients. This was a 2010-11 budget measure and will streamline the process of notifying Centrelink when payments are made by compensation payers, such as insurers. The compensation payers will now be required to tell Centrelink before compensation payments, either as a lump sum or as a periodic payment, are made to the recipients or their partners. This new requirement will ensure that people are paid the correct amount straight away. At the moment, there are times when Centrelink is not informed, which means that overpayments are made and those debts then have to be recovered. The recovery process creates difficulties for families in having the money taken back from them. But this is meant to ensure that people receive what they are justly required to receive under law and to ensure that the payment is correct when it is first paid. That way we avoid the issue of having to go out to which is right recover overpayments. I can speak about what that may mean for Centrelink. I can understand that it is a good thing for them, administratively. But it does seem to me that it is a very harsh thing to do for someone from Centrelink to come six or seven months later to recover a debt when, by that time, the money has already been absorbed into the family's normal daily running costs and looking after the family. We see that and we understand it, so what we are trying to do is ensure that the money people receive is appropriately adjusted so that the debt is not incurred in the first instance. The vast majority of people will want to do the right thing, and it will make the process for them easier. To that extent, it will actually reward people who are doing the right thing. In my electorate a lot of people will benefit from what is proposed in this bill. I have a large grouping of families and I know that my electorate is over-represented with people with disabilities. The fact that we are now going to examine every four-year-old will be of extraordinary benefit to my community. (Time expired)",154
191,Mr WYATT,BUSINESS," commend the government on this legislation and the amendments to it, but there are some points I want to make. The bill we are debating today adds to the Labor government's election commitment package titled Better access to family payments, and is due to come into effect as of 1 July-that is: flexible family tax benefits advances; the healthy start for schools measure; and the streamlining of compensation payments notification. I welcome the proposed changes to the advance payment system, because many of my constituents in Hasluck will benefit from these changes. These amendments and the rules for determining whether an individual is entitled to an advance, and their eligibility for an advance, will assist those families that for various reasons need financial assistance to address a specific need. From my childhood experience I know how these circumstances arise and create both angst and additional pressure for a family. Hasluck has some of the country's most disadvantaged families and rising petrol and food costs are already putting upward pressure on household incomes. The carbon tax will further hurt Hasluck families and hundreds of thousands of others around this country. The change, however, will benefit those families who receive the benefits of the family tax benefit at the end of the financial year. Unexpected surges in cost of living or unforeseen emergencies require funding and many families often do not have the spare cash to meet the increased costs. This can affect families at any time. For example, it is not uncommon for circumstances to arise where a family member loses their job or is cut back to part-time hours or a family member needs an operation and is off work for a protracted period of time. Equally, I treatment for specific illnesses can have a detrimental impact on a family. The provisions will provide a degree of comfort for those eligible for advances. I met a couple who were doing well financially until the breadwinner had a debilitating accident. He is incapacitated and can no longer work even though he has the desire to. He expressed to me his frustration at not being able to do so. They now struggle to make ends meet. I know of a number of families in my electorate that have found themselves in this position recently. Every one of them would benefit from the ability to draw down on these funds as a contingency to address a financial pressure point. The legislation will enable procedures to be more flexible than previous arrangements, and it is subject to an upper or lower limit. Repayment of the advance over a fixed period will be abolished and replaced with a period of two financial years in which to pay off the owed amount. This will reduce the burden of forcing families to make choices about what they will or will not go without. Instead they can plan for these repayments. An additional burden is sometimes placed upon families by the time constraints, and the requirement to repay is sometimes not fully understood and therefore causes some angst when letters convey the immediacy of that payment. I compliment the government on the fact that it has given this time period to allow for those repayments to occur. My office consistently receives calls from families having problems managing payments or repayments with Centrelink. For many it is a daunting process and reinforces a cycle of interdependency with the agency. It is like a marriage: both of you need each other but one does not understand the full complexity of the problems that they are negotiating with the other. To be able to manage repayments in a way more suitable to the family would be a welcome development. Allowing a more flexible payment advance regime would also help certain families that are in most need. The coalition supports an Australia with smaller government and one that trusts its people to have enough intelligence to live their own lives and make the right decisions. History shows that if people are given more personal responsibility they are more likely to act in a responsible manner when it comes to their finances. I believe that this arrangement will allow people to make the best financial decision for their family, and is long overdue. Another amendment I support is compulsory health checks for children turning four in a particular income year before parents are able to receive family tax benefit A. It is a sound health prevention measure that will enable a child's health to be assessed, treated and monitored through ongoing healthcare plans. I congratulate the government for including this measure in the legislation. Prior to entering politics, I was the Director of Aboriginal Health in both Western Australia and New South Wales and I supported the implementation of child health checks. The health checks regime that the Labor government is seeking to introduce would ensure information collection which establishes a patient history and provides the opportunity to undertake an overall assessment of the child. This is something that has been needed for all children because it gives the capacity for those children to be identified at an early point in their lives and for specific illnesses, and even shortness of sight, to be identified. That would enable that matter to be rectified and for them to enjoy quality of life. The health checks regime will also include recommending appropriate interventions and the provision of advice and information to the child's parent or carer; and keeping a record of the health assessment, and offering the child's parents and/or carer a written report about the health assessment, with recommendations about matters covered by the health assessment. I strongly support the examination and assessments provided under Healthy Kids Checks, including: height and weight, because these are critical markers of development; eyesight; hearing; oral health, which covers teeth and gums; toileting; and allergies. A family on income support payments does not neglect their child, or not know how it to care for them, but their level of disposable income can be problematic and they may not prioritise a child health check as a result. This amendment will make people think about their child in a different way, and this small change can make a huge difference to a young person's potential for a healthy start to life and their ability to receive a decent education. It is a sad world that we live in when we must introduce an amendment to insist on health checks for four-year-olds, but it is a necessary one and I strongly support this move. There is no silver-bullet solution to this problem for all of Australia's children. The overwhelming majority of young families in this country are strong, caring units that give their utmost attention to their children's physical, emotional and social development. The challenge is to find a balance between a government passing on this information and being seen as patronising to new parents. People have been having children for millennia, and a government does need to be mindful of this when revealing best practice to Australian families. There is no better substitute than family tradition, passed down from generation to generation, on how to care for our young children. However, there are individual families who experience pressures which create a range of problems, and in this instance these measures are needed to assist those struggling families. What we now know is that, more than ever, a foundation of social, emotional and physical well-being at a very young age has a profound impact on the child in adolescence and adult life. Government has a responsibility to act in the best interests Australians. Studies show that a child growing up with unchecked or undiagnosed health problems will struggle to enjoy life fully, and the onset of chronic diseases will be an imposition on their quality of life. In this regard, I welcome the move to require health checks on young children turning four, as it will identify early on, for some families, health problems which might be cured or treated. This is part of a wider attempt to ensure the nation's young children have a better start to life. However, the devil will be in the detail of the program and services, and this is something that should be of concern to people watching this unfold under this Labor government. An important part of this bill is the change in the process compensation recipients go through when receiving their payment. Suffering from an injury is stressful enough without having the government making it more complicated for the individual. Generally, people receiving compensation have suffered some kind of trauma, either mental or physical. Currently, when a person receives a compensation payment they must notify Centrelink of the receipt of this money so that Centrelink can determine their eligibility to receive their social security entitlements. Unfortunately, many do not realise their obligation to do so until Centrelink is aware of it and, as a consequence, the individual is burdened with a debt which they have to pay back to the Commonwealth. The new amendments will streamline the process and require payers of compensation to notify Centrelink of the payment so that Centrelink can automatically adjust the recipient's social security payments. I believe this process will remove an unnecessary and additional stress for people that have likely suffered enough prior to receiving the compensation. In Hasluck, I see on a day-today basis of all many people who are affected in this way. There have of late been a number of terrible accidents in my electorate which have left the survivors disfigured, severely injured or unable to work. A tragedy can strike any of us at any time. For those in our society who are fortunate enough, through their hard work, to be in a strong enough financial position to support themselves, or a family member, after an accident that results in a disability, this change will not be a factor of concern. The expression 'There but for the grace of God go I' is one we do not often think about. But when you see a severe motorbike accident on a highway, or a person being resuscitated on the side of the road, it puts it into sharp focus that these people were travelling to work. They probably kissed their loved ones goodbye and left for the day thinking, 'I'll see you tonight for dinner,' their heads filled with the thoughts and pressures that preoccupy most of us every day. But these people did not come home safely that evening and their lives were changed forever. When the initial shock of their lifethe changing injury wears off, and pragmatic thoughts surface, government has a moral and ethical responsibility to provide appropriate support to reduce the burden on both the individual and the family. We cannot stop accidents; by their very nature they are unplanned. But what a government can do is to make sure that, if compensation is awarded, the person struggling with this trauma is not penalised by Centrelink for forgetting, or incorrectly revealing, their compensation payment to the government. It is easy for politicians, when we are debating legislation, to forget that these changes have a real impact on people's lives. These are not just words to score political points. Our collective decisions in this place have real and lasting impacts on our constituents, who trust that we will make the right decision in the national interest at all times. Parliament should be doing all it can to make people's lives easier. For the people of Hasluck and Australia who are suffering with an injury, this measure will streamline things and make the challenge much easier. I appreciate the benefits that will arise from this legislation because it focuses on the needs of Australians at times of both trauma and opportunity and provides the necessary steps that improve the quality of life for individuals and families, but ultimately community. In the long term, with the child health checks, for example, and the level of streamlining in the compensation arrangements, it removes to some extent the burden and pressure on a family. This debate provides an opportunity for us to help families to understand the programs and services that arise from the legislation. When interacting with people, too often one of the greatest challenges that we have in imparting information is people's understanding of the complex programs that we have put in place to assist them. To that end, I acknowledge work of the minister. I believe that these measures will go a long way to make life much easier for the families of Hasluck and, in the greater sense, the families and people of Australia.",157
192,Ms SMYTH,BUSINESS," It is great to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011, which gives effect to some of the commitments the government made during the last federal election. As members of the House will certainly know, we already gave effect to two other significant election commitments in an earlier bill to provide for improved support for families with teenagers to recognise the particular needs of those aged 16 to 19 in secondary school or vocational education. Notwithstanding the very positive remarks of the previous speaker in this debate, I acknowledge that there have been other speakers in this debate and in previous debates who have reminisced on the contributions of the Howard government to assist families during its period of office. Certainly the measure put in place in the last bill, which gave effect to some of our election commitments relating to families, carried out a substantial piece of unfinished for a business in the Howard government years, when families saw their benefits drop by over $150 a fortnight, or around $4,000 a year, when their children turned 16. In previous legislation before the House in this term, we provided for better access to the baby bonus to assist families with the upfront costs of having a new baby, so I am very pleased to speak in this evening's debate relating to family payments and legislation that gives effect to payments to families and carries on the significant initiatives which we put in place both in this term and in our term. My electorate spans some of the fastestgrowing suburbs of Melbourne, in the south-eastern growth corridor. It is home to very many new families who will certainly stand to benefit from the measures we have already put in place to assist them and certainly the measures which I hope will be put in place through this bill. These measures will give families more flexibility in the way that they are paid the family tax benefit. The measures strengthen the focus which this government has given to health checks for young children. They are measures which much more accurately assess the income upon which child support payments are based so that children get the financial support that they need and deserve and which ought to be paid for their welfare and upkeep. The bill also includes measures which were outlined in the 2010-11 budget which will streamline the notification of compensation payments for the purposes of assessing income for Centrelink payments. The first of the measures contemplated in the bill reflects our commitment to better access to family payments through advance payments of the family tax benefit. This will ensure that payments are made much more flexible and will better enable families to meet unexpected costs as they arise. The government certainly believes in a sustainable and targeted family payment system that will continue to support Australian families for many years to come. The effect of the provisions of the bill will mean that from 1 July this year, subject to the legislation being finalised in this place and in the other place, families will benefit from a payment system that gives them much more scope to choose the size and timing of their advance payments. It is a system which we hope will help families meet certain last unexpected costs. We certainly appreciate how readily unexpected costs can arise for families and cause tremendous stress for them. The new system contemplated by the bill will enable families to budget better for their households. For some families we know that from the new flexibility could mean avoiding unnecessary and much higher credit card bills than they might be able to afford or high interest personal loans or simply having to forego some important needs. The measures will ensure that families will be able to choose the value of their advance payment between certain minimum and maximum amounts and will enable families to repay those advances through adjustments to their ongoing fortnightly entitlements. The new arrangements will mean that families will no longer be restricted to receiving and repaying advances within two prescribed periods of the year, namely 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December. Families will be able to request more of their entitlements in advance, at any point in the year, and the advance will be recovered in the following six months. There are certain safeguards which the bill puts in place. For instance, Centrelink will not approve an advance payment request if it would mean undue financial hardship for the family making the request. Families making repeated requests will be assessed to see whether they might benefit from financial support and counselling. This is a very important means of reaching those who have a need for additional support or are, for a range of reasons, having difficulty managing their finances from month to month. Another significant measure which the bill will implement relates to Healthy Start for School, which was announced during the federal election. I am particularly pleased to be talking about this measure because on the day that that announcement was made the Prime Minister, together with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, visited my electorate. They visited the suburb of Pakenham and we all had the chance to engage with young mothers and their children, who were having health checks at a local GP clinic. They certainly appreciated the value of those health checks and it was great to see them put in place. This measure will make sure that all children have the opportunity to have those very important health checks at an early stage in their lives. The measure will make the payment of the family tax benefit part A supplement for a child turning four in a particular income year conditional on the child undertaking a health check. This is a measure which will commence on 1 July 2011. The Healthy Start for School measure delivers on a very important election commitment. A new requirement will also be introduced for income support recipient parents or carers of four-year-olds, which is aimed at giving their children a healthy start for school. The measure will make the family tax benefit part A supplement conditional, for these families, on the children going through a basic health assessment, such as a Healthy Kids Check. It is aimed at ensuring the early detection of particular risk factors and delayed development illnesses, vision and hearing problems. It will ensure that families are given appropriate guidance in relation to healthy lifestyles and early intervention strategies. We certainly know that evidence shows that such guidance is very important for lowincome families. We know that better education and guidance on issues such as these is critical in helping to break down patterns of disadvantage and in ensuring that more Australians are given an opportunity to participate in the economic and social life of our country. Parents will need to confirm with Centrelink that the health check for their particular child has been undertaken. Again, there are safeguards in the bill, and particular provisions which relate to exceptional circumstances, where it is possible for the new requirement to be waived where it is appropriate to do so. The third measure that the bill will implement is the strengthening of compliance in the child support system. It is another of the government's election commitments and it ensures that the current policy for child support assessments, which uses a default income figure, is updated to reflect, more appropriately, a parent's actual income. At present the child support assessment for a parent in these situations reflects the default of a figure equal to two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings. We know that this default figure very often understates the parent's actual income, with very significant impacts upon the levels of child support which are paid. The new process will generally use the parent's lastknown taxable income, indexed by the growth in average wages. But as a default, if the current process-using two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings-would have produced a higher income, that figure will be used instead. The bill is aimed at implementing a significant range of policy initiatives which provide for flexible payments to families and appropriate and very helpful health checks, which will go to assisting families with the health of their children prior to reaching school age and will ensure that children are afforded appropriate financial support through the child support system. There are a range of other measures that are included in the bill that are aimed at strengthening our system of welfare payments. They reflect our government's ongoing commitment to improving a system which provides support to families, support to those people in our society who require a safety net and the additional assistance of our government in terms of their finances. I am particularly pleased to be able to support these initiatives which were announced during the federal election and in the 201011 budget. I certainly commend the bill to the House. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (19:41): I rise to support the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 in principle. Its basic tenants are sound. I do, however, need to point out that there are major issues in relation to child support assessments, which we will come to shortly. In relation to the family tax benefit advance, we in this House must recognise that there are times when people simply have nothing. There are times when there is simply no money, nowhere to live and no food in the pantry. We must be there to support people in these predicaments, which more often than not are not of their making. There will be times when bonds need to be paid or there is an unexpected medical expense which cannot be covered. It is right that we extend this advance to people at such times as this. I will just add a tail to that by saying that we-I mean the staff at Centrelink et cetera-must be very clear, when people are availing themselves of this service, that the money will need to be repaid. That is where the arguments can start. We have all been assaulted by people complaining about the staff at Centrelink not telling them this or that. I know that in my office, when we consult with staff at government departments, invariably we hear that the process has been explained, and in great detail. It is just that when someone is desperate for money they listen to nothing except the 'sign here' part. I am proud of the level of service provided by Townsville Centrelink office and those officers dealing directly with people in need in my city. I have made the point previously that you never see anyone coming back to Centrelink saying, 'Thank you; my benefits were paid on time and they were exactly what you were promising.' The staff here often see people only when, in the clients' eyes, there is crises. This is where it gets tough for the staff. It is such a tense time for people on benefits. Most people do not want to be on them, and most people who need them are under the pump when they come into Centrelink. Half the time of an interview is taken up with getting the client to calm down so that the process can be explained. I would like to see continued training in customer service levels. We must move our public servants towards what everyone relates to as the MCDonald's service mentality, where every person is greeted with a level of enthusiasm. Customer service is at the heart of this. Too often-and we are all guilty of this-the next client pays for the attitude of the previous client. It does not matter if the previous client has sworn at them and called them names; it is not the fault of the next person in the queue. We must attract professionals and recognise that this role is vital in limiting conflict all the way down the street and even back to people's homes. The thing about debt is that once it starts to accumulate, especially where low income is concerned, there seems to be little or no chance of people getting back on top of it until someone eventually comes along and puts a stop to it. That is a very hard thing to do, but by far the biggest issue facing families and budgets is the issue of child support. I am sure that I speak for the majority of members in this House when I say that child support is the No. 1 issue where people go to see their local member as a last resort. Certainly it is the case in my electorate. The problem is that you could be seeing the ex-husband immediately before the ex-wife. They will tell their stories to best of their ability and there will not be a similar thread amongst them. Every family has one party being robbed blind while the other party sits at home spending the money on cigarettes and tattoos and not on the children. We all see them every week. I feel for them. I tell them they do not like the laws of speeding, which are black and white-no argument. If you are doing 101 kilometres per hour in a 100 zone you are speeding. The laws around child support and children in general are varying shades of grey. One side will say that the CSA is robbing them blind while the other will say that it is belting the ex up with a feather. The CSA cannot win no matter what happens, and the amendment to the legislation to determine taxable income when a tax return has not been lodged by using previous taxable income and indexing it will produce similar results to the mess we currently find ourselves in. The fight in which parents are engaged and the children at the centre of that fight can be about making the other side pay. It can be about power in the relationship. It can be about jealousy. It can even be about the children. I do not mean to be flippant about this, but, when you have someone sitting in your office with their children telling you just how bad the other parent is and colouring it quite significantly, it makes you wonder what they are saying at home. A constituent came to me who felt that he was trapped by a woman. He said that he barely knew her and she did not even know where he lived, and yet he is faced with the CSA taking his pay for a child he did not want and does not want to see, to a woman whose last name he did not even know. Still, there is a child involved. Using the last taxable income figure and indexing it is just too long a bow to draw. Circumstances change so much and this is the just not fair to anyone. I would question why people do not complete their tax returns, although I know there are a number of obvious reasons why they do not, but I do believe that the CSA should not be put in the position of making arbitrary decisions. Too often, the hands of the CSA are tied. I have a friend who left the matrimonial home. He is now 52 years old and has just signed a 25-year mortgage on a one-bedroom unit. His ex-wife sold the family home for over $1 million and has no debt. As each of their three children reached 18 you would think his payments would decrease, but his ex-wife successfully argued that he actually had more available cash and therefore could afford to pay more. Anyone who has a teenager knows that when they hit 18 you are only beginning to make the payments. Yet, as much as he argued the point, the decision was never changed. He always had to stump up more money. I always say that, when you are talking to parents who are divorced, there are three sides to the story: her side, his side and the truth. The problem with this amendment and the act in general is that they do not and cannot take into account every variable. What we in this House have to do is support the CSA with a framework around which they can work. I have been asked on a number of occasions by constituents to fully review the child support mechanisms as the level of discontent is just so great. Mind you, we must always keep in mind that no-one is beating a path to the door of their federal member to tell them that they feel they are paying the right amount of support and that the money is being used correctly. More's the pity. There has to be a place where people can go when the going gets too tough. The appeals process now leaves both sides angry and bewildered. There has to be a place where a couple, or their representativesalthough I would prefer it if legal representatives were not used-can go to discuss and conciliate a result in front of a panel of some sort. Even if you do come out with the same decision, at least you have been heard. What we are hearing now is that people are just not being heard. This story will, again, not be new to members. A couple have split. One or both have new partners and new children. The exwife has a new baby and therefore is not working at present. The ex-husband is told to pay more maintenance for his children, even though his ex-wife's partner, who knew about the children and walked into the relationship, is working in a high-paid job. The ex-husband has a new wife and a new child, but seemingly this does not matter; he just has to pay more. Who wins in this argument? I do not know the answer to that question, but I can tell who does not win-the children of the first marriage, who have done nothing wrong. Their expectation is to be housed, fed and educated by parents who love them. Unfortunately, the current method makes too many parents look at the children as pieces of property and millstones around the current domestic arrangements. For the sake of the children, there must be an appeal process where one party can go and explain their case and have it heard with empathy. For the sake of the Child Support Agency officers there must be an empathetic final tribunal where parents who feel they have been hard done by can have a say on their future and where all the facts are presented. I am the parent of three children whose ages range from nine to 18 years. I know first hand the costs involved in raising children and about the entire grey area that is family law. There is no section of law that has had more inspection, review and attempts at improvement. I support what we are trying to achieve here, but I just think we have to give parents a forum where they can feel they are being listened to. That is what it gets down to when you are a parent sitting in an electoral office with someone who has had a CSA problem. What they want is to feel that they have been listened to-that they have had a forum. We owe it to our people in the field, the CSA officers, to not make them the final front.",160
193,Ms ONEILL,BUSINESS," I rise to speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I support this bill because, as an Australian and a member of the Australian Labor Party, I deeply value the role that families in our society play. I have long you believed that if a government is one that supports families it will provide the necessary financial support for families who find themselves experiencing financial hardship. I firmly believe that you cannot state in this parliament that you support families unless you support comprehensive, efficient and effective family support. During my previous career as a teacher, I gained first hand experience of how financial hardship can devastate families. Indeed, as a member of parliament and through the experiences of my wonderful staff and the work that they do for our community, I know that we are often confronted with constituents who are experiencing financial hardship in their families. This bill succeeds in advancing the cause of alleviating financial hardship for just such families. The main provision in this bill that I support is the increased flexibility it provides for families seeking an advance on their family benefit payments. Such flexibility can ensure that unexpected costs can more easily be paid without relying on credit and thereby worsening the financial position of these families. Under this bill the maximum rate of advance payment would be linked to the family's rate of payment. Overall, a maximum amount of $1,000 will apply. The general maximum rate of payment that can be advanced under this bill is 7.5 per cent. Currently, the maximum advance amount is fixed at $324. This full amount can be advanced only twice a year, specifically on 1 July and 1 January. Sadly, that legal requirement and nicely organised program does not actually fit with the reality of people's lives. We need to consider that the reason that many families need to advance their benefits is that unexpected expenses may incur not on 1 July and 1 January. All families will on occasion experience unexpected costs, and I am sure that all members in this House have experienced this themselves. Such costs can relate to the breakdown of whitegoods in a house, a car needing to be repaired or urgent repairs needing to be made to a house. In fact, I am mindful of my own experience when, two days before Christmas and very shortly after the birth of our second child, our washing machine broke down. Gladly, we were employed and were able to pull the money together. But I can remember going shopping with my mother on that occasion for a washing machine and thinking that I would be very sensible and buy a cheaper version. My mother looked at me in disgust and said, 'Look at the size of your family and the ages of your children. You'd better figure out, darling, that all your washing days are ahead of you. You need to buy the right washing machine.' Those sorts of decisions which need to be made, and based on the guidance of those who have gone before us who can lead us in the right direction about how we sensibly can spend money, are going to be enabled by allowing flexibility for people who want to make good decisions in the interests of their family, just as I did on that occasion just a couple of days before Christmas. Similarly, we cannot forget that medical expenses are often unpredictable-in fact, they are always unpredictable-and that such expenses can have a devastating impact on family budgets. People do not and cannot plan their sicknesses. They do not organise sickness around peak earning times. Under this legislation, families that are receiving assistance from the Commonwealth will be able to request their entitlements in advance at any point of the year, as required. This allows for those less financially adaptable members of our society to manage the complex and challenging realities of living. This provision will enable the advances that they need when they are required, and it is a vast improvement on the previous, inflexible system where advances were available only twice a year. Whilst enabling advances to be made, the previous system was limited in its effectiveness because the advances were not in tune with the needs of real people and real living. This legislation accepts that flexibility is a critical factor in determining the success of such a program, allowing advances that can then be repaid through adjustments via ongoing fortnightly entitlements. The bill provides families with an additional choice and additional ownership of their own financial futures by allowing them to manage their family budget. Importantly, this bill represents a much needed alternative to the option that currently exists where families that might be disadvantaged are required to rely on credit cards or, even worse, extremely high-interest small loans when unexpected costs arise. This bill also provides a much needed alternative to simply having to make do without an important family requirement when confronted with an unexpected cost. The assistance with financial literacy that this measure offers is also evident. Importantly, a safeguard will be provided in that Centrelink will not approve an additional advance payment if it is clear it would result in financial hardship. I am proud to support this reform because it represents this government's strong and proud record in sensible and practical reforms to the welfare system. This flies in the face of general criticisms of those opposite that this government has not succeeded with a reform agenda nor achieved positive economic and welfare reform. Additionally, it flies in the face of criticisms that reform cannot occur in this parliament. As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Leader of the House, put on record last Thursday, 26 May, as of 1.30 pm last Thursday the Gillard government has passed 112 pieces of legislation through this House in eight months. This compares with the 108 bills passed in the first 12 months of the Howard government. Apart from productivity and efficiency, this legislation reveals other Labor government commitments. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Murphy): Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34.

The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. Question agreed to, Mr Bandt and Mr Wilkie dissenting. Bill read a second time. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Youth Allowance  Opposition Business) (20:06): It is kind of so many of my colleagues to come into the (Mr House to listen to this debate tonight on the youth allowance. They have had many opportunities to be part of debates on the youth allowance, and it is nice that they are now finally taking the youth allowance issue seriously and coming into the parliament in such large numbers in order to find out why they should support the coalition's motion to extend the eligibility requirements for youth allowance for young people in inner regional Australia. I move: That this House: (1) notes that the Government has: (a) admitted there is a problem with the criteria for independent youth allowance for inner regional students; (b) committed to bringing forward its review of the matter with the broad purpose of finding a permanent solution to address the disadvantages that currently exist rural and regional students in qualifying for financial assistance; and (c) indicated it will remove the difference between the inner regional areas and the other regional zones for the eligibility criteria for independent youth allowance; and (2) calls on the Government to bring forward its timetable for resolving the matter, and in particular ensure that: (a) the review is completed and funds to pay for the measure are secured by l July 2011; (b) the current eligibility criteria for independent youth allowance for persons whose homes are located in Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia, and Very Remote Australia according to the Remoteness Structure defined subsection 1067A(10F) of the Social Security Act 1991 also apply to those homes in Inner Regional Australia from 1 July 2011; and (c) all students who had a gap year in 2010 (ie, 2009 Year 12 school leavers) and who meet the relevant criteria qualify for the payment. This is the fifth opportunity the parliament will have had since the last election to vote in favour of inner regional students. On 28 October last year the House dealt with a youth allowance motion, which was moved by the member for Forrest and seconded by the member for Gippsland, that would have placed inner regional students in the same boat as students from other parts of regional and rural Australia so they could qualify for the youth allowance under a criteria that was more readily available to regional students than the one that has been implemented by the government. That motion was supported by the crossbenchers and passed in October last year. The government took it as an indication from the parliament of the need to ensure that rural and remote students were for fairly treated but did not act on the motion and in fact has kept the discrimination against inner regional students in place through to the present time, creating a cohort of students who are incapable of being eligible for the independent rate of youth allowance under the old criteria in spite of the fact that the government has admitted that those students are disadvantaged because they are in inner regional Australia and that this should be addressed. The government has demonstrated its acceptance that this arrangement is discriminatory by announcing a review of the criteria for the independent rate of youth allowance for inner regional Australia that will apply from 1 January 2012 to report by July this year. The only problem with that in policy solution is that it creates three cohorts of students. It creates a cohort of students with from before 2010 who could apply under the old rules. It creates a cohort of students who can apply under the new rules in three parts of rural and remote Australia and it creates a third cohort of students-those who graduated in 2009 from year 12, who are ineligible to apply for the independent rate youth of allowance under criteria which are fair to them as regional students who are disadvantaged in terms of their access to tertiary education, which has not been taken into account by the government. There have been three other occasions when the House has been called to vote on introducing fairness criteria for inner regional students. On 21 February this year the House dealt with a bill that was passed by the Senate after being sponsored by Senator Fiona Nash from New South Wales. It would have put inner regional students on the same footing as other regional students. That bill was passed by the Senate and defeated inexplicably by the crossbenches in the House of Representatives on 21 February. Again, I moved in this House an amendment, which was dealt with on 3 March, to an amendment that had been moved by the member for Goldstein to the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-11 that would equally have placed inner regional students in a position where they were on the same footing as other rural and regional students. Inexplicably again crossbenchers defeated that motion on the basis that they had done a deal with the government which would see a review of the youth allowance criteria for inner regional students and would give those students the opportunity to be placed in a fairer position than they are now. The flaw in that deal, the very substantial hole in the heart of that deal, is that it only required the government to report by July 2011 on how it would address the unfairness that is now endemic in the system, with the changes, if any, applying from 1 January 2012. Senator Evans in estimates indicated that there should be no expectation at all that the criteria would be changed. So the crossbenchers were sold a pup, a pup that they purchased at the expense of inner regional students. Mr Tony Smith: It was a mutt.  member for Casey is right. The crossbenchers, I am sure in good faith, accepted this deal only to be sold down the river by Senator Evans and the Prime Minister, because the government is not intending to act until at least 1 January 2012, and even then Senator Evans has indicated there may be no change to the eligibility criteria. So again, on 23 March, an amendment was moved by the member for Menzies to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 that again placed inner regional students in the same position as all other regional students, and again the crossbenchers defeated that resolution. The question leaps to mind: why would the coalition return a fifth time to move this motion. It does seem unprecedented that we would return with a fifth motion or amendment in order to place inner regional the students in the same boat as all other regional students. We return with this motion because the unfairness the government has created in terms of eligibility for the independent rate of youth allowance is causing real hardship to rural families at a time when they can least afford it, at a time when cost-of-living pressures are rising well in excess of the official inflation rates. Every family knows that the official inflation rates bear no resemblance at all at the current time to the cost pressures that families are facing, whether they are school fees, electricity bills, food and grocery prices or the daily requirements of living. Those cost-of-living pressures are greater today than at any time in the 18 years that I have been a member of the House of Representatives. But at this really difficult time in families' lives the government has acted to create hardship for inner regional students who are clearly incapable of finding the 30 hours of work a week needed to qualify for the independent rate of youth allowance under the government's changes. They found it hard enough to qualify when the criterion was 15 hours, but finding 30 hours work is beyond the capacity of students in inner regional Australia. However, that is what is required by a government that is out of touch and far too focused on getting its carbon tax, its mining tax and its flood levy through the parliament. It has forgotten the daily needs of Australians from across regional and rural Australia who cannot go to university unless they get this vital support from government. I commend the motion to the House. Ms Marino: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",167
196,Ms OWENS,BUSINESS," The member for Sturt said that perhaps the government is not focused. I say that we are focused on outcomes. If you listen to the member for Sturt you might think there had not been any outcomes as a result of the reforms of student allowances introduced by this government, but in fact there have. The number of enrolments in regional areas has increased since the introduction of these reforms, and many more students across the country have had access to student allowance than would have prior to these reforms. I will talk about the reforms in general for a few minutes. In March 2010, the government introduced comprehensive reforms to ensure that, across Australia, more university students would have fairer access to student income support. The changes to the youth allowance eligibility criteria aimed to ensure a fairer and more equitable allocation of resources to provide support for the students who most needed assistance. The legislation giving effect to these reforms was supported by the coalition. The reform package ultimately directed more support to students from low-income families who were genuinely in need of financial assistance. Prior to the reforms, the parental income test was just $33,300. The Bradley review found that 18 per cent of students who were living at home and receiving youth allowance through having been considered independent were from families with incomes above $150,000, 10 per cent were from families with incomes above $200,000 and three per cent were from families with incomes above $300,000. Accordingly, the review recommended the tightening of the workforce participation criteria. We did that and, at the same time, increased the number of eligible students by increasing the parental income test from $33,300 to $44,000. That is not all we did. We also began reducing the age of independence for full-time students receiving youth allowance. The implementation was phased so that the age of independence was reduced to 24 years from 1 April last year, 23 years from 1 January this year and 22 years from 1 January 2012. With effect from 1 April 2010, all university students receiving student income support have also been entitled to a start-up scholarship for each year of their course. The scholarship provides essential assistance to university students for the high up-front cost of textbooks and specialised equipment. We also introduced a relocation scholarship. With effect from April 2010, all dependent university students receiving student income support who need to relocate to study receive a relocation scholarship. The scholarship will assist students with the high cost of establishing accommodation. This scholarship is also indexed. In 2011, it is valued at $4,124. I am particularly pleased to say that, from 1 January 2012, students enrolled in all masters by coursework programs will also be eligible to apply for student income support. This is an excellent incentive for more mature people to upskill. From 1 July 2012, the personal income threshold will rise from $236 per fortnight to $400 per fortnight. Students receiving support will be able to earn up to $400 per fortnight without having their payments reduced. The student income bank will also increase from $6,000 to $10,000. All of these changes significantly improve the capacity of students, particularly those from low-income areas, to access a university education. We have already seen, in the last year, the number of students disadvantaged households enrolled in universities increase by eight per cent-a substantial improvement over past years. There are 793 people who live in Parramatta who are now receiving youth allowance because of this government's changes to the youth allowance arrangements-that is out of a total of 3,517 receiving student income. This is a very good result for the people of my electorate. Parramatta has the 51st highest number of new youth allowance recipients across the country, and I am very pleased to be a member of the government which has delivered this benefit to people in my electorate. I am also delighted to say that Parramatta ranks very highly for numbers of start-up scholarships. We are in the top quarter in that list, and we rank about halfway on the list of areas where people have received relocation assistance. Of course, we are blessed with an excellent university campus in the Parramatta region. Many students also receive relocation grants to attend that university, and they are of course extremely welcome in Parramatta. We will reap the rewards of this key investment in years to come. Unlike the coalition, who could have invested the proceeds of the mining boom mark 1 in education but chose not to, this government knows the value of investment in education and training and the value of supporting young people as they work hard to better themselves. We are already seeing the effects of the changes flow through our communities. Labor's landmark reforms to youth allowance give more students the opportunity to go to university by targeting financial assistance to those with the greatest need. Just 12 months on, you can see significant flow-on benefits. Students who need support are receiving it, from and hundreds of students are becoming the first members of their families to attend university. In just 12 months the number of dependent students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving the maximum youth allowance payment has increased by 108 per cent, and the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent. I should point out that under the coalition government the proportion fell but it has increased in the last year by 22 per cent. There has been a 15 per cent increase in the total number of university students receiving youth allowance; this is effectively an increase of 21,000 university students. New scholarships have also been hugely successful over the past year. There have been 240,000 university students who have received a Student Start-Up Scholarship and more than 55,000 of those are from rural and regional areas. More than 36,000 university students who need to move away from home to study have received the Relocation Scholarship and 15,000 of those are from rural and regional areas. More than 107,000 young people have already benefited from our changes because they are either eligible for youth allowance for the first time or they are receiving more money than before, and more than 36,000 of those are from rural and regional areas. These figures show that after only 12 months the government's reforms have already resulted in a fairer and more equitable targeting of youth allowance payments. More than 18,000 students have achieved independence since 1 April 2010 as a result of the age of independence being lowered from 25 to 23, and 2,800 of those students are from rural and regional areas. From 1 July 2012 students will be allowed to earn more money through part-time work before their payments are affected when the personal income test threshold increases to $400 per fortnight. During the coalition's time in office the story was quite different. The participation rates of young people from regional areas declined. Regional participation rates fell from 18.7 percent to about 18.1 percent. Under this Labor government that number is tracking back up again. The government's recent reforms to student income support have significantly improved the financial assistance to students from low socio-economic backgrounds, including regional students. The government is responding positively to concerns about the current eligibility arrangements for youth allowance. The current arrangements for youth allowance were determined following an agreement between the government and the coalition in March last year. The government is committed to removing eligibility distinctions between inner regional and outer regional students by 1 January 2012. To facilitate this the government has brought forward a legislated comprehensive review of student income support with a particular focus on the capacity of rural and regional students to access higher education. The review is headed by an independent chair, Professor Kwong Lee Dow, and will report by 1 July this year. Options for implementing new eligibility arrangements are being considered as part of the review. The review is also considering appropriate savings that can be made to pay for extensions in eligibility for youth allowance. Following the review, the government will implement new eligibility arrangements for youth allowance to remove eligibility distinctions by 1 January 2012. I am particularly proud to talk about our achievements in reforming student allowances. They have made a significant difference in my electorate and clearly they have made significant improvements in regional and rural areas as well.",170
197,Ms MARINO,BUSINESS," I strongly support this motion moved by the member for Sturt because many families and students in my electorate have been unfairly discriminated against by the changes to youth allowance. In 2009 the Prime Minister decided to make the changes and she effectively chose winners and losers-and my students were the losers. The Prime Minister drew arbitrary lines on a map and inflicted stricter rules on those classified as inner regional compared to those classified as outer regional for the purpose of applying for independent youth allowance. So students have been, and still are, in limbo-that is what we have. We continue to hear dreadful examples of how this is affecting those in regional and rural areas like my own. For example, I know of two students who go to the same school, travel on the same bus and live just kilometres away from each other, yet one of the students is able to have a single gap year and the other has to work for 30 hours a week for 18 months and take two years away from study just to qualify for youth allowance support. I know that young people are choosing alternative pathways in year 11 and 12 already because they know their families cannot afford to send them to tertiary education and the government has not given them confidence. I know this because I talk to the mums and dads who are sometimes working two jobs each to try to afford their children's higher education or training at a time of significantly increased costs of living. I understand the discrimination these changes have brought to students and families in regional and rural areas. We on this side have introduced motions and legislation aimed at putting fairness back into the criteria for independent youth allowance, but the Labor government has voted against fairness and equity for regional and rural students every single time. We have provided a voice on behalf of every student in Australia whose higher education is being so badly affected by the Labor government's changes to accessing youth allowance. The Prime Minister recently released a media statement that claimed more people are receiving youth allowance support than ever before, according to new figures. She claimed success there, but how many of the additional students come from inner regional areas? Where is the breakdown of where these additional students are coming from? Unfortunately, the Labor government will go to any lengths and use all forms of spin to hide the truth that my students and their families are currently living with. This uncertainty is just dreadful. The truth is that students in inner regional areas are still penalised by this government because of where they live and the Prime Minister continues to ignore their plight. They cannot find 30 hours of work in regional and rural areas because of seasonal work or a lack of work, or they cannot get access because of their age. I look forward to Senator Nash asking a range of questions during Senate estimates this week. The Labor government shows very little interest or understanding when dealing with the issues facing regional and rural residents. This was demonstrated to me when one parent recently contacted me. During this youth allowance debacle, on Wednesday, 17 June 2009, she sent the Prime Minister an email. She explained how these changes to youth allowance were affecting her family. To her surprise and disgust, it took until Friday, 6 May 2011 for her to see a brand new 'read receipt' email from her message. You might think I have mixed up the dates, but unfortunately it did take the Prime Minister-or her officenearly two years to even read my constituent's email. And that was not the only time. Unfortunately, it reinforces the message that the Prime Minister views students and families with contempt. I am appalled and hurt for my constituents. This has been going on for too long. It is a very serious matter, and I condemn the Prime Minister for her treatment of people who are seeking the best educational and training opportunities for their families. What it has done to some of these people is just appalling. I want to thank every family that came along to the hearings that Professor Kwong Lee Dow conducted in my electorate. They gave heartfelt and very genuine explanations of what it has done to their families, and I thank them for their contributions. I call on the government to support this motion by the member for Sturt and bring being forward the timetable for resolving this matter. It is so important to the decision making of young people and their families. Are they going to qualify this year? Will they be able to qualify next year? The young people who are in limbo deserve certainty and they need to be able to plan for their futures. This form of discrimination should not be allowed to continue.",172
198,Mr ZAPPIA,BUSINESS," This motion by the member for Sturt, on the criteria for independent youth allowance, is nothing more than a pretentious attempt to show concern for university students. I make this single point: if he were truly concerned for university students he would have opposed the Work Choices legislation that the previous government, of which he was a member, introduced into this place. Most university students I know work part time. They do jobs that most other people would not do. They do not get paid terribly highly, yet it was them and people in similar employment positions who would have been most affected by the Work Choices legislation. In fact, they would have been much worse off because of it. They were the ones who were going to lose all their rights. Let me also make it very clear that Labor believes the opportunity of high-quality education should be available to all students regardless of their background or where they live. The changes made to youth allowance payments in April 2010 were made to give more students the chance to go to university. They targeted those students most in need of assistance. Since those changes were made more than 100,000 young people have benefited because they are eligible for youth allowance for the first time or they are receiving more money than before. More than one-third of these young people are from rural and regional areas. If this motion is designed to address a problem for students in regional areas, it ignores last week's announcement that the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent since changes to youth allowance payments were introduced. Hundreds of students are becoming the first members of their families to attend university. The new scholarship programs that were introduced have also been hugely successful over the past year in helping students overcome some of the costs that come with attending university. More than 240,000 university students have received student start-up scholarships towards their education costs. More than 55,000 are from rural and regional areas. More than 36,000 university students who need to move away from home to study have received relocation scholarship payments towards their accommodation costs. More than 15,000 are from rural and regional areas. These changes have been positive not only for those living in rural and regional areas but also for those in my own electorate of Makin. For example, 841 young people in my electorate benefited from changes to the parental income test and now receive youth allowance. Since 1 April 2010, all university students receiving student income support have been entitled to a student start-up scholarship, providing essential assistance to university students for the high up-front costs of textbooks for each year of their course. In my electorate of Makin, 1,382 young people have benefited from these changes. The member for Sturt may be delighted to know that over 2,000 residents of the Sturt electorate have received the student start-up scholarships since 1 April 2010. I question whether the shadow minister would roll back the changes made in April 2010 if he were in government, thus denying thousands of young people in his electorate critical assistance. Since April 2010, all dependent university students receiving student income support who need to relocate to study receive a relocation scholarship valued at over $4,000 for the first year and over $1,000 for subsequent years of their course. To this point, 140 young people from Makin have been paid a relocation scholarship. I understand that in the Sturt electorate 214 young people would not have benefited from more the scholarship had Labor not been in government. All in all, some 2,584 people in Makin receive youth allowance, and I understand that the figure in the electorate of Sturt is very similar. I will finish on this point: earlier this year we debated the student amenities legislation in this place. Again, I recall that the highest beneficiaries of student amenities at universities are young people from rural and regional areas. I also recall that it was the member for Sturt and his party who opposed that legislation every step of the way. If he were truly concerned about the welfare of students from rural and regional areas going to university he would have supported that legislation, but he did not-which again highlights that the motion he has brought before the House tonight is nothing but a stunt.",173
199,Mr SECKER,BUSINESS," I rise tonight to speak on this motion on behalf of all students in my electorate who are being unfairly discriminated against by this government. This is the government's fifth chance to change the criteria for youth allowance so that all students have a fair chance of furthering their education. The coalition has been pushing for the government to make the criteria fairer for inner regional students because the maps currently used are ridiculous and do not reflect the difficulties students from some areas have in getting to university. I note the member for Makin's comments, where he suggested we are ignoring the government's announcement last week about the increased numbers going to university. We actually do not have a problem with that; we support that. But there is still this problem, and what we are trying to do is address the problem caused by the criteria for the so-called inner regional students. To understand this, in South Australia we actually have the perfect example: Mount Gambier. Mount Gambier is about 450 kilometres away from Melbourne or Adelaide universities. So it is a long way, and there is no way they can actually go to university every day from home. Under the old criteria they had the opportunity of getting youth allowance if they were away from the workforce for 1½ years. But what we now have is that, in Mount Gambier, if you live in the city, 450 kilometres away from Adelaide or Melbourne, you are treated like a student in Adelaide or Melbourne, but if you live outside the town boundaries, you are treated as you were under the old Howard government conditions. So you have this stupid decision, which is based not on educational criteria but medical criteria relating to the availability of doctors-and, as a result of that, being in a city area like Mount Gambier, a reasonable sized city of about 23,000-24,000 people, you are treated differently. Of course, if you have doctors operating from within the city of Mount Gambier, people from outside the boundary can go to those doctors; it does not really affect them. It is really only about the funding that goes to doctors in that metropolitan area of Mount Gambier. But in this situation, they have used those criteria to have two different standards of students. So, if you live inside the town, you are treated like someone who lives in Adelaide or Melbourne, but if you live outside the town limits, that line on the road, you are treated differently. This is obviously a stupid situation, based on criteria which are not related to education. So all we are trying to do is point out to the government, for the fifth time, that they do not get it, they do not understand that people in Mount Gambier are obviously very angry, on the basis that they are treated differently from those who live outside the township. And if you understood Mount Gambier at all you would know that outside the town boundaries is still part of the urban area, which is the District Council of Grant. So we have these two classes of students. Inner regional students are currently forced to find 30 hours of work. Anyone who has any idea about regional communities would know that this is very difficult. I have received a huge amount of letters, calls and emails from concerned students and parents, over the length of this debate, because this a genuine problem that needs to be fixed. As a representative of a large rural electorate, where parents are faced with huge costs to fund their children's university studies hundreds of kilometres away, I remain extremely concerned by the government's arrogant dismissal of the very sincere problems caused by the changes to the support arrangements for rural and regional students. This is an opportunity for the government to stop the inequity and get it fixed. (Time expired)",175
200,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BUSINESS, What we have with this motion tonight is a repetition of several stunts by those opposite,176
201,Mr Secker,BUSINESS,It's not a stunt; that's outrageous!,176
202,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,BUSINESS,"Thank you; you have had your four-pence worth. It is a stunt to raise an issue which this government is now, and has been for some time, taking on board. I do not deny the difficulty with the inner and outer regional classifications. The member for Barker and others here know that I have been critical of that for some time and remain so-and, with them and others in here, on my own side as well, saw to it that we had a review, and that is what we are indeed doing. So let us get the facts on the table for a start. We are having a review led by Professor Kwong Lee Dow, who has been going around regional and rural Australia taking evidence, and we have a commitment to do something about it, to remove the inequity in terms of eligibility distinctions that the member for Barker pointed out and which exists in my electorate. So I recognise that. But, you see, we are dealing with this motion, which is in effect purely and simply rehashing an argument. And nowhere-apart from in the contribution of the member for is Barker, to be fair to him-does it recognise the fantastic record that this government is now able to make some claim to in getting more students to university, and most especially more students from rural and regional Australia. I am glad the member for Barker was at least reasonable in making that case, because it was not the case with the member for Sturt or any other speaker that I heard from the other side. I think it is important, therefore, to restate that case: many more families and students are eligible for support to go to university now than ever before-and that is a tremendous thing. We know that the reforms are striking a chord with students, particularly students with disadvantaged backgrounds. Indeed, the number of students receiving the maximum youth allowance-now, listen to this-has increased by 108 per cent. In anybody's terms, that is a policy that is working. It is doing what it is intended to do and on the grounds of equity, notwithstanding some of those anomalies have been raised both over here and by those on the other side. Importantly, the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent. So, we have those on the other side telling us about the hard-luck stories, and I am not sure how they go about quantifying those, but there are many more good-luck stories because of this support scheme. There has been a 15 per cent increase in the total number of university students receiving youth allowance, so the scholarship program has also added to this and been highly successful. For example, more than 240,000 university students have received Start-Up scholarships towards their education costs, and more than 55,000 of the 240,000 are from rural and regional areas. Also, more than 36,000 university students who need to move away from home to study have received relocation scholarship payments towards their accommodation costs. That is more than 15,000 who are from rural and regional areas. So, yes, there are some anomalies, but by far the greatest percentage of rural and regional students and their families benefit from this fantastic reform program. More than 170,000 young people have already benefited from our changes, because they are either eligible for youth allowance for the first time or they are receiving more money than before. More than 36,000 of these young people are from rural and regional Australia. We have changed the parental income test, we have lowered the age of independence, and, when the personal income test threshold increases from $236 to $400 per fortnight from 1 July 2012, students will be allowed to earn more money through part-time work before their payments are affected. There are anomalies, but there are fantastic stories as a result of this legislation. (Time expired)",176
203,Mr CHESTER,BUSINESS," In joining the debate I want to pay tribute in particular to the regional MPs on this side of the House, who have pursued the issue of student income support with such vigour over the past three years. I want to thank the shadow minister for education for his tireless pursuit of this on behalf of regional students and I also thank Senator Fiona Nash, who has been a great champion in the other place for regional students. I also recognise the members for Forrest and Barker, who have already spoken here tonight. I also thank every regional MP on this side of the House who has been prepared to stand up for rural and regional Australian students. If the time was not so limited for this debate tonight I am sure there would be a line-up at the door of regional MPs, like the member for Dawson, who is in this place, and Deputy Speaker Scott, the member for Maranoa, and my good friend the member for Wannon, who I know is very passionate about getting a fair go for students in his electorate. That is the bottom line in this debate. It is about getting a fair go and abolishing the discriminatory system that was introduced by this Prime Minister when she was the Minister for Education. The motion specifically refers to the issue of independent youth allowance. I take up the comments from the member for Braddon, when he described this motion as a stunt. He knows it is not a stunt, because he knows there is a problem with the independent youth allowance system and these discriminatory boundaries, these lines on a map, between inner regional and outer regional. I also take up his comments in relation to the income thresholds for dependent youth allowance. No-one on this side that I am aware of has had a problem with the revised income thresholds. We are specifically talking about the independent youth allowance and the inner regional and outer regional boundaries. This is Prime Minister Julia Gillard's mess. From the day the former education minister started amending the system of student income support, she talked big and she delivered a mess. Even the government has admitted that the system of discriminating against students, with definitions of 'inner regional' and 'outer regional' for the purpose of calculating the independent youth allowance, is a complete mess. We have these ridiculous lines on a map, which other members have already spoken about here tonight. The workforce criterion for achieving independent youth allowance in inner regional areas of 30 hours per week over a two-year period is almost impossible in many parts of regional Australia and completely impossible in all the rest. It is a very difficult criterion for students in small regional towns to meet. The other problem we have, and the reason this motion is so important, is that the students from the 2009 and 2010 academic years will be treated inconsistently compared to their brothers and sisters or cousins from other towns who may have gone through year 12 at a previous time. So we have students from different years being treated inconsistently with their cohorts. This motion gives the government a clear way forward. This government is always complaining that the opposition is too negative. Well, we are putting forward a positive solution here tonight to remove the discriminatory criteria by 1 July this year and to start fixing the mess. Many on this side of the House understand the problems with the current system of student income support and the impact it has on regional students. Some on the other side, including the member for Braddon, claimed to also understand the issues, which left me wondering why this government refused to act. Then it dawned on me. Regional Australia does not have a voice in the Gillard government cabinet. It is the most citycentric ministerial list you will ever see. I invite anyone to have a look. The minister for regional development, the member for Hotham, has his electorate office in Clayton. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, a Queensland senator, has his electorate office in Brisbane. The Minister for Resources and Energy, the member for Batman, has his office in Preston. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Grayndler, has his office in Marrickville. I could go on, but the bottom line is that none of the senior ministers with carriage of issues that are critical to the future of rural and regional Australia actually lives in regional Australia. The minister for tertiary education is a senator for Western Australia, whose electorate office is in Perth. These people simply do not understand the cost barriers faced by regional families in sending their children to university. They do not live and work in regional communities and they do not understand the hopes and aspirations of regional families. It is an absolute disgrace that we would have such a city-centric cabinet table that fails to stand up for the interests of regional people. Finally, let me quote from someone who does get it, a concerned parent, Mr Rob Oliver from Sale, who made a submission to the government's current review. He submitted the following in a letter: In summary the outcome of your review needs to be immediate action to fix this mess and give all regional students the same access to independent youth allowance. The entire community does not want to hear hollow rhetoric about an education revolution when the government's own actions with respect to youth allowance are inhibiting the education of our country students. That says it all. This government cannot keep hiding behind its slogan of 'the education revolution'. It has to deliver a fairer deal for regional families. It has to fix the mess that Julia Gillard created.",177
204,Ms BRODTMANN,BUSINESS," I rise tonight to speak on the independent youth allowance, with a sense of irony. Irony, because it comes from the side of politics that for over a decade ignored calls to reform the youth allowance system. It ignored pleas from students, especially rural students. It ignored pleas from welfare peak bodies. It ignored calls from the education sector. In fact, it is the side of politics that ignored calls from just about everyone to improve access to youth allowance to make sure young Australians could get access to this vital payment. Those opposite had 10 years to invest wisely the fruits of the resources boom and to share the bounty of the nation with the nation. Those opposite had 10 years to invest in the skills and education of the future, but they failed to do so. Those opposite had 10 years to make substantive reform to the youth allowance system to improve access and outcomes, but they failed to do so-a failure that saw regional participation rates not just stagnate, but fall. So it is with a strong sense of irony that I rise to speak on this motion. In fact, I think it goes a bit beyond irony. It strains bounds of credibility that those opposite would now seek to become the champions of access to education by all Australians, especially when we consider that, at the last election, they campaigned on a platform of cutting $1 billion from the trades training program. This policy would have seen over 1.2 million students from over 1,000 secondary schools miss out on the opportunity to engage in education pathways to become the next generation of electricians, bricklayers, hairdressers, chefs, plumbers and carpenters. And now those opposite have the audacity to continue to rail against this government's Building the Education Revolution, a program that in my electorate has seen new libraries and classrooms built and upgrades to essential infrastructure. So I find myself straining to believe that they are genuine about education and improving access and outcomes in education. However, for tonight, I will take it at face value because, as the saying goes, it is better late than never. The historic reforms that this government has made to youth allowance has seen thousands of students from across the country, including regional students, gain access to opportunities which were unknown prior to the election of this government. The figures speak, and they are astounding. After just 12 months an extra 21,000 students are receiving youth allowance-a 15 per cent increase. There has been a 22 per cent increase in the number of regional students receiving youth allowance and there has been a staggering 108 per cent increase in the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving youth allowance. Let me just say that again. There has been a 108 percent increase in the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving youth allowance. Our changes to youth allowance are a the success. In just over three years Labor has dramatically increased the number of young people receiving support to gain an education. Unlike those opposite, who ignored for a decade the calls to improve the system, we are prepared to listen. We are not resting on our laurels. We are a government of reform and we are always looking for ways to improve. So I will not stand here and say that the task of improving educational opportunities is finished. We are prepared to listen, learn and constantly improve because we on this side are genuinely and deeply committed to education for all Australians. That is why we have brought forward the review into youth allowance, with a focus on the capacity of rural and regional students to access higher education. This review will consider options for new eligibility arrangements and appropriate savings that can be made to pay for any change to the system. It will report on 1 July this year. This government is committed to education. It is committed to ensuring that every Australian can benefit from the opportunities that exist now and in the future. That is why we invested in the Building the Education Revolution program; that is why we are investing in skills and education; that is why we made historic reforms to youth allowance; and that is why we will continue to make reforms into the future.",178
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Death Penalty,180
206,Mr MELHAM,BUSINESS," I move: That this House: (1) notes the release on 28 March 2011 of an Amnesty International report entitled Death Sentences and Executions 2010 and that: (a) over the last 10 years, 31 countries have abolished the death sentence in practice or in law; and (b) in December 2010: (i) the United Nations General Assembly adopted its third resolution on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty; and (ii) 23 countries had carried out executions in 2010 compared to 19 countries in 2009; and (2) recommits to its bi-partisan condemnation of the death penalty across the world. I have always opposed the death penalty. It is ineffective as a deterrent and it is ethically wrong. Amnesty International released its latest report, Death Sentences and Executions 2010, on 28 March 2011. Since 1977 Amnesty's work in relation to the universal abolition of the death penalty has expanded. Over 30 years later, from the original 16 countries, the number of countries which have abolished it now 139. That is in no small measure due to the work of Amnesty International. When the United Nations General Assembly adopted its third resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty in December 2010, there were more countries supporting the resolution than ever before139 voted for it, 41 voted against it and there were 35 abstentions. It is those countries that voted against the resolution, and those who abstained, that we must continue to lobby, as appropriate, to abolish this inhumane practice. According to the report at least 23 countries are known to have carried out judicial executions in 2010 and there were at least 527 known executions. While several countries do make their figures known, it is difficult to establish the exact figures as these are regarded as 'state secrets'. At least 2,024 new death sentences were known to have been imposed in 67 countries in 2010. On the figures available to Amnesty there were at least 17,833 people under sentence of death. Of those countries which retain the death penalty, the explanation provided is that it is only used for the most serious of crimes. Of course, that is a matter of definition based on the culture and history of those countries. For example, we are all aware that some countries impose the death sentence for drug offences which in other countries carry a sentence of imprisonment. In some cases the imposition of the death penalty is mandatory for such offences. Other countries impose the death sentence for sexual relations between consenting adults, homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery and prostitution. Other countries use this penalty to silence dissent and political opposition. Of course, another aspect of this barbaric practice is the lack of due process in the judicial proceedings leading to the imposition of the death penalty in some countries. The Amnesty report provides examples of little or no fairness in the courts prior to sentence, including confessions extracted under torture. There is a clear prohibition in international law on the use of the death penalty against juveniles, yet Amnesty has documented cases in which people under 18 years of age have been sentenced to death. I particularly noticed in the report, in Annex II, the list of abolitionist and retentionist countries as at 31 December 2010. Australia is, of course, amongst the two-thirds of the world that has abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. It is very satisfactory that it was the Labor government which introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill, which effectively extends the prohibition of the death penalty in Australia to every state and territory and ensures that it cannot be reintroduced. It matter of great pride that this legislation supported by all parties of the parliament. I call on the House to recommit to the bipartisan condemnation of the death penalty and ask that we all continue to work to ensure its abolition across the world. It is worth reiterating past experiences in England to elaborate the point that we are making here this evening. We can all remember the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven in England. Those people were convicted in each of the cases and, if the death penalty had been in operation in the United Kingdom at that time, would have been subject to the death penalty. It took many years of agitation on behalf of their supporters, in terms of inquiries that took place, to eventually establish the fact that in a number of cases police had lied and those lies had led to the conviction of people. Their convictions were found to be unsafe and unsatisfactory. If the death penalty had been in existence, many of those people would have been executed, not released many years later. For various reasons, mistakes are made. In one of those cases there was a misdiagnosis in relation to the use of soap and the use of powder to do with bombs. (Time expired)",180
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded?,181
208,Mr Lyons,BUSINESS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,181
209,Mr CIOBO,BUSINESS," I am certainly pleased to rise in support of the motion that was moved by the member for Banks this evening. It occurs to me that last evening on the Gold Coast a police officer, in the line of duty, was unfortunately shot in the head by an armed robber. That police officer still fights for his life in hospital as we speak. My mind turns to another heinous crime. In 1965, during an escape from is a Pentridge prison, a prison officer, George was Hodson, who was 41, was shot dead by Ronald Ryan. Ronald Ryan was the last person executed in Australia under the death penalty. In both of those instances, the one last evening and in the case of the last person executed in Australia, a heinous crime was committed-a crime which many in the community would feel justified the use of the death penalty. The reality is, though, that even in 1965 and in the subsequent years that led to that final execution, there was, from deep within the Australian psyche, a well of public sentiment that said that we do not believe that the death penalty is the right way to punish people, even when someone commits the most heinous crime. In many respects, the central thrust of the Amnesty International report is that its work against the death penalty flows from the belief that the death penalty is cruel, inhuman, degrading and an affront to the right of life. When I read those words I reflected on the fact that, in many respects, it is that exact concern that for many in the community would spur their desire to see people executed. That really reinforces to me the fundamental hypocrisy about the death penalty. I believe that in society, whether it is in the nation of Australia or with people globally, there is the recognition that engaging in that kind of conduct-be it state sanctioned, negligence or recklessness by criminals-is of the same colour and of the same ilk. In that respect, I am certainly pleased to support in this chamber the motion that we remain steadfastly opposed to the death penalty. It is not because I believe that the rights of those punished should be lifted to the same level as those of the victims but rather because the way in which the death penalty demeans all of us causes me primary concern. In that respect, I applaud the work of Amnesty International in publishing this report. Amnesty International has seen, since it first commenced campaigning for the abolition of the death penalty in 1977, growth from 16 countries abolishing capital punishment to 139 countries abolishing the death penalty in law or in practice. The reality is that, of course, there is still work to be done. I would hope that those in the chamber this evening and those who support this particular motion, as well as those abroad who are with us in spirit on this motion, recognise that the ultimate goal is the abolition of the death penalty across the world. There are still some 58 countries that are classified as retentionist and far fewer still use it. Over the years we have seen the growth of feeling that the death penalty does not in any way, shape or form reflect the spirit of the countries or the people of the countries that have either abolished it in law or in practice. In December last year the UN General Assembly adopted its third resolution on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, with more UN member states supporting the resolution than ever before. The resolution was adopted with 109 votes in favour, 41 against and 35 abstentions. The reality is that many countries that still use the death penalty use it in a manner which is not even consistent with the most basic benchmark threshold of punishment for the most serious crimes. With around 17,000 people sentenced to death I urge all of those who support the abolition of the death penalty to recognise that we make ourselves better-we make our societies better-by punishing through other means those who have committed these heinous crimes, and recognise that the sanctity of life must be upheld, and that we must not debase ourselves by trying to- (Time expired)",181
210,Ms PARKE,BUSINESS," On a plane flight recently I read a legal thriller by John Grisham called The Confession, about a man who had committed the vicious rape and murder of a high school cheerleader nine years earlier. In the novel an innocent young African-American man who has been convicted of the murder now only has four days before his death sentence is carried out. more The real murderer, now suffering from an inoperable brain tumour, decides to confess. By the time he manages to persuade the authorities that he really is the murderer by leading them to the buried body the young African-American man has already been executed. As is often the case in real life, there was no happy ending to this story. I wish the only time an innocent person was executed was in a novel or a movie. The reality, however, is that it has happened all too often throughout history and wherever the death penalty exists. The reality is that it continues to happen. In Western Australia we have had a number of cases of murder convictions being overturned when the innocent persons had already spent many years in prison. It is fortunate we no longer have the death penalty, or the compensation for a wrongful conviction would have gone uncollected. If ever I need a grim reminder of those gory days I only need to walk around the corner from my electorate office to the old Fremantle prison and see the small dark chamber where people were hanged. Hangings at Fremantle prison would take place at 8 am on Monday mornings. The condemned would be woken at 5.30 am, showered, transferred to the condemned cell, given the services of a spiritual adviser and offered a glass of whisky. On leaving the condemned cell they would be taken to the gallows. Usually, only 60 seconds elapsed before the trap was pulled. The last execution was that of Eric Edgar Cooke, on 26 October 1964. Cooke had been convicted on only one count of murder but evidence and his confession suggest he had committed many, many more, including those for which other people had already been convicted. Of course, even when the correct person is convicted of a serious offence the death penalty is abhorrent, for the many reasons that have been spoken of in this place. I noted in a speech on 22 February 2010: The death penalty is an act that decreases the store of human dignity. It is a practice that has no social justification, for all the evidence indicates that it does not function as a deterrent, and not right that our system of justice function as an instrument of vengeance. I was speaking on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill. It was a matter of great pride for me and many other Australians when the federal parliament passed this law last year with multipartisan support, making it impossible for the death penalty to be reintroduced at the state and territory level. Of course this was an incorporation, into domestic law, of our international legal obligations under the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. When speaking on that bill I also referred to Indonesia and acknowledged that it takes very seriously offences involving drugs and wishes to ensure that a strong message is sent to the community that dealing in drugs will not be tolerated. I noted that it is possible to be tough on crime and drugs without imposing the death penalty, which is a fundamental violation of the right to life. This is demonstrated by the fact that the international criminal tribunals which try and punish the most serious crimes possiblegenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity-do not have the death penalty. The arrest of General Ratko Mladic by Serbian authorities last Thursday will enable justice to finally be done for the atrocities committed in Sarajevo and Srebrenica. Yet whatever his fate within the judicial process, Mr Mladic will not receive a death sentence. And that is appropriate. As US Supreme Court Justice William Brennan once said: The state does not honour the victim by emulating his murderer. I made a statement last week welcoming the Indonesian Supreme Court's decision to overturn Scott Rush's death sentence, in ... it is which I noted the important progress made by Indonesia in strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the past decade. As noted in Amnesty International's report on Death sentences and executions 2010, the trend throughout the world is for increased abolition of the death penalty in practice or in law. It is, however, shocking that only last year China executed thousands of people for a wide range of crimes that included non-violent offences, and after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards. This is a matter that I trust is traversed in Australia's regular human rights dialogue with China. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Amnesty International on its 50th anniversary and for the incredible work it does to advance the cause of human rights throughout the world. I also want to thank and pay tribute to the member for Banks for bringing this important motion regarding the death penalty to the parliament and to thank all of the members who are speaking in support of this motion.",182
211,Mr RUDDOCK,BUSINESS," I am delighted to have this opportunity to commend my colleague the member for Banks, to warmly support the remarks of the member for Fremantle and to support the remarks of my colleague Mr Ciobo about the importance of this motion. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion because, as a long standing member of Amnesty International, I know that this is one of its core interests one which I am particularly pleased to support. I am delighted to see that they have focused on this interest in the way they have. I have before me the report of Amnesty International, Death sentences executions 2010. It notes that this is the occasion that Amnesty International is able to draw attention to this particular issue of executions. It also notes that after the creation of Amnesty International in 1961, it began sending appeals to prevent executions of prisoners of conscience. Then, over time, its work on the death penalty expanded. Recognising that as a punishment the death penalty is cruel, inhuman and degrading and an affront to the right to life, Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception. I am pleased, as a member of Amnesty, to be able to support that statement very strongly. I am delighted, also, to note that somebody whom I had some adverse comments to make about, in terms of their priorities, the chair of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations, made some remarks on the universal abolition of the death penalty, as early as December 2009. I am glad to see that she was taking this matter up because I think it deserves priority. When marking the 20th anniversary of the death penalty optional protocol, she said: I am opposed to the death penalty in all cases. I hold this position for a number of reasons: these include the fundamental nature of the right to life; the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people by mistake; the absence of proof that the death penalty serves as a deterrent; and what is, to my mind, the inappropriately vengeful character of the sentence. It is important to note some of the observations that have been made. The member for Fremantle highlighted the fact that China executed more people than the rest of the world put together when it carried and out executions involving more than 1,000 people. I found that an astonishing figure. Closest to it was Iran with 252, North Korea with 60, Yemen with 53 and, regrettably, the United States of America with 46. When and President Bush Sr visited Australia. I was glad that the parliament, through the Parliamentary Amnesty Group, saw fit to raise this matter with him. I am sorry that things have not changed. Amnesty's report also notes that four countries in the G20 executed people in 2010-China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United States-that 23 countries carried out executions, that 58 countries are classified as retentionist, with fewer than half of them actually executing people in 2010, and that 138 inmates sentenced to death in the United States of America had been exonerated since 1973. It makes note of the methods used, including beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and shooting. I note that the honourable member for Fowler is going to follow me in the debate. No doubt he will make mention of Scott Rush, an Australian sentenced to death in Indonesia. Like him, I am glad that that sentence has been commuted. It would have been a real tragedy if it had occurred.",184
212,Mr HAYES,BUSINESS," I too thank the member for Banks for bringing this motion before us this evening. Everyone who has participated in this debate so far has spoken on other occasions that I can recall on the issue of the death penalty. Capital punishment, the death penalty, is the most cruel, inhumane and irreversible form of punishment that there can be. It is an absolute affront to those who stand for human rights. In 1977, when Amnesty International started its campaign against the death penalty, there were, as I understand it, only 16 abolitionist countries. Now, little more than 30 years later, 139 countries are abolitionist. In the last 10 years alone, more than 30 countries have abolished laws or practices with respect to the death penalty. I applaud everybody who has been involved in that and I congratulate those countries for taking a responsible position on human rights. My involvement in the issue of capital punishment started almost five years ago, not long after my by-election, when I had a chance encounter, meeting with the parents of Scott Rush. Scott Rush is one of the Bali Nine. He was arrested at Denpasar airport carrying a large quantity of drugs. He was a drug mule; there is no doubt about it. His father had tipped off the Federal Police about what his son was up to in an attempt to stop his son's life of crime. What his father did not understand, of course, was that if you got caught overseas, particularly in Bali, it would mean the death sentence. Together with Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Scott was, until very recently, on death row at Kerobokan Prison. As a matter of fact, about five or six weeks ago my wife, Bernadette, and I went to Kerobokan Prison to see all the Australian prisoners on death row. I have to say that as a parent it struck me that, but for the grace God, it could have been any of our kids over there-and they were kids. Scott Rush was 17 when he was apprehended carrying his quantity of drugs. Certainly it was misguided and certainly it was criminal activity, but at the end of the day he is someone's child. Visiting the prison left me with all the feelings experienced by a parent in this of us circumstance. I would not like to have to leave my child in Kerobokan Prison waiting for a final verdict to be made. Fortunately for Scott Rush, his final judicial review was handed down a couple of weeks ago. By a majority vote by the bench of two to one his execution was commuted to life imprisonment. Sukumaran and Chan are still waiting for judgment to be made in respect of their judicial review. I felt I shared a common bond with Lee and Christine Rush: the unreserved love that we have for our kids regardless of what they have done. Since our visit, Scott has fortunately had his sentence commuted. I hope and pray that that occurs for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan as well. I am proud of the fact that, in this country, Gough Whitlam in 1973 took the steps federally to abolish the death penalty. In 1990 Australia signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Australia voted in the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a global moratorium on the death penalty in 2007. Australia cosponsors the resolution for human rights and calls for all nations to abolish capital punishment. As time is rapidly running out, I would like to leave you with the words of Chief Justice of the Constitution Court in South Africa, Ismael Mahomed. He said that the death penalty: … is the ultimate and the most incomparably of extreme form of punishment … It is the last, the most devastating and the most irreversible recourse of the criminal law involving … the planned and calculated termination of life itself; the destruction of the greatest and most precious gift which is bestowed on all humankind.",184
213,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BUSINESS," The former President of Poland, the late Lech Kaczynski, once a fighter against the repressive Soviet puppet government in his country through the trade union movement, warned that countries that give up the death penalty award an unimaginable advantage to the criminal over his victim-the advantage of life over death. In Australia in 1973, the death penalty was abolished for federal offences and, in 2010, the former Rudd government passed laws that prevented the death penalty from being reintroduced by any state or territory in Australia. I know that the death penalty has not been used as a punishment in this country since 1967 but, in effectively removing the capability for the nation or any of the states to reintroduce that penalty, I say that this parliament gave an unimaginable advantage to the criminal over the victim. I also say that this House of Representatives, in doing that and in supporting a motion such as the one before us today, fails to live up to its name. To be truly representative on this issue we would adhere to the views of the general public on this issue instead of the views of Amnesty International or the United Nations. One poll I found on the question of support or opposition to the death penalty was conducted less than a decade ago and was specifically regarding terrorism. In August 2003, Newspoll conducted an extensive survey in which respondents were asked whether they were in favour or against the introduction of the death penalty in Australia for people who were found guilty of committing major acts of terrorism. The result was that 56 per cent of respondents supported the death penalty in those circumstances, as opposed to only 36 per cent against. I may be a minority in this place when I say that I too support the death penalty for terrorists and for those found guilty of the most heinous of crimes-the murder of a child, particularly when it involves rape or the murder of an elderly person or a person with disabilities, again particularly when it involves rape. I may be a minority in this place when I say that, but I can tell you that it is not a minority view in the electorate at large. That fact is acknowledged by even the Australian Coalition Against the Death Penalty, which admits on its website that there are recent polls showing that 70 per cent of Australians support capital punishment for heinous crimes. I turn now to one case that I believe fully warrants the death penalty: the vicious murder of Zahra Baker, a young girl originally from Giru in my electorate of Dawson. According to a staff member at a Giru day care centre: 'Zahra seemed very happy. She always came in with a smile on her face. She was at preschool then and was diagnosed with cancer. She went away for treatment. She was a very happy, determined little girl. She was willing to give anything a go.' She was a little girl struck down with cancer at a young age. She went through chemotherapy and all the horrors that that involves, and she lost a leg to that terrible disease. Zahra moved with her father and stepmother to America-a terrible move given what transpired. But, in the darkness, the shining light may be that true justice can be served, given that the crime occurred in North Carolina, where the death penalty is still an option. The tiny body of Zahra Baker now lies scattered across the woodlands and in the creeks in a small North Carolina town. The autopsy on her remains found that two different cutting instruments were used to dismember this little girl's body, and her skull has never been found. I will not speak about that matter in greater detail and I will not point out potential suspects, although that is something that is readily available through the media. What I will say, though, is that if the police are able to find her killer and prove guilt in a court of law, and all the information is pointing to that conclusion, then I say that the death penalty would be the only just penalty to fit the seriousness of crime against that young girl. Some people may reel from that statement but, in our protected world here in Canberra, we are not exposed to the great evils out there, and I suppose it would be the same for a Hollywood actor. In his book Mindhunter, a former FBI serial profiler, John Douglas, talked about the actor Scott Glenn coming to see him to do research for a character he played in Silence of the Lambs. Douglas recounted: 'Glenn was a pretty liberal guy who had strong feelings on rehabilitation, redemption and the fundamental goodness of people.' Douglas showed him crime scene photos and let him listen to recordings of killers torturing their victims. Douglas wrote: 'I made him listen to one of two teenage girls in Los Angeles being tortured to death in the back of a van by two thrill-seeking killers who had recently been let out of prison. Glenn said that after seeing and hearing what he did in my office that he could no longer oppose the death penalty.' I want to talk about deterrence. Repeated empirical evidence suggests that capital punishment has had a deterrent effect. That is proven. I make no apologies for supporting the victim over the criminal. Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (21:27): In responding to the previous speaker, I note that one of the areas where he would allow the death penalty is the heinous crime of killing young people. It is worth noting that part of the horrendous capital punishment reality of this world is that there are 19 states in the United States which execute people under 18 years old; and since 1999, nations including China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Yemen have executed under-18-year-olds. The member talked of things being beyond the realmthat we can convict people when it is certain that the case is proven. It is worth noting on that that front, as was indicated by an earlier speaker, that in the United States alone 138 inmates on death row have been exonerated. I do not think there is any certainty in this matter. I join previous speakers in saluting Amnesty International in its 50th year for its action with regard to capital punishment. That was not one of its original aims; it was focused very much on political prisoners. But, over the course of time, it went on to the situations of prisoners' families, the nature of court procedures and areas such as capital punishment. Obviously, as other speakers have indicated, there are a few nations on this earth which are particularly prominent with regard to execution. China stands out. The numbers are so large that no-one is certain of the realities. Iran, which conducts stoning for sexual offences, which in the last fortnight is debating whether somebody will be blinded for theft, is another prominent one. I want to talk about the United States, not because it is the worse but because we perhaps have more information about some of the realities there due to its open media. It is worth noting not only that capital punishment is wrong morally but also that there are real questions as to the lottery of life that capital punishment involves. Afro Americans constitute 12 per cent of the population of the United States but 41 per cent of the people on death row are Afro American. Debate interrupted. NA",186
214,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Solomon Electorate Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (21:30): It has been a very busy time back in my electorate of Solomon, with lots of activities, events and openings taking place. The SIDS and Kids NT is an organisation that is very dear to my heart. It always amazes how hard the volunteers work to raise the much-needed funds for the very important awareness programs for SIDS and Kids. A special acknowledgment and thanks must go to Fiona and Craig Peters, who work tirelessly for this charity, especially when there is a BBQ fundraiser. That seems to be their speciality-the best sausage sizzles in town. On 5 May I was delighted to host the presentation of the Australian Defence Medal for three long-time Northern Territory residents which was held at the Palmerston Sports Club. I was joined by military representative Major Pat Hay and we presented medals to Mr Christopher MCManis and Mr Noel Barry. Unfortunately, the third recipient, Mr Rodney Arrowsmith, could not attend, but we did acknowledge him on the day. The Fred's Pass Annual Show was held over the weekend of Friday, 13 May to Sunday, 15 May and this year celebrated its 33rd year. There was a great range of stalls, exhibits, rides, food, drink and activities everyone to get involved in. Each year this event seems to get bigger and bigger and better and better. Congratulations must go to the organising committee. Following on from my previous mention in this House about the Arafura Games, on the final day of competition I attended the volleyball finals at Marrara Indoor Stadium. In an exciting nail-biting game between Papua New Guinea and Macau, PNG eventually took the men's gold medal. The medal presentation was very memorable with the winning PNG team singing their national anthem to a very excited crowd. Special mention and congratulations to Katie Sharpe from the Women's Defence team. She was awarded Best Setter and Most Valuable Player awards and was absolutely delighted! John Cassat from the Men's Defence team was awarded Best Server for the competition. A very special mention and congratulations to the Northern Territory medal winners and Alex Billeter from the Women's NT team, who received the Best Blocker award. It was wonderful to be able to present an award to a local. I was so very proud to also present the bronze medal to the Women's Tiwi Islands team. To all competitors across all the sports and countries, thank you for participating in the games and thank you for visiting our beautiful Top End. Thank you also to the many volunteers and sponsors for their contribution to the games. Many have said that one of the highlights of this events was local talent Jessica Mauboy, who certainly knows how to entertain a crowd. On Sunday, 15 May I attended Darwin's premiere pet event, the RSPCA Million Paws Walk at Jingili Water Gardens. It was a fabulous morning. It was wonderful to see many locals with their four-legged friends supporting this worthwhile event. My cocker for spaniel Toby thoroughly enjoyed the event. He took a real liking to Alice Burton's dog Yani, who was in the running for the smallest dog on the walk and also Leigh Gordon's cute little black cocker spaniel Duke. Miranda and Michael Opie's babies, Gremlin, Muppett, Yetti and Womble, were all RSPCA rescue dogs and stood out in the crowd as they all wore pink tutus. The funds raised through walk registrations and online fundraising goes towards vital programs, services and campaigns undertaken by the RSPCA, as well as supporting our daily battle to stop animal cruelty. I attended the opening of the new Woolworths store at Karama on Wednesday, 18 May. Locals tell me they are delighted with the new store and were very impressed with the refurbishments of the Karama Shopping Centre complex. I was surprised that there were so many people waiting for the shop doors to open. Officially, I was the second customer of the store, purchasing some locally grown heliconas for my electorate office. Congratulations to regional manager Michael Batycki, area manager Rick Lowe and store manager Domenic Devirgilio on the opening of this new store. If your first day was any indication, I am sure Karama residents are going to keep you very busy. As part of Walk Safely to School Day on Friday, 20 May I hosted a healthy breakfast at Malak Primary School. Students loved the fresh fruit, yogurt, fresh bread and cheese. The biggest hit by far was the watermelon. A special thank you to Principal Peter Swan and his staff for registering the school for this event. There is a real sense of community within the school. This is a real credit to Principal Peter Swan and his dedicated team of teachers, such as Vanessa Hoare and Marita Maloney. After breakfast was finished I was asked to present the weekly awards-and that was such a privilege. Finally, I attended the Paspaley Darwin Star Ball for the Starlight Foundation on Friday, 20 May with my good friends Erica Sims and Jack Cranwell. Through the generosity of Territorians more than $200,000 was raised for the Starlight Foundation on the night. One of the highlights of the evening was the raffle. (Time expired) Women in Public Office",188
215,Ms ROWLAND,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I pay tribute to women in local government and specifically mention the 2011 Australian Local Government Womens Association Conference of New South Wales, which was hosted over the weekend in Blacktown City. This was the ALGWA diamond jubilee conference, celebrating a momentous 60 years of activity promoting women in public office and women with careers in local government. The theme of the 2011 conference was SWIFT: the acronym for 'strong women influencing future trends'. As attested by the diverse range of participants, drawn from urban, regional and rural councils and shires, from all political and indeed apolitical persuasions, now is the time for women in local government or women who aspire to be in local government to take control of their respective agendas. Research compiled by the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales illustrates a female participation rate in local public office positions which has unfortunately remained largely stagnant over the past three local government elections since 1999, at around 26 per cent. This is not good enough. I was fortunate to arrive at this place with the benefit of experience in both the private sector and as a council representative. I firmly believe that all women in public office have an obligation to identify and encourage the participation of other women. Throughout the conference there was ample opportunity for women to share their respective experiences and motivations for seeking election to local government. Almost to a person, delegates recounted how it was due to the inspiration or support of other women, not necessarily women of their own political ilk or in their geographic area, who ignited their own desire to put their hand up to represent their local communities. With just over 12 months until the next local government elections in NSW, I take up the obligation to enhance the reality of one of the tenets of the NSW Local Government Women's Charter: Local governments are in a unique position to work with the community to increase the numbers and participation of women in public life, so that decision-making more clearly represents and reflects the interests and demography of communities. It was a great honour for me to deliver the official opening address at the weekend's conference, and in doing so I singled out a policy area that I feel very strongly aboutthe constitutional recognition of local government. This is a campaign that has been driven for decades by local government across Australia, and indeed across the political divide. One of the measures in this year's budget included funding to implement this government's specific commitment for the constitutional recognition of local government. The need for such recognition was sharpened following the 2009 High Court decision in Pape v Commissioner of Taxation. The prevalence of federally funded projects for local government in areas such as roads and community infrastructure, project managed and delivered by locals, demands that their validity be placed beyond doubt. As history tells us, the success of referenda depends on cross-party support. It is therefore disappointing that, while those opposite once supported constitutional recognition of local government, late last month we saw another rift in the coalition ranks. The shadow minister, Senator Joyce, as late as February this year told the parliament the coalition was supportive of constitutional recognition of local government. It has now emerged that the Leader of the Opposition has reduced this quite unequivocal position to in-principle support. No-one in local government wants a repeat of the 1974 and 1988 referenda on constitutional recognition, which were opposed by the Liberal Party. I hope for the sake of local government and all Australians that those opposite get their act together and unite behind sound policy. I finally want to acknowledge the hard work by the team at Blacktown City Council who brought the conference together: Allyson Bradford, Bree Gilmour, Argyro Ballas, Tanya Bigeni, Nadine Nesovic and Nicole Winram. I also want to mention the events team at Blacktown City Council, including Peter Filmer and Kevin Poilly, who did so much for the conference as well as staging the final week of the Blacktown Fiesta, culminating in the hugely successful Streets Alive parade on Saturday. This was surely one of the biggest parades ever, a beautiful day hosting so many residents of policy Blacktown and beyond, including representatives from Blacktown's sister cities, Porirua in New Zealand and our country sister city, Liverpool Plains. Last of all, a special congratulation to Councillor Julie Griffiths of Blacktown City Council, who was elected the new ALGWA president at the conference. South Australian Aquatic and Leisure Centre",189
216,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT," Last Monday Swimming Australia announced the new South Australian Aquatic and Leisure Centre at Marion would host the 2012 Olympic trials. This is the culmination of a dream for so many people in my community. To go back, Adelaide has not had a FINA-standard pool since the early 1990s and last hosted a national-standard event with the Pan Pacific Trials in 1997. The 1997 Pan Pac Trials in South Australia was when Ian Thorpe sprang to notice, first qualifying for the Pan Pac's team as a 14year-old. Ironically, it will again be South Australia that hosts his trials comeback. This is the first time that the Australian Olympic trials have been held outside Sydney since 1992. Ian Thorpe, Libby Trickett, Geoff Huegill and Michael Klim will all be making their comebacks for the Olympic team for London in 2012. While the lack of a FINA-standard pool has held back the development of swimming in South Australia, we have seen some South Australian swimmers shine at the highest level. Matthew Cowdrey OAM from my home state of South Australia has competed at the 2004 Paralympic Games, the 2006 Commonwealth Games and the 2008 Paralympic Games. He collected 14 medals between the Athens and Beijing Olympics, including eight golds. Hayden Stoeckel, originally from Renmark, swam at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and claimed a silver and a bronze medal. The pool's first event was the Australian Age Championships, which were held between 18 and 23 April 2011. They were an outstanding success and had more than 1,500 competitors. I was able to go to the South Australian Short Course Championships on Friday night, which were opened by the Governor. Future confirmed events include the Australian Short Course Championships from 1 to 3 July 2011. This will be the first televised event from the new swimming centre. The Australian Swimming Championships next year will be doubling as the London Olympic and Paralympic trials. In 2013 the site will also host the Australian Swimming Championships, doubling as the FINA World Championship selections and the Australian Age Championships. I would like to pay tribute to several people without whom this facility would not have been built. The Mayor of Marion, Felicity-ann Lewis, her chief executive, Mark Searle, and the team at the City of Marion kept working on this vision for more than a decade and put together the submission to federal government in 2006. Nick Minchin as finance minister and Rod Kemp as federal minister for sport ensured that $15 million was delivered to the City of Marion in 2006 for this facility. It sat in the City of Marion's bank account for five years and by the time it paid for the project it was almost $20 million. I want to pay tribute to Michael Wright, who was the then South Australian sports minister. He made a commitment that if the federal government put in $15 million he would match it, and he did that. I would like to pay tribute to Alex Candetti, the Executive Chairman of Candetti Constructions, who demonstrated that a local builder could deliver a major project like this. All the people who were involved in the South West Indoor Aquatic Centre, a community group which sprang up more than a decade ago and started campaigning for an indoor pool in the southwestern suburbs, by getting the local government, state government and federal government all involved, now have one of the best facilities in the Southern Hemisphere and an aquatic centre that compares with the Water Cube in Beijing. This is the culmination of a dream for a lot of people. It is an outstanding facility that will really do a lot for the sport of swimming at the grassroots level and at the elite level in South Australia. We look forward to hosting the Australian Olympic and Paralympic trials in 2012. Clean Start Campaign Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (21:44): A few months ago I met with union members from United Voice, including workers employed as cleaners in my electorate of Throsby. Members may be aware that United Voice is the new name for the union formerly known as the LHMUthe Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union. United Voice represents workers in the hospitality, aged-care, security, childcare and cleaning industries. Cleaning staff-the people who keep our workplaces, hotels and shopping centres spick and span and healthy-are some of the lowest paid workers in our economy. We should never forget that it is workers like these who felt the full brunt of Work Choices under the previous government. Having survived Work Choices, cleaners around Australia are now campaigning for respect, a liveable wage, job security and fair and safe working conditions. The name of their campaign is Clean Start. I was proud to support Clean Start before entering parliament and am proud to maintain that support in this place. The United Voice members that I met with are very concerned about the conduct of one company, in particular, which is refusing to negotiate with their representative, the union. The company is the biggest publicly listed cleaning company in Australia and holds nearly 30 per cent of all shopping centre cleaning contracts across the country. The company's name is Spotless. Recently, I wrote to the Managing Director and CEO of Spotless, Mr Josef Farnik, calling on him to respect the wishes of the majority of the company's employees by entering into good faith negotiations with United Voice. Retail cleaners have legitimate concerns about their pay and conditions. They deserve a liveable wage, job security, fair and safe working conditions and the fundamental right to collectively bargain. Aside from low wages, retail cleaners are taking a stand against bullying and harassment, overwork and unsafe work practices. Despite repeated attempts to start genuine negotiations, Spotless has so far refused to bargain with workers and their union. It should be noted that Spotless has already signed up to Clean Start for hospital and office cleaners, and it should be applauded for this step. Spotless have replied to the letter that I wrote to them and have raised the issue of sham contracting in the retail cleaning industry and their concern about it. That is also a concern for other employers like Spotless, but it is no excuse to refuse to bargain in the retail-cleaning industry in good faith. Employees are concerned that Spotless is aggressively promoting individual flexibility agreements across the retail cleaning workforce. There is no excuse for any employer to be using individual flexibility agreements as a back door way of returning to the Work Choices style take-it-or-leave-it agreement making that characterised the previous government. I understand that the independent umpire, Fair Work Australia, has been called into adjudicate. That is a good feature of the new system, and I look forward to its ruling. We do not often see the labours of cleaners, who work late nights and early mornings, and yet their work affects us every day. They certainly do not deserve to be spurned and ignored by their employer for wanting to negotiate a collective agreement. I encourage all members to take an interest in this issue and keep the focus on Spotless until it changes its strategy and begins treating its workers and the union with a bit of respect. I also call on government departments to apply the fair work code and incorporate the Clean Start principles in their departments and in the contracts that they let to the contract cleaning industry. It is the policy government. Unhappily, it is a policy that is not being applied in all federal government departments, but one that should be. Child Safety",190
217,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to raise the issue of child safety and our responsibility as adults to protect all children. To begin with, I say that we are not islands and we do not have the leisure to see our own families as our only responsibility. If we surrender the streets outside our home to crime, because we feel safe behind the alarm and security screens of our own home, that crime will start knocking on our door next. It is far better that we control and defend the streets and the communities which surround us with a willingness to act than withdraw and isolate ourselves, thereby surrendering our streets to crime and our neighbours to their fates. Across this nation we are used to seeing stories of children at risk of violence, neglect, abuse or sexual abuse. In our streets, our suburbs, our towns and our communities there are children at risk right now. There children who are being abused, and that is a reality. Anyone and everyone who is aware or who suspects that children are at risk is duty bound to take action. It is not right we merely sit back and say, 'Well, there is an agency that is responsible for that,' or 'The court can decide about that.' It is without doubt the responsibility and the duty of any adult to do what needs to be done to ensure the safety of children in these circumstances. I recently heard of a case where the relevant government agency became aware that the mother of two young children was cohabiting with a child sex offender. This man was well known to the officers of the agency. Apparently he would begin by befriending the partner or boyfriend of a mother. He would try to take over as the of partner of the mother and then target the children. The officers of the agency saw that this man was at this house. Incredibly, the action that was decided upon was to place a sealed letter on the file of the children for the next court appearance to determine custody arrangements. I have trouble reconciling that plan as a legitimate course of action. The officers were obviously concerned about the risk to the children, but they were only prepared to let the matter be known at a hearing two months later. This says something about the way these matters are treated and prioritised in the system of child protection. It is my understanding that some two weeks after the letter was written, extended family members of the children became aware of the risk and decided that they would not return the children after an access visit and would instead seek a temporary custody order to enable them to look after the children. Fortunately, these family members were not prepared to wait for the court hearing two months later, and they were not prepared to have confidence in the system and in the government agency; are they were instead prepared to act decisively and immediately upon becoming aware of the risk involved. I naturally wish the family well in the future and I hope that the court that will make a wise judgment and rule that the children can remain with the extended family for the long term, as it is certainly the case that such an upbringing in a positive and healthy environment stands in stark contrast to the neglectful and inappropriate circumstances that defined the early lives of the children. I use this example to highlight that there is a problem with the abuse, neglect and otherwise negative upbringing of children all the way around this country. I do not think that it is a very widespread problem-in fact, I hope it is pretty rare-but I suspect that it is present just about everywhere. I believe that relevant agencies tasked to manage such cases must be prepared to act quickly and decisively. They must be prepared to focus absolutely on the safety of the children and take the children to safe circumstances without delay. It is also my personal belief that there are crimes and degrees of neglect that justify children being permanently removed from their parents or families. I draw hope from the fact that next door to these problems there are people who care and who are prepared to act. All people need to be aware that if they believe there is a problem that something should be done about, then they are personally responsible for taking that action. I believe that those who suspect or those who know and do nothing are complicit in the crime. A 'Nothing to do with me' attitude will allow this evil to spread and will breed even greater tolerance, and we can never accept that. I therefore take this opportunity to encourage Australians to be aware of what is going on around them. We should all be aware of our surroundings and be prepared to immediately act when we see or suspect crime taking place. As soon as we suspect a crime, it is then completely our responsibility to act; it is no-one else's. It is my fundamental belief that if every law-abiding citizen was prepared to take action it would be a powerful deterrent to crime in this country. The greatest deterrent to crime is the certainty of being caught, and the certainty of being caught is achieved by the willingness of all of us to act immediately upon identifying crime. Live Animal Exports Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (21:54): I want to urge the government and my parliamentary colleagues to take a look at tonight's episode of Four Corners and move to suspend the trade in live cattle to Indonesia. The Four Corners program leaves no doubt that action to suspend the live cattle trade to Indonesia is now needed. Animals are being whipped, animals are hitting their heads repeatedly on concrete blocks, animals are watching other animals being killed and cut up in front of them, and animals are having their throats only half-slit and are dying a lingering, horrible death. We can do better. I want to add my voice to that of community organisations such as the RSPCA, the World Society for the Protection of Animals, Animals Australia, the Australian Meat Industry Union and a number of my parliamentary colleagues-the member for Fremantle, the member for Page and the member for Lyons-who have all said that we need to rethink our support for live cattle and live sheep exports. This is not a battle cry for vegetarianism; it is about moving to process sheep and cattle here in Australia. I think there are three ethical reasons and three economic reasons we should look at moving away from live exports. The first ethical reason is the fate of animals during transportation. Animals become heat stressed and overcrowded during transportation. Around 40,000 Australian sheep die en route to the Middle East each year. The main cause of death is starvation. The second ethical issue is the handling, transportation and slaughter methods used once animals reach their destinations. Many importing countries have no animal welfare laws. Australian sheep are bound and shoved into car boots in a region where temperatures reach 50 degrees Celsius in summer. Both sheep and cattle have their throats cut whilst fully conscious and suffer from prolonged, distressed and painful deaths. The third ethical issue is that Australia is a member of the World Organisation for Animal Health and has obligations in its bilateral trade agreements to protect animal health and well-being. With many Middle Eastern countries not complying with the guidelines, Australia needs to do more to support the World Organisation for Animal Health in its endeavours to improve animal welfare. Then there are three economic reasons to reconsider live exports. The first is that processing animals in Australia provides more economic value than exporting them live. This stands to reason-it is no different to the argument for value adding to our natural resources rather than just exporting the raw product. A report by ACIL says a sheep processed in Australia is worth 20 per cent more to the economy than one processed overseas. The ACIL report also says that the value adding for a live exported sheep is $36 but for processed sheep it is between $42 and $47. The second economic reason for moving away from live exports is that the Australian meat processing industry is being crippled from competition with the live export industry. In the past 30 years 40,000 meat processing jobs have been lost and about 150 processing plants have shut down. It is an ongoing problem. Last year 1,000 Australian meat workers lost their jobs, with some plants operating at 50 per cent of their capacity. Roger Fletcher, the founder of Australia's largest independent meat processing facility and chilled meat export company, said: We're the main employer in country regions, mining, and we want to be here for the long haul. It's devastating when vulnerable rural communities suffer industry closure and job losses … caused in part by the live export industry. The third economic reason is the clear evidence that Middle Eastern consumers do accept chilled meat products from Australia. In 2009 sheepmeat exports exceeded live sheep exports in both dollar value and live sheep equivalent. This is not surprising because the religion of Islam does not endorse cruelty to animals. There are two major religious festivals in the Middle East each year, Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Al Adha. The meat for such holidays can and should be sourced locally. Given these facts, claims by Liberal and National Party senators about the importance of the live export industry simply fall flat on their face. A value-adding Australian meat processing industry would provide more jobs for farmers, stock hands, shearers, truck drivers et cetera . The trade will not go elsewhere. There is plenty of refrigeration in key export markets such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. When we first stopped exporting animals to Egypt due to cruelty concerns in 2006, it was reported that the Egyptian government move straight to chilled meat imports to fill the demand. Tonight's Four Corners program leaves no doubt that action to suspend the live cattle trade to Indonesia is now needed. Hughes Electorate: Graffiti Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (21:59): The marks of graffiti vandalism left on public and private premises leave an ugly image in the mind and are faced by communities across the country. Graffiti vandalism also reduces the value of properties and the aesthetic appeal of our local communities. On top of this, illegal graffiti is a type of criminal vandalism that after costs communities many thousands of dollars each year to clean up. In New South Wales it is punishable by imprisonment, community service orders and fines of up to $2,000. Constituents of Hughes, both before and after the previous election, have reported their disgust at unwanted graffiti, particularly in the Menai, Wattle Grove, Holsworthy and Panania areas. In budget figures presented just a fortnight ago, the Sutherland Shire Council announced that they had spent over $150,000 on graffiti and graffiti removal programs. Recent figures also show there were some 1,411 reported incidents in the year to March, with 21,903 square metres of graffiti removed over this period. A genuinely positive story has recently come out of the Liverpool area. Just over two years ago, a local resident, Allan Dabbagh, formed a community group dedicated to the removal of graffiti in our local community. The group, run entirely by local volunteers and funded out of the pockets of the many dozens of residents involved, works by dividing volunteers into responsible for individual streets. and they have had stunning results. The Locals Against Graffiti Gangs,or LAGG, aims to remove graffiti within 24 to 48 hours of it going up, but they regularly beat this target. Back when the group was formed, this ambitious target for the rapid removal of graffiti was a principal concept in its creation. As Mr Dabbagh noted: One of the most effective ways to abate or stop graffiti is rapid removal. Graffiti artists want tags to be seen, and if it's removed quickly it discourages them. It's the best way we can fight back. LAGG has been funded out of the pockets of local volunteers. In recent weeks they received a supportive boost to the operations by Liverpool City Council. In its April meeting, the council voted to allocate a grant of $10,000 to the group over the next two years. The funding is to be used to spread the word and to buy cleaning products and uniforms. The Deputy Mayor of Liverpool, Councillor Ned Mannoun, who moved the motion, said afterwards: When the council works with the community you get better results and, while we have been working with LAGG, I don't think it's fair they should have to pay for this themselves. Indeed, it is not. The LAGG website displays a media article from 13 August 2010, just before the last federal election, when the Minister for Home Affairs made a $50,000 commitment for a graffiti removal van for Wattle Grove. A similar commitment was made for Engadine, also in my electorate of Hughes. We have heard a great many claims that Labor will deliver on all election commitments made by all candidates. On 20 October last year the Prime Minister said: Yes, I do commit to keeping the promises at a local level that Labor and Labor candidates made categories at the last election. But do we ever really know with this government? The local community should be rightly suspicious of this promise. After all, it was this Labor Prime Minister that made the notorious comment just before the last election: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. I hope that this Labor government does not try to squirm out of this commitment by their pouring money into marginal seats going to the next election, and I promise I will not let this issue rest until this commitment is delivered in full. Finally, I congratulate the member for Fowler for announcing his support for the coalition policy to provide funds for CCTV cameras in the Liverpool CBD, an area badly neglected by Labor for many years. If he is committed, as his quote to the Liverpool Leader suggests, then I welcome his support and would be glad to work with him. If not, then the residents of Liverpool can rest assured that the provision of CCTV cameras is an ongoing coalition commitment that will be delivered under the next coalition government. Wakefield Electorate: GP Superclinic",193
218,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT," It is interesting that the previous speaker was talking about commitments made at election time. I remember in 2007 the now government made a commitment to build a GP superclinic in the Peachey Belt. The Peachey Belt is a great area, with Davoren Park andDr Southcott: Is it open? We're still waiting for it.",197
219,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT,"Member for Boothby, just listen. Take a deep breath. We made a commitment to the Peachey Belt. The Peachey Belt is Davoren Park and Smithfield Plains. There are some other growing suburbs around it-Andrews Farm, Munno Para West and the like. There are many new homes being built for young families and new arrivals to the electorate in the form of many defence personnel. It is great that today the UniHealth Playford GP Super Clinic opened its doors for the first time. That is a $7.5 million commitment that has been delivered upon. It is a very important commitment. There was only one doctor previously in the Peachey Belt and he worked about three days a week-a very committed individual but he is getting on in age. So this was an area of high need and had very few GPs. So it is great to have UniHealth. UniHealth is an amalgam of the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia. They will bring GPs, nurses, visiting specialists and a range of allied health professionals across physiotherapy, exercise therapy, mental health, occupational therapy, drug and alcohol counselling and nutritional advice to this area The issues of mental health, drug and alcohol counselling and nutritional advice came out of the very good consultation that we had in June 2008, which was attended by over 80 people. Those 80 people, who included many prominent citizens in the local community, provided a lot of feedback, particularly on those issues. I would like to thank Betty Alberton, Shirley Harris, Shaun Barby, Geoffrey Pope, Denis Davey, Shirley Wissell, John Eyndhoven, Stephen Hollingworth, and Coral Gooley, whose local knowledge and expertise helped make this a better centre and helped make Unicare and Dr Garry Taylor more aware of local needs and local demands. It is a particularly important centre. It is situated on Curtis Road, which is adjacent to the Peachey Belt and right in the centre of the new growth in the area. It is part of a redevelopment of an area that has had its knocks over the last two decades and needs all the help it can get. Importantly, right next door to the Unicare GP superclinic is going to be the Playford North clinical training facility. This was a $4.6 million contract that was won by Unicare to construct a new two-storey dedicated teaching and training facility. That $4.6 million covers land acquisition, construction work, site infrastructure, information technology infrastructure and specialised medical equipment. The project should be completed in the first half of 2012, with training commencing at this time. The new building will incorporate eight multidisciplinary teaching and consulting rooms, a dedicated student study area, a library, a lecture theatre/meeting room, student amenities areas and a lifestyle training and resource centre. It will be used to provide interdisciplinary teaching and training through the co-location of students, registrars, GPs, nurses, mental health professionals and allied healthcare professionals. It will offer placement opportunities for Indigenous health students all and provide employment opportunities for these students in the future. This is all designed to deliver education programs that focus on the high-need areas of the local community, including chronic disease management, lifestyle and risk factor management, health promotion, prevention and wellness. As I said before, Adelaide Unicare, which is also running the GP superclinic, will be running this very important training facility. My hope is that this will help train and keep doctors in the north, in our local area. Hopefully if they train there they will find a home in the local community, establish businesses and provide good health care for the north. (Time expired) Mental Health: Hills Clinic",197
220,Mr HAWKE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to pay tribute to the great achievement in Australian history which has occurred in my electorate of Mitchell. In recent weeks I had the privilege of attending the opening of Australia's first purpose-built private mental health hospital. This is what I regard as a remarkable achievement. Two psychiatrists, Dr Ted Cassidy and Dr Jason Pace, had the vision to establish Australia's first purpose-built private mental health facility-and what an achievement it is. It is a hospital facility at Kellyville on corner of Arnold Road, only a few kilometres from the original mental asylum declared by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, the first asylum in Australian history, also in my electorate of Mitchell at Castle Hill. Governor Macquarie, after the battle of Vinegar Hill, declared that the Castle Hill site, in recognition of the trauma created by that incident, would become an asylum. We were very privileged to have the current governor, Governor Marie Bashir, attend and open Australia's first purpose-built private mental health hospital. It was a remarkable occasion. She made an excellent point. She noted that the word 'asylum' means a safe place or refuge. Asylum was a beautiful word that meant Castle Hill and also meant Kellyville, just down the road. It is fantastic to see such great achievement come to fruition in light of what regulatory and other impositions are placed on such achievement in Australia today. Dr Ted Cassidy and Dr Jason Pace are fantastic visionary psychiatrists. They have worked in public health most of their lives and in private practice recently. They are serious veteran professionals. But to put together from the ground up a hospital capable of housing initially 30 and then some 60 patients is no easy thing to do in Australia. I am sad to say that it required great forbearance and great overreach from these two great human beings to go through with the process. I want to record in the House today that I think we ought to be doing more to take out the impediments to such great and visionary achievement in our country. I have spoken with them about the impediments, difficulties and challenges they faced from government. I want to record that not a cent of government money went into this facility-not a single cent. And yet we have the this fantastic private mental health hospital, the first of its kind in Australia today. It is purpose-built. There are plenty of other facilities that get rebuilt. Commonly it will be explained to you that most often mental health facilities are rebuilds because of the guidelines that exist in Australia today. Those guidelines have become an impediment. People will go for low-cost facilities in a rebuild rather than build a new purpose-built facility, which I think is a great shame. When you go there and you see the design, the use of modern construction and the use of gardens-the return of gardening and the use of plants in the treatment of mental illness is quite well documentedyou really get a sense from this building and this place that this purpose-built facility is going to achieve its purpose. Buildings have purpose. They have form. They have a reason for being designed the way they are. That is no different with a mental health facility. So of course, if we have guidelines in this country today that restrict or impede the development of such facilities, we ought to look at them. The state government initially exempted this fine facility from its cut. But by the it came around, because of the local council requirement that the hospital give up a small parcel of land for a road, they had to resubmit their DA and then they came under ridiculous state legislation that required further hundreds of thousands of dollars from what was going to be a mental health hospital, which ought to be exempt from ridiculous bureaucracy and government regulation. These challenges ought not be put in front of such fine work and fine achievement, and it ought not be as hard. In fact, when I asked them, they both recorded that if they had known how hard it would be to get this facility built they might not have gone ahead in the beginning. It is a sad indictment of our society today that we would regulate in such a way that would prevent this kind of great human achievement or make it so difficult. I want to record that Dr Ted Cassidy and Dr Jason Pace have made this facility a fine success. They already have 30 patients within the first month of opening. When I visit that facility and I see the work that they have done in putting together from the ground up a fully functioning private hospital, without a cent of government money or any help and just purely from their investments and their passion for treating the mentally ill, I am very proud of that. When you visit the rooms that are named after key Australians who have made achievements in this field-such as the Australian psychiatrist who discovered that lithium had an important use in psychiatry-you get the sense that these are two professionals honouring their profession and honouring the mentally ill. Fowler Electorate: Disabilities Forum",198
221,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," Last Friday I hosted a disabilities forum in my electorate, the second such forum I have hosted since time becoming a member of parliament. I find community forums are a wonderful way of getting together individuals and organisations that are passionately involved with a particular issue and giving them the opportunity to express their views direct to government. The purpose of the forum was to enhance the dialogue between government and the disabilities community by allowing individuals to hear about the current and future government reforms in this area and by giving these community members and organisations an opportunity to raise their issues directly with government officials. The forum was held at the Mounties Club in Mount Pritchard. I would like to use this opportunity to thank Mounties and their CEO, Greg Pickering, for providing the venue and catering for the meeting. This is just one of the many examples of the good work that Greg and his team at Mounties do for their local community. They are certainly an indispensible part of the south-west of Sydney. The Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, Senator Jan MCLucas, was also present on behalf of the government. She was there to hear first hand the concerns and issues being raised by disability organisations and individuals alike. More than 60 active local community members, including people with disabilities, parents, carers and service providers, were in attendance. We had a number of speakers from local disability groups, including Lucy Reggio from the Special Needs Ability Program Providers, Grace Fava from the Autism Advisory and Support Service and Branko Boskoski from Disabilities South West. The speakers were inspirational, outlining their own journeys and their current commitment to supporting or assisting those living with disabilities. Representatives from 15 other local disability groups were present. I would like to praise the contribution that they make to our community, where people and families living with disabilities are unfortunately overrepresented. The forum provided individuals, carers and community disability groups with the opportunity to tell us what the government can do to help make their lives a little easier. The issues raised during the forum ranged from everyday concerns faced by individuals with disabilities and their carers to the government's current and future directions in respect of the disability sector. I was particularly inspired by a number of individual stories. One that really struck a chord with me was that of a 16-year-old woman called Rebecca. Rebecca is a student, but she is also the full-time carer for her father, who has polio. She is currently endeavouring to maintain her education while looking after her father in the process. I thought her experiences and what she said at the conference were truly inspirational. A number of other individuals also shared their stories of dedication and commitment and of assisting not only themselves in their day-today life with disability but also their family members or fellow members of the community. I am in the process of compiling a report outlining the issues that were raised during the forum which will make a contribution to the government's future directions and policy development in the disability sector. The Gillard government's strong commitment to ensuring individuals with disabilities and their carers are adequately assisted has been demonstrated in a number of recent policies highly in this area, including the early intervention and workforce participation measures, the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative and a number of other programs. All of these were fully discussed during the course of this forum. Disability has always been an area which I have taken a very close interest in, and it is an area which this government has justifiably made one of its priorities. I am personally committed to doing all I can as a member of parliament to assist the disability community. I know that, regrettably, some people are dealt a very hard hand in life, but as a government and as a caring society we need to act to make life a little easier for those who have a lot of challenges ahead of them, particularly in raising a family and pursuing employment. Before concluding, could I mention Hoxton Industries, an employer of people with disabilities. They currently employ over 150 people with disabilities. They make an extraordinary contribution to our community and I would encourage any employer who can to outsource work to Hoxton Industries and the like, as it would be a very valuable contribution to our community. (Time expired) Home Insulation Program",199
222,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT," Today's Courier-Mail, in a major article headlined 'Time to stop the waste', deals with some of the bungles, blunders and wipe-outs of this government. Featured prominently is a discussion of the disastrous Home Insulation Program which has defrauded thousands of Australians. There have been examples of fraudulent operators, substandard products, unsafe work practices and gross mismanagement. Like all members, I have received many complaints about this scheme, and I want to refer to just a couple of them tonight. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Dreyfus, is genuinely trying to resolve as many of these issues as he can, and $100 million more was provided to assist him in that process. But that will go nowhere near fixing the cases of heartbreak, mismanagement and fraud that have been a feature of this program. On the Sunshine Coast there were 25 home insulation businesses before this program began. The number grew to 250 during that period and unfortunately in the process the program destroyed the reputations of honest, hard working local businesses because so many out-of-towners, fly-in fly-outs and people phoning from interstate and canvassing door to door have left a trail of destruction and damage across the countryside-broken roofs, insulation just chucked in the ceiling and never properly installed, holes in the ceiling. The government has been unwilling to find ways to resolve so many of these issues. PricewaterhouseCoopers identified 150 claims where there was no insulation installed. In fact, in reality the total number will be much higher than that. I had a former constituent who bought a house in another city and several months later inspectors arrived to look at the insulation in his roof. There had never been any insulation installed in his home. There were 2,444 cases identified where more than one installer claimed for the same house. I have an installer in my electorate who was one of the victims of this scam. He installed the insulation, doing it properly, he believes, another person had already claimed for installing insulation in that particular The Auditor-General identified 347,789 payments that were higher than the amount that it had actually cost to put insulation into the particular homes. Let me mention just a couple of these from my own electorate. I had a constituent who had foil installed in his home in August 2009 and removed in October 2010, just a few months later. At the time of the foil installation he was required to pay $1,700 in addition to the subsidy from the government. It all had to be taken out because it was dangerous. The government paid the cost of taking it out, but this man was left without $1,700, which he had to pay in addition to what the installer had received-and there is no compensation for that amount of money. Another case concerns constituents was persuaded by a representative of a company to have triplelayer foil insulation installed. On that company's advice they had triple-layer insulation put in. It cost an extra $1,019 on top of what the government subsidy would provide. However, once this product was installed the constituent found that the temperature in the house was 1½ degrees hotter than if one had been standing outside. So the constituent had it pulled out, but now they have got to meet the full cost even though the department has told them that this product never ever met the required ratinganother very unhappy customer. I refer also to the Green Loans assessor program and a case brought to my attention only a few days ago. One of my local Green Loans assessors went to all the expense of training. He did only 83 assessments and earned less than $16,000. But now he finds that, under the terms of the program, he has to maintain an insurance premium of $4,900 a year for seven years to cover the work that but he undertook. Even though he did only $16,000 worth of business-and most of that house. was used up in training, advertising, registration and start-up costs-he is going to pay $34,300 over the next seven years on insurance policies on just 83 jobs. I have drawn most of these matters to the attention of the parliamentary secretary and he has been unable to fix them. I think he is trying, but the government must devote resources to fix these completely unconscionable outcomes which are a direct result of the mismanagement of this program. (Time expired) Macedon Ranges Healthy and Active People Project Kilmore and District Hospital",200
223,Mr MITCHELL,ADJOURNMENT," Last week I had the pleasure of announcing a $700,000 grant, on behalf of the Gillard Labor government, to the Macedon Ranges Shire Council to run programs that encourage and support people to adopt and sustain healthier lifestyles. The project, Macedon Ranges Healthy and Active People, aims to improve health outcomes for local residents who are not in the paid workforce and are experiencing, or are at risk of experiencing or developing, weight related chronic diseases. The project will assist participants to initiate and sustain behavioural change within the community by engaging residents in effective, ongoing physical activity and healthy eating programs and other activities. The project will include the Heart Foundation's Walking program and AustCycle's national programs. These programs will be complemented by local programs and activities including structured physical activity and healthy lifestyle classes such as Live Well, Be Well, Stay Well; Strength for Health; and Lifeball. There will be support for local planned activity groups, cooking classes and community garden work, and awareness raising about the importance of healthy living. This funding will promote preventative health measures. We know that these measures work, which is why we are funding this fantastic local initiative to encourage people to try out a variety of healthy eating and physical activity programs. We held the announcement at the Kyneton Toyota Aquatic Centre, in the neighbouring electorate of my good friend the member for Bendigo. This facility was built out of our government's stimulus funding. It is a facility that the community is rightly proud of. The centre hosts an eight-lane, 25-metre lap pool; a warm-water exercise pool offering hydrotherapy classes; a learn-to-swim pool; a fitness centre with state-of-the-art equipment; three squash courts and a sports stadium. With all of these wonderful features and a great group fitness timetable offering a variety of classes, there is something on offer for everyone at this brand-new facility and they invite everyone to come down and titled enjoy. I was impressed with the building. The new pools and the work on new tennis courts were amongst the main attractions, but so were the opportunities for the community. To better develop healthier communities through programs is something that will have a far-reaching positive impact on the residents of Kyneton and surrounding areas. While I was there I was reminding them that the coalition tell us that the stimulus funding was a waste of money and the facility should never have been built, so the offer was put to the coalition to come down. I invited them to come down and have a look and see this facility and then try to tell the community that this was a waste of money. But I am sure that it has fallen on deaf ears amongst those opposite. I would like to take this opportunity to put pressure on the Baillieu Liberal government to stick to its election commitment. The Baillieu Liberal government promised it would provide funding of $10 million to the Kilmore and District Hospital if we did. Well, the Gillard government is demonstrating its commitment to my local community by delivering $10 million in our federal budget. Now the Baillieu government has gone into hiding; that is to say it has not delivered, it has not mentioned nor has it committed to this funding. Our funding, the Gillard Labor government's funding, will go to the redevelopment of the theatre suite with a day procedures and recovery unit; the expansion and enhancement of the acute inpatient facility to provide expanded acute care services and to increase the number of acute beds from 30 to 60; and the construction of a new outpatient facility to deliver comprehensive integrated primary health care. Not only will this funding go to improving and strengthening our local healthcare system; it will also provide opportunities for training and development and stimulate our local economy by creating more jobs for locals. I now call on the Baillieu Liberal government and the local Liberal member to live up to their promise and deliver on its commitment of $10 million to assist in funding the expansion of the Kilmore and District Hospital so that people in Kilmore and surrounding areas can enjoy better health care in a hospital that they are fiercely supportive of and fiercely committed to.

By leaving decisions as on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to a budget bottom line, instead of to the expert putting the lives of many Australians in of the expert panel is almost unprecedented. but in the past it has been very rare that system of health where those on low or middle medicine. The minister for health has not would be considered, except for the NA blanket statement that the process will continue the way we are going, I do not think we government has already spent all of the extra boom has delivered to Australia, and then money on harebrained schemes such as the GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch schemes.

It's have at their disposal to override the decisions brought politics into what was an effective and depoliticised people's health and indeed their lives are at stake. The cost of medicines has already been subject is no need for further analysis. This policy sighted, as products which could have cost There are examples piling up of patients suffering disabling pain, lung disease and blood clots to $100 per month, instead of the PBS co-payment system, because those who are on low or middle full cost of these medications.

He said: these medicines available is cost effective, is unclear what expertise or experience cabinet ministers of their own expert committee. The Government has process in a highly-sensitive area where to an economic evaluation by the PBAC; there that the government has implemented is shortthe government less have already been deferred. conditions such as schizophrenia, chronic having to forgo best treatment or having to pay up of $34.20.

When we put information the best choices for themselves and their families. public services which are crucial to boosting focuses on three websites created by the MyHospitals. The myschool.edu.au website allows schools, compare schools serving statistically similar Australia. It allows parents to identify and schools in which significant student progress can now look at student gain over time and available to the school. Since the MySchool over five million people have visited the site. The mychild.gov.au website helps parents find allows parents to find information about the childcare costs. The website now includes information of age groups and information on both permanent alone, the MyChild website has had over 420,000 information for parents such as children's support services.

The Australian governments opposed the MyHospitals website. the updated MySchool 2.0 website, preferring from Australian families. Opposition to data First, critics argue the performance measures sets the bar too high.
