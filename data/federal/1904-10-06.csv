0,NA,Unknown,"iQouse of iirpiTsrnraiiurs. Thursday, 6 October, /gof. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p;m., and read prayers. ORDER OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Mr Reid) agreed toThat the consideration of the first' Order of the Day be postponed until tomorrow. NA CONFIDENCE. Debate resumed from 5th October (vide page 5286), on motion by Mr WATSONThat the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House.",12
1,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF," Jus t prior to the adjournment last night, when referring to the excellent speech delivered by the honourable member for Perth in the course of this debate, I said that, although he is utterly opposed to the alliance which has been entered info between the members of the Labour Party and a few protectionists who sit in the Opposition corner, he is yet, in obedience to the caucus, in duty bound to vote for the motion. Since making that statement. I have found that I was in error, because the honourable member for Bland has explained to me that the motion of-want of confidence is not one of the planks of. the labour platform, and, consequently, the honourable member for Perth, and any other member of the Labour Party, is at liberty to Vote upon it as he may choose. As I have no desire to do an injury to any'member of the Labour Party, I withdraw the remarks to Which I have referred - Although we may differ: in our political opinions, we have the highest esteem and regard for the members of the Labour Party individually. We are - certainly opposed - to their policy of compulsory and restrictive legislation. I wish, however, to say a few words about a speech delivered the other day by the honourable member for Brisbane, whom I am glad to see present. He was good enough to say what he had to say about me while I was here, and I should be sorry to say anything against him in his absence. Later on, I shall make a personal explanation in regard to something which he said. The other day he made a most extraordinary speech. In giving the financial history of Queensland, he dealt with millions of pounds as though they were merely so many pence, and depreciated the public men of the State apparently to his entire satisfaction, though no other member, 1 venture to say, had the slightest idea of what he was driving at. He is only a recent convert to the Labour Party.",12
2,Mr CULPIN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How does the honourable member know that?,13
3,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have lived in Queensland longer than any other representative of the State in the House.,13
4,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,1 challenge that statement.,13
5,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have lived in Queensland for over thirty-six years.,13
6,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is a mere nothing.,13
7,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"During the whole Of that time, except for visits to the land of my fathers, and to other parts of the world, I have resided in Brisbane, so that I consider myself a pretty good authority on what has been going on in Queensland, and particularly in Brisbane, during the last thirtv years. I say that the honourable member for Brisbane is only a recent convert to the Labour Party, because, until two or three years ago, there was nothing in common between Dr Culpin and the working man.",13
8,Mr CULPIN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What nonsense.,13
9,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Like many new converts, he is just now full of enthusiasm, very indiscreet, and inclined to make most unreliable statements. He joined the Labour Party, not because he was in sympathy with its claims and aspirations, but because he thought that that was the best way of getting into Parliament.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Standing Orders expressly prohibit the imputation of unworthy motives such as the honourable member has imputed to the honourable member for Brisbane.,13
11,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I apologize, and withdraw what I have said. At any rate, he signed the labour pledge, and bound himself to follow his leader blindly if he were elected. The greatest objection that we on this side of the House have to the Labour Party is that its members are bound hand and foot. We do not care about giving up our political liberties, and therefore will not sign anv pledge.  will have to give up their political liberties in a few weeks.",13
12,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There is an old saying to the effect that every man has a soft spot somewhere.,13
13,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Generally in the head.,13
14,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not desire the honourable member to assist me in delivering my speech. I think that in the case of the honourable member for Brisbane, the soft spot will be found in the upper regions. The weakness from which he suffers is an impression that he is an authority on financial and banking matters. He has dealt with immense figures, and in his maiden speech in this House he discussed the financial affairs, of not only Queensland, but the Commonwealth.",13
15,Mr CULPIN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I desire to know if the honourable member is in order in referring to me as he has done ?,13
16,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What the honourable member was saying at the moment was not out of order. I do wish, however, that honourable members would make a stronger effort, if that were possible, to uphold the dignitv of debate in this House.",13
17,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not wish to transgress in any way, and I shall curtail my remarks as much as possible. As I say, the honourable member for Brisbane labours under the impression that he is. an authority on financial and banking matters. Queensland is fortunate in having even one representative in this House who can claim to be an authority on such subjects.",13
18,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member's supporters bolstered up the most rotten institution in Australia and it took us a long time to expose it.,13
19,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I would point out that in this Parliament we have no epidemic of financial troubles for which the honourable member for Brisbane need prescribe. If the honourable member is not more reliable in matters of physic than he is in banking and financial matters, may the Lord have pity on his patients. The honourable member made a very free use of the names of other honourable members. He appeared - to have a very serious grievance, and he made reference to a visit which was recently paid by a member of the Legislative Council of Queensland to Victoria. He saidThe honourable and learned member for Ballarat has been making "" copy"" for the newspapers. One of the remnants of that continuous Government who has been pensioned off in the nominee Chamber in Queensland, was in Victoria, and interviewed the honourable and learned member, as thus reported :Speaking with Mr Deakin, the Queensland visitor was able to show very plainly what the effect has been in Queensland of the Act abolishing Polynesian labour. . . . Mr Deakin's reply was- "" See the kind of men Queensland has sent to represent it . "" 2 Aiolion of Want [REPRESENTATIVES.] I desire to point out that if Mr Deakin made use of those words they could not apply to any honourable members of the present Parliament, but could only refer to the members who were returned to the first Parliament, and who sat here at the time that the Pacific Island Labourers' Bill was before the House. Mr Deakin sent the following telegram to the Brisbane Courier :My remarks to Mr Annear, reported in your paper of 17th, followed, and related to his statement that Queensland now regretted exclusion of Kanaka labour, and had no relevance unless that is understood. This shows that the honourable member for Brisbane had nothing to complain of with regard to the statements supposed to be made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.",13
20,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Another manufactured grievance.  it is absolutely true - freedo,14
21,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The statement made by Mr Deakin had reference to the fact that Queensland returned to this House a majority of representatives pledged to abolish Kanaka labour as speedily as possible.  that sense.,14
22,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Mr Deakin denies absolutely that he made any such statement. Mr R, EDWARDS - My contention is that the statement did not in any wav refer to the representatives of Queensland in this Parliament. The honourable member for Brisbane went on to sayThere is another contribution from this gentleman, to which he attaches no name- a statement which could only have been made by a vile cur, and it is a pity it was published. read the statement and also the names the writer mentions in the paragraph, and if there are any of those honourable members present, I hope they will repudiate having had anything to do with the matter. I say that this paragraph was communicated by a vile curThat appears to be a favourite expression of the honourable memberi f the communication was made to Mr Annear, who is reported to have said"" The Queensland representatives, with one or two exceptions, seemed to have but little influence in the House. Prominent legislators had remarked to Mr Annear- "" The prominent legislators mentioned in the graph are Mr Richard Edwards, Mr George Reid, Mr Deakin, and Sir John Forrest. I now give the paragraph referred toof Confidence. "" Prominent legislators had remarked to Mr. Annear- ' Surely a city like Brisbane could have sent a representative whom we might really take seriously.'"" I desire to ask the honourable member whether he implies that if Mr Richard Edwards, Mr George Reid, or Sir John Forrest made such a remark he is a vile cur.",14
23,Mr CULPIN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Certainl y I do. if either of them made such a statement.,14
24,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have nothing to do with what other honourable members may have said, but I deny that I made any such remark. In conclusion, I would urge upon honourable members that after having wasted so much time we should now employ ourselves to better purpose. - Mr BAMFORD - We all sav that.",14
25,Mr R EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We should endeavour to pass useful legislation for the benefit of the community as a whole, and to do something that will tend to bind together these great States of Australia in a bond of common sympathy and common freedom m of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom of trade and commerce throughout the continent.",14
26,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF," I recognise that at this stage of the debate very little that is fresh can be said, and I should not have risen had it not been for a statement made by the honourable and learned member for Wannon. I must admit that I am rather surprised at the great concern which is being displayed by the Government and their followers with respect to the alliance entered into between the Labour Party and those honourable members who sit in the Opposition corner. If any proof were needed that the alliance is justified, and that it is the best that can be done under the circumstances in the interests of democracy, it is afforded by the hostility that honourable members opposite are exhibiting towards I intend to it. The honourable member for Larig, who spoke early in the debate, adopted the alliance programme as his text, and every honourable member on the Government side who has since spoken has, to a greater or lesser degree, followed his example. They have adopted exactly the same attitude that they assumed when the Conciliation and ' Arbitration Bill was under discussion. They claim to be the true champions and representatives of the working classes. This afternoon the honourable member for Oxley declared that he failed to see how a doctor could represent the workers, quite paraoblivious of the fact that there are more doctors upon the other side of the House than there are upon this. Last night he stated that the workers should exhibit the self-reliant spirit which characterized them thirty or forty years ago. If his remark had reference to the farmers of Victoria, who are continually approaching the Government with requests for assistance, I quite agree with him. In my opinion, the workers in the cities should not be slower in appealing to the Government for aid than are those in the country. At a later stage I may have something further to say upon this aspect of the matter. I was pleased to hear the apology offered 55y the honourable member for Oxley for the statement which he made last evening to the effect that every member of the Labour Party is absolutely bound to vote upon a. no-confidence motion as he is directed by the caucus. When the accuracy of that statement was denied, I regret to say that the Prime Minister interjected, "" Oh, they must have altered their rules lately."" Surely the right honourable gentleman is aware that when he submitted a want of confidence motion in the Barton Administration he received the support of no less than six members of the Labour Party.",14
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,But this motion was submitted by the honourable member's leader. The case is therefore somewhat different.,15
28,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is absolutely the same. Every member of the Labour Party has perfect liberty to' vote as he chooses upon this question. I am satisfied that when the opportunity presents itself, the electors of the Commonwealth will express their opinions of the action of some honourable members who are sitting behind the Government in disregarding a decision which was' arrived at in caucus, to the effect that it was inadvisable to enter into any coalition.",15
29,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,They will get that opportunity in about two years' time.,15
30,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I hope that they will get it at a much earlier date. In this connection I desire to quote from the Age, and I think I may do so without any prejudice, because that journal has never given me a line of support. The Age of the 16th August contains the following :At the last caucus of the protectionist body, held on the 19th May, that party distinctly declined to accept any coalition, and carried the following resolution :- "" That this party is not prepared to consider proposals for a coalition except on the condition that the Prime Ministership of any coalition be accorded to the present leader of this party."" Has effect been given to that resolution? 2 r",15
31,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If effect had been given to it, would the protectionist members have supported the present Prime Minister?",15
32,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not a member of the caucus, and I am no more in a position to answer that question than is the honourable member.",15
33,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It .would be just as well to know that.,15
34,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"As the honourable - member is comparatively a ""new chum "" in the House, perhaps he is not aware of the fact that I am a member of the Labour Party, and consequently imagines that I have access to another caucus. The Age article continuesNothing that has since taken place has modified that situation. The resolution stands. The need for protectionist cohesion has 'not been weakened by the lapse of time; the contrary is the case. If one single protectionist joins in a Reid coalition, he breaks the strength of his party, while he leaves the free-trade section intact. When we consider that theie are three members of the Government who to a large extent owe their political existence to the fact that they have been continually written up by the Age",15
35,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member suggest that the Age has habitually written me up?,15
36,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I will show that it has written the Minister of Defence down since his recent action in associating himself with free-traders.,15
37,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It has never made a pet of me.,15
38,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ver y likely. I believe that the whole of the Victorian representatives in this House, with the exception of the Conservative five, were upon the Age ticket at the last general election. That organ supported their candidature. Yet, despite the fact that some of these honourable members were returned pledged to a definite platform, they have absolutely broken away from their party, and are now doing their best to disintegrate it. That is a matter upon which the electors will pronounce judgment. Upon pievious occasions I have heard certain honourable 'members denounce Victoria as the home of blacklegs, and of men who have no principle. I am inclined to think that they are now in a position to quote some very good examples in that connection-thos e honourable members who have broken away from their election pledges. Having agreed to a certain resolution in caucus, they afterwards desired to dragoon the minority into submission, Motion of Want [REPRESENTATIVES.] and. finding that that was impossible, without holding any further meeting, they declared "" We will leave the minority and support, a man whom we regard as a menace to the Commonwealth.""",15
39,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does not the honourable member believe in majoritv rule?,16
40,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do. 'But the honourable member does not represent a majority of his constituents.,16
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That can be said of a good many honourable members.,16
42,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There are eight honourable members upon the other side of the House who do not represent a majority of their constituents, and five upon this side. The honourable member for Corangamite polled only 4.600 votes, and there were 8,488 votes recorded against him. Air. WILSON - How many did Mr. Wynne poll ?",16
43,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have not the remotest idea, but it does not follow that every elector who voted for Mr Wynne would have supported the honourable member.",16
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Why not agree to a second ballot, and thus solve the difficulty ?",16
45,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am quite prepared to support a proposal of that character, and I am satisfied that the Labour Party would not lose anything by its adoption. The eight honourable members upon the other side of the House who represent minorities polled 33'ioo votes, whereas 52,000 votes were recorded against them. They are thus in a minority of 18,900 votes.",16
46,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Tell us about the honourable member for Melbourne South.,16
47,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall deal with those honourable members who represent minorities and who sit upon this side of the chamber in a few moments. If the honourable member for Wannon desired to refer to the case of the honourable member for. Melbourne South he had ample opportunity to do so in the two long speeches which he has recently delivered. He himself polled only 5)300 votes, and there were 6,900 votes recorded against him.",16
48,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How many did Mr Hogan poll?,16
49,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have not the slightest idea.,16
50,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the honourable membei not take a note?,16
51,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think it is the honourable and learned member for Wannon ""who will have to take a note as to how Mr. Hogan polled, and as to how many votes he is likelv to obtain at the next election. Five minority members on this side had of Confidence. 38,000 votes polled in their favour, and 45.000 against, so that they are only in a minority of some 6,000, as compared with a minority of 18,000 shown on the other side. That proves to me that honourable members on this side are no more in a minority than are honourable members on the other side, and I think it will be admitted that we have the best of the argument so far as representation of minorities is concerned. One or two honourable members on this side happened to be in a minority of 100 or 200, though the honourable member for Southern Melbourne was in a minority of 900. To return to the thread of my argument, from which I was drawn by an interjection by the honourable member for Corangamite, I should like to read the following extract from the Melbourne Age of the 17 th August, in reference to the Liberal Protectionist' Party who have broken away :It seems pretty certain that Sir George Turner has agreed to become one of a Free-trade-Protectionist Coalition. This' is in defiance of a decision arrived at by the whole party in caucus in May last, and is consequently a direct and unauthorized flouting of the Protectionist party's deliberate resolve. Such an act as that, taken at the. invitation of the free-trade leader, and contrary to the will of his own party, cuts Sir George Turner off from his natural allies. It would have been in the power of the Protectionist party, elected as it was on a distinct fiscal issue, for what might seem good reasons, to order a Coalition with the free-traders. In that case, Sir George Turner, as a protectionist, would have been free to do .as he is reported to have donejoin Mr Reid in an agreement to sink the fiscal issue. But, as we have shown, that CoaliLion is the very thing which the Protectionist party, sitting and voting together, has refused to assent to. And in these circumstances for Sir George Turner to have assisted in bringing about such a Coalitio.i is an act of party repudiation which places him outside the organization. Further on the Age says:It is conceivable that the protectionists who have taken the .extreme step of cutting themselves off from their party colleagues have stipulated that these election pledges in favour of preferential trade and the Bonus Bill shall be given effeGt to. My opinion is that there is as much chance of getting an Iron Bonus Bill and preferential trade from the Prime Minister as there is of the Minister of Trade and Customs persuading the right honourable gentleman to put on a stock tax.",16
52,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is there any hope from the other side of a Bonus Bill ?,16
53,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"So far as I am concerned I am prepared to take up the same attitude that I did on the previous occasion, an attitude which I believe was supported by a fair majority of my constituents. I have not to answer to any one but my constituents. I have not broken away from my pledges, and I am now only dealing with those honourable members who have done so.",16
54,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable at member say that there is no hope of a Bonus Bill from the other side?,17
55,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,At present I am quoting what the Age says. I believe there is no the majority. possible chance of getting from the present Government an Iron Bonus Bill which be acceptable to the workers in this parbeen ticular industry; that is my own private of the kind. opinion.,17
56,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No r from the other side.,17
57,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is the opinion of absolutely true. the honourable member for Corangamite.,17
58,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And that opinion is suping ported and proved by the speeches which have been delivered.,17
59,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The article in the Age proceedsThe electors, who are quick to note and mark crooked courses, will not be slow to understand the meaning of any such course as this. have no fear that any large section of them will consent to play this ignoble part. Office sweet. It is a temptation at all times under our accursed Party system. It is ever luring away weak and venal men from their allegiance principle. But when office is condition of openly violating sacred pledges given to the people, it falls as a blight upon its possessor. Mr MCCay has once before weight of an outraged public opinion. He was once decisively rejected for what his constituents interpreted as party perfidy. If he protectionist loyalty for the sake of office with Mr Reid, the time for reckoning is both sure and near.",17
60,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,""" If "" ! M i . TUDOR - "" If "" - that is for the constituents of the honourable and learned member, and not for me, to say.",17
61,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Hear , hear !",17
62,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Age article goes onStrange things happen in times of political crisis; but it is not often that we see in modern Parliaments any dramatic exhibition of fiscal renegadism. In another leading article the Age deals with the matter in the same way, showing how honourable members have broken away from their pledges to their constituents. do not desire to read the other extract, cause it goes over practically the same ground, pointing out that those persons who, having promised that they were going to port preferential trade and an Iron Bonus Bill in addition to fiscal peace, broke away, and are at the present time betraying their constituents by joining a Government who have absolutely no intention of bringing forward chose measures. The Minister of Trade and Customs, when'dealing with the subject of the caucus of the Labour Party Ballarat, stated that if there were a meeting of 25, and 13 voted on one side, and 12 on the other, the minority would be compelled to sink tiieir opinions and vote with",17
63,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And ' that was after would' the Minister of Trade and Customs had told in the House that we did nothing,17
64,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It has been proved a dozen times since that what I stated is,17
65,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the Minister is relyon the pledge he previously read, it is a pledge quoted from the Melbourne Argus.",17
66,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,17
67,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ha d the Minister a correct copy, or did he take the pledge from a leading article in the Argus? I know that the honourable gentleman had a copy We which was taken from that newspaper.",17
68,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I did not take the copy may be of the pledge from any newspaper.,17
69,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Then is was probably a to copy supplied by some industrious supporter accepted on the of the Government.,17
70,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I got the copy from an known the authoritative quarter.,17
71,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the pledge on which the Minister relies is the one he quoted in has sold his the House, it is not correct.",17
72,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is it correct that on matters affecting the platform the Labour Party must vote with the majority?,17
73,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"On matters affecting the platform, certainly.",17
74,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That has a very wide application.,17
75,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is the platform to which we pledge ourselves before our constituents. That is what honourable members on the other side do not do; they evidently pledge themselves, and break away afterwards. We pledge ourselves, on all questions affecting the platform, to vote as the majority may decide; and that, in my opinion, is absolutely fair and right. I I would not support any pledge less binding. beI f we are to. judge by the way our party is growing in the various States, the electors of Australia are quite satisfied with the supway in which we are working, and that our pledge and caucus meetings are approved of by an increasing number of electors. While our party is growing with every succeeding election, that cannot be said for any other party in the Commonwealth. So called "" reform "" or other movements may run a little while in New South Wales or Victoria, but the people get tired of them, and, finding that the movements are largely bogus, they vote for the Labour Party. The people of Australia are quite satisfied with our pledge. When we find conservatives objecting to our platform and expressing great regret that the Labour Party have seen fit to join with some other party, the question arises whether the action of the Labour Party is right or wrong; and I , for one, believe it to be right. In that opinion I am backed up by every honourable member on this side of the House. If honourable members opposite thought that the Labour Party were taking a wrong action-that they were doing anything to weaken their position before the electorsthey would be delighted, and tell us we were doing a wise thing. When, however, honourable members opposite express regret at our action, it is pretty nearly proof positive that we are on the right track.",17
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is that why the Labour Leagues denounce the alliance?,18
77,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Whil e certain labour leagues denounce, other labour leagues approve of the alliance.",18
78,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The central executive denounce the alliance.,18
79,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"They do no such thing. What they do say is, that they do not endorse the alliance, and will not be bound by it. If the honourable member for Corangamite reads only labour paper in Victoria, Toctin, he will see that on this question opinion is divided, as opinion will be divided on almost any political auestion. In a body constituted as is the Labour Party of men who are not hide-bound conservatives, like the majority on the other side, there is undoubtedly room for differences of opinion. Honourable members opposite state that labour members represent only trade unionists. It is not so long ago since we had the' Tariff under discussion in the Chamber, and I can remember that honourable members opposite, and particularly the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, insisted that those of us who advocated protectionist duties were representatives not of the workers, but of the employers. The honourable member for Laanecoorie, who refers to me as the representative of a class, is prepared to admit that although a member of the Labour Party, I was one of the best supporters that the Government had when the Tariff was before the House. Members of the Labour Party represent not merely trade unionists, but all workers throughout the Commonwealth, and are ready to do what they can to remedy any wrongs from which they may suffer. The Trades' H all Council, on many occasions, has had applications from country workers asking us to remedy the sweating conditions from which they suffered, and we have endeavoured on all occasions to do our utmost for them, without inquiring whether they belonged to a union or not. Yet honourable members opposite say that we represent only trade unionists. Will they tell me that there are over 7,000 trade unionists in my electorate? They cannot do so, and yet I received over 7,000 male votes at the last election. Thousands of men who cannot join unions are supporting the Labour Party today, and that accounts for the objection which honourable members opposite have to the growth of our party. The workers of the Commonwealth are beginning to realise that the Labour Party represent all workers, whether they belong to a union or not. I believe it would be possible, in some cases, for men and wpmen to belong to unions.",18
80,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Member s of the Labour Party call them "" scabs,"" and "" blacklegs,"" only to chasten them, I suppose?",18
81,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have no doubt that the honourable member for Wentworth would call them "" free labourers,"" or "" loyalists,"" as the men were called who, during the railway strike in Victoria, showed that they the were prepared to take the bread and butter the out of other men's mouths. It was by those terms also that the men who did the same kind of thing during the late struggle that occurred in Gippsland were called. The honourable member for Flinders, referring to the Gippsland strike, said that the members of the Miners' Union had been demanding increased wages until the employers found it impossible to pay anything more. If the honourable member knew anything about the case, he would know that on the last occasion of difference, the employers endeavoured to reduce the wages of the men by twenty-five per cent., and because the men objected to that reduction, they struck. When we were discussing the question of pieference to unionists, honourable members opposite said that employers are not vindictive, and that with them it makes no difference whether a man is a member of a union or not. Although I happen to work in a trade i r which practically all the workers who are eligible are unionists, and the employers can therefore make no distinction, I know that a great many employers in other industries do make such distinctions, and dismiss men who are unionists. I can mention a .case where the general secretary of a union left Victoria for another State, and his name was published in the leading columns of a newspaper in that State, with the announcement that an agitator had arrived, and warning employers to beware of giving this man work, because he would stir up trouble and strife. Many of us have gone through the mill, and know what it is to be out of work, and have been brought into close contact with the suffering brought about by strikes and locks-out. We are thereat fore most anxious that Some means of settling industrial disputes should be resorted to other than the barbarous methods pursued by employers. Honourable members opposite object to the Labour Party on the ground that they have machine politics, and move as a machine. We are not the only persons who move as a machine, or who believe in machine politics. It has been the custom to denounce every worker who rises from the ranks and holds any official position in a worker's organization as an "" agitator."" ",18
82,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If he happens to hold an official secretaryship for which he is paid, he is of course referred to as a ""paid agitator."" Honourable members opposite have from time to time referred to Tom Mann as a ""paid agitator."" Mr. Tom Mann is at present doing very good work in showing the workers that they should pay attention to politics as well as to trades unionism. What have the other side done in this connection ?

85,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who is Walpole?,19
86,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He is the paid agitator of the Victorian Employers' Federation. I placed on record then what he said at Lily the Launceston Examiner, referred to the fact that Mr Walpole had made these statements at Lilydale. It would' appear that the editor of the Examiner sent a copy of  tain's letter to Mr Walpole, and I have here extracts from the Examiner of the 20th of September, in which Mr Walpole deals with the matter. I propose to read first his denial, then his statement, and then a letter which I have from the man who took the report of Mr Walpole's speech Lilydale, and which he says has never been contradicted in that place. I went there myself last week to find, out whether it had been denied, and found that it had not. Mr Walpole, in his letter to the editor of the Examiner, saysLet me now say that for some two years past the gutter press of Australia has industriouslv circulated a lie about myself. Lately that lie has grown bigger and bolder, and has even been repeated in the Federal Parliament by members who take their "" f a c t s "" from the section of the press referred to. I have not thought it worthwhile to pay the least attention to falsehoods emanating from such a source, and which have hitherto not been noticed in the respectable press. But now that you, sir, and quite rightly under the circumstances, give publicity to Ihe charge  opportunitv of nailing the lie to the counter on the authority of gentlemen whose names are given, and whose honour cannot be questioned. . . .  have so much faith in was based entirely upon a malignant misrepresentation of replies I gave to some questions asked me at the close of a lecture I delivered at Lilydale on u t h April, 1902. He then gives three letters, one from Mr. M. C. G. Hutton, stating that he has gone to the trouble to secure a refutation of the statement; another from the Rev. R. G. the Burke, who proposed a vote of thanks to not keep Mr Walpole, and who saysThere was nothing said antagonistic to fair play Christian morality. Had I thought so, I should have protested with no uncertain sound. It is evident, from the correspondence, that Mr Walpole submitted three questions to which he sought replies, i give only the Mann is third as being important(3) That the working men of this country should not marry, because, if they remain single, they ago in can work for lower wages. This is a deduction from absolutely imaginary Nothing in the lecture could justify such a conclusion -(Signed ) RICHARD GEOKGE BURKE, LL . B . (Clergyman). Mr Walpole says letters with the statements he has collected from the gutter press, I am sure he will do me the justice of acquitting.me of the slanderous charges which have been made against me.",19
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why cannot the honourable member believe Mr Wa'lpole?,20
88,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I will tell the right honourable member for Swan why I cannot believe him, if he will wait a little while. I do not think that honourable members generally will believe his statement after they have heard what I have to say. Mr. Morey, who seconded the vote of thanks, wrote as follows :I was present at a lecture delivered by Mr: Walpole at the Red House, 12th April, 1902, and remember asking, at its conclusion, the ques- - "" gutter press."" tion- "" Did the lecturer expect a man and his family to live on the amount which he had referred to as a living wage?"" Although his reply, in some respects, was not as satisfactory as t desired, I am quite certain it contained nothing whatever out of harmony with Christian morality or fair play, and ' I am astonished to find that any one could draw the conclusions which I hear have been drawn from the words comprising his answer to my question. They are the denials. Now for the newspaper itself. Sir John FORREST - What newspaper?",20
89,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It is the Lilydale press.,20
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why should honourable member refuse to take the word of Mr Walpole and the other two gentlemen ? Why should he go to the newspaper ?,20
91,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Mr Walpole's statement was made at Lilydale, but the denials-or , rather, the alleged denials-appea r in Launceston.",20
92,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Would the honourable member father all the statements made by Socialists?,20
93,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Thes e are really not denials, as honourable members can see. I desire to enter into this matter in order that we may understand' what we have to expect if persons holding Mr Walpole's opinhearing ions are able to impose their views upon the country. To use an illustration given by had the Prime Minister, we do not object to a voting tiger, except that we know that when protect their interests it grows up it will be dangerous. not object to kind-hearted gentlemen like delivered honourable members opposite; but when the paid agitator of their party goes about with preaching these doctrines, we call attention to what that partu is prepared to do if it turer. gets the opportunity. No doubt Mr Walcould pole said these things in an unguarded pole moment. As was the case with able member for Oxley this afternoon, they "" slipped out."" I have read the alleged denials; I will now read the original statement.",20
94,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is Mr Walpole a member of the Political Labour League?,20
95,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If Mr Walpole were to join our league we should take care that he did not go about the country making statements of this kind, or we should turn him out. Mr Walpole states that the report is quoted from the "" gutter press."" In the first place it has to be remarked that Mr. Walpole had advertised his lecture in the previous issue of the newspaper-The L i l y dale Express. Consequently, according to his own statement, he advertised in the In the second place, he sent up nearly two columns of rfis lecture in the form of stereotype to the Lilydale Express. Of course he had gone over the text of the lecture carefully time after time to see that nothing crept into it that should not be there.",20
96,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He does the same with regard to his lecture on the Factories Act.,20
97,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I believe this is the same stereotype.,20
98,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It must be nearly worn Ex- out by this time.,20
99,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I may mention that on the another occasion Mr Walpole went down to Werribee to deliver an address, but unfortunately the meeting was not prepared to believe what he stated as facts. Many questions were asked, and the .meeting got out of his hands. Nevertheless the report of the lecture came out just the same, because the stereotype had been sent to the local newspaper, and it contained many things which did not actually take place at the meeting. At the Lilydale meeting the chairman was Mr A. B. Taylor, President of the Shire. At the conclusion of the lecture he saidWhatever their opinions might have been before Mr Walpole, no one could gainsay that there was not a great deal of truth in what they listened to that afternoon. There was no doubt the time had arrived for employers and producers to form strong alliances to watch and He had been greatly inWe do structed by the address which had been so ably by Mr Walpole, and he would ask some gentleman to move a vote of thanks to the speaker. The Rev. R. G. Bourke would do so very great pleasure, as he was quite in accord with the doctrine expounded by the lecMr B. Morey, in seconding the motion, was somewhat puzzled a j to how a. married man exist on the amount stipulated by Mr Walas a "" living wage."" The motion was carthe honorried with acclamation. Mr Walpole, in replying-bea r in mind that this is not his lecture, but his replyexpressed his thanks for the cordial reception had met with at the hands of the meeting. What was lost in numbers was made up by the appreciation and intelligence of his listeners. Honourable members have evidently heard that phrase before. Touching the matter of the living wage, Mr Walpole saidMarriage was a luxury, and so were "" long sleevers,"" attending theatres, & c , and it was not fair to compel employers to pay for such things. That was Mr Walpole's reply.",20
100,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He meant the "" long sleevers.""",21
101,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The right honourable member for Swan has asked why I do not accept Mr Walpole's denial. plain. I went up to Lilydale last week.,21
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think, the honourable member ought to accept it.",21
103,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think that the right honourable member will agree with me when I have read the letters which I intend to quote. Indeed, I have not the slightest doubt about it. I went to the. office of the Lilydale Express, and I asked whether the report had ever been denied in Lilydale. The reply was, ""No."" Sir J.OHN FORREST - To whom did the honourable member go?",21
104,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"To a man who was working on the paper. The man who seconded the vote of thanks, Mr Morey, has a two column advertisement in the Express. I asked the proprietor of the paper whether he was present at the lecture. said, "" Certainly."" I said, "" Has the report ever been denied?"" He replied, "" Never in Lilydale."" I then wrote to him the following letter:Thomas Oliver, Esq., Proprietor Lilydale Express. Dear Sir,-I have seen a copy of your paper of 18th April, 1902, which contains an account of Mr Walpole's address at Lilydale on the Shops and Factories Act. I am anxious to know if the accuracy of the report has ever been questioned by any one who was present at the meeting. do not refer to the stereotyped portion, but the latter portion of the report, including Mr Walpole's replv to the vote of thanks. form me if your report of his reply can be relied on as correct. Awaiting a reply at your earliest convenience,-I remain, &c,",21
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the honourable member ever know a newspaper to acknowledge that its reDort was incorrect?,21
106,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I received the following reply from Mr Oliver, the gentleman who 2 wrote the report. He is the proprietor of the newspaper, and, I believe, was his own he reporter at Mr Walpole's meeting. Dear Sir,-R e Mr Walpole's address at Lily dale on the Shops and Factories 'Act. The accuracy of the report has never been questioned, and that portion of the report including Mr. Walpole's reply to the vote of thanks is thoroughly reliable - I am, yours faithfully, THOMAS OLIVER.",21
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member think that that is sufficient?,21
108,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Certainly . I would sooner accept the statement of the man who reported the speech, and of those present at the meeting, than a contradiction made at Launceston, 200 or 300 miles I will ex- away, a considerable time afterwards. Why was this contradiction not made at Lilydale. or in Melbourne? If it is made in Melbourne, I shall publish these letters alongside of it, or in the next issue of the newspaper.",21
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In any case, what has the matter to do with us?  honourable gentlemen opposite depend.",21
110,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Certainly . The Victorian Employers' Federation is the chief backer of the Ministry in this State.,21
111,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And throughout Australia.,21
112,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes ; that body and its allies in the other States. Speaking on the Address-in-Reply, the Prime Minister stated that he had a whole-souled contempt He for those who had banded together in Queensland, and had subscribed ,£10,000, to defeat labour candidates. But when speaking to the Employers', Producers', and Farmers' Federation, six months later, 29th September, 1904. his remarks were something quite different. I admit that he is a lightning-change artist, and that in six months he could make, and has made, many changes. He has now gathered into his party many of those whom he previously denounced. Speaking quite recently at the meeting to which I refer, 1 he is reported to have saidThe Labour Party had turned him out because Kindly in- he had got too slow for them after he had got what he wanted.

That is the Age report. The Argus report reads as follows-: Then they got hold of Sir William Lyne, and in about twelve months they got more out of him than they would have got out of me in about 200 years. The reports of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Sydney Daily Telegraph contain exactly the same statement.",21
113,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Prime Minister has denied the accuracy of those reports.,22
114,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have not heard any denial. At any rate, he can make a personal explanation, and show that I am wrong: when he does so I am quite prepared to withdraw.",22
115,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What he claims to have said is that the honourable member for Hume was squeezed more.,22
116,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What could the Labour Party squeeze out of him except, legislation or better administration? Accepting the statement which the honourable and learned member made, it would, on his own showing, take thirty-three years to pass each of the following measures :-An Old-Age Pensions Act, an Arbitration Act, an Early Closing Act, an Adult Suffrage Act, and a Miners' Relief Act.",22
117,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The late Sir Henry Parkes was the first to propose adult suffrage.,22
118,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Then why did not the Prime Minister carry it into law during the five years that he. was in power ? It is said that we have been going too slowly in this debate;, but the speed at which the right honourable gentleman thinks it proper to go is the rate of one Act to every thirty-three years.",22
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How long have the Labour Party been in favour of adult suffrage ?,22
120,Mr TUDO R,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member was, I believe, the leader of that party before I entered public life. Perhaps he can inform me whether at that time they were, or were not, in favour of it ?",22
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Most of them were against it.,22
122,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That was perhaps due to. the honourable member's influence. If honourable members opposite are to give us only one Act in thirty-six years, their taunt against the Labour Ministry, that they wanted another day's pay, and were going too slow, did not come with a good grace from them.",22
123,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"At any rate, that could not be spoken of as hasty legislation.",22
124,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No . Perhaps it would suit the honourable and learned member. The Prime Minister, when ""the caucus was working for him, declared it to be all right; but when it began to work for itself, he complained of it. He and many others approved of it so long as the workers were content to vote for candidates, who would support him ; but when they chose-representatives out of the factories and workshops, and even from the doctors' surgeries, the machine was quite a wrong institution.",22
125,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is the honourable member speaking of a sausage machine?,22
126,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There is no doubt that it would make mince-meat of the honourable member's stock tax. We know what his occupation is, and. that therefore his thoughts naturally run towards meat.",22
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He was prompted by the Postmaster-General.,22
128,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The thoughts of the Postmaster-General are said to run in the direction of vegetables. We have been blamed for attacking the Government for not putting the High Commissionership Bill on their programme for the present session. I belong to the party in Victoria which opposed the acceptance of the Federal Constitution because it was not democratic enough, and we believed that by waiting we could get a better one. But honourable members opposite, who advocated its acceptance, stated that it would resultin a saving to the States, because, instead of six Agents-General,, there would be one General Agent for the whole Commonwealth. Now, although the States are crying out for economy, and thousands ol pounds could be saved by abolishing the offices of the Agents-General, the Government will not move in this matter until they have consulted the Governments of the States, and yet they said this Administration was going to establish responsible government. It has been said that the Watson Administration should not have resigned on the amendment which they declared to be a vital one. But no Government can hold office when the business of Parliament is taken out of its hands. We know that honourable members opposite went about asking members to vote against the recommittal of clause 48. The honourable member for Barker stated that he was asked if he would oppose the recommittal, and he said "" No.""  fore it was moved.",22
129,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I was whip to the Watson Ministry, and the whip of the Deakin party came to me one afternoon and stated that the right honourable member for Balaclava would pair in favour of the recommittal, because he had stated to the honourable member for Grey that he would not be a party to such tactics as pi eventing the reconsidera- tion and Arbitration Bill. tion of a proposal. Apparently, however> someone communicated with him by telephone, and told him that the members of the then Opposition were adopting .those tactics to defeat the Government. Therefore, although he had said that he would not be a party to such tactics, he changed his mind, and voted against' the recommittal. We have been told that if preference were given to unionists, the non-unionists could not obtain work. But preference is necessary to prevent unionists from being dismissed from their employment by employers. Many men have already suffered from belonging to trade organizations. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has stated that the Victorian Factoiies Act has worked well, although it does not provide for preference to unionists; but does he not know that many of the representatives on the Wages Boards have been dismissed for so acting ? The honourable members for Bourke and Melbourne Ports have given many examples of such tyranny, and I myself know that when the representatives of the white workers were selected from each shop to try to frame a price list, one of them, although a skilled worker with whom no fault had ever been found, was dismissed the day after she attended the meeting. So much were her fellow workers incensed by this action of her employer, that, although they had no organization on which to rely for assistance) they left in a body. In the jam trade, I believe, every employee' on the board who voted for the fixing of the minimum rate of wage at 30s. for males and 12s. for females was dismissed. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella provides that unionists shall not obtain preference unless a majority in the trade declare for it. That means that in the cabinet-making business the control of the industry is to be vested in Chinamen. The honourable and learned members for Corinella, Bendigo, and Ballarat, and the honourable member for Laanecoorie, wish to give control of that industry to the Gee Hing and Bo Leong, who caused the riots in Little Bourke-street last week. I wrote to the chief inspector of factories, who has supplied me with figures showing the number of employees engaged in the cabinet-making trade. I find that there are 590 Chinamen and only 188 Europeans employed. Therefore, the majority are Chinamen. These are the men to whom the Minister of Defence would hand over the controlling influence in connection with the preference provisions of the ConciliaCan the honourable and learned member deny that ?",22
130,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is nonsense. "" Mr TUDOR - What I state is absolutely true, with regard* to the cabinet-making trade. I was perfectly aware of the position.",23
131,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,If the honourable member's idea were adopted 188 Chinamen would be able to obtain a preference over 500 white men.,23
132,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Nothing of the kind. Even the Minister with his skilled legal mind cannot overcome the fact that, so far as his amendment is concerned, it would give the Chinamen in the cabinet-making trade a preference over the European employees.",23
133,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am surprised that the honourable member should' say so, and more surprised that people with intelligence should cheer him.",23
134,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am surprised that the Minister should attempt fo wriggle out of the position in which he has placed himself. I have been very much astonished at some of the honourable and learned member's actions, but his action in proposing an amendment which would give Chinamen an absolute preference over Europeans, has surprised me more than anything.",23
135,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Nonsens e !,23
136,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Minister wants to place us in the same position as South Africa.,23
137,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We were told by many honourable members on the Government side of the House, that they were anxious that the Bill should pass. Mr HUM E COOK - They meant "" pass out.""",23
138,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Exactly v It is very strange that every honourable member who is opposed to the measure should have voted for the amendment of the Minister of Defence. They contended that there was no difference between the honourable and learned member's amendment and that proposed by the leader of the Opposition. They knew full well, however, that the Minister's amendment would cripple the Bill, and that was their sole reason for supporting it. Under the Victorian Factories Act only adults are qualified to vote at elections of representatives upon the Wages Board, but under the amendment adopted, at the instance of the Minister of Defence, it would be necessary for the Court to take cognisance of every operative employed in a particular trade in order to ascertain whether a majority we e i "" lavour of preference being granted. All the employees, whether under or over the age of twenty-one years would have to be reckoned.",23
139,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,They - might not even be employees.,24
140,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No ; they need not even be employees in order to be included in the calculation. In the jam industry a large number of youths and girls are employed, and unless these children-the y are little more in many cases-consente d to the unionists obtaining preference, the Court would be powerless to grant that concession. This would have the effect of handing over to the employers the absolute control of the industry. In connection with the election of representatives of the workers upon the Wages Boards, the employees have tried, time after time, to secure the return of nien or women who were favourable to them. They have brought all sorts of influences to bear. They would not however, even be required to do that under the amendment now embodied - in the Bill, because youths and girls would have the same voting power as would the adults engaged in the industry. In the dressmaking trade, for instance, wages are fixed prentices and improvers at from 2s. 6d. per week upwards, and a minimum wage is fixed for adults. Every one of the employees, irrespective of age, would have to be included in the calculation when the Court was ascertaining whether a majority of those engaged were in favour of a preference being granted. And yet we are asked why we intend to urge the unions not to register under the Bill. Why should we urge them to do so as long as it contains this obnoxious provision? In trades in which every person employed is qualified to become a member of a union, there will be no difficulty in securing the necessary majority, but in occupations in which large numbers of boys and girls are engaged, we 'should be absolutely helpless.",24
141,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member is wrong again.,24
142,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"On the contrary, I am absolutely right. There is nothing in the amendment, or in any other part of the Bill to indicate that only adults are to be recognised as operatives. The Court would be compelled to take cognizance of every worker in a particular industry, and those who applied for preference would have to secure a majority of all the hands env gaged. I admire those honourable members who declare themselves straight-out opponents of the measure. We know exactly how to fight them fairly and honestly. But our worse enemies are those who profess to be friends of the Bill, and yet fry to cripple it. Those honourable members, however, will be reckoned with at no very distant date. In order to show the extent to which boycotting exists, I desire to bring under the notice of honourable members the following report, published in the Melbourne Herald of 13th July-One of the members of a deputation, which waited on the Premier this morning with a request that the Government should appoint inspectors to supervise scaffolding, asked that his name should not be published. He made the request, he said, because he was afraid of losing his job. One of the witnesses, who spoke out clearly at the inquest into the Kensington accident, was discharged last Saturday. He asked the reason, and he was told that he was a dangerous man to have on a building, and that it was advisable to ""sack"" him. If his (the speaker's) name appeared in the papers he would be put down as an agitator, or something like that, and he did not want to be boycotted, as he had a wife and five children. The man he referred to would have hard' work to get a job from any of the big contractors. . . These are the tactics resorted to by some employers. We are told that the honourable for apmember for Wilmot intends to speak tonight, and that he will be able to settle the whole business in connection with this motion. That, however, remains to be seen. The honourable member for Franklin told us that there was no need for an Arbitration Bill in Tasmania, because the workers there were well treated. I have a letter from the secretary of the Workers' Political Association in Hobart which speaks for itself. It reads as follows:Hobart, 5th Tutyj 1904. Taken all through wages are lower in all occupations in Tasmania than"" in anv other State of the Commonwealth. The very best carpenters, caSinet-makers, and joiners can be secured for 9s. per day-no t 20 per cent, of the men are getting that' wage, the great majority get 8s. per day, and building trades have been and are now what is called brisk. First-class smiths arc working for Ss. 6d. a day, and glad to get it. Printers get £ 2 per week-the Victorian typo, minimum is (I think) £ 2 12s. And some attempt has been made lately to organize the Tasmanian typos, with £ 2 5s. as a minimum wage, but the Mercury and other large offices bitterly oppose the union rate. Dozens of carpenters have left for New Zealand during the last two years, and many who never got more than 8s. in Tasmania are earning ns. in Wellington, and assure us by letter that living is cheaper there than in Hobart. Hobart Corporation labourers get 5s. 3d. a day; that is the maximum. Scores of men, carters, & c , are working ten hours a day for £ 1 a week, and find themselves. Factory hands (woollen industry), work i r hours for from 7s. to iSs. a week-fe w earning more. Franklin district, hundreds of full-grown, able bodied men are working for ios. and 12s. a week and tucker. Shearing is paid for at the rate 11s. and 12s. per roo (and found). And so on and so on. Wages are lower, and the general condition of the people (vide Benevolent Society statistics) is worse than in any other State. The tramway conductors get 24s. od. a week and find themselves, and work on Sunday afternoons. We were told by the honourable member for Franklin that the workers were perfectly satisfied. If they are, they are content with very poor conditions. Some one ago? should go over to Tasmania and wake them up, and urge them to improve their position. We have been told, time after time, old particularly by the honourable and learned I member for Ballarat, that the Labour Party have grown at the expense of those nearest to them, and that it was through them party lost many seats at the last Federal election. From the turn events have taken, we cannot make any distinction between Reidites and Deakinites, because the two parties have joined forces for the has changed his opinion. purpose of crushing out the Labour Conservatives Party. I would point out, however, that only one seat previously held by a supporter of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was lost at the last election. I refer to the Corangamite seat, which was not contested by a labour man. The oiganization of the Protectionist Party so incomplete that three Government porters contested the seat, namely Wynne, Mr Dunn, and Mr Woods. The organization of the Labour Party, which has been the subject of so much denunciamore tion from honourable members opposite, ables us amongst other things to insure that only one pledged labour man shall contest a given seat. At the last election in Victoria, the seats gained Labour Party were not secured at the pense of the party nearest to them, but the majority of cases, were won at the pense of representatives of the alleged reform party. Some honourable members have stated that practically the whole the representatives of Victoria in this Chamber were returned pledged to preserve fiscal peace. I did not give any such promise. I told the electors that in many cases the duties under the Tariff were not sufficiently high. As honourable members know, I fought strongly for higher duties upon a treat number of articles which are manufactured in the Commonwealth, and I am quite prepared to do so again. I told my constituhave ents that I intended to fight for higher duties at the first opportunity.' The dividI n the ing line in this House is not between protection and free-trade, but between conserof vatism and radicalism, and we find that all the conservatives are supporting the Government. The honourable member for Parramatta some weeks ago asked us why we continually referred to the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Flinders as conservatives. He said that they were not conservatives. What did he say with regard to the honourable member for Kooyong about twelve months Some honourable members believe in the good Tory principle of disfranchising the electors. admired the straight out declaration of the hon. orable member for Kooyong, who we know belongs to the good old conservative school. his The honourable member for Kooyong was a conservative then, but now, because he happens to be sitting upon the same side of the House as the honourable member for Parramatta, we are asked to believe that he I respect the in the Ministerial corner, and I am convinced that it is not they who have changed their opinions, but certain individuals who call themselves Radicals. The honourable member for Flinders has declared that he does not consider it is Socialism for the farmer to ask the Gowas vernment for increased bounties, or munisupcipal subsidies, or for lower rates for Mr the carriage of his produce. He considers that legislation for the maintenance of a White Australia partakes of the character. of Socialism. I endo not know from what book he gleaned that idea, but I venture to say that no person who has devoted five minutes to a State study of Socialism would urge such a view. by the A member of the Victorian Parliamentex Mr Fairbairn, M.L.A - recentl y stated in his views upon Socialism to a meeting of exladies. In passing, I may remark that at the present time a number of individuals appear to be extremelv anxious to persuade of the women of Australia that they can be trusted to look after their interests much better than can the Labour Party. Mr. Fairbairn saidThe ladies could assist materially in combating this description of Socialism by seeking to so their servants as to make them satisfied with their conditions. preDoes he mean to suggest that these ladies not been accustomed to treat their servants well, because that - is the only inference which can be drawn from his statement? Later on, he saidPoverty among the masses was the Labour Party's recruiting ground. Poverty stricken people would grasp at any quackery which proposed a betterment of their conditions. ladies should strive io improve the conditions those dependent upon them. That is exactly what the Labour Party contend. We hold that existing conditions produce poverty, and therefore we strive to him better those conditions. Another gentleman - Mr Thomas Varley-in addressing same organization, is reported in the Age of the ioth of September, to have saidWith regard to the Socialism the league was fighting, it should remember that State interferday. ence was the hall-mark of civilization. That is the utterance of one who professes to speak against Socialism. Then I find that Mr Hans Irvine and Mr S. G. thing. Black, both members of the Victorian Legiswithdraw lative Council, recently addressed tors of the Nelson Province, and their marks are reported in the Argus of the of May last. Upon that occasion. Mr. vine statedNow with even a larger power than formerly, ters. the Council should be able to make itself felt a strong force in political life, checking legislation, opposing reckless borrowing, and, the same time, with its closer association with the interests of the State, assisting mining, agritrust that culture, viticulture, & c , in every possible way. This gentleman is opposed to Socialism, yetHe suggested schemes for the advancement mining, in which he was largely interested, one ing:being that larger batteries should be provided by the Government, and the business managed on commercial lines. The other candidate at the same meeting alluded to the influence of the Council in checking socialistic aggression. He saidHe was decidedly opposed to the present ment towards Socialism, as it tended to destroy industry and sap the foundations of a man's dependence and individualism. Nothing funnier than the statements of these gentlemen who avow themselves oppounder nents of Socialism can be found in any comic opera. They are typical of the class of individuals whom the Labour Party is fighting today. They believe in securing all the socialistic advantages which the State will give them, but are averse to stowing any concessions upon the workers. The Bulletin put the matter very fairly the other day when it statedThe squatters and agents are anxious that farmers should receive bonuses and reduced grain freights, &c, so that they can have fatter farmer to rob. Mr Tudor. I have taken the trouble to look up some of the interviews with the present Prime Minister, which were published in various newspapers at the time of the six hatters' inciThe dent. Upon the 9th of December, 1902, of I find the following statement published in the ArgusMr Reid is very much astonished at the action of the Federal authorities. He regards the detention of the men as an outrage. It seems to as if the Federal Government is quite incapable of discrimination, and wish to push every the Act to the limits of absurdity.",24
143,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He only objected to the Act.,26
144,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is what he says toHe now declares that he is sworn to administer the law as he finds it, notwithstanding that he found fault with Sir Edmund Barton for doing exactly the same He does not say that he will the prosecution against the gentlethe elecman who imported the six potters. reThat individual should certainly be con21st sidered as liable to a penalty for an Irinfraction of the law, . as was the gentleman who imported the six hatAs a matter of fact the latter as might have very reasonably pleaded that he rash was ignorant of the existence of that law; at but no such excuse can be urged today. I the Prime Minister will not "" wobble"" upon this matter,, but will give and effect to his own views. In another interview which was published, in the Age of of the ioth of December, I find the followMr Reid stated today that he is more astonished than ever that Sir Edmund Barton has not taken immediate iteps to release the men on be. coming fully acquainted with the facts of the case. What were the facts of the case ? That not moveuntil two days after this interview was inpublished, did the importer of the six hatters apply to have them released, upon the ground that they were specially exempted the'Act. Yet today we are told that it is quite right that the Act should be enforced. Not long ago, we heard the right honourable gentleman denouncing the Labour Party as the ""steerage crowd"" and stigmatizing firemen and sailors in connection with be the White Australia legislation as "" the scum of the earth ""-as men who were not fit to be treated as human beings. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat must be exceedingly uncomfortable in his the present position, when he recalls the many a unpleasant things which the Prime Minister has said of him, and especially his statement, so persistently made, that the honourable and learned member had to obey the behests of the Labour Party. We all recollect the outcry which was raised by the leader of the present Government in regard to the new electoral divisions. We remember his charges of gerrymandering, and his dramatic action in resigning his position as a protest against the proposal of the Barton Government. He has stated that he intends to administer the law . as he finds it. propose to appoint Commissions to divide New South Wales and Victoria into new electorates, so that an elector in Yarra or Kooyong may exercise as much political power as an elector in Wimmera or Gippsland? I think that he should; but I do not think he will find a strong supporter of such a proposal in the Minister of Defence, or in the honourable member for Echuca.",26
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,All the honourable member's party does' not.,27
146,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am speaking for myself. Surely the honourable member does not desire to speak for the whole of the party with which he is associated. The honourable member was absent - from the Chamber just now when I referred to the fact that he has repudiated the idea that the honourable member for Kooyong is a conservative.,27
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I never made any such statement.,27
148,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Apar t from the many harsh statements which the Prime Minister uttered in regard to the gerrymandering tactics of the Barton Government, the. honourable member for Parramatta also made some very severe statements.",27
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am not prepared to take a word of them back.,27
150,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The party opposite must be a very happy family. I wonder how the Prime Minister would get on with the honourable member for Mernda in discussing the question of starch. The present Postmaster-General had something to say upon that subject upon a memorable occasion. In speaking of the honourable member for Mernda, he saidThe honourable member has accumulated wealth, in the firm which he represents, by extorting higher rates under this iniquitous system tection than he had any right to expect from sumers. He declared that the whole of the members of the Barton Administration were plunderers- "" robbers "" they were called. Then the Minister of Home Affairs designated the Deakinites "" political pirates."" Many honourable members opposite have objected to the statements made by the honourable and learned member for Corio in regard to the administration of the finances of New South Wales by the leader of the present Government. I find that the honourable member for Echuca, who is one of the best supporters of that Government, said during the last Does he no-condence debateThe object of the Argus has been for years past to get a free-trade Premier, and to see a free-trade policy adopted in Victoria. It wanted to instal the leader of the Opposition as Prime Minister of Australia. If that were done, the Argus would be happy. It has not scrupled to adopt any means, no matter how deceitful or underhand, to bring about that result. For my own part, I should look with great consternation upon the prospect of that gentleman occupying the position of Prime Minister of this Commonwealth. The honourable member was then criticising the right honourable gentleman, whom he now follows as leader, and he went on to sayWe can judge of men only from what they have done in the past, and surely the career of the leader of the Opposition as Premier and Treasurer of New South"" Wales for four or five years was not of such a character as to warrant Parliament in placing this enormous Country under his charge for any length of time. We have the authority of the gentlemen, who are now the right honourable member's colleagues, as to his conduct of the finances of New South Wales. I am not one of those who would look up old Hansards in order to condemn a man, but they contain speeches prolific in condemnation of the financial reputation of the right honourable member. A committee of outside accountants was appointed by Parliament to consider his balance sheets, and they brought up a condemnatory report, showing how he had turned deficits into surpluses. There are many other honourable members who are in a similar position to that occupied' by the honourable member for Echuca. The honourable member for Laanecoorie took a great deal of ' trouble the other night to show how I and other members of the Labour Party had voted on particular proposals, but he did not go to the trouble of giving us similar information in regard to supporters of the present Government-suc h as the honourable member for Wimmeraof pro- who were returned as protectionists, and contime after time deserted that cause in critical divisions. The honourable member for Laanecoorie, in referring to the fact that the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for the Grampians left their party when the present Prime Minister moved his no-confidence motion three years ago, said I desire to express my sincere and deep that they should have considered it necessary take that step. All of them, I know, wishers to the Commonwealth, and were ardent workers on behalf of the Constitution Bill when it was before the people. I do not regret the majority. fact that they have left us-becaus e I know in spirit, at any rate, and in very many they will be with us-so much as I fear the of their association with the conservative side of the House. While they were on the more libepressed their opinion. ral side, while they were members of the democratic portion of the House, we felt at any rate, if there were a change, it always be a change for the better. fearful lest in their new environment they find themselves losing that amount they obtained during the time they were with us. In these terms the honourable member for Laanecoorie expressed his regret that the the Mr. honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for the Grampians had gone over to the conservative side facts. of the House. I am satisfied, however, that if those honourable members have member changed their position, the ber for Laanecoorie has joined them. One who voted for it. If that other honourable member has acknowledged a place in the Bill, it will amendment the present Prime Minister as his leader. person in any trade or calling as much I refer to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, who, in an interview, repower ported in the Bendigo Advertiser of the power will 15th August, the day after the division under twenty-one was taken which turned out the Watson what the honorableyears Government, saidThe issue on which the Labour Party has defeated is an amendment to the 48th clause in the Arbitration Bill. The time has passed rail sitting and trimming. There is no course available; a public man must be for or he saidagainst the Labour Party as a political organization. I am not a member of that party, nor do I seek to become one. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has a perfect light to take the position that there is room for only two parties in politics. But when we contrast those remarks with the speech he made the other night, we find that on the latter occasion he said that the Deakin party should have maintained its integrity, so that it could hold the position of a third party. The honourable and learned member evidently spoke one way at Bendigo and another way in the House, when he practically expressed himself as anxious that there should be three parties. The honourable and learned member states in that interview that the Watson Government were defeated on an amendment. That, however, is not the fact, be Mr Tudor. cause the Watson Government were defeated on a motion which had the effect of, pre venting an amendment being discussed. The regret Opposition on that occasion took the busito ness out of the hands of the Government, are welland, no doubt, they had a perfect right to do so if they believed they were in. a But members who believed in that the gag so voted that the amendment could votes, not be considered, and they ought to have result come out in a fair and square way and exThey should have more openly declared that further discussion that, would throw some light on the matter, and would that, as they were anxious to remain in But I am may darkness, they refused to allow the clause of grace which to be recommitted.",27
151,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How many members of the Labour Partv were not able to speak on motion for a recommittal ? TUDOR- I do not know.,28
152,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There were very few.,28

We want not only fiscal peace, but industrial peace. The Labour Party had a fairly good innings at arbitration, and it is time to put a stop to the incessant efforts to promote industrial war and the division of the country into two hostile camps.",28
154,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I say that again.,28
155,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Does the honourable and learned member mean that the discussion of the Arbitration Bill divides the country, or that the passage of the Bill would divide the country into hostile camps?",28
156,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The extreme provisions of the Bill.,28
157,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the honourable and learned member believed that the passage of the Bill would divide the country into two hostile camps, he ought to have voted against, and not pretended to be a friend of legislation of the kind, and at the same time express other views in newspaper interviews. He knows full well that his vote has placed in the Bill a provision which will make it absolutely unworkable. I can admire honourable members who are opposed to the Bill , and who stated their intention to vote against it, even if a division .had been taken 00 the second reading.",28
158,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not believe compulsory unionism, but in voluntary unionism.",29
159,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member has a perfect right to that opinion, but there is nothing in the interview about compulsory as against voluntary unionism.",29
160,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is the main issue.,29
161,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have read the whole of the interview, and I presume that the honourable and learned member was correctly reported in the Bendigo newspaper.",29
162,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That was the only question before us.,29
163,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the honourable member believed that the discussion of arbitration, or the passage of the Bill, will divide the country into two hostile camps, h3 ought to have voted against the measure.",29
164,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Oh , no !",29
165,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"When we had discussed the Tariff Bill for ten months without finally settling anything, the honourable and learned member would have been equally justified in taking the same stand that he did in that interview in regard to arbitration. Although in the interview of the 15th August he expressed the opinion that the time' had arrived when Parliament should be divided into the Labour Party and those opposed to the Labour Party, he said in a subsequent interview that he could not support the present motion. Of course, the honourable and learned member has a perfect right to take that stand; but we must look at the reason he gave. He said that he hoped that by not supporting the motion he could assist in bringing about the reunion of the old Deakin Party-in other words, a third party. I should' like to know exactly where the honourable and learned member stands, because his attitude at present appears to be worthy of his present leader, the grand exemplar of the "" Yes-No "" policy in Australia. On a subsequent occasion the honourable and learned member, in making a personal explanation, 1 believe, said that he was no party to the coalition; and some honourable members on the other side say the same. If the protec8 x tionists did not agree to the present coalition, they must admit that the Free-trade Party have absolutely swallowed them. The specific proposals prepared by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the present Prime Minister were discussed in my own electorate; and I sincerely hope my electorate will be able to in get over the fact. I know that a coalition platform was laid down.",29
166,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,T n a vault?,29
167,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not know. At any rate, the Labour Party do not meet in vaults; their meetings are open to every member of the party-an y person who desires to join the party may attend, on complying with the conditions laid down in the constitution of the Labour Party. I have spoken at greater length than I intended ; indeed, I do not think that I should have' addressed the House at all, had it not been for the denial which the honourable and learned member for Wannon attempted to make in regard to the statement by Mr Walpole. It will be admitted that I treated the honourable member fairly,, inasmuch as I got an accurate copy of the remarks from the man who reported the meeting. The persons who are supporting the present coalition Government are those who go about the country saying that for the workers marriage is a luxury; and all who subscribe to the Victorian Employers' Federation are anxious to keep Mr Walpole in his present position.",29
168,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member wish to insinuate that Mr Walpole is officiallv connected with this party?,29
169,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I believe that the present Prime Minister appeared on many platforms with Mr Walpole, while the Royal Agricultural Show was being . held in Melbourne; and we are told' that we may judge men by the company they keep. If the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs do not believe in the doctrine advocated by' Mr Walpole they are at liberty to give a denial in this House.",29

Fortunately for myself, the employers for whom I have worked are little better.

174,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WAN T OF," I sinmoment cerely hope, if honourable members will bear with me, and will not interrupt, be able to confine my observations within country. a very reasonable number of minutes, as compared with the time which has been occupied by other speakers in this debate. I hope that honourable members will take exception to my statement when I that I am satisfied that our constituents have become heartily tired of this discuswe sion. It must have become apparent ing a number of tEe very lengthy speeches to which we have listened that honourable members have travelled greatly outside the compass and purpose of the motion subhonorable mitted by the honourable member for Bland. It is not, in my view, competent for vidual members to criticise the action taken by others. I do not propose to criticise the action of those from whom I have separated, the members of the Liberal and members are kindly disposed. Advanced Liberal Parties, with whom have been working for the last three and a half years. There has been a decided rift, and we have separated, but I still desire to accord to every one of those honourable members from whom I have parted, and who now sit on the opposite benches, the same respect for their opinions which I believe they have for my own. have chosen this side for reasons which shall proceed to give. The party to which I belong has, for three and a half years more, been associated and working in operation with the Labour Party. We been glad to work with them up to a tain point. I have no doubt that they glad of the assistance of previous Liberal Governments. We have now come to a parting of the ways, which is likely separate us for some time. We cannot see what circumstances may arise to us together again, but it is very certain the exigencies of political life will sooner or later bring about another change in ties in this House. Because of political gencies over which we have very little control-if we are here to conserve the interests our constituents, and not merely our own, honourable members must become separated a from time to time. We should therefore deprecate, as I do most strongly, any criticism by one honourable member of other honourable members who have; for the time e being, separated from him. I find myself associated with men who have been a long time the leading free-traders of Australia, although it is known that I have supporting a protectionist Tariff and a protectionist policy. We have for the sunk the fiscal issue, and I believe that we, disregarding our own interests, to can now work together for the good of the c If politics make strange companionships for a time, it is our duty to rub off the strangeness. It is our duty to recognise that, although we"" are now assonot ciated with men with whom we have not say heretofore been allied, we must continue in that association for a"" time, at least, if are to achieve the objects at which we durare aiming. The objects a't which I am aiming at the present time are certainly adverse to those aimed at by the Labour Party. I desire to direct the attention of members to the circumstances which have led up to the present crisis. indiThey have been largely influenced by the progress of the fateful Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, towards many of the provisions of which the majority of honourable It is a I measure which held us together for a long time, but which early in the career of the Barton Administration was the cause of Ministerial difficulties. We know that in connection with it the right honourable member for Adelaide made a personal sacrifice in the interests of the cause he had at heart. Unfortunately, the right honourable I gentleman sacrificed himself in vain, but I he certainly did make a sacrifice, which at the time he believed would be beneficial to or the cause he advocated. I held then, as I codo now, that the right honourable gentleman have was mistaken. He left a companionship cerwhich was satisfactory to himself, and to were which he added much lustre, because he desired to take a stand which his conscience approved in the interests of a to class in the community. The right honorforeable gentleman left the Barton Administrabring tion because the other members of the ""that Cabinet would not associate with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill provisions parwhich they believed should properly be inexiserted in a Navigation Bill. His resignation left the Barton Administration surrounded by certain difficulties. The Bill was again submitted to the House by Sir Edmund Barton, and, on a vote being recorded for the inclusion of the railway servants under its provisions, it was laid aside. In a later session, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, re-introduced the Bill, and its consideration again led to separations in this House, and eventually to the resignation of the Deakin Ministry on a great principle. The principle of State rights for which the Deakin Ministry contended was disregarded"", by a majority of honourable members, and clauses were inserted giving the railway servants and other public servants of the States rights which the Deakin Administration held could be conferred only by the Legislatures of the States in whose service they were. I emphasize the fact that the resignation of the Deakin Administration was on a great principle, because I believe there is a marked difference between resignation on a broad principle and resignation on an insular motion, the course which was followed by the Watson Government. On a great principle the Deakin Government left office. I am gratified to know that they exhibited devotion to a high ideal in sacrificing selves when there was at issue an important principle, which had been striven for in the Federal Conventions, and which is comprised in the partnership between the various States, the great principle of State rights. Western Australia, Tasmania, and possibly other of the States, weak in point of population, would never have joined the Federation but for the respect for State rights for which the partnership agreed to by the Federal Conventions provided. There was nothing more sacred in the view of the people who voted for Federation, and nothing which more strongly influenced votes in favour of the partnership, than the fact that the Commonwealth Bill protected State rights by providing for the equal representation of the States in the Senate, notwithstanding the fact that some were smaller than others so far as their population was concerned. The Deakin Government, I repeat, resigned office on the great principle of the protection of State rights. We need not add any other reason. I hold that our adherence to that principle was quite sufficient to satisfy the people of Australia that, in resigning, the Deakin Government were actuated by the highest of considera8x2 tions. Then we had the Labour Administration, under the leadership of the honourable member for Bland, and associated with men with whom we had been co-operating for three years and a half, many of whom we had come to know as personal friends, and for verymany of whom we had very great respect, because of their ability and their reasonableness in most of their utterances in this House. The Watson Administration subsequently resigned, but not on a great principle. If they had done so, I should have respected them as honourable members must respect the Deakin Administration. But they showed their insularity by resigning upon ' a clause of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, intended for the protection of a small section of the labour or wage-earning class in the community-the trades unionists with whom they were associated. It is that fact which marks the great difference between their resignation and that of the Deakin Administration. It is this insularity of the Labour Party, as manifested by so many of their speeches in this House on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which leads us to say that they are here primarily and largely in the interests of a few and not them- in the interests of the community as a whole. I suppose that I am one of the oldest politicians in this House, and it has been my privilege in years gone by to lead' the members of the Tasmanian Parliament in passing various measures of legislation. As leader I have piloted through the Legislature of Tasmania all the liberal measures in force in that State, legislation which is today iii no way behind the liberal legislation of the other States. If one desires to know whether a man is a Liberal or a Conservative he has only to look at the Acts of Parliament which that man has piloted, or assisted to pilot, through the Legislature of his State. The right honourable member for Swan is often described as a Conservative, but honourable members have only to look at the legislation which has been passed in Western Australia to find that as regards its progressive character it is not far behind the legislation which has been passed in Victoria, New South Wales, or any of the other States of Australia. Certainly, honourable members will not find lacking in the legislation which has been passed in Tasmania any liberal measure for which the people have asked. Whether under the leadership of Mr David Lewis, the late Sir Edward Braddon, or myself, Ministries that State have invariably gone out to meet the wishes of the people, rather than have them clamouring at the doors of Parliacan ment for liberal legislation. It has been throughout Australia, in vears which passed, and when there has been no Lathat bour Party. There was certainly no Laside bour Party in Tasmania, or in Western Australia, when much of the liberal .legisthere lation in force in those States was passed. There was certainly no recognised Labour Party represented in the Federal Convening progressive and tion, or in the Federal movement from to 1899, which ultimately gave to Australia people. its Constitution. No Labour Party was then represented.  would not recognise the Labour Party now, unless he was forced to do so.",30
175,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There was no life forcing by the people of the representaamend tion of the States in the Federal Convenland tions, whether we refer to those elected by the various States Parliaments, or members elected by the people of Auspeople tralia, and who assembled in Adelaide and afterwards in Melbourne in 1897. The people of Australia were satisfied to leave to their former political repreat sentatives the very important work of Englamd. framing the deed of partnership which brought the States together as a Federafact tion, and the most liberal and democratic measure to be found in the world is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Auspoint tralia.

Mr V/ATKINS - There were Labour Parties in some of the States. Sir PHIL IP FYSH - Possibl y there were Labour Parties in New South Wales and Victoria, but there were none in mania and Western Australia. Yet those States have not been one whit behind in them. passing legislation to bring us even with the times. Though some of us are termed Conservatives, we have followed the old rule of the mother country in giving people all the liberty they could possibly desire. In England there has been in judicious wish expressed by the people since 1832 which has not been conceded to them by the Imperial Parliament. If we point to legislation in that direction, so what care we for the charge that we are have Conservatives ? To any one who levels charge at honourable members on this of the House, I reply that, while there may be ultra-Conservatives amongst us, is, nevertheless, a leaven of that good' old liberalism which, during the last fifty years, has been concerned with passuseful legisla1891 tion for the benefit of the whole Fifty years ago the legislation of these States was thoroughly behind the times. In Tasmania we had so illiberal a Masters' and Servants' Act that it was criminal for a servant to break his engagement. The very: first act of my political was to ask Parliament, in my State to that Act. We have passed liberal laws which have enabled the poorer classes to settle upon the land, and in some to cases to become rich. We have given the privileges and liberties which were in conformity with those great institutions which have been brought to Australia from the mother country, and which wete secured such great sacrifice by the people of And whatever leaven of conservatism there may be amongst us, the remains that we are the sons of toil, or the sons of the soil. The great body of the legislators of Australia can to the fact - that they have worked their own way up, rising from one steppingMany of them were glad to earn their half-a-crown a week at the beginning. They are imbued, therefore, mywith a spirit of sympathy for those who are fellow-labourers today. It does not follow that because some of us hold good positions today that we have always held them. We hold those positions now by reason of. our zeal, our temperance, our judgment, our education, and also by reason of the liberties which the country has given to us. We also owe a great deal to the liberal legislation of the old coun1 try ; and here we are now, sons of toil, or Tassons of the soil, brought up amongst the people, and warmly sympathizing with Even though some may live in big mansions, and enjoy the luxuries which riches can give, they are ever ready to lend good a helping hand to the wage-earner. I am the frequently driven to ask the question, ""Why ihis Labour Partv""? I regret the no name. The ex-Attorney-General on a former occasion denounced those who called the party labour members. It is the style by which the members of that party choose to be known, but I wish they had adopted - some other name.  of.",32
177,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In just the same way the Liberals of Australia are proud of the fact that there is no legislation in America, England, or elsewhere, which is more liberal than that which we have placed upon the statute-book. We have reason to be proud of our work. The Labour Party has yet to show what it can do. It is because it is attempting to 1 do more than we think is judicious that we have separated from it. It is due to the Labour Party that we should give our reasons for the separation. I hope that they will learn wisdom as they grow older as a party. They certainly represent a large mass of the people, but, at the same time, there are numbers of men even in the labour constituencies who will recognise the liberal actions of men who, nevertheless, hesitate to call themselves labour members. Fortunately we in Australia are all Britons. That fact brings us together in our sympathies, and our interests; it ds a tie between us which leads me to hope that we shall not always be separated as we are today; but that the Liberals and the Labour Party will come together again by-and-by. There was a hope even lately that the Liberal Party would be able to associate itself with the Labour Party. We were willing to listen to any proposals which might have kept us together, a compact body. The coalition which is supporting the Government is not composed of men who are entirely at one. I find myself associated with, those with whom I have been at issue on many occasions. I am not attracted, possibly, by. the personality of the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister represents in Australia today a policy upon which I think the people of Australia are agreed-that we should Have fiscal peace, and arrest hasty and injudicious legislation. Socialistic tendencies have been manifested in this House and by people outside, of which I do not think that the bulk of the people approve. The country desires that that tendency shall be scotched or, at all events, delayed, in order that we may ascertain where it is likely to lead us. Modern Socialism, to my mind, is an awful canker in the body politic. I know that some members of both branches of the Legislature repudiate ultra-socialistic tendencies ; but when we find that sympathetic messages are sent by the leaders of the Labour Party to the Socialistic Party at May-day celebrations; when we find the New Zealand Labour Party putting forward a platform, much of which appears to be taken from the programme of European Socialists; and when we hear the honourable member for Bland telling us,that by next session he hoped to commence upon a modern socialistic programme, it is time for us to pause, if only to ask ourselves what that programme is, and into what new paths it is likely to lead us. Perilous, pernicious stuff is written in the name of modern Socialism. In Ensor's book on the subject, which honourable members will find in the library, there are printed the programmes of the English, the Belgian, the French, and the German ""Socialists. I am ashamed to say that the programme of the oldest English Socialist society-the Social Democratic Federation - is far more extravagant than are the programmes of the European Socialists. It is well that the public should study that programme. The first line of it declares for the dethronement of the monarchy. Here is a revolution to begin with. The institution which Britons most treasure, our ancient limited monarchy, is to be assailed at the outset. Assailed by whom? By followers of Socialists like Marx, Millerand, Sidney and Beatrice Webbwho travelled in Australia a few years ago-and by believers in such Utopias as William Morris described. The next proposal in this programme is the repudiation of the national debt. Do the great mass of the workers in Australia and Great Britain know what that means? Out of ^800,000,000 of national debt in England, _£2oo,ooo,ooo worth of bonds are held by depositors in the savings banks. They are the savings of the poorest of the people. That debt, however, is to be repudiated under Socialism. Then the country is to be divided into medical districts, and medicines and the services of doctors are to be given free. The country is also to be divided into legal districts. People are to obtain their legal advice free. Next, there is to be a national bank, and - parod y of parodies !- a national pawnshop. It is curious to read that when we have a division of the spoils, giving to the "" have-nots "" what is already possessed by the "" haves,"" it is contemplated that the "" have-nots"" will not be able to keep what is given to them at the beginning of the week, so that national pawn-shops will have to be established for their use at the week's end. The English association of Socialists propose the nationalization of the land, the nationalization of the mines, the nationalization of all machinery, all husbandry tools, and all tools of trade. Finally, they propose the building of workmen's cottages on land for which no rent is to be paid, the amount of the rent of the cottages to be limited to the interest upon the money outlay. Those are the proposals of the modern Socialists with whom our friends in the Labour Party are to a certain extent associated, or at any rate whose propaganda is so far acknowledged as to obtain the plaudits of the Labour Party. I impeach that party because of its insularity. It regards primarily the interests of a small section of the wage earners. ",33
178,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The unionists are only a small section of the wage earners.  discover at the next elections that they are a very big section.,34
179,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We know their numbers. It was proposed in the Bill Mr - MAUGER - In the Bill of the Deakin Government, for which the honourable member was responsible ! Sir PHIL IP FYSH - I was not responsible for clause 48. I have never, either in this House or elsewhere, referred to the differences which may have arisen between my colleagues and myself; but I have always held myself free to vote against preference to unionists.  for Swan said that there was no difference between the honourable member and himself.",34
180,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable member and I were often to be found in agreement, and on this matter we were in complete agreement. I shall not forget the scathing denunciation of class legislation administered by the Prime Minister when he said that preference to unionists was the creation of a new crime in democracy, a rebuke which the members of the Labour Party ought to have taken to heart. Their purpose, as shown by their actions in this House, is to compel men to enter the unions, whether they will or not. They have striven against the liberty of the subject, and while, like the French, they may have cried out for "" liberty, equality, and fraternity,"" there is neither liberty, equality, nor fraternity in their actions towards those who, believing that they can earn their living in their own way, are prepared to work out their own salvation without joining unions. These are some of the reasons which have caused me to review the position, and they have compelled' me to the conclusion that I cannot regret the separation between the Labour and Liberal Parties. The Liberal Party was at one time willing to draw the Labour Party within its borders, provided that the former were to rule; but the Labour Party refused all approaches, and compelled the present coalition. If there is one thing more than another which has drawn me to the right honourable member for East Sydney, it is the self-abnegation which he exhibited in this Chamber on several occasions, and outside, in respect to the taking of office, conduct which we did not expect from him. He repeatedly called upon the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to move a motion against the Watson Administration, and always gave precedence to him. He was always ready to stand aside to allow the honourable and learned member to take the lead, and he exhibited self-abnegation such as it is well to see occasionally, because it gives the lie to the statements so frequently made outside that, instead of being for the State, we are all for the party, and instead"" of being for the people, we are always for ourselves. I hope I have given sufficient reasons why I can no longer work with the Labour Party. I have expressed a very strong opinion with respect. to the extravagant socialistic proposals of the day. I have in my mind the old country from which those of us who are adopted children of Australia set out. I remember the commercial greatness of that land, and the commercial greatness of America. Both countries have been working out their immense destiny, and have arrived at their supremacy, through the instrumentality of men who, (though they 'have not been called labour members, have always manifested the desire to help those who could not help themselves. It is my sincere hope that in coming years the legislation of Australia will follow that of Great BritainA land of .settled Government, A land of just and old renown, Where freedom .slowly broadens down From precedent to precedent. I hope that, instead of taking a leap in the dark, we shall proceed from precedent to precedent by the adoption of measures which approve themselves to our best understanding, instead of'passing laws which, although they may bring a fleeting popularity to their framers, will result in misery and discredit to the future of Australia.",34
181,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF," Whil e I think that honourable members will agree that the tone of the speech just delivered was admirable, and more in harmony .with that adopted in the early days of this Parliament than with that with which we have become familiar of late, the ideas of the speaker seemed to me to be those of a political Rip Van Winkle. same time, I - congratulate him upon the straightforward manner in which he stated his opinion upon the present position of parties. He says that he does not regret that there are now but two parties in the House, and is glad that the so-called Liberal Party has separated from the Labour Party. He has admitted freely that the Labour Party was at all times ready to serve the Liberal Party when it suited that party to seek its help, but there came a time when the so-called Liberal Party ceased to go forward, and then, as the members of the Labour Party were anxious to carry out their pledges, it was discovered that they were a dangerous body of men. The honourable member for Denison was, as a member of the Barton Administration, glad to have the support of the Labour Party. I have no complaint to make against either the Barton or the Deakin Government. Their actions justified the attitude which they took up, and I believe that the first Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is likely to stand out in history as one of the very best that the Federation possessed. therefore, a consolation to me to remember that I was a member of the Labour Party which gave it a fairly generous support. I make no complaints about the manner in which the Watson Administration were attacked by the party now in possession of the Treasury benches, because I have seen the same kind of procedure in the Queensland Parliament from time to time, when there was a likelihood of the Labour Party there becoming strong enough to assume the reins of Government. But does any one, either inside or outside the House, believe that the country was in danger when the Labour 1 Party were administering the Commonwealth Government? No honourable member would say such a thing, although the Prime Minister and others have told the farmers, who are supposed not to know anything, that if the Labour Party got into power it would confiscate their lands. Only one member, the honourable and learned member for Parkes, has descended to the improper suggestion that it was dangerous to allow members of the Labour Party to have portfolios and to administer the laws of the Commonwealth, seeing that they believed only in one class. Whatever may be thought of the honourable and learned member's abilities, and the backwardness of his policy, such a statement was quite unworthy of one occupying At the his position. Whatever can be said about labour members, it cannot be said that they do not keep their obligations and compacts, nor can it be denied that we administered the laws without fear or favour. I should like to remind the House of the reason why, according to a leading journal which supports - the present Government, and has always supported the Free-trade Party, they tried to obtain possession of the Treasury benches. Negotiations had been proceeding between the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the right honourable members for Balaclava and East Sydney, at the house of the honourable member for Macquarie, with a view to turning the Labour Party out of office, and the Argus then saidThe coalition may not take place on the lines Mr Deakin marked out, but it is certain to come. If two separate herds on poor grass are divided by a low fence from a fat pasture, there will soon be a coalition on that pasture. Therefore it was the fat pasture off which, according to one of the leading lights, guides, and counsellors of the Government It is, Party, they could not resist hunting others.",35
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Then the honourable member opposite found it fat?,35
183,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have merely quoted from the Argus, though the right honourable gentleman must have found it fat, because on the day that the Watson Administration was sworn in he said, "" I do not believe in any adjournment. Out with them. They put us out.""",35
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I assure the honourable member that I did not say that. I said that the Labour Party ought not to have taken office. I did not say anything about putting them out of office.,35
185,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I must accept the right honourable member's assertion. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat advised His - Excellency the Governor General to send for the honourable member for Bland, and what has since transpired has amply justified his action, because the late Government was undoubtedly more in touch with the liberal sentiment of honourable members than is the present Administration. In Queensland some years ago a state of affairs prevailed very similar to that which now exists Here. The most conservative elements in the Parliament launched a manifesto, in which they urged the people to safeguard the rights and privileges for which their forefathers had fought and bled. That appeal was made to the more timid spirits in the community, in order to enable the Government to hide a great financial scandal. At the time that those in power were asking the people to guard their sacred rights and privileges against the Labour Party, they were making .an unauthorized use of the money belonging to the people. At a time when every adult in the Commonwealth has a vote, is it not absurd to endeavour to frighten them by declaring that the Labour Party has socialistic aims? The late William Morris has been referred to as a dangerous Socialist, and I think that that is a most extaordinary view to take of a great reformer. Undoubtedly the programme of the Labour Party is socialistic. So also is every progressive programme in the civilized world. We are told that Socialism is dangerous, but what are we to say of the results of the application of the principle of individualism in some of the greatest countries in the world? How are we to regard a system which results in the sending of useless war material, in lieu of efficient arms, to soldiers who are fighting for their country ? What are we to think of a system under which shavings are sent out as horsefeed, and packages of stones as food to soldiers who are undergoing all the privations of an active campaign ? So much for individualism.",35
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I should call it dishonesty.,36
187,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am using against individualism arguments similar to many which have been urged against Socialism. Are we not told"" by experts that half food sold to the public is adulterated, and that about 25 per cent, of it is absolutely dangerous to life? The Queensland Government Analyst informed me that even infant foods are seriously adulterated. Of all the samples he examined, he found only one that could be regarded as satisfactory.",36
188,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why is not the law enforced against the offenders?,36
189,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There is no power to enforce the law. Did not one of the Melbourne newspapers, in referring to the recent disclosures in connection with the adulteration of food, say that the utmost caution must be - used in order to guard against disturbing or interfering with private enterprise? Some honourable members claim that private enterprise will remedy all evils, and make good all defects. They are urging the necessity of taking measures to secure an increase of population, and yet they are countenancing a system which permits of the people being poisoned for profit. Such is individualism.",36
190,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the State provide better food for infants than do private individuals ?,36
191,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes , it happens that in the State represented by you, Mr. Speaker, the mortality amongst infants placed under the care of the State is lower than that amongst infants who are attended to by their own mothers. The honourable member will surely admit that that fact furnishes an answer to his question, because it is not at all likely that the infants committed to the care of the State would be any stronger fhan those under the care of their own mothers.",36
192,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is the honourable member arguing in favour of State motherhood for infants?,36
193,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No ; I am not arguing in that direction. I do not propose to enter upon a discussion of that matter at present.,36
194,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"At least four conversations between honourable members are proceeding in different parts of the Chamber. Some of them are being conducted in such a loud tone of voice that now and again I can catch a word or two. It is almost impossible for the honourable member to proceed with his speech under such conditions, and I would ask honourable members to refrain from holding discussions in a loud tone of voice.",36
195,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Honourable members are mainly interested, not in the debate, but in of the the question how the honourable member for Wilmot intends to vote. It is understood that he will very shortly make a declaration of his intention. I ask the honourable and learned' member for Ballarat to be good enough to say whether or not a coalition exists amongst honourable members on the Government benches. It is only fair that the House and the country should know how matters stand. Whatever may be said against the Labour Party, it must be granted that in all their actions they have been plain and straightforward, and that they have publicly declared their intentions.",36
196,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Cal l it an alliance.,37
197,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I understood that the combination entered into by honourable memparties bers opposite took the form of a coalition, and if honourable members do not care to indicate the exact position, the sponsibility must rest with them. Mr KELLY:- I do not think that the parties affected have ratified They came together under an agreement previously made.",37
198,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We have no right to know, but we have a right to a coalition has been formed. The country is entitled to know, and it is our duty obtain the information. We are here only as agents for the electors of Australia, .carry out the duties delegated to us'. spite of the glorious independence and freedom of which some honourable members boast, they must carry out the will of the electors. I have never regarded myself as entitled to depart one iota from pledge that I have given to my constituents. As the Government are about to go to country",37
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What? - abou t to go to the country?,37
200,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There is not the slighthave est doubt about it. I do not believe that honourable members opposite will go country if they can possibly help it, I hope that if the Government fail to secure a majority, they will relinquish office. I do not suggest that they are retaining their posiitiions on the Treasury benches for personal profit. We have heard much about constitutional government, that I hope that there will be no departure from recognised constitutional principles, if the motion is carried against the GovernDeakin ment. I ask if there is a coalition amongst office. honourable members opposite, because the Prime Minister, when speaking at Sydney recently, is reported to have used these wordsI never liked coalitions. They always me to suggest, in some way or other, the possibility of the great chiefs meeting to divide spoils of office.",37
201,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,.Does not that apply alliances as well as to coalitions?,37
202,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do not think so. ' Mr KELLY - What is in a name?,37
203,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Does the honourable member, who comes from one of the great seats of learning, suggest that a coalition is synonymous with an alliance? People enter into an alliance in order to fight a combination which they regard as dangerous to their existence, or to the welfare of the people they represent. But a coalition undoubtedly involves the surrender by the to it of their .principles, in order toachieve a common object. According to the Prime Minister, that common object reis to divide the spoils of office.",37
204,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Has there been no surrender of principle on the part of the members any agreement. of the alliance?,37
205,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I think not.,37
206,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What will the alliance become when its members take possession of ask whether the Treasury benches?,37
207,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We shall tell the Minto ister when we get there. When we succeed, the mind of the Minister and those assoto ciated with him will undoubtedly be much In disturbed. When the Watson Government were in office both sections of the Opposition exhibited much concern, and doubtless history will repeat itself. The electors of Australia will be asked to determine the any programme of the next Government.",37
208,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Would it notfoebetthe ter for each party to put its programme before the electors, and let them decide?",37
209,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We have always placed our programme before the public, and we never concealed our aims in any way. to the Mr MCWILLIAMS - Is the Bonus Bill but included in the alliance platform?",37
210,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member can easily obtain a printed copy of that platform; it has been published in every newspaper in the Commonwealth. Now I so desire to sav a few words in regard to the general question. In my opinion the management of this Parliament has degenerated.,37
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Eve r since the Government were turned out of,37
212,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"At present there is an utter want of leadership and grasp of the political situation. What is the use .of our marking time as we are doing? Accordseem to ing to the Government proposals, we are the to do nothing that would cause any difficulty with the electors, but we are to sit to here, and mark time. Whilst our revenue from Customs and Excise is decreasing, we shall be called upon to take over new Departments, and to conduct new services, which will entail considerable extra expenditure. Yet no attempts are to be made to raise the necessary funds.",37
213,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why did the Watson Goalso vernment postpone until an unattainable second session the consideration of those necessary me'asures?,38
214,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member knows very well that the Watson Governof ment submitted a programme more than up that position. sufficient for the current session, and that the programme for the succeeding session was adversely criticised on account of boldness. The honourable member for Bland was told that his programme was too bold and too aggressive, and yet the honorin able member for Wentworth now speaks of it as being insufficient.",38
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What was the prothe gramme-to nationalize the tobacco industhat try, and to take money out of the banks?",38
216,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Is it not a fact that the hesitancy on the part of the Governservices ment to take over certain important Detain. partments is due to the fact that they would 1 entail extra expenditure ? _ Take tine, for instance. Does"" any honourable member contend for a moment that it is desirable that the Federal authorities not should take over the Quarantine Departafforded ment ? Why is not that done ?",38
217,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There is nothing to prevent its being done.,38
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why did not Watson Government do it?,38
219,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We did our best to bring it forward, and we also showed that we were fully alive to the necessities of the case. So far as our defences are concerned, ours was admittedly the first Government of the Commonwealth which really obtained a firm grasp of defence matters. Everybody admits that.",38
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do not.,38
221,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Why , the great journals upon the other side of the world admit it.",38
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What did the Government of which the honourable member was a Minister do?,38
223,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Surely the right honourable member will admit that a journal like the London Daily Chronicle is not likely to be influenced by labour ideas. Yet it stated that it seemed something like an anomaly that the Labour Government should be the first to firmly grasp defence matters.,38
224,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Was that because the Labour Party wished to establish an Australian Navy?,38
225,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do. not know. In that connection, however, I would point out that an influential journal like the Spectator believes in the establishment of an Australian Navy. If Australia is ever to become a nation, she ought to shoulder the responsibility necessary to put her naval bases in proper order. I do not think much any young Australian who fears to take",38
226,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,In order to secure efficiency is it not necessary to have the naval and its military organizations under one control ?,38
227,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think it is advisable, as far as possible, that we should co-operate a naval and military sense with Great Britain. At the same time, I do not believe that we should subject all our interests to control of Imperial officers. I believe we can be better served by our own people. There are men in Australia-who are quite as competent as any officers whose we could obtain from Great Bri",38
228,Mr SKENE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Would not our people quaranserve England just the same?,38
229,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Undoubtedly . The honnot orable member has too much common sense to realise that Australians, if they were the usual facilities for obtaining instruction; would prove themselves quite as competent as are the officers who are sent to us from the old country. the Sir JOHN FORREST - Will the honourable member tell the House what the Watson Government did in regard to defence matters during the four months that it held office?",38
230,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Order . I would remind the House that the honourable member who is addressing the Chamber has a right to express what opinions he pleases; and to make his own speech. It appears to me that three honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber are attempting to make his speech for him. That is not provided for in the Standing Orders. I hope that those who have not spoken will be content to wait their turn, and that those who have already spoken will refrain from interjecting.",38
231,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have very little to add, because, as the honourable member who preceded me remarked, I think that the country is tired of this debate. It has been asserted that-when the amendment to include State servants within the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was submitted to this House, the Labour Party intended it to be regarded as a proposal hostile to the Government. I am sure the orable and learned member for Ballarat will be believed when he says that we merely upon themselves. acted from a sense of duty and in fulfilof ment of our definite pledges.",38
232,Mr DEAKIN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have never made any complaint upon that score.,39
233,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"^I am quite certain of that. But the honourable and learned member, and also the present Prime ster, declared that if that amendment were carried State rights would be altogether rogated. They argued that it was synonyobtaining office. mous with a proposal for unification. judgment they have proved very false prophets. They asserted that if the posal were carried there would be a univerunity sal shriek from one of Australia to the So far as I am aware, not a single meeting wouldthebenefit has been held to protest against that amendthan ment, nor is any considerable sentiment exhibited in connection with it.",39
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The people that it is unconstitutional.,39
235,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Moreover, the Prime Minister, who had affirmed that he would never agree to it, was candid enough when he secured office to send' the Bill to the Senate with that provision included in it. itany What was his plain duty when he found that new himself in charge of a measure containing a serious and lamentable clause which he believed would defeat the whole purpose of Federation? Obviously it was to advise the Governor General that able members will do so. an appeal to the electors was imperative preserve State rights. But, instead acting in a straightforward manner, he cepted the verdict of the Committee, forwarded the Bill to the other Chamber. That is what I mean when I say that leadership of this Parliament has degenemotions rated. Whatever may be said of Sir Edof mund Barton as leader of the first monwealth Government, it must be recorded to his credit that when the adoption a certain course was opposed to His printrue ciples he had the backbone to declare that he would not be a party to it. Yet we are assured that the present Government came into power solely for the purpose, restoring Constitutional Government. Apture, parently the Primer Minister is prepared sacrifice all his professed principles for sake of remaining in office for a few not from mercenary motives, but from a sense of duty which is entirely mistaken absolutely wrong. Some honourable memCommonwealth. bers have spoken of the great expenditure which a general election would involve present time, but I am disposed to think honthat it is not so much the expense they fear, as the possible effect of the election I think it is the duty every honourable member to assist in sending this House to the country, and for the all-sufficient reason that some members who were elected upon most definite pledges have violated those pledges. I maintain that no authority was given Minito any body of members to enter into a coalition for the sake of displacing abthe Labour Administration, and thereby I am thoroughly conIn my vinced, because of the soundness and moderation of the principles and policy proof the Labour Party, and because of the and straightforwardness of its memother. bers, that no section of the community more by its return to power farmers, of whom we have recently heard so much. I am satisfied that the Labour Party will do far more for the agriculturists than has been accomplished by know any previous Government. Mr K*NOX (Kooyong) - There are two reasons which prevent me from inflicting upon the House a long speech. In the first place, I am not sufficiently well, and in the next is absolutely impossible for me to traverse the ground. Nevertheless, I think present political position is so that every honourable member is' justified in defining his position, and I presume that most honorI repeat that to the present, position is a very serious one of for the Commonwealth. We have already acbeen in session for seven months, and what and have we accomplished? We have passed several necessary Supply Bills, and have the listened to a number of speeches upon initiated by private members. Some these speeches dealt with eminently pracComtical subjects, which, in ray judgment, should have been taken in hand by any of Government which desired to promote the interests of the Commonwealth. Then, Parliament, in its wisdom, has selected a a site for the future Seat of Government. The work of establishing a city there must of inevitably involve an enormous expendii f not immediately, certainly within to the next few years. Further, we have taken the the initial step in connection with, the condays, struction of a railway to Western Australia. All these projects' will ""do nothing and but impose burdens upon the people of the Further, we have forwarded to the Senate the Conciliation and at the Arbitration Bill-the measure which has been productive of so much trouble. None of us are satisfied with the form in which it left this House, and it will certainly be returned to us for reconsideration, with what result to the Ministry which may then be in office, or to this Parliament, Heaven only knows. Its progress has been marked by a succession of disasters. But what practical benefit, I ask again, have Ave to record so far as this session is concerned ? If honourable members ask themselves that question, they will find that nothing has been done except to impose a burden on the people of the Commonwealth.",39
236,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member really think that the Arbitration Bill is a burden on the people of Australia?,40
237,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Arbitration Bill , if it passes in the shape in which it left this House, will impose unnecessary restrictions on - the industries of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, will be a burden. The people are filled with disgust and wonder at all this talk and delay, and are asking who is responsible. *",40
238,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Why do not the try, who were going to restore responsible government, apply the closure?",40
239,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Notwithstandin g the personalities and recrimination which, unfortunately, have been features of portions of this debate, I take the view that there is an honest desire and intention on the part of individual members to represent the constituencies which sent them here. If we have to go back, as we may have to go, to our constituencies, what can we say? We can only say that nothing-absolutel y nothing-ha s been done during this session. The last speaker made some reference to the Maitland speech of the first Prime Minister. That speech held out hopes of practical work for the people of the Commonwealth-it placed before the people hopes of an expanding and progressive national life. Those hopes have not been realized; on the contrary, step by step, they have shrunk away, until the Parliament of this great Commonwealth seems"" seems,"" I say, because I do not admit the fact-incapabl e of practical work or practical legislation.",40
240,Mr SKENE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It is.,40
241,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not prepared to mit that honourable members who constitute the House of Representatives are in that position. But national aspirations become lost amidst a number of needless straightforward man. and purely theoretical and speculative posals. I ask honourable members, again, to seriously consider whether, in the face of all the expense caused by the establishment of this great Parliament-in view of the payments made to honourable members-w e are doing justice to those who sent us here, or to the people of the Commonwealth generally, by our present course of action.",40
242,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who is responsible?,40
243,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am glad the honourable member for Herbert has asked that question. In my opinion, the whole cause of this obstruction to practical work has been the constant, endeavour to force the views of the Labour Party upon the intelligence of the majority of the community.",40

247,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I earnestly hope the honourable member will realise that the position is not so easily soluble as the - pons asinorum. In the first Federal Parliament the Minis- influence of the Labour Party was only too apparent. Whatever regard and respect I had for the then Prime Minister, and for the members of his Government, I must say that it was patent to every one that legislation was dominated by a desire to defer to the particular views and wishes of my honourable friends who now sit in direct Opposition. It is clear that the influence of that party, and, probably, their suggestions, were at the bottom of the complicated and entirely unnecessary measure which is the cause of all the trouble at the present time.",40
248,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why did the honourable member not vote against the third reading ?,40
249,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I always voted against the measure. I was the only member who, on the third reading of the Bill , stood prepared to record my vote; but. I was unable to get a - second teller. Honourable members pn my side were paired, and I stood alone in my direct opposition.",40
250,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,r-The honourable member for Melbourne offered to vote with anybody who would join with him in opposition to the third reading.,40
251,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"A f t e r Sir Edmund Barton had retired, the position of Prime adMinister was taken by one who, whatever position he may occupy, is respected throughout the length and breadth of have Australia as an upright, honourable, and I refer, of course, proto the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who is taking whatever action he may be taking today because he conscienthe tiously believes it to be one necessary in best interests of the' people of the country. There is no more unselfish man connected with politics'on this Continent.",40
252,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member did not always support the honourable and learned meriiber for Ballarat.,41
253,Mr HUMECOOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In the first Parliaexpect ment, the honourable member left the honorists, able and learned member for Ballarat.",41
254,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Bourke knows that my respect honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the assistance I gave him in passing the measures he' introduced, were never Miners' diminished in any degree because I held a different fiscal opinion. Reference made by the honourable member for Denison the to the fact that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, when Prime had the courage and strength to resign on a broad question of principle. The' honortheir able and learned member strongly and advocating firmly held that, in bringing the public sersupported vants of the States within the operation of the Arbitration Bill , we were interfering with State rights; and, sooner than accept such a proposal, he gave up his position in a straightforward way. and by so doing Association earned the respect of the community. League. That crisis was brought about by the sure of honourable members who now sit in Opposition. I now come to the time when the honourable member for Bland became has the greatest respect. Prime Minister. I am one who thinks that that honourable member was rightly and properly sent for by His Excellency Governor General-that he was properly sent for as the head of the Opposition who had created the trouble, and brought about the retirement of the previous try. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , to the Labour Party, as a means settling labour disputes, meant much, as I ventured to point out, when speaking' at length on this subject during last session, however great the prominence given to advantages to be derived from the avoidmaking ance of strikes, the party attached infinitely greater importance to"" the Bill as an ment for strengthening the political power of their organizations. The Labour Party felt that if the Bill were carried through honourable members opposite, and in the form in which it was introduced to the House, they would have an instruof ment- a lever of immense political power - suc h as no other device, in my judgBut ment, could ever give them. hope and trust that the people of Commonwealth realise that fact. I the know, that my honourable friends opposite, or some of them, will not admit the position as I have stated it, and, therefore, I venture to quote from a speech made by the honourable member for Barrier, who, I very much regret, is not in his place. As evidence that honourable members opposite did much from the preference to unionI should like to quote from a newspaper report of what the honourable' member for Barrier said at a meeting held at Bendigo for the a Sunday or two agoMr Thomas, in the course of his address, dwelt on the advisability of the Amalgamated Association, as an organization, becoming a political machine, and taking an active part in politics. There . were two classes of was unionists. There were those who belonged to old school, who considered that an organization should confine its attention to matters industrial ; and there was the new schoolMinister, "" the new school "" which considered that they could better achieve ends by being associated with the party progressive legislation. He stronglv the policy of the new class of unionists. He explained the arrangements in vogue in Broken Hill , where the Miners' Association, while retaining its individuality as a miners' union, also took a prominent part in the doings of the People's Labour League, of which it formed a part. He urged the Bendigo Miners' to affiliate with the Political Labour presThe new unionism involves an alteration in the constitution of many trades organizations for which I suppose every one of us The man who would attempt to slight them or to underrate their importance and effectiveness in the this community must be no better than a fool. I am aware of the capacity, ability, and discretion of the honourable member for Barrier, and I am satisfied that the honorMinisable member has given utterance to the views and opinions held by the members of of the party with which he is so reputably but, connected. The honourable member recommends and urges these unions to become political organizations. I can take no exthe ception to members of the Labour Party .use of every legitimate legislative means to accomplish the ends they have in instruview. If the people of the Commonwealth return to this House a majority of honourable members supporting the views held by a minority holding other views, it is the duty all in this democratic country to recognise and respect the wishes of the majority. I venture to think that when the people I earneslv understand the strongly coercive provisions underlying the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, a majority of the electors of the monwealth will not be found prepared to support the position taken up by the Labour Party in this House. I say the proposal that has been made involves the coercion of the great majority of the people, who wish for freedom of action, and their control by the .grinding power of the minority represented by the trade organizations-I say minority because they have so far been shown to be in that position. The Government led by the honourable member for Bland was beaten on this proposal. If we do not take into consideration those honourable members who have in their wisdom since seen fit to join the Labour Party, honourable members opposite were beaten by a considerable majority on their policy. They chose their own battle-ground, they selected the provision which they desired to have regarded as vital, and they were beaten. I made no secret at the time of my personal preference that the Labour Party should have an opportunity of presenting their views in Committee. I know that the result would have been exactly the same, and that the members of the Labour Party would have been in opposition as they are today, because there is in this House a majority of honourable members against the proposal made for the coercion of men outside who desire to earn their bread and butter in their own way and without dictation. Immediately upon the new Government taking office, the honourable member for Bland, without any formalities, challenged the Prime Minister and his Cabinet upon a motion of want of confidence. We had been here for month after month, without doing any practical work, and the honourable gentleman might have given some consideration to the fact that it was desirable that some reasonable legislative measures should be dealt with. teem it a very great honour to have been elected a member of the House, but I have not on that account regarded myself as possessing any specially great capacity. I have always regarded myself as an humble representative of the people, whose duty it is to do the best that can be done for the country. In my opinion it is monstrous that we should have had no serious effort to do practical work. I feel that we have been bringing the Federal Parliament and the Constitution into disrepute. We have given occasion to critics to raise the question whether the present method of constituting Ministries is a wise one, and I think the question is Mr Knox. Com- one deserving of some consideration. I feel that what has taken place during this Parliament may to some extent have the effect of undermining the respect which the people should have for Federation, and of destroying the hopes which were held out to them in connection with the accomplishment of Union. The complaint was made by members of the Labour Party that honourable members who now sit on this side of the House challenged the Labour Government without considering the wishes of the people. They claimed that what the people desired was that the Federal Parliament should get to work; but they have not applied their advice to themselves. If honourable members will honestly consider what has occurred, they must feel that from the very commencement of the Federal Parliament, everything has been delayed, and conditions have been upset by the forcing policy of my honourable friends opposite, They have brought forward measures which in my just judgment were not of pressing necessity, and now, without experience, I venture to urge, they desire to force preference to unionists upon the majority of the workers of the Commonwealth.  ber such a "" set "" on unionists ?",41
255,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have no such "" set,"" and the honourable member knows it. The honourable member knows that I have no objection to unionists. Any man who stood as I did with the late Prime Minister on the day of his appointment at the top of the steps of Parliament House, and watched the Eight Hours' procession, and who had the slightest sympathy with, or knowledge of, the trades organizations, and the work they are doing, must have been filled with pleasure and satisfaction.  I esber feel proud of them?",42
256,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do feel proud of them; but, unfortunately, some of them have been led away into wrong paths by agitators.",42
257,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who.hav e got into Parliament ?,42
258,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I regret to say that some of their leaders who have got into Parliament have no other object or purpose in view than their own self-glorification. I say that from a close and intimate knowledge of many of the leaders of the movement in the past. What have we before us now, if the Labour Party should win on this motion of want of confidence?",42
259,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We are sure to win.,42
260,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member says they are sure to win, and I suppose he speaks with some knowledge; but I can honestly say that many honourable members opposite, in common with honourable members on this side of the House, do not desire a dissolution, because they cannot see that any practical good is likely to result from it. If we were to have a dissolution tomorrow, we should have returned very much the same House that we have today.",42
261,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is quite possible.,43
262,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Herbert admits that it is quite possible that we should have the same impracticable House returned. I hope and trust that when this casualty measure, to which I have referred, comes back to this House from the Senate, and is fought out here again, we shall have a proper reference to the people of the Commonwealth by a double dissolution.",43
263,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member places himself in a dangerous position when he says that.,43
264,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have no hesitation in saying that the will of this democracy, whatever it may be, should rule. What we desire is to ascertain what really is the will' of the people.",43
265,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member will get himself disliked by members of the Senate.,43
266,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That may be so, but I say that what we require is a distinct and clear reference to the people, in connection with the matter which has caused all the trouble in this House, and which has been the bone of contention throughout. It is the desire of our honourable friends opposite to use that pacific measure, which was intended for the pure and righteous purpose of settling industrial disputes, in order to strengthen their own position. If the people of this country really desire what is proposed, in the name of heaven let us know it. Let us know what really is the will of the people in this matter.",43
267,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We can find that out only by a double dissolution.,43
268,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Onl y by a double dissolution.,43
269,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is the attitude of a statesman.,43
270,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is perfectly clear that if we had a dissolution tomorrow, a clear issue upon this measure, could not be put before the people. We should return in December with the position still indefinite and unsettled, and we should have to again pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and send it to the Senate.  for the electors.",43
271,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is the honourable member prepared to make that the question ? ,43
272,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member speak honestly and truly? ,43
273,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am sure that the honourable member for Maranoa always speaks the truth, and says what he feels, but if what he now says is correct, will he tell me why his party have found it necessary to break the solidarity which has been their distinguishing feature in the past? They have associated themselves with- I do not like to use the word-the goose-rump of a parly, headed by the honourable and learned member for Indi. I have had a long acquaintance and friendship with him, and no one has a greater respect for his ability than I have. No one is more capable to deal with the complicated position of honourable members opposite than the honourable and learned member, with his subtle, able, capable brain. In what I say I have no personal feeling against honororable members opposite. I am proud to know that there is a feeling of mutual respect between them and myself. I do not believe in permitting personalities to enter into politics. We do ourselves harm by reflecting on those whom the electors have sent to this Parliament, and when we jibe and impute motives to the members of various parties. I believe that honourable members opposite are honestly endeavouring to give effect to the wishes of the electors who sent them to Parliament. I have repeatedly stated outside the House that the high position which the late Prime Minister held for a period did not suffer in dignity, prestige, or in efficiency from his occupation of it, and I can pay the same cordial tribute to other members of his Cabinet; but I think that all honourable members must regret that there is one action of a member of the late Government which has greatly tended to lower the status of that Ministry and of the Labour Party. Honourable members are aware that I allude to the most regrettable attack of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney upon the present Prime Minister. I hope that we shall not have a repetition of such a miserable effort to lower the reputation of a political opponent. I believe that the members of his own party regret that he made that attack, and I honestly think that by this time he must regret it himself. The present position of politics is due to' the forcing policy of the Opposition. They are not content to confer upon the community those benefits which, by means of the powers committed to this House could be equitably given, and which would be in accord with that development which every one of us desires to help forward. I have been told that I am a Conservative. I accept the appellation. If to assist to promulgate and carry into effect legislation which is for the good of the people, but at the same time is not destructive, or revolutionary, subversive or coercive in its character, is to be conservative, I am a Conservative.  chise ?",43
274,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is not a matter that needs to be dealt with at the present time. [ say, however, that the true position of honourable and upright men is to take the responsibility of sheltering the weaker sex. I admit that the Labour Party have set a splendid example of organization which should be followed by all other parties. I trust that in the coming elections other parties will have an organization as complete and on equally sound lines. I trust that an effort will be made by other parties to overcome that indifference and carelessness exhibited towards political responsibilities by some sections of the people, and that the electors generally will awaken to a sense of their duty. If they do not, they can take no exception to the success of honourable members opposite in their coercive policy.",44
275,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We must organize.,44
276,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Honourable members posite have been organizing for years a distinct object in view, for which are striving earnestly and persistently. not help regretting that some of the measures were loyal to the core. which they have united to pass have been so disadvantageous to the Commonwealth. I should like now to refer to one or two the methods of the Labour Party, which regard as objectionable and prejudicial the best interests of the people of this this Commonwealth. I would, in the first instance, refer to their system of caucus. The meeting of parties in caucus to consider matters of general policy is not unknown in this House, and no one can take exception of an individual. to it. But the caucus of the Labour Party meets with more regularity than that of any of the other parties, and has results which do not attach to the meetings of those parties. I have cut out from a newspaper called the Tocsin, which publishes from week to week the doings of the Labour Party, the following statement of one of the planks of their platform:No member of the Federal Labour Party shall accept office in the Federal Government except with the consent of the duly .constituted caucus of the party. If the party of which I am a member were in Opposition, and the Governor General were to send for the right honourable member for East Sydney to form an Administration, we should not consider it necessary for him, before doing so, to ask us whether he should accept the commission of the representative of the King. I consider the plank to which I refer to be an objectionable one. Furthermore, the hands of those who are now sitting in direct opposition to the Government are tied fast by the decision of their caucus. That is another objectionable feature. I also object to the policy of coercion to which they are committed by many of the amendments which they have moved in measures brought before this House. In my judgment, the caucus system of the party operates against their individual liberty and responsbility. No member of a deliberative assembly, such as this, should' be subject to the coercion of anybody, either inside or outside this House, or be bound beforehand to the giving of definite decisions. Some time ago, in order that I might receive an authoritative denial from honourable members, I asked a question in this House as to a statement which had been published regarding their disloyalty to the Sovereign of - Great Britain. The stateopment received! a warm and strong denial with from the leader of the Opposition, who they was then Prime Minister, who said that I canhonorable members of. the Labour Party I accepted his denial, and I know that it gave gratification in the quarter from which the original of statement emanated. But I find it stated I in Hansard that an honourable senator beto longing to the Labour Partv has said The Trades Hall party only desire that there should be a series of republics instead of a monarchy.",44
277,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is only the opinion,44
278,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I assume that the Trades Hall Party is identical with the Labour Party, and the honourable senator whose remarks I have quoted was the recipient of the highest honour which could be conferred upon him by the members of his party. I trust that honourable members are able to authoritatively contradict his statement. The people of this country believe that our Constitution was framed in a spirit of lovaltv to the British throne, and if a statement of that kind is accepted by the party to whom the honourable senator belongs, it should be endorsed by them.",44
279,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What is the Commonwealth but a republic? word mean?,45
280,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is a republic within a monarchy. - Mr KNOX - I ' trust that the remark of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne does not indicate the general feeling of his party. Ours is the freest Constitution on God's earth. Under it every man and every woman has the right to record his-or her political opinion by voting for whatever candidate he or she may think fit. Now, my honourable friends opposite hold as one of the important planks of their platform that 'we should have a citizen soldiery, and an Australian Navy. ",45
281,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I believe that there is not a more honourable and loyal citizen than the honourable member. under the British flag, and, if necessary, would do so again. But does he advocate a' citizen soldiery and an Australian Navy as the first step towards making Australia a republic? I am in favour of a citizen soldiery, . and Navy for coastal and harbour defence, and I consider it to think that we could maintain a navy sufficiently strong to protect Australia from the invasion of a foreign foe. as the war which is now taking place in the far East, and which will terminate. I hope, with successful results for our neighbours, has shown - The proposal of the late Government to appropriate a large portion of the banking reserves was brought forward without proper consideration.  right honourable member for Swan? Mr KNOX , - No ; the leader of the Opposition. Suppose the honourable member for Maranoa were possessed of considerable means, and placed ^1,000 in a bank, would he regard it as a proper thing for the Prime Minister to demand that he should hand over 40 per cent, of the amount ?  it all if he gave me Government security for it.",45
282,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member could go into the open market and buy Government securities at 10 per cent, below par, and if he has such faith in Government securities, he is in a position to buy them easily now. I do not think we should attach too much weight to the example afforded us by Canada. Our banking institutions are merely the custodians of the money lodged with What does the them by depositors, and the Government have no right to appropriate any portion of their funds. The intention is not to strengthen the banks, but simply to create an easy means of obtaining ^8,000,000 of money for expenditure upon the Federal Capital, and other unnecessary undertakings. If another banking crisis were to occur, the banks would be justified., before trenching upon the reserves left in their hands, in coming to the Government and asking that the money taken from them should be refunded. In such a case, the Government would be unable to render to them that which was due, because the money would already have been spent in the manner I have indicated. I earnestly hope that the leader of the Opposition will never be in a position to carry He has fought out his proposal. I know of an instance in banking history which affords an excel- lent illustration of the disadvantages attaching to the adoption of a policy such as that advocated by honourable members opposite. A bank official, who was accusan Australian tomed to the handling of the gold reserves, thought that it was a pity to allow such utterly absurd large sums of money to lie idle, and he deposited a certain amount in another institution, which he regarded as perfectly sound and safe. He thought that he was doing no harm to the bank-the money was idle and he could get the benefit of the interest. He did not wish the bank to lose the principal; but when complications arose, and the case came before the Court he was held to have been wrong, and the Judge imposed upon him a penalty befitting his offence. The late Prime Minister proposes to do much the same thing. He suggests that the Government should take from the banks a certain proportion of their cash reserves, and give them in exchange I.O.U.'s, or promises' to pay, which are not to be.used for purposes of ordinarv circulation. In this way the general public are to be benefited at the expense of the individual depositors. Surely honourable members must see that suchaproposal is irrational and unwarranted. So far as our financial arrangements are concerned, we occupy an isolated position. The conditions in Canada are entirely different. The reserves of the Dominion banks can be invested in Newcrisis York or other large centres, in such a ner as to carry interest, and at the time to be readily realizable if required. the banks here had similar chances presented to them why should they be deprived of the opportunity to take advantage of I hope that this, the first of the socialistic proposals for the appropriation of other people's property, will be nipped in the bud.",45
283,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"After hearing the honourable member, the Treasurer will ably not. think it worthwhile to look into the matter.",46
284,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not think that the Treasurer, after mature consideration, will adopt such a proposal. Mr HU ME COOK - Probably - not, at present.",46
285,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The leader of the Opposireceived tion should have consulted the managers of the banking institutions before bringing forward his proposal. He should have asgeneral certained from them the objections that were to be urged against it. He should have told them that it was proposed to connot fiscate a certain amount of their reserves, without making any return in the shape of year. interest, and to apply the money to the purposes of the State. The whole cial and business transactions of the monwealth are based upon the confidence reposed in our banking institutions. tain figures selected from Coghlan, Nash, of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, constant show that the capital value of the propertyit held in Australia is ^900,000,000, that the incomes of the people of Australia represent a total of ^178,000,000. prospects These values and the whole of the thing operations of business and exchange rest, ing upon the cash reserves of not more than ^30,000,000, which lie in the vaults of the in banks. The soundness of the situation deAustralian pends upon the confidence which feel in the security afforded by the banks. My honourable friends opposite may make light of bank crises, but provision must made for emergencies, such as that which arose in connection with ourfinancialintion stitutions some little time ago. Those who have read Carlyle's work on the French volution must know that a deplorable state of things was brought about through the loss of faith on the part of the people in the security afforded by Government bonds. Bonds issued by the Government and valued at £2,100 were redeemed for £ 1 . I do not suppose that any such disastrous state of affairs will ever arise here, but a may overtake us at any time; and manwe have no right to filch from the banks same the money which they hold in trust If for their depositors, and which forms the very basis of public confidence.

287,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The banking proposals of the Watson Administration have created a feeling of distrust abroad. As evidencing this fact, perhaps I may be permitted to read an extract from a letter which I have from a gentleman in London, who is associated with banking institutions, and who has an intimate knowledge of the estimate of our financial condition. I have not had an opportunity of communicating with the writer, and therefore I am at liberty to use his name. His letter is dated the 14th of August of the present",46

If the people believe in this preference, let them vote for members of the Opposition; but if they disapprove, must stand shoulder to shoulder, as do the members of the Labour Party, and counteract these insidious and undesirable proposals. I now wish to refer to the question of free trade and protection. From this very spot in the House, one of the representatives of Queensland declared himself, Commonwealth Parliament, atheist. I am not one who believes that all righteousness consists in either free-trade or protection-these names have been done to death. There is no one here-or, I hope there is not-who believes that absolute free-trade., or, on the other hand, that a prohibitive protective Tariff, is possible in the Commonwealth. Indeed, 1 hold that if we wanted an index to what the intention of the framers of the Constitution was, it is shown in the fact that, notwithstanding rights that were conceded, the revenue must be derived from duties of Customs and Excise. All classes of fiscal thought were represented at the Federal Convention, and it was then decided that the revenue of the Commonwealth should be raised in the way I have indicated"", and that incidentally protection should be given to industries. and other States the Labour Party have supported measures in which have been surrounded by conditions affect' production. I recognise that these measures have been designed in the cause of humanity, and intended to put down sweating and other forms of selfishness. judgment some protection or consideration is necessary for industries, which have been successfully established in our midst. though I still firmly believe-other tions being equal-that a revenue Tariff is best for the primary producers, who are the source of our wealth, I admit that the Constitution, and our circumstances, point to a policy of moderate protection for our industries. It has been alleged that a number of industries are suffering; but I sav that the whole of the Commonwealth is suffering from depression in trade. I shall support a proper and just inquiry, and when the Mr Knox. Commonwealth opportunity comes, if it does come, I shall advocate that whatever may be the constipro- tution of the commission that may be apsurprised. pointed, thei;e shall be on it no member of require Parliament. A Royal Commission of the kind should be comprised of .a Judge qualified to take evidence and who understands the situation. It should consist of an equal number of protectionists and free-traders, who are practical and substantial men, so that we shall not have repeated the fiasco which has been the result of so many similar they inquiries. I should like also to say a word or two about the suggested dissolution of Parliament. We shall probably know tonight whether a dissolution is coming. Honourable members say that no one in the House desires a dissolution, and I have tried to show that if such an event should in the first take place within the next month or two, as a fiscal the result will be absolutely ineffective. We shall return to a similar condition of affairs to that which we now witness. ",47
298,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Rubbis h ! at least, Mr KNOX - The honourable member says that my remark is rubbish; no doubt he imagines that the Labour Party will come back with an increased following. I predict,' however, that the people of this Commonwealth are prepared to face the issues which they will have to decide. It is no the other part of my task to attack honourable members who sit in the Opposition corner. I believe that those honourable members are actuated by a sense of what they feel to be their duty ; but I ask them-both protectionists and free traders-to look at the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Gippsland, and the right honIn this orable member for Balaclava, and ask whether the cause of protection, which manufacturers is so dear to those gentlemen, is which .in any danger in their . hands. The answer is, no; protection is in no danger. Those honourable members, acting with consistency, accepted the verdict In imy given throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth in favour of fiscal peace. They desire the effects of the existing TaAl- riff to become known, and in my humble condi- judgment they have adopted a right and proper position. I give my adhesion to the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Government.  able member mean?",48

300,Mr KNOX,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I give my adhesion to the head of the Government, and the honourable members associated with him, because they intend to support, law and order, and create confidence in this country, opposing as forcibly as they can all revolutionarymeasures which are detrimental to the inteiests of the community.

302,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member will feel much more uncomfortable before I am finished, I feel deeply the responsibility which rests upon me at the present time. When I said a short time ago that I held the Ministry in the hollow of my hand honourable members were inclined to jeer. I rather fancy, however, that, as the debate has proceeded, and it has been realized how equal the balance between the parties is, their laughter has fad'ed away. I think i may claim at the present time to possess a power equal to that of the leader of t.'-; Government, and also equal to that of the leader of the Opposition. It rests with me to make six men happy and sixty-eight men miserable, or to make sixtyeight men happy and six men miserable; and such a responsibility is calculated to make a man pause before deciding what course he will take. It has been said that some of the members of the Opposition, upon the eve of the division, will be stricken with a mysterious illness, which will prevent them from attending and recording their votes. I do not believe that prediction is likely to be fulfilled. I rather think that, like the gladiators of ancient Rome, who, when they entered the arena, shouted, Ave Imperatorl Morituri te salulantl those honourable members of the Opposition will enter this Chamber 2 shouting, "" Hail, member for Bland ! Hail, member for Indi, we who are about to die, salute you!"" And' I greatly fear, Mr. Speaker, that some of them may die. ",49
303,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Only politically, unless sudden joy has a disastrous effect. I can imagine those honourable members of the Opposition as they enter the Chamber, parodving the words of TennysonTheir's not to make reply, Their's not to reason why ; Their's but to do and die; Into the Valley of Death, Into the mouth of hell, Walked in the ghosts Of those labour men. I need hardly say that, for some of those honourable members equally with some honourable members. I see on the Government side, it is not likely that there will be any resurrection.",49
304,Mr TOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Now then, be quick ! Mr ""CAMERON - I propose to divide my speech into two portions. I shall first of all deal with the Opposition, then I shall deal with the Ministry, and I shall conclude by telling the' House how I propose to vote.",49
305,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Boilin g in oil is not in it to this !,49
306,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I need hardly say that I expect that respectful attention from honourable members on both sides which is due to the man who holds the balance of power. Three and a half years ago the Federal Parliament first came into existence. On that occasion, the Ministerial Party and the Opposition were about equally balanced. A third party called the Labour Party, but which in my opinion ought to be called the' ""Union Party,"" as its members are practically the representatives of unions, held the balance of power. They found the Ministry of the day singularly kind and considerate, and with distinct leanings, I think I may say, towards the policy in which the Union Party believed. They found, at all events, that if the then Government had not sympathetic leanings towards their policy,, they were squeezable. The result was that legislation was introduced and passed, which, in my opinion, was then, and is now, calculated to bring disgrace and discredit upon Australia. The Government of the dav. with the assistance of the Labour Party, if I may be allowed to call them, by their oldname, secured the passage of such Acts as the Alien Immigration Restriction Act, ' and the Pacific Island Labourers Act, and were instrumental in getting a section inserted in the Post and Telegraph Act prohibiting the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers subsidized by the Commonwealth. Later on, the Government introduced a Bill known as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I need hardly tell honourable members, most of whom were, with myself, members of the House at the time, that I was then, as I have always been, bitterly opposed to that Bill. I opposed it, not only because I believed it to be bad in itself, but because I believed that if it were carried in the form proposed it would have a most disastrous effect upon some of the smaller States, and particularly the State of Tasmania, to which I belong. Considering the strength of the Ministry that introduced the Bill, and knowing that the members of the Labour Party intended to assist in getting it through, it was very doubtful whether it would be possible to wreck that Bill. However, the honourable member for Wide Bay was kind enough to give me an opportunity, by moving an amendment to include in the provisions of the Bill the civil servants and railway employees of the various States. I saw the opportunity; I induced another honourable member to support me, and I am proud to say that upon that occasion I wrecked the Bill. There can be no get away from that fact. The result was that the Bill was thrown under the table. Shortly afterwards the general elections were held, and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat announced, as leader of the Government, that he intended to oppose the inclusion, in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, of States civil servants and railway employees. He told the people that sooner than agree to their inclusion- a course which he did not believe the Federal Parliament had power to adopt-h e intended to resign. I say that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, having made that distinct statement as to what his intentions were as leader of the Government, the members of the Labour Party in this House, as a matter of courtesy, and as a matter of gratitude for all the past benefits they had received at the honourable and learned gentleman's hands, should not have pressed the proposal.",49
307,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And should have broken their pledges to their constituents ?,50
308,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have nothing to do with their pledges to their constituents, but with what they actually did. Honourable members have all read of Judas, who sold our Saviour for thirty pieces of silver, and then hanged himself. In my opinion, Judas was not in it with the members of the Labour Party on that occasion. They were worse than Judas. They had received benefits time after time at the hands of the 1 honourable and learned member for Ballarat and his Government; they knew distinctly what would be the result if they insisted on the inclusion of the public servants and railway employees in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and if they had had any gratitude at all they would not have pressed their proposal. However, they did press the proposal to a division, again at the instance of the honourable member for Wide Bay. They ought to have known what they were doing - They knew that the then Prime Minister would not consent to accept the amendment proposed, they knew that he would resign if it was carried, and yet they deliberately, if I may so describe it, politically murdered the honourable and learned gentleman, and after he was dead they stripped him of his clothes, and then fell down beside him, and said, "" Oh, dear brother, why did you die""? If they had had the slightest knowledge of political warfare, or I may say if they had had common intelligence, they would have behaved differently. Their party'numbered only twenty-three or twenty-four members. They should have known that by their action they would embitter the feelings of honourable members who then sat on the Government side of the House, and that those men would go into opposition against them. They knew that the honourable members who were in opposition at the time were their bitter opponents, and yet they were so led away by greed for office that they took the responsibility of carrying on the government. What they ought to have done was this: They had, by a majority, forced the inclusion of the States public servants and railway employees under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and it was not in the least degree likely that the provisions which they had carried would subsequently be struck out. Knowing that ten men had gone over from the Opposition to oust the Deakin Government, they could have checkmated those ten men, if when the Go vernor-General sent for the honourable member for Bland, that honourable gentleman had declined to carry on the government. The right honourable member for East Sydney, who was then leader of the Opposition, would in the circumstances undoubtedly have been sent for, and within twenty-four hours, or within a week if they had chosen to give the right honourable gentleman that length of rope, the previous Government party and the Labour Party could have coalesced, they could have wiped the right honourable member for East Sydney off the Government side of the House, to which he would never have returned, and the fifty men comprising the Deakin Party and the Labour Party could then have formed a Government that would have been able to carry on the) business of the Commonwealth for the next three years.",50
309,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Would the honourable member have supported them?,51
310,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Certainl y not. would rather remain on the Opposition side until the day of my death than support a policy in which I do not believe. If honourable members of the Labour Party will reason the matter out for themselves, they must realise that they had the ball at their feet, but they had not the common intelligence to see it.",51
311,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the honourable member see it?,51
312,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Did I see it? went over and voted with the Labour Party before the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was known in this House, in order with their help to throw the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill under the table. I knew what would happen. I trusted that my Opponents-of course I refer to them only as political opponents-woul d not see the game, and as subsequent events have proved, they did not see it. The supporters of the late Watson Administration have been howling that the Watson Government did not get fair play from the time they went on to the Treasury bench until the time they were forced into opposition. I ask every impartial person to answer the question: Did they deserve fair play ? It is perfectly true that the present Prime Minister kicked them from behind, but that is a matter for the right honourable gentleman himself. My contention is that the Labour Government did not legitimately come by the power which they seized, and they therefore have not the slightest reason to cry out because they themselves were treated in the way in W'hich they previously treated their opponents. There are just two' other matters to which I wish to allude in connection with this debate. One was raised by the honourable member for 2 Darling. The honourable member gave us what I think I may term a long discourse, in which he told us one or two stories, and quoted from a number of authors. After hearing the honourable member's story about the gentleman who found that he had made ^400 more than he expected to make, and wanted to divide it with his men, I understood the honourable member to say that the Socialism advocated by him was that carried out by the Governments of the various States in the control of water, gas, tramways, railways, and enterprises of that sort. The honourable member claimed that all these works are carried outby the States Governments for the good of the (people as a whole, and not for the good of any particular individual. That, I understand, is the Socialism advocated by the I honourable member. Is that correct?",51
313,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Onl y partly.,51
314,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If that be so, I ask the honourable member for Darling how he can reconcile his statement that he supports Socialism because under it all are treated alike, with the proposal which honourable members of the Labour Party desire to introduce into the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, to give preference to unionI ists?",51
315,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is easily done. 1,51
316,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It may be easy for the honourable member for Darling. The honourable member may be able to square the circle, but I am not, and I honestly confess that I cannot reconcile the two things. There is only one other matter to which I wish to refer, and that is the statement made by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney with respect to what is known as the "" six potters"" case. I am sorry that I should have to allude to the matter. I may say that if the honourable and learned gentleman's statement had been proved to be correct I should not have hesitated for one moment after I heard it. I have hesitated repeatedly as to what would be the best course to pursue as regards my vote, but had the statement of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney with respect to the action of the Prime Minister in that case been proved to be correct, nothing would have induced me, by my vote, to have allowed the right honourable gentleman to remain another second on the Treasury bench. The statement of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney was proved to be incorrect. I can find no justification for the honourable arid learned gentleman's statement that the present Prime Minister is responsible for the carrying out of the law in that case. I hold that when laws are made, be they bad or good, it is incumbent upon those administering the government for the time being to carry them out in their entirety. Therefore, I do not think that any reproach could have been cast upon the Prime Minister if he had done so. The only other thing he could have done was to disguise his action. I can find no fault with him under these circumstances. But I do say this-that , if by any chance he remains in power, it is his duty to try to get such a section as that under which these troubles have occurred repealed, because it is calculated to bring great discredit upon the Commonwealth. Nothing has ever cast more discredit upon Australia as a whole than what is known as the Petriana case. Of course there can be no question upon this pointthat the case was somewhat exaggerated. At the same time, it simply shows what might have happened; and I sincerely trust that if the right honourable gentleman remains in power he will endeavour to have that section repealed. Now, Mr Speaker, that is all I have to say against the Opposition.",51
317,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There are no cheers from the Government side, I notice.",52
318,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I now propose to .deal with the Government of the day. Holding the scales of justice impartially, I have shown the House as well as I could what I think of the Opposition. I deeply regret that the Prime Minister is not present to hear what I have to say concerning the Government. I daresay you will recollect, Mr Speaker, that on the occasion .when the late Deakin Government' were turned out of office, the right honourable member for East Sydney expected to be sent for. He remained for twenty-four hours, more or less, within the precincts of this House, and he spent most of his time in saying not "" Sister Ann, Sister Ann, is 'there anv one coming?"" like the young lady in the ""fairy tjale, but ? Brother Smith. Brother Smith, is there any one coming ? ;! And Brother Smith had to reply, very regretfully, "" No, Fatima, I am very sorry to say that no one comes from Government House."" As honourable members all know, the right honourable gentleman retired a very sad and sorrowful man. But he said that as soon as the Watson Government met Parliament he would table a direct no-confidence motion. I would ask-the right honourable gentleman is not here, unfortunately, but I should like to ask-wh y did he not do so? I am a straight-going man; at least I have tried to be straight all my life, and when I make a threat I endeavour to carry it out.",52
319,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not always.,52
320,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Do I not? Let the honourable member induce me to threaten him, and see whether I will not carry it out afterwards. The right honourable member for East Sydney announced that he intended to challenge the Watson Government, and I have no hesitation in saying that had he challenged them directly after the adjournment, he would have defeated them, because the previous Government and their supporters were distinctly sore at the manner in which they had been treated. Talk about the snake that was nurtured in the husbandman's bosom ! It was nothing to the treatment meted out to the Deakin Government by the Labour Party 1 I have no hesitation in saying that had a direct vote of want-of-confidence in the Watson Government been tabled at once, the probabilities are that they would have been defeated. But the right honourable gentleman, like Bob Acres, thought discretion the better part of valour. The more he thought about the task, the less he liked it. But at last he saw his opportunity in connection with the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. He took it ; and as we all know, he carried his point successfully. He has now come into power. The right honourable gentleman has been going about the country speaking at various places, and always-of late, at least-posin g as an opponent of Socialism. But he came to the House, and he brought forth his programme; and his policy for the few remaining months of the session is practically-what ? It is practically the programme of the Labour Party, as laid before Parliament by the honourable member for Bland. There' is not the slightest difference between them, as far as I can see. Therefore, I ask the House, how does the right honourable gentleman justify his position on the Treasury bench?",52
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He has hardly been there five minutes yet. . Mr CAMERON - I am not quite sure whether he will be there five minutes longer, if that is the case. He had, at any rate, an opportunity to bring forward a programme or policy in consonance with what he had been saying outside the House, but he brought forward a policy which is practically the same as that which the Labour Government had proposed. he says, "" Only let me get into recess - let me have one of those sleeps for which I am so famous-and I will come down next session and astonish you."" That is practically what it amounts to, and nothing else. Then, when the leader of the Opposition brings forward a motion of no confidence, the Prime Minister, in his own defence, says, "" If I had the power I would repeal a certain section in the Post and Telegraph Act, and also a certain section in the Immigration Restriction Act ; but I have not the power."" Well, if he has not the power, what right has he to be there? If the Prime Minister cannot lead the House, and has sufficient party to enable him to carry on the government of the country, what right has he to occupy his present position? He comes down whining- I use an expression which I have often heard from honourable members on the Opposition side, but it really amounts to a whine-and says, "" If I had the power I would do these things, but as I have not the power, I am not going to do any' thing."" I contend that a man who attains to such a position as that of Prime Minister, and who aspires to hold it, but who makes such a statement as that to the House- a man who does not bring forward a policy in consonance with what he said outside-ha s failed to make the most of his opportunities. The Prime Minister had a trump card to play until I took it.",52
322,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member for Wilmot has the joker.,53
323,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Prime Minister had a trump card, but I have the joker, as an honourable member suggests; and I am going to play it. The Prime Minister knew that if he had brought forward a policy of his own, and if it was not carried, the House would practically have been exhausted, and all he would have had to do would have been to ask the Governor General to grant him a dissolution. The request would have been acceded to. There is no getting away from that fact. Therefore, instead of taking up the position which he occupies at the present time, it was his bounden duty to bring forward a policy of his own. Instead of that, he has merely come down, and said what he would do if he had the power. The man who seizes the right moment is the man who takes the power-as I have taken it. There is, however, one condition which weighs very heavily with me in givBut ing my decision upon this question. It is this: On the Government side of the House I see a number of honourable members with whom I have been in close sympathy during the last three-and-a-half years while I have held a position as a member of this House. I also, recognise the fact that during the last few months, State elections have been held in Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales. In every one of those States the unionists Or Labour Party have increased their power - At the last two elections in connection with the Federal Parliament, two new members who support the Labour. Party-on e sitting in direct not a opposition, and one in the Opposition corner-hav e been returned. I recognise that if a general election were held at the present moment, it is quite possible that the Labour Party would sweep the polls to a very great extent. I think that any thinking man can have no hesitation in coming to that conclusion. Further, I know that the unionists are thoroughly organized. I know, on the contrary, that the liberal-conservatives, with whom I have been associated so long, and the liberals themselves are not thoroughly organized. In the interests of fair play, and with a strong desire to see the best side win when the fight takes place, I shall vote on this occasion with the Government.",53
324,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF," After the intensely dramatic speech which the honourable member for Wilmot has delivered, I approach with something like fear and trepidation the task set before me. I allow the fullest amount of consideration to the grave statement of the honourable member who has just given another exemplification' of the policy of "" Yes-No."" I was always under the impression, and am still, that no member has the right to abrogate to himself the privileges of this House. Every member of the House is sworn to do his duty to his constituents and to his King, and I do not think it very creditable for any member to pose as the custodian of the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia, and to declare it in the manner in which it has been declared to-night. I ask the indulgence of the House for a short space of time, while I deal with what might be termed a few personal matters before I address myself to the subject under discussion. I offer no apology for doing this. I do it from a stern sense of duty, not only to myself, but to every member of the House; because I hold that the honour of this House-the honour of any one member-is the honour of every member. Whatever our differences may be on political matters, whenever a dissolution takes place, and we appeal to the electors of Australia, it is our duty to speak the truth, and only the truth, concerning the actioqs and votes of the members of this House. I have to charge the Prime Minister of this country, the right honourable member for East Sydney, with having knowingly misrepresented me, misrepresented my actions, and misrepresented my votes as given in the firstFederal Parliament. I am glad that there are one or two members of the legal profession present tonight, because I wish to tell the House what was said in my electorate, with a view to preventing my return, about my action in regard to the proposed remission of the fodder duties. Honourable members will recollect that on the 8th October, 1901, the right honourable member for Adelaide introduced the Tariff, and, following a precedent which I believe has not been successfully challenged, the Government of the day commenced to levy the proposed duties from that date. In November following, it was decided in Committee of the Whole to agree to the duties upon agricultural produce proposed by the Government. The Prime Minister, however, in addressing a public meeting at Hay, one of the chief towns in my electorate, prior to the late elections, said that he was not sure, but he thought that a vote had been taken on that. Question, and that he was satisfied that, though I, because of my position as Chairman of Committees, could not vote, I would have voted, if I had had an oppoitur.ity, for the duties, and, subsequently, against their remission. 1 challenge the right honourable member to show that tt vote was t^ken on the question. As a matter of fact no vote was taken. The Prime Minister lent himself to the tactics of my political opponent by deliberately misrepresenting my action, knowing, as he did, that - the pastoralists in my constituency had probably suffered more by the terrible and devastating drought which occurred than did any one else. He made a further charge against me, and against the Government which I then supported, to which I direct the attention of members of the House. As leader of the Free-trade Party in the Commonwealth, he stated that the fodder duties could Have been remitted by Mr Chanter. an Executive act, and I was unable to publish the true facts of the case to the people there, except by word of mouth, because the press was against me, and refused to publish the statements which I had made on the subject in this Chamber. The remission of the fodder duties was first proposed on grievance day by the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who at the time was Acting Prime Minister, will, I.think, bear me out in the statement that, before the matter was so referred to, I went to him personally, and asked him if under the Constitution the Government could give relief. He communicated with the then Attorney-General of New Soutft Wales, Mr. B. R. Wise, and with the Premiers of the six States, four of whom replied that they were not agreeable to the remission of the duties. Consequently, the hands of the Commonwealth Government were tied in the matter. Furthermore, if honourable members will refer to Hansard., they will see by my speeches that I was deliberately misrepresented by the Prime Minister, and that every word which I spoke breathed the fullest sympathy for those who were suffering. But I knew, on the authority of the legal members of the House, and of the Acting Prime Minister of the day, that no relief could be given by the Commonwealth without a breach of the Constitution. I pointed that out, and I suggested that the State Government should either itself remit to the pastoralists taxation equal to the amount received by it from the fodder al- duties, or purchase fodder, and give it to them directly, without the intervention of middlemen ot agents, allowing them a term of years in which to repay the expenditure, as has been done to other producers under similar circumstances. Was it honourable of the Prime Minister to misrepresent my action in order to gain a few votes for the candidate who was opposed to me, and who espoused his cause? I wish also to refer to the conduct of another member whom I am obliged, in conformity with the rules of ttic House, to refer to as honourable-the honourable and learned member for Werriwa - who , in assisting the Prime Minister in trying to defeat me, went still further in misrepresenting my actions and votes as a member of this House. Honourable members will be surprised to hear that the rumour circulated against me was that in Committee the voting was equal, and I , in the exercise of my casting vote, was so he'artless and regardless of the wants of my constituents as to determine the matter against them.",53
325,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who said that?,55
326,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That wais said by my political opponents. I charge the Prime Minister with partly corroborating the statefrom ment, and he has not been honourable enough to deny it. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa, however, speaking to a large audience in Deniliquin, repeated the statement of the Prime Minister that, under section 69 ot the Constitution, the fodder duties could have been remitted by an Executive act. If honourable members will look at the Constitution, they will see that section 69 has no more bearing on the question than' section 169, which does not exist. If the honourable and learned gentleman had referred to sub-section 2 of section LI., and had read it to electors, they would have known that it would have been a clear breach of the Constitution to discriminate between one State and another, and that what is done for one must be done for all. Moreover, section 99 refutes the statement of the honourable and learned gentleman. The honourable and 'learned member also said of me what he is reported to have said of many honest and honourable members of the first Parliament. During the discussion of the Tariff base motives were imputed even to Ministers of the Crown. It was said that they were acting from motives of personal gain, and similar statements were repeated, until the Committee became tired and resentful of them, and, as Chairman of Committees, I had on more than one occasion to rebuke the honourable and learned member for his disorderly language. Therefore, the statements which he made against my honour and integrity savoured very much of personal malice, envy, and jealousy. He told his audience at Deniliquin that I had a motive for voting and speaking against the remission of the fodder duties, because I was connected with the firm of Chanter, Martin, and Company, produce merchants. As I have pointed out, however, the Tariff was introduced on the 8th October, and the fodder duties were agreed to in November, 1901. whereas the firm of Chanter, Martin, and Company did not come into existence as produce merchants until the ist January, 1903. I am sorry that the honourable and learned gentleman is not here to-night, because I have here extracts from newspapers, sympathetic with the honourable and learned member, and the cause which he then espoused, which prove absolutely all the charges I am making against him. In view of the fact that the honourable and learned member is not present, I do not intend to quote all of them now, but I desire to give one example of his want of truthfulness. I shall quote a leading article, entitled, "" Truthful or Untruthful,"" in the Riverina Herald, published in Echuca. After having made the statement to which I have referred, the honourable member, on the following day, addressed ameeting at Moama, where I live, and have my place of business. In the course of his address, he was told that he had acted very improperly the night before, by representing that I had a direct personal interest in the votes I gave, because I had a share in a produce business. Although only twenty-four hours had elapsed since he had spoken at Denilithe quin, the honourable and learned member deliberately denied the statement he had made there. His denial called forth from my partner, who happened to be present at the meeting, a very strong retort, and the Riverina Herald published the following article: On Thursday evening, much of Mr A. H . Conroy's address at Moama was a repetition of the injunction to the electors "" to send in as their representative in Parliament a truthful man."" Certainly a very excellent suggestion, and one which the great majority of people will commend the speaker for, that is, if it can be proved that he was sincere in the matter. But, at the same time as Mr Conroy was uttering these words, there was most noticeable that there was an implied ""something"" about it, and it must have been, indeed, a dull, or "" hollow head,"" as Mr Conroy termed one interjector-wh o happened to be of his own i l k , by-the-way-wh o could not see that the real meaning he wished to be taken was that the present representative was not truthful. It is not our intention to go into such an unnecessary piece of work as to give reasons for vouching for the truthfulness of Mr Chanter. He is too well known, not only in Moama and Echuca and throughout his own electorate, to require us to state more than that he is an upright, honest man. What it is our intention to do, though, is to prove, by his own words, that the man who stood there and "" i m p l i e d "" all sorts of things against Mr. Chanter, is not the ""George Washington"" any one listening to his oily-mouthed utterances would believe him to be. We shall not weary our readers with a long statement. One instance will probably be sumcient. Early in his address Mr Conroy cemmenced quoting from the Herald report of Mr Chanter's speech at Deniliquin, and remarked, inter alia, ""that that journal was strongly supporting Mr Chanter."" In that he was quite correct. Later, an interjector remarked that a quotation from the same speech was wrong. Mr. Conroy told him it must be correct, as it appeared in the journal supporting Mr Chanter, which would not - put anything in he did not say ? Note the italics. Referring to the fodder duties question, in his Moama speech, Mr Conroy said, among other things, that "" he did not think Mr. Chanter's firm was in the produce business at the time""-viz. , the time the request was made for the remission of the duties. An elector remarked, "" You said last night at Deniliquin that it was."" Mr Conroy, with emphasis, replied, "" I-did r.othing-of-the-sort, "" drawling it out. Now, jemember those italics above.",55
327,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member think that that matter has anything to do with the motion before the Chair ?,56
328,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes . I shall endeavour to connect it with the subject under discussion. Whenever an honourable member is misrepresented outside of the House with regard to his votes, and statements in this Chamber, this is the only place in which he can challenge his accuser, and repudiate the charges made against him.",56
329,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I would point out that with the permission of the House, the honourable member could make a statement embracing all the facts which he now desires to present. As the honourable member has stated, this is the proper place in which to make such a statement, but the present is not the proper time. I raised no objection while the honourable member was dealing w'ith a member of the Ministry, but as the honourable and learned member to whom he is now referring is not a member of the Cabinet-and , personally, I am not aware of the relation in which he stands to the Ministry-it seems to me that, the matter could be very much more appropriately discussed under circumstances such as I have suggested.",56
330,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I connect my remarks with the motion in this way: We are invited to declare whether or not we have confidence in the Ministry, and one of my reasons for voting against the Government is that I take great exception to the action of certain Ministers and other members who support them. The article continues The Deniliquin Independent of yesterday, newspaper which is a strong supporter of Blackwood, who is being bolstered up by Mr. Conroy, reports the latter's speech at some length, and we take the following sentence from the port :- "" Mr Chanter was not in favour of mission of the fodder duties, because he knew his own firm of Chanter, Martin, and Co. would benefit by their retention."" These are the two rupt him. statements of Mr Conroy. If they are not the strongest samples of "" Yes-No-ism,"" what could your indulgence, sir. be. If the electors take Mr Conroy's advice and elect truthful men to Parliament,"" how will he fare. We ' rather fancy Mr Chanter will Island Labourers Bill benefit by the ""stumping"" of the electorate by honourable Mr Conroy, instead of the end being gained the which was aimed at. That is what one newspaper had to say about the matter, and I have half-a-dozen extracts from other journals which are sufficient to prove that certain misstatements were made. Another action of the honourable and learned member called forth a stinging rebuke from one of the weekly newspapers published in Sydney, which circulates from end to end of Australia. In connection with the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, I told my constituents that it was proposed that the Kanakas on the plantations in Queensland should not be retained after a certain period, that no more licences would be issued after a certain date, and that within two or three years the Kanakas would have to be deported to the islands from which they came. The Government of New South Wales, actuated by humane motives, have established two mission stations for aboriginals in my electorate, and I charged the honourable member for Werriwa with having made the statement that I deliberately voted",56
331,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Reall y I cannot allow the honourable member to discuss these matters upon the motion now before us, because they have no relation that I can discover to the question whether the Government possess the confidence of the House.",56
332,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I would ask permission to complete my statement, because I am jealous of the honour of the House as well as my own. If some misleading statement were made regarding yourself, Mr . Speaker, I should regard it my duty to bring it under the notice of honourable members.",56
333,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member will be one of the first to perceive that whilst such matters can properly be discussed in the House, and whilst the honour of every member is a matter affecting the honour of the House, the debate which is now taking place is upon the specific question whether or not the House has confida ence in the Government. Therefore, the 1 Mr subject introduced by the honourable member has no relation to the matter before the reChair. However, as T understand the hona reorable member is just about to conclude his statement, I should be very sorry to inter",56
334,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am grateful for All the - votes I gave in connection with the Pacific dealt, as every member ""knows, only with Kanakas, and had no reference whatever to the aborigines of Australia. The statement of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, that I had voted in favour of driving the aborigines out of Australia within three years called forth a rebuke from the newspaper to which I have referred, to the effect that any one making such a statement was not fit to mix with honest men, and ought himself to be driven out of Australia. I desire now to take a retrospective view of the circumstances which have led up to the present position. I had the honour and privilege of following Sir Edmund Barton when he formed* his first Ministry. had the pleasure of assisting him to bring about this grand Federation. Further, I was gratified to be able tb approve of the measures which he submitted to this House. When the leadership of the Government was undertaken by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat I was pleased to follow him, and to assist him in carrying out his proposals, because I believed that they were conceived* in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Certain changes, in which I had no hand or part, afterwards took place. As honourable members know, I was unfortunate enough to be made the victim of faulty administration of the Electoral Act. When we passed that measure we knew what was intended, but I had to resort to the High Court, at considerable expense, in order to obtain a proper interpretation of the law. Therefore, for a certain period I was denied the privilege of sitting in this House. During my absence the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was ejected from office, and the leader of the Opposition took his place. the honourable and learned member for Ballarai had stated that the honourable member for Bland had attained' office by legitimate means, and* had promised to give him fair play, I pledged myself to mt constituents to see that every reasonable consideration was shown to the new Administration. Shortly after my return certain meetings of the party to which I belong were held, and at one of those gatherings it was resolved unanimously that the Protectionist Party, of which I was a member, should not ally itself with the party at present led by the Prime Minister. I have never departed from that position. As far as I am aware, no subsequent meeting of that party was ever convened. I would further point out that it is not correct to say that the Watson Administration resigned office because they were defeated upon clause 48. which contains a provision relating to the extension of preference to unionists. I may be pardoned, perhaps, for recalling the exact circumstances surrounding the division which took place upon the amendment submitted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. It was launched upon a Friday afternoon, shortly after 4 o'clock, whenas is usual-Inter-Stat e representatives were anxious to catch their respective trains home. As a matter of fact, several amendments were proposed-on e by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, anodier by the honourable and learned member for I also Darling Downs, and two others, I think, by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I have a very vivid recollection of the then Prime Minister, sitting at the table, agieeing to some of these amendments, and disagreeing with others. In the hurry of the moment honourable members could scarcely be expected to grasp the proposals to which he had agreed and those with which he had disagreed. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella was not even in print, and one had to catch its purport as it was read from the Chair, and to vote upon it almost immediately. One cannot always do right, and if an honourable member acts in great haste he is very apt to do wrong. I candidly confess that when I saw that amendment in print I . realized that I had done wrong. When I voted for it I w-as under the impression that it provided that any union, either of employers or employees, interested in an industrial dispute, could apply for a preference to the Arbitration Court if they comprised a As majority of its members. But when I came to analyze it subsequently I saw that its objects are of a threefold nature. In the first place, it provides that those affected by any award must have interests in common with the applicant. Who would be affected by an award? Would not every man, woman, and child in Australia? It is absolutely impossible for any tribunal to ascertain what the majority of those engaged in a particular industry favour, and what they do not favour. I recollect the then Prime Minister stating that he was dissatisfied with the amendment in the form in which it was proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, that he himself believed that a substantial number of those who desired a preference should be represented, and that upon the first opportunity he would make the necessary alterations to comply with the real wishes of Parliament. That opportunity presented itself when the Bill had passed through all its stages in Committee. He could not ask for the recommittalof the measure until it had been reported to the House. When he moved that the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering a number of clauses, including clause 48, he was met by a hostile amendment, which prevented him ' from remedying the mistake which had been made, and making clear the real intentions of Parliament. I ask was that fair play? The honourable and learned member for Ballarat promised to give the Watson Government fair play. I made a similar pledge when addressing my constituents, and consequently I felt bound to stand by them upon that occasion. So far as I am aware, no precedent can be found, either in Australian history or in that of the great mother of Parliaments-the British House of Commons-for the action taken by honourable members opposite. The then Prime Minister occupied a ' to tally different position from that of a private member of this House. in charge of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and was responsible to the country for it, and I unhesitatingly affirm that it is not creditable to any honourable member to attempt' to justify his action in preventing that measure from being taken into Committee. It was the foulest play that I have witnessed during twenty years of political . experience in Australia, and to my mind any attempt to justify it only aggravates the offence. If-as has been urgedthere was no difference between the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella and that of the then Prime Minister, why was the latter not allowed to recommit the Bill?",56
335,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If there was no d if r ference between the two amendments, what did it matter?",58
336,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If there was no difference between them, was it fair play to take the unusual course of preventing the measure from being recommitted? there been some great difference between the proposals there might have been some justification for the action of honourable members opposite. I hold' that the procedure which they adopted will be regarded by the future historian and political student as the first foul act perpetrated by the Commonwealth Parliament. orable members are aware, for many years the Prime Minister and myself occupied seats in the New South Wales Legislature. We always sat upon different sides of the House. I do not intend to dig up past events concerning him. I prefer that they should be forgotten. In my opinion it is What followed ? high time that they were relegated to oblivion.",58
337,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The people of New South Wales have sent him here with a great number of supporters, anyhow.",58
338,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,In the eyes of the Prime Minister 'the people of New South Wales are the residents of Sydney.,58
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Nonsense .,58
340,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He receives his support from the city of Sydney and the county of Cumberland. I . have no desire to discuss the reason why he continues to obtain that support, because to do so would only lead to recrimination.",58
341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,-That is a poor compliment to New South Wales.,58
342,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"B y his actions the right honourable gentleman has always shown to the country districts of New South Wales He was that their interests are not worthy of consideration when compared with those of Sydney and the county of Cumberland. Upon one occasion my own constituents were denied fair treatment, owing to his intense hostility to persons' resident in what he regarded as a Victorian zone. What did he tell a Victorian contractor, in my presence, at Gundagai? This gentleman was invited to tender for a contract upon the Murrumbidgee, but despite the fact that his tender was the lowest, and that he had spent several hundreds of pounds in getting machinery upon the ground, the right honourable gentleman declared that he could not accept his tender because he was a Victorian.",58
343,Sir JOH NQUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did not the honourable member for Hume do the same thing ?,58
344,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do not think so.,58
345,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He did.,58
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How much lower was the tender of the gentleman to whom 'Had the honourable member is referring?,58
347,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It was lower by some hundreds of pounds.,58
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The difference was only about £ 1 1 or ^ 1 4 , and I understand that the lowest tenderer had no plant, whilst the other tenderer had a good plant. As hon- Mr CHANTER - I do not know who was the other man. These tenders were invited from the world at large.",58
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The difference between the tenders was only about j£n or £*4,58

352,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I was not aware of Administration. it, and I think that the Minister is making a mistake. I know that the matter was alluded to in the Senate, but I do not that it was mentioned here, and I am very sorry that I have been led into making the any reference to it. If the Prime Minister enemies has been consistent, or nearly consistent, in one thing more than another, it has been in his advocacy 0|f free-trade. I recognise and pay full tribute to the ability of the right honourable gentleman who has succeeded in bursting tectionist Party in Australia. The right honourable gentleman could not do that in policy ? New South Wales, although he often tried; but he has done it in this House, by what means the future may show. The fact I very much deplore. I am a protectionist first, because I believe that to be the truest for the country. I associated myself with the protectionists of Victoria and the other States, but particularly with the protecthe tionists of Victoria, because the latter is the one State that has done noble work for the great principle during the past being thirty years. Victoria has held up the flag terests of protection year after year, but now see that flag dragged in the mire, as the result of the greatest piece of political gineering within my knowledge. Of course, the Prime Minister is quite right in claiming credit for having burst up the Protectives tionist Party, and having absorbed a tion in the party which he leads.",59
353,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And the rest of the Protectionist Party are absorbed in the IParty Labour Party.,59
354,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not a membei of the LaSour Party, but I am in strong sympathy with their aims and aspirations. My natural affinity is with them, because they are seeking in other ways to do I seek to achieve by means of - protection, namely, to benefit the masses, raise them to a higher level, and give every possible encouragement to the development of the industrial life of the country. I seek by my advocacy of the protectionist principle to provide labour at which men may earn honest wage in their own country. I have been connected with ihe Protectionist Party for many years, and it is a great the giief to me that it should now be broken by political machinations, especially in view of the fact that, united, it could have done good work in this House. When is the fiscal battle to be resumed? My doubts as to that question form one of the reasons why I have no confidence in the present This young nation must have a settled policy-soone r or later we must embrace one principle or the other. think Who is going to carry the banner? Whether the dissolution takes place now, or in future, how shall I regard this present Ministry, half of whom are my political ?",59

358,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The protectionists in the alliance say to the Labour Party, "" We, the protectionists, want no commission of inquiry into the ruin and disaster which have policy followed the imposition of the present Tariff, especially in the State of Victoria; we are prepared to act at once."" To this Labour Party reply, "" We are prepared, if you can show by means of a Royal Commission, or in any other way, that injury is done, to remedy the evil in the inof the workers we represent.""

359,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Labou r representahave stated distinctly that they will pornot support any increase in the Tariff.,59
360,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have nothing to do with what individual members of the Labour have or any other party may have said; only to deal with myself, and my responsibilities to the alliance.

If the Ministry, or their supporters, could show me that I have more to hope from them for what what is nearest and dearest to my heartthe welfare of the people of AustraliaI should be only too glad to consider the advisability of a combination with them. But where is there any such hope? There is peace now; but will members of the present Government say there is not going to an be war very shortly amongst them? Which half of the Ministry will carry the flag to the country ? Is the Prime Minister, at head of the Free-trade Party, to carry the free-trade flag, or is the honourable member for Gippsland to carry the protectionist flag? What would become of the Government under such circumstances? Where would there be any hope of useful measures ? I would twenty times sooner see a straight-out free-trade Ministry the Ministry which now occupy the Treamistakes sury bench. The people would then have follow the example. an opportunity to test the question fairly and honestly, with some solid effect. Everylife body quotes the cry of "" fiscal peace,"" and I stated on the platform, I do not want hide myself behind any misrepresentation wriggling, so far as my responsibility or remedy. pledges are concerned. The leader I then followed, the honourable and learned memdo ber for Ballarat, stated in his manifesto that there was to be fiscal peace. Why? lines. Because the Prime Minister was at that time going from one part of the Commonto deal with this question. wealth to the other, declaring that there should be no fiscal peace-that he fight to the death to have the Tariff revised at the first opportunity, and would remove the duties one by one, until they were all placed on a revenue basis. It was that action on the part of the Prime Minister that caused cry for fiscal peace. But when I pledged bers of the Government. myself to follow the honourable and member for Ballarat in this regard, made great reservations. I said that so as preferential trade with Great Britain was concerned, I was ready to concede it at a moment's notice; so that that was empted from my pledge. I do not know that I or any honourable member desires to escape responsibility for his declarations; but at that time we had gone through all the turn-oil and trouble of fixing the Tariff, and we did not know-or at least I did not-what serious effects the reduction of some of the duties would have on the inwe dustrial life of the Commonwealth. I would l>2 criminal, when now that experience has hence? shown what those effects are-when some indeclare dustries are ceasing to be carried on, and the proposed reciprocal relations? thousands of workers are being driven employment day by day-if I were stayed in my action by this paltry cry of fiscal peace. The honourable member for Laanespoken-t coorie made charges against honourable members on this side; but supposing a favourable diagnosis of his, on which he had arranged not to see a patient lowing morning, should, in the middle of the night, turn out to be wrong, would he refuse to attend the patient until the time thing. he had fixed, and to give him the medicine which might save his life?

But free-trade and preferential trade will exnot, and cannot, blend. The right honourable gentleman at the head of the Government has stated here, as well as outside, many times, that he is in favour of preferential trade with Great Britain, but his idea of preferential trade is to sweep off all the duties, and make no difference between the foreigner' and the Britisher. Can afford, in the interests of Australia, to deal with this question five or six years Is it not our bounden duty to that Australia is ready to enter into For out of months past Mr Chamberlain has been holding out his hand, asking Australia to speak as Canada and New Zealand have o say that we do not want to wait, but are ready to concede the broad principle and deal with details afterwards by way of conference or by way of legislauntil the foltion in this House.",60

369,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I know the leader of the Opposition is a protectionist, and every protectionist who understands economic principles, knows that preferential trade is only another form of protection for ihe Empire. Is it not our duty to help Mr. Chamberlain in his great and noble campaign ? The other day we had a cable message to the effect that Lord Rosebery declares there is nothing in the proposal, and is trying to lead the people of Great Britain to believe that statements f i pm Australia to the contrary must be weighed very carefully. Is there any honourable member who does not honestly believe that if the people of Australia were polled tomorrow they would re'turn a verdict in favour of preferential trade? If that be the fact, why not say so? Why should we refuse this great assistance to Mr Chamberlain in his campaign? Why should this Legislature not say at once that Australia is agreeable, whenever England is ready, to enter into these reciprocal relations? Tn the face of the statements of the Prime Minister in the past, and within the last few days, I have not the slightest hope of the matter being brought to a happy consummation by him. The right honourable gentleman has been at great pains, when attending agricultural shows in Melbourne, and meetings at Kyneton and other places, to tell the farmers that he wants to encourage and foster the interests of the primary What greater encouragement could the right honourable gentleman give the primary producers than to lend himself heart and soul to forward these proposal si of Mr . Chamberlain? No greater offer has ever been made to the producers of Australia. What is proposed is but protection in another form, and the right honourable gentleman should have said, "" In the interests of the producers of Australia, I am not going to dally with this* Question of preferential trade, and, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, I shall submit a motion in which I shall invite the Federal Parliament to at once say ' y e s ' or ' n o ' to what Mr Chamberlain has proposed."" 8Y I [6 OCTOBER, 1904.] of Confidence. 5337",61

371,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There was no necessity to do so. Sir Edmund Barton, and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat have time after time announced to the world that they are in favour of preferential trade with Great Britain. That announcement was made from Ministerial platforms at the last general election. It is because the right honourable gentleman now at the head of affairs has' announced exactly the opposite view that I say I haw. no hope that in the interests of the primary producers of the Commonwealth the right honourable gentleman will take this matter in hand.",61
372,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Can the producers of Australia secure any benefit unless Greac Britain gives them a preference? - Mr CHANTER - Mr Chamberlain has offered a preference with respect to wheat and other Australian pioduce.,61
373,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is Mr Chamberlain's proposal, and not a proposal of the British Parliament.",61
374,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There could not, so far, have been such a proposal made by the British Parliament. Mr Chamberlain is now conducting a campaign in England, with the object of educating the people on the subject.",61
375,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Unfortunately, nearly every election which has taken place in England recently has gone against him.",61
376,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Thos e are bye-elections, and I dc not think we need take any notice of them. All that we need take notice of at the present time is the information with which we are supplied by the producers. cablegrams in the press, and through the Department of External Affairs. We know that Mr Chamberlain is inviting the British people to agree to certain proposals which he has outlined. He proposes that wheat, meat, and, to some extent, wine, and other produce should be admitted into the markets of England free, while he counsels the Government of the dav, whoever they may be, to impose a duty upon similar products sent to Great Britain from any foreign country. I repeat that that is the finest offer that has yet been made to the primary producers o i Australia, and we should assist Mr Chamberlain to give effect to his views in order that the Imperial Parliament may. enter into negotiations for preferential trade with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other British Possessions, and so make the British Empire not only self-reliant, but selfdefiant, because, having its food supplies under its own control, the Empire can defy the world. The present Prime Minister says that if the British Government should ask him to do this he will be content to consider the request. Possibly the right honourable gentleman would be content to attend the Conference which has recently been spoken of as a representative of Australia. But until on the floor of this House the right honourable gentleman has recanted the views to which he has given expression in connection with the preferential trade movement, how can he be considered a fitting representative of Australia to assist in bringing about reciprocal trade relations with the British Empire? It is because of the right honourable gentleman's statements in regard to this question that I have no faith in a Ministry of which he is the head, cr in some of the members of his Cabinet. Preferential trade is entirely at variance with their past policy and present professions. All through this debate 1I have waited' quietly to learn what the policy of the present Government is.",61
377,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the honourable member find out what the policy of the last Government was ?,62
378,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes , I did. The policy of the last Government was the policy of the first Federal Government, and I believed in every one of the measures proposed by that Government. I . cannot claim any justification for approving the policy of the present Government until I ' know what it is to be.",62
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Takin g money from the banks ! I suppose the honourable member approves of that. That was the policy of the last Government.,62
380,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am not one of those who go beyond the present Labour Party and look into the d'im and distant future to consider something which may hereafter be proposed. It will be time enough for me to deal with those questions when they are brought before the House. All I have to deal with at present is what the party' propose to do during this and the next Parliament.,62
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Labour Government said they would deal with that matter next session.,62
382,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I ask the right honourable gentleman to say why I supported . the Barton Administration. It was because I believed in the men, and in their measures. I believed in the right honourable member fo;r Swan; I believed that he would be true and loyal as a member of that Administration to the policy that was announced.",62
383,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The fight honourable gentleman appears to have been always in a minority in that Administration.,62
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not always.,62
385,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"W it h respect to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, we know that it was introduced by the Barton Government ; it was taken up by the Deakin Government; and it is now fathered by the present Government. We know also that it was the same Bill that was dealt with by the Watson Government. However, a change has been made in the Bill since it emanated from the first Federal A d ministration. It now includes the railway employees of the States, and on that provision it is well known the honourable and learned member for Ballarat resigned office. The honourable and learned gentleman considered that it was beyond our powers under the Constitution to interfere with the affairs of the States in any way, and he would not be responsible for the provision suggested. I ask who backed up the honourable and learned gentleman in that view? Was it not the present Prime Minister? The right honourable gentleman did so, not only here, but in other places, and the Sydney press supporting him, declaimed against the action of honourable members who desired to interfere with the rights of the States Governments. Yet, when the right honourable gentleman gets into power he retains the very provision which he had previously condemned from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. He invited the House to consent to a recommittal of the measure, and why did not the right honourable gentleman then have the courage of his convictions, and invite honourable members to remove the provision to which he had so strongly objected, and on account of which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat resigned office? How are we to describe the action of the right honourable gentleman in this, connection ? Imputations and charges have been levelled against one party and another, that they have raised opposition merely in order to secure office. It is a noble ambition to wish to reach office, but is there one honoiable member in this House who would feel himself elevated in his own eyes or in the eyes of the world, if he reached office by the forfeiture of his principles ? That is what the present Prime Minister has done. The right honourable gentleman had the power which he denied to the Watson Government of recommitting any clause in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which he wished to have reconsidered, and why did he not take out of the Bill a provision which he considered unconstitutional, instead of shirking the responsibility and imposing upon the people of Australia a provision which he still holds to be radically wrong? I should not have referred to the alliance agreement, were it not that some of the hireling press in the country have endeavoured to misrepresent matters, and T desire that the people should know the truth. To what have the parties to the alliance agreed? They have agreed on certain matters. The first is thus statedConciliation and Arbitration Bill , as nearly as possible, in accordance with the original Bill , as isintroduced by the Deakin Government, but any member is at liberty to adhere to his voles already given. Is there anything wrong in that? The proposal is for an adherence to. the principles of the Bill, as introduced by the Barton Government, and also by the Deakin Government, and as carried by the Watston Government.",62
386,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And as agreed to by the right honourable member for Swan.,63
387,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"- Exactly; the right honourable gentleman as a member of the Government who introduced the measure, is responsible for it.",63
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Stat e servants and railway employee's have since been included in the Bill.,63
389,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is so; but under the alliance agreement every member is to be at liberty to adhere to the votes he has already given. Nothing could be fairer than such a. provision. I feel certain from my knowledge of the members of the party to which I belong, and of the members of the Labour Party that: no attempt will be made to depart from'the alliance agreement and what it implies. The next plank in the platform isWhite Australia legislation. Maintain Acts in their integrity, and effectively support their intention by faithfu l administration, Is that not needed? I have always pronounced myself on the platform, through the press, and in my place in Parliament as being in favour of a White Australia. I have had occasion to-night to indicate that 8 Y 2 in one particular instance I have been misrepresented in connection with that matter, but I need not refer to it again. What objection can there be to this proposal of the alliance? Are honourable members on the other side, and particularly members of the present Ministry, prepared to oppose it ? If so, why do they not join issue with us on that subject at once. We are in the somewhat unfortunate position that almost every honourable member who has spoken from the Government side has addressed the House, not with the object of defending Ihe present Government against the motion of want of confidence, but with the object of attacking the alliance programme. From the part which those honourable members have taken in the debate, it would appear that the motion being discussed was one of want of confidence in the Opposition, and the alliance programme. The next matter referred to in the platform of the alliance Navigation Bill. Report of Royal Commission to be expedited, and, subject to this, Bill to provide for[a) The protection of Australian shipping from unfair competition. (4) Registration of all coastal vessels engaged in the coastal trade. (c) Efficient manning of vessels. (d) Proper accommodation for passengers and seamen. (e) Proper loading gear and inspection of same. If honourable members opposite challenge that we shall know where we are. As a member of the ""Protectionist Partv I say that I am in complete accord with the members of the Labour Party in this matter. What is asked for is the application of humane conditions to those who have to earn their living at sea. and who are as much entitled to consideration as are those engaged in the various factories in Melbourne, Svdney. and elsewhere. These are proposals for legislation which demand the serious consideration of honourable members, no matter on which side they sit. The Trade Marks' Bill is another measure upon which the members of the alliance are agreed. I know how necessary it is that that Bill should be passed as rapidly as possible.",63
390,Sir TOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Includin g the trade union label provision I suppose?,63
391,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I 'do not think that the trade unions will obiect *o that. Do not honourable members know that in conseauence of the extraordinary prejudice in the minds of many people against Australian products, the manufactures of this country are unfairly handicapped in competition with goods that come from other parts of the world ? It is necessary to tect Australian goods by Australian trade marks,, and to endeavour to overcome that prejudice. Then there is the Fraudulent Marks Bill., concerning which we are agreed. Surely it is natural that we should join gether in support of measures which are intended to put down fraud.",63
392,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Government are in favour of that Bill.,64
393,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Government will not tell us what they intend to do.,64
394,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"They have done so, but the honourable member was not here.",64
395,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member must have been away.,64
396,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have been a close and careful listener to the debate. The next matter is the High Commissioner Bill with the proviso that the selection of the Commissioner is subject to the approval of Parliament. The appointment of a High Commissioner will enable the Federal staff to be used for the benefit of all the States. That is absolutely, necessary. I dissent from the idea that there should be delay as contemplated by the Prime Minister.",64
397,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Government are not helping the producers in that respect.,64
398,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No , the effect, is exactly the opposite. We do not need to wait for the opinion of the States. We have no right to delay the settlement of such a matter until the States choose to express their approval. It is our duty to appoint the High Commissioner as soon as we possibly can, and we can safely leave it to the electors to remove their superfluous Agents-General.",64
399,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Han g the expense 1,64
400,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If I interpret the honourable member's meaning rightly, I reply that instead of increasing the expense the appointment of a H i gh Commissioner will decrease it . The taxpayers of Australia will have less to pay, because, instead of having an Agent-General for every one of the States, there will be a High Commissioner, representing the whole of Australia, whose services will be available for all the States Governments. If the States clesire to be represented in London they can have their General-Agents instead of their Agents-General, and the result will be a considerable saving to the people. As to consulting Parliament with regard to the appointment, the position to be filled is so responsible in its nature that it is only right that Parliament should know pro- who the High Commissioner is fo be before the selection is finally made. Thaf--is all that is asked for. The Government should not be allowed to get into recess, and then make any appointment they think proper, to- asking Parliament to ratify it, when Parliament can only express its disapproval with the consequence of dislocating the machinery of government by putting the Ministry out of office. Prevention is better than cure. That is one of the principles of the alliance with which I am thoroughly in accord. I need say no more with regard to preferential trade, as I have already dealt with the subject at considerable length. In the interests of my constituents, apart from the interests of the whole of Australia, nothing has ever been suggested which will result in more lasting benefit than the establishment of reciprocal relations in regard to the interchange of commodities between Great Britain and the Commonwealth. I shall support any legislation that may be necessary to that end. While I told my constituents that I was prepared to support fiscal peace, at the same time. I am not prepared to see the interests of this country neglected and ruined. I am quite sure that no protectionist on this side of the House has any clesire to see the Tariff reopened from end to end, but what they do desire is that there shall be brought before Parliament the cases of industries that are being injured by the operation of the present Tariff, so that the anomalies may be removed. That is reauired in the interests not only of capital, but of the bone and flesh and sinew of the people, of this country. People are being driven out of Australia'to seek for work elsewhere. We should be traitors to our country if we did not attempt so to readjust the Tariff thai this ruinous devastation may be stopped.",64
401,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,When did the Labour Party announcd its fiscal policy as a partu ?,64
402,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,As a party they have,64

405,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I know him to be a protectionist. I also know that many members of the Labour Party are protectionists. I am quite sure that my honourable friend the member for Moira, and the right honourable member for Swan, will agree with me chat had it not been for the assistance of House in that manner. members of the Labour Party, we should not have had a protectionist Tariff in tralia today. They recognise that duties certain articles were in the interests of upon sugar. labour, and they came to our assistance and helped us to pass the Tariff as i stands.

408,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He is always paying them compliments.,65

411,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Protectionist think.

The right honourable member for East Sydney, on coming into power, declared that he stood for the policy of a free breakfast table. He immediately swept off this duty on corn. But when the Government of New South Wales got into financial difficulties, and more revenue was wanted, who gave it to the right honourable gentleman?",65

The Barton Ministry, at all events, did not go to the Labour Party, and sell themselves for a duty of i d . or 3d. per lb. upon tea. ' They would rather have gone out of office.

Another reason why I stead have no confidence in the present AdminisI.ahour tration is that I believe that some of its members are misrepresenting the feelings and aspirations of the Labour Party, with whom I am in alliance, by terming them Socialists, and by telling the farmers that, they are in favour of the confiscation and re-subdivision of the land. I do not believe that that is so. If I thought that the Labour Party would attempt any such thing they would receive no support, from me. On the contrary, I would oppose them. But I cannot forget that when I , as a land reformer, endeavoured to have land thrown open to the people of New South Wales. I met with the opposition of the Prime MinI merely ister and those associated with him, while I was assisted by the members of the Labour Party, whose aim was to give people an opportunity to settle on the land, not to take it away from them. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro then stood shoulder to shoulder with me. We strove to burst up the large estates, but we met with the opposition of the Free-trade Party all through. Not one Minister, except when protectionist Governments, such as that of Sir George Dibbs, were in power, did anything for land reform in New South Wales.",66

484,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am not discussing Tom Mann's teaching,69
485,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member has allied himself with Tom Mann's disciples.,69
486,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Moira is usually very .fair, and I may tell him that I have never asked a member of the Labour Party whether he believes in Tom Mann, or not. I can only' repeat that if the Labour Party-j with whom I am at present allied on a clearly denned programme, attempt to carry put confiscation doctrines, or any anarchial proposals, they will not receive my support",69
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Was the honourable member not sent here to support the honourable and learned member for Ballarat?,69
488,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I was not, and I am glad the honourable and learned member has given me the opportunity to deny the statement. I was asked to attend only two meetings of the party, at which a decision was arrived at.",69
489,Mr JOSEPH CQOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What I meant was that you were returned at the election to support the honourable and learned member.,69
490,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I was returned at the first election to support the policy of proHouse tection. The programme was laid before the people by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, when he, did me the honqur to attend meetings at Deniliquin and Moama, and explained matters, apart from myself. I said that I was very glad to be in agreement with him, and to follow him. On the question of fiscal peace, not only myself, but the honourable and learned member for Ballarat made it absolutely clear to the people of Riverina that if it meant any stoppage of preferential trade, we would have no peace.",69
491,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member did not say that. What he said was that there would be no reopening of the Tariff, except in connection with preferential trade.",69
492,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member may now see a report of the speech tomorrow. I had already dealt with that question, and expressed the opinion that, now I know the effects of the Tariff, I Sz . would be criminal if were not prepared to afford relief at once. The question is one of the gravest moment to Australia. I suppose there is no one in the House who has any particular desire for a dissolution j but I would scorn to give a vote to prevent such a result. The honourable member for Wilmot posed here very dramatically tonight ; but I can say that the intriguing for votes in connection with this motion is greater than I have observed on any other occasion in my twenty years of political life.",69
493,Mr CAMERON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Nobod y has ever asked me for a vote, I declare on my honour.",69
494,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"As I cannot conclude my speech to-night, I ask that the debate be adjourned.",69
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I desire to make a' personal explanation. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat imputed to me, very improperly, I think, a desire to impugn the memory of a dead man. I absolutely repudiate any such intention. I simply related a fact of' which the honourable member,.with his knowledge of New South Wales politics, ought to be aware - a fact well known to any on-? associated with the New South Wales Parliament. I refer to the time when a motion of censure was lodged against the Dibbs Government on account pf Sir Edmund Barton and Mr R. E. O'Connor accepting retainers against the Government of which they were members. When the Government were defeated, instead of resigning as any self-respecting Government would have done, they came down to the next day, and dramatically flourished in the faces of honourable members a pro-' rogation notice. The honourable member for Riverina knows all this, and yet he denies it in point-blank fashion. If my statement can be construed into a reflection on a dead man's memory, I have yet to understand the meaning of language.",69
496,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Politica l memory; I did not say personal memory. Debate adjourned. House adjourned at 11 p.m.,69
