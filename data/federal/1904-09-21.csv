0,NA,Unknown,"fi^ousc of IxrpiTsmtcitibrs. - Wednesday, 21 September, 1904. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",12
1,Mr REID,Unknown, I wish to make a personal explanation with reference to a statement made in this House last evening as to .my conduct in connection with the case of some potters tinder the Immigration Restriction Act. Honourable members will recollect that the honourable and learned member for West Sydney stated last night that I had taken certain proceedings with reference to either the employer or the men themselves. In one of the newspaper accounts published this morning he is reported to have said that I had taken proceedings against the men.,12
2,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"He said "" against the employer.""",12
3,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think that he did. In the other and fuller account-that which appears in the Melbourne Age-h e is reported to have said that I had taken the proceedings against trie employer. .1 should have liked to. refer to an advance proof of Hansard, to set the matter at rest; but we are not entitled to see proof copies of other member's speeches until they have been corrected, unless with the permission of the member concerned, and, as the honourable and learned member for West Sydney was not here, I could not get his authority. I have therefore had to fall back on the newspaper reports. The Age report of the honourable and learned member's remarks reads as follows: The Prime Minister stated his intention of altering the law- ' That is the law with reference to this tract, arrangementas soon as he got into power; but what has done? Listen : Six English potters landed this country-me n of our own flesh and bloodand are now here as citizens; but instructions being givenHonorable members will notice that the present tense-is-employedto the Solicitor-General to file, in New Wales, an information against the man who brought them here, and under the very section the Act under which it was sought to prevent the six hatters landing. (Sensation, and loud Opposition cheers). Since the rising of the House I have had opportunity to get full information on the subject from the Secretary to the Departthat ment, and I am now in a position to state to the House that I have never, from the time. I entered office until this moment, had any papers submitted to me in conunder nexion with any incident of the kind, nor have I ever given any instructions of any kind ^with reference either to the potters themselves or to their employer. I knew that something had occurred in reference this matter since I came into office, and that two things ! made me reticent until I could satisfy myself of the facts, because it is always to wait until one is sure. This is what has occurred: When I came into office Secretary to the Department asked me if I wished to disturb any of the actions of predecessors, especially with reference this Immigration Restriction Act. Honormitted able members who have been in office knew what the universal rule is-that no Minister who comes in disturbs the decisions of predecessors except under some very special work. circumstances. That is an unwritten law, pf which every man of experience is aware. The Secretary asked me whether I had intention to undo or to unsettle the actions would he not? of my predecessors under this Act, and I said, as I think any other Minister in world would have said, that I had not. a matter of fact, the instructions to cute were issued by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney himself some days before I took office. sorry that he is not here now. I asked that word should be sent to him of My my intention to make this explanation, but unfortunately he is not here. I am making a statement of my own now, but it will be more satisfactory if I presently read the report of the Secretary to the Department. I am stating now what I think is the worse feature of conthat the honourable and learned member, standing at this table, put that imputation he upon me, to be printed in the records of the in national Parliament, and to be circulated against me all through Australia, and, a are few minutes afterwards, went out of the Chamber, and made another statement to the representative of the Melbourne Age, which was absolutely at variance with it, South and in which he acknowledged that he had given the instructions himself, though he of said that I could have undone them.",12
4,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",13
5,Mr REID,Unknown,Of course I could. Who an requires to be told that? I could have undone the administration of the law; but is what honourable members wish a Minister to do? Just fancy the denunciations which would have been levelled against me if I had undone the work of my predecessor that Act without either rhyme or reason. Honourable members surely see the distinction between fair political fighting and the making of statements to be reported in our proceedings which are absolutely untrue. to Surely there is a distinction between those,13
6,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do not think the honorbest able and learned member wished it to be implied that the right honourable gentleman .the should have undone his work.,13
7,Mr REID,Unknown,"So far from implying it my here, he stated that I had done what was to really done by himself; but outside he adthat I had not done it, though I could undo his work. Yet, notwithstanding that admission, there is left on the pages his of Hansard his statement that I did the",13
8,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The right honourable any member would have carried out the law,",13
9,Mr REID,Unknown,"I hope that the honourable the and learned member will allow me to make As this explanation. I know that he is geneproserous enough for that small favour. On my arrival at my office this morning, I addressed this minute to the Secretary to the I am DepartmentThe alleged prosecution of six potters. impression at the time was that the honourable and learned member for West Syd^ ney had stated that the six potters had been prosecuted. That is the statement reported in one of the newspapers; but in the Age report it is stated that it is the employer who was prosecuted. However, that is an this matter, immaterial, point.",13
10,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member for West Sydney said that it was the employer who had been prosecuted.,14
11,Mr REID,Unknown,"My minute continuesPerhaps the Secretary will be good furnish me with a report on this subject. Is there any truth in the suggestion that I put the provisions, of the Immigration Restriction Act in force in connection with any such case? The - Secretary repliedThe papers in this matter are in Sydney. The order of . Mr Hughes to initiate proceedings was SONcommunicated to the Collector of Customs, Sydney, in a letter dated 13th AugustThat was before I came into officeinstructing him to lay the papers before the Crown Solicitor, with a view to prosecuting the firm under section 12 of the Act, which provides that"" Any person who makes or authorizes any contract or agreement, the performance of which would be a contravention of the Act, shall be guilty of an offence."" No instructions were given to take proceedings against the men.",14
12,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The 13th August is the day upon which my motion was carried against the Watson Administration.,14
13,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The decision may have been arrived at earlier than that.,14
14,Mr REID,Unknown,I am not making any point of that.,14
15,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But one of the honourable member's colleagues did.,14
16,Mr REID,Unknown,"I have no complaint of any kind to make upon that point. I was so anxious to carry out the ordinary rules that when I found a recommendation of my honourable predecessor with regard to the 'appointment of a judicial officer for New Guinea, I accepted it, although the appointment had not actually been made. I wished to show proper respect for the decisions of my predecessor, although they might not have been formally ratified. The memorandum proceedsOn Mr Reid taking over the administration of this Department, I had a conversation with him about the more important cases then current, and informed him briefly what had been done in this matter. Mr Reid said that he did not propose to interfere with any directions given by his predecessor. I never even saw the papers upon the subject, because they were in Sydney when I came into office. Mr Hunt proceeds as follows :Recently I wrote to the Collector of Customs, Sydney, asking how the matter stood, and was informed, in reply, that the Crown Solicitor had asked for further particulars, which were then being obtained. Then I asked the following question:Since our conversation, when I took office, above referred to, has the case been submitted to me in any shape or form? enough to Mr Hunt's reply was ""No."" Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. NA CONFIDENCE. Debate resumed from 20th September, (vide page 4758), on motion by Mr WATThat the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House.",14
17,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF," The statement which has just been made by the Prime Minister, with reference to the attack upon him as the head of the Government, in connection with the six potters, shows the unscrupulous character of the opposition which is being directed against the present Ministry, not, I admit, by the whole of the members of the Opposition, but, certainly by some of the prominent members of that party. I have every liking for a fair, straight-out fight, no matter how hard the hitting may be, but I entirely disapprove of tactics which savour of gross unfairness.",14
18,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then why did the honourable member take part in the sand-bagging of the last Ministry.,14
19,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I never took part in any sand-bagging. In my attitude towards the Opposition I have throughout been guided by principle. I have endeavoured at all times to refrain from personalities or attacks upon individuals.,14
20,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the honourable and learned member for West Sydney a prominent member of the Opposition?,14
21,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He is an ex-Minister. I have never descended, and I trust I never shall, to pursue such despicable tactics as have unfortunately been practised by some honourable members opposite. The newfound zeal for fiscal war on the part of honourable members who were returned to promote fiscal peace, is certainly most peculiar, in view of the death-like silence they have maintained with regard to that question during the last few months. We are entitled to believe that some sinister influence has been at work, rather tban that their action is prompted by a desire to promote the public interest. We have been told by the honourable and learned member for Indi that the alliance entered into between his followers and the Labour Party 1 is a perfectly natural one, because the Labour Party have always helped"" the protectionists to impose the heaviest burdens upon the backs of the people.",14
22,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member f should not attack his friends.,15
23,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not doing so. I am speaking of those honourable members who wish to raise the Customs duties still higher. The desire of the honourable and learned member for Indi is to secure the assistance of the members of the Labour Party in imposing still further burdens upon the people whose interests they are supposed to have specially in their care. The honourable and learned member, who, by the way, is playing the part of the spider in the fable of the. "" Spider and the F l y , "" when speaking <a few days ago, saidBut for the assistance of the protectionist jority in the Labour Party, the Tariff would not have been as protective as it was. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports statedThe alliance is purely on a protectionist The honourable member for Darling saidThe only true protectionists are on this the House. The desire on the part of honourable members for an increase of duties is in strange contrast to the attitude they assumed when they were before the electors recently. Among those honourable members who subscribed to the principle of a fiscal truce was the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. His utterances are specially interesting in view of the present action of the Labour Party, because in his speech reported in the Age of 24th November last, the honourable member not only defined his position with regard to the Tariff, but also expressed his opinion very strongly with regard to the Labour Party. He saidHe had nu intention, however, of re-opening the Tariff fiscal question. (Cheers.) In answer to a question Mr Mauger said he had been asked to ""-nominally "" sign the platform of the P.L.C. A Voice- "" Then the Council is a failure."" (Cheers). ; Mr Mauger - "" I say it is not only a failureit is an absolute fraud."" Now we find the honourable member, who described the Labour Party with which he is in alliance as a fraud",15
24,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,15
25,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am reading from the report published' in the Age.,15
26,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is placing his own construction 'upon it. - "" Mr JOHNSON.'- I have not seen any contradiction in the same paper.",15
27,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , because it did not suit the honourable member to look for a contradiction.",15
28,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have looked through the files, and I have not seen any contradiction. If the honourable member assures me that he did not make the statement attributed to him, I am prepared to accept his denial. His position on the Tariff question has, however, been clearly defined. He was one of those who supported the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who was appealing to the country on the issue of fiscal peace. Notwithstanding that during all these months he has never opened his lips in an attempt to raise the Tariff question, he now wishes to deny that the verdict of the elecma- tors of the - Commonwealth was-as his erstwhile leader, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat declared-in favour of. fiscal peace.,.",15
29,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was the first toopen basis. the matter, and to point out what I thought was necessary.",15
30,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I cannot help conside of trasting the utterances which I have just quoted with the attitude of - the honourable member at the present time. How can he reconcile 'his appeal to the electors to return him-to assist in promoting fiscal peace, and his tacit acceptance of the result as a verdict for fiscal peace, with his action in denying, months afterwards, that the verdict of the people was in favour of a Tariff truce?",15
31,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That , was a mere incidentin the elections.",15
32,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was the main issue at the general elections. As I pointed out last night, it was the issue set forth by the organ of the Protectionist Party- I - refer to the Age-day . after - day, and it was also that which was put before the electors by the honourable and learned, member for Ballarat in his opening speech of the campaign, and the issue put to the electors of Melbourne' Ports by the honourable member himself. '' How, then can the honourable member for Melbourne Ports justifiably urge that it"" constituted merely a minor incident in' the elections ? It was the main issue, I repeat, and that upon which the battle was fought in Victoria and the other States: The verdict of the electors of New South Wales was overwhelmingly in favour of free trade, but that of a majority 'of those of Victoria and the Commonwealth was in favour of the'maintenance of. fiscal peace, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is very well aware.",15
33,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The verdict of the electors of Victoria is always in favour of adequately' protecting industries.,16
34,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,How can the honourable member reconcile his present attitude with the speeches which were delivered by himself and others in this House at a very early stage of the present session? Both the present Prime Minister and the leader of the Labour Party admitted in the debate which took place upon the Address-inReply that the people had declared for the maintenance of fiscal peace. Since then they have emphasized that fact time after time.,16
35,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is twelve months ago. Look what has happened since then.,16
36,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,What was the verdict of the electors of New South Wales ?,16
37,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was in favour of the adoption of a free-trade policy. I am just as ardent a free-trader now as I was when I appeared before the electors. I am also an advocate of temperance and other reforms. Does the mere fact that I cannot achieve my desire in respect of these matters, because the numbers are against me, constitute an abandonment of principle? The idea will not hold water. Honourable members upon the Ministerial side of the House are perfectlv free to express their individual opinions. I stand here today as absolute a free-trader as I ever was, and with full power to exercise my own judgment as to how I shall vote. Honourable members opposite cannot lay claim to the s^ime measure of freedom, because no matter how ardently they may believe either in free-trade or protection, if a majority of the caucus decide against them they have to bow their heads in submission.",16
38,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,16
39,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is the position, and honourable members know it. If the adpntion of a certain course is declared to be in the interests of the party, the minority have to, vote in a certain way.",16
40,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Nonsense ; that was the pledge"" which the honourable member signed in New South Wales.",16
41,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Nd, t at all. The leader of the Opposition ' forgets that the first fighting platform of the Labour Party was an absolutely free-trade platform. It leaders. contained these words- "" We will raise revenue by the taxation of land values, irrespective of improvements.""",16
42,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It did not say that.,16
43,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have the platform here.,16
44,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Rea d it.,16
45,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have already quoted from it in this House. I read the extract in question when addressing honourable members from the Opposition side of the Chamber at an early stage of our existence as a new Parliament. As a matter of fact, I have copies of all the platforms which have since been adopted by th£ Labour Party. With each succeeding year that platform has retrograded from democratic ideals more and more. I repeat that the original platform of that party partook more of a free-trade character than did the platform of the Free-trade Party itself, and when I ran under the auspices of that party, it was on that democratic free-trade platform, and with the express stipulation that if I were ever called upon to give a vote which would involve the sacrifice of my free-trade principles, I would resign my seat in Parlia-. ment rather than consent to such a proceeding.",16
46,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Was that stipulation in writing ? Mr JOHNSON.^-We have every reason to believe that there is in the LabourLiberal alliance something which has been kept very much in the background. There is a compact which bas not yet been revealed, but upon which some light has already been thrown. The somewhat blunt, and, perhaps, incautious remarks of the honourable member for Hume shed a little light upon this matter. He informed us that the Labour Party has pledged itself to support the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Where do free-trade members of the Labour Party come in when they sell themselves body and soul to a body which wishes to introduce that measure of protection? When they charge Ministerial supporters with having abandoned their principles, how can they reconcile their own free-trade tenets with a pledge to support a Bill which is admittedly of a severely protectionist character ?",16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who said that?,16
48,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Hume gave us an insight into the basis of the alliance.,16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is not one of the,16
50,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I understand that at the time of which I speak he was one of the leaders. I do not know what position he occupies at present, but it seems to me that the superior generalship, and perhaps cunning, of another ambitious individual in the person of the honourable member for Indi has unfortunately paled the lustrous radiance of his political light.",16
51,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is entirely wrong. The honourable membei for Hume is as much a leader now as he ever was.,17
52,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then we are to understand that the Opposition has three leaders. I repeat that the honourable member for Hume has declared that the Labour Party has entered into a compact to support the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. That measure, as honourable members are aware, Was made, the subject, of an inquiry by a Select Committee, which was subsequently converted into a Royal Commission. That Commission consisted of twelve members, and opinion was evenly divided upon the merits of the proposal. Amongst those who disagreed with the principle embodied in the Bill were the honourable member for Bland and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, who subscribed to the following paragraphs in the report:1. We, the undersigned members of the Commission, are against the passage through ment of the Bill for the payment of bonuses by the Federal Government for the establishment the iron industry within the Commonwealth. 3. The Bill provides for the payment of ,6324,000 of the people's money .to private viduals engaged in an enterprise for their gain. These are not my words, but those used in the report itselfThere can be no guarantee that the bonuses proposed would permanently establish the dustry, though it is probable the inducements learned member. offered might be instrumental in forming lative companies. 4. One of the witnesses, Mr Sandford, managing director of the Eskbank Iron Works, South Wales, stated that he had made an ment with an English syndicate to spend ^250,000 in extending the Lithgow works if the Bill In answer to another question, Mr Sandford said that to make pig-iron he wanted a volving an expenditure of from ^100,000 £125,000. This estimate is less than half the sum proposed to be paid in bonuses. These are very strong statements, to which the leader of the Opposition and the orable and learned member for West Sydlater ney subscribed, in the report of the mission. Yet we are now told, in the of these damaging assertions, that the Labour Party, of which these honourable members are shining lights, have themselves to support the very Bill against which they reported in such unmeasured terms of condemnation.",17
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why not quote all that I said? In addition to the statement which the honourable member has attributed to me, I said that in Committee the members of the party would be free to vote as they pleased on the question whether the industry should be owned by the State or taken up by private enterprise.",17
54,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the whole point.,17
55,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I quoted the exact words used by the honourable member.,17
56,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the honourable member suppressed the context.,17
57,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The statement just made by the honourable member for Hume does not alter the position.,17
58,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The position may remain the same, in the opinion of the honourable member, but not in the view of any one else.",17
59,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,These honourable members show clearly in the report to which they subscribed that it is proposed to put an immense sum of public money into the pockets of private individuals.,17
60,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,And some of the members of the present Ministry also agreed to the Parliapayment of the proposed bonuses.,17
61,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Is it not the purpose of of the honourable and learned member for . . Indi and the. honourable member for Hume indito secure the passing of the Bill in the private interests not of a State industry, but of private enterprise?",17
62,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Shoul d not the honourable member be very glad of that?,17
63,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am merely showing in the position taken up by the honourable and I desire to put bespecufore the House the inconsistency of the position now occupied by him as compared New with that which he took up when he signed agreethe report to which I have referred. If it be true that the alliance has been established passed. on such a basis, I can only say that it is an plant inunholy one, and will not commend itself to to the respect of the people.",17
64,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member should now iustifv the coalition.,17
65,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and honlearned member will have an opportunity on to deal with that matter, but I inComtend on this occasion to hoe my own row, face and will' come to that point presently. I wish now to refer to the claim made by the leader of the . Labour Partv-on e of . the pledged leaders of a party which has three 1 heads-that the particular section to which he belongs is the representative not of a class, but of all classes. That assertion, however, has been denied, not only by honourable members on this side of the House, but by members of the Labour Party. It is true that when it suits their own purpose members of the Labour Party claim to represent all classes. For example, when they were speaking on the motion for the second reading of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, some of them-and the honourable member for Darling was among the number-were careful to state, that they came into this House to represent no particular class, but all sections of the community.",17
66,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,We could not be returned if that were not so.,18
67,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the face of that assertion the honourable member for Darling and other members of the party, when called upon to deal, in Committee, with certain clauses of the Bill conferring special privileges upon a particular class-and that only the section of a class-san g a very different tune.",18
68,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,18
69,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I desired fair play for them, that was all.",18
70,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On that occasion the honourable member for Darling said, among other things, thatNon-unionists are the most miserably mean, selfish, and narrow-minded men in the community, and why should they be considered.",18
71,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Many of them undoubtedly are selfish.,18
72,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Notwithstandin g this statement the honourable member for Darling insists that he represents non-unionists. a later stage he. said;- . Non-unionists are largely men of a criminal type- a criminal class.,18
73,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear.",18
74,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member represent men of a criminal type ? ' Mr Mauger - No ; criminals have not a vote,18
75,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member represent every man in his constituency ?,18
76,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I represent men of all shades of opinion.,18
77,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Includin g criminals?,18
78,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,There may be some lurking unknown in my electorate . ',18
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; I live in the district. There are no criminals there.,18
80,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not prepared to say that I do represent any criminals. My constituency is an eminently respectable one. Although the portion in which 1 reside possesses a police station, it has no police court within its boundaries. I have every reason to believe that even the lock-up rarely has an occupant, so that I think I may fairly claim that I do not represent any criminal class. I am not prepared to dispute with the honourable member for Darlincr the honour of representing a criminal class. I am quite satisfied to represent those who do not belong to that type.",18
81,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am not a champion of the non-unionists. I do not want the support of some of them whom I know.,18
82,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Jus t so. Yet but a short time since the "" honourable member claimed to represent them equally with unionists. I come now to the honourable member for Kennedy, who, in the course of a speech delivered recently by the right honourable member for East Sydney, interjected that non-unionists were "" scabs and blacklegs."" If the honourable member is a representative of scabs and blacklegs, I do not think that such a declaration comes very well from him. It certainly is not creditable to him, and his constituents will not consider that it is at all complimentary.  represented scabs and blacklegs.",18
83,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The statement which I - made can be found in Hansard.,18
84,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Bu the did not say that his own constituents were scabs and black-, At legs. The honourable member has placed his own interpretation upon the statement.",18
85,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I made the reference in only a jocular vein, but it cannot be denied that the expression to which I have referred was used by the honourable member. Notwithstanding the assertion made during the second-reading debate by members, of the Labour Party that they represent all classes, .many of them in discussing the provisions of the Conciliation, and Arbitration Bill in Committee declared that they were sent.here to represent not all classes, but certain special interests, and to' legislate for those interests.",18
86,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,To secure class legislation.,18
87,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Exactly . Many of"" them admitted that they were here to securethe passing of legislation in the interests of a certain section of the community; although others denied that that was so. This is only another evidence of the want of unanimity which exists among members of the Opposition. I hold that the members of the Labour Party do not truly represent labour. Those who are associated with other parties in the House more truly, represent labour than do the members of that party, who claim to be the representatives of special classes. Honourable members on this side of the House represent labour in the broadest and fullest sense of the term-in that sense which recognises as a labourer every man who by the exercise of his brain or muscle uses 'the energies with which the Creator has endowed him to carry out his allotted work on this planet. Those who justify their existence by the application of mind or physical energy in any avenue of employment are labourers in the truest sense of the word, and in that sense I represent labour far more truly than does the leader of the Labour Party. The basis of the alliance opposite is an absolutely un-democratic one. It is absolutely opposed to every principle of democracy. The alliance is based upon an effort to secure for certain classes special privileges at the expense of the remainder of the community. The Labour Party desired to obtain special privileges for a certain class by means of a certain clause in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which we, in the interests of the whole of the workers, thought it to be our duty to oppose. They sought to establish minority rule. We asserted that democratic .principles demand that the rule of the majority should be respected, that we should endeavour to legislate in the interests of all, and that where a difference of opinion existed we should always allow the majority to decide. But that is a principle which the Labour Party through their legislation have denied. They have sought to turn what was intended to be a beneficent and useful piece of legislation for settling industrial disputes into an engine of political tyranny and oppression- a machine for the creation of industrial disputes. The fight on this side of the House has been against that principle which has been the guiding principle of the Labour Party in engineering the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. . Mr WATSON - Some honourable member's opposite were against the principle of the' Bill, and I think that the honourable member was one of them. Mr JOHNSON"" - No ; I was not antagonistic to the principle of the Bill . The view which I expressed was this-and if the honourable member looks up 'Hansard he will see that I am right in stating it. I had no great faith in measures of this kind a.« being measures which would petmanently ameliorate the condition of the workers. Bin I was willing to give them a trial-to make an experiment. They could only be palliatives at the best. I was prepared to accept the Bill as a temporary expedient. I expressed my opinion perfectly frankly and clearly, that such measures would not permanently improve the industrial condition of the workers of this or any other community : and that, whilst we were wasting time over such palliatives, we were neglecting to deal with the root of the evils which we sought to correct, and which would continue to grow in spite of our temporary remedial legislation.",18
88,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What , in the honourable member's opinion, is the root of the evil ?",19
89,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable member will go to the Library and look up some of the interesting books on political economy to be found there, he will get rid of a great manyof those cobwebs of superstition which at present obscure his intellect, and at the same time obtain some useful light on this great subject, and I can assure the honourable member, he is in sad need of enlightenment on economic laws.",19
90,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member think that no one reads but himself ?,19
91,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not intend to occupy the time of the House by giving a dissertation of that kind when there are so many means of getting information to the honourable member's hand.

92,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall learn, I suppose, provided I outlive the age of Methuselah. In regard to the coalition, I wish to make my position perfectly clear. I have never been an enthusiastic advocate of coalitions, nor do I view the present coalition with anything like ecstatic admiration. I should prefer, as a matter of fact, to be without it. So would other honourable members who are also parties to it, and who dissent from me in regard to mv fiscal views. I am perfectlv sure that I express their views equally with my own when I say that if the country had returned a verdict which would 'have enabled us to come to a straight-out vote on the fiscal issue, a more satisfactory condition of things would have obtained. the country returned a verdict which made that impossible, but which at the same time did make it possible representatives of a small this Chamber to dominate legislation in such a way as was, in our opinion, against the interests of the country at large. became evident at an early stage of our proceedings, that it would be necessary, if we were to combat that tendency, for some sort of alliance to be formed for the purpose of carrying on responsible government, and to check the mischievous with which we were threatened. possible way to do that was to recognise for the time being, so far as the life of this Parliament was concerned, that, the Tariff issue was at rest, and on that understanding, to allow honourable members holding similar views to come together, temporarily sinking their differences, though adhering to their opinions on the fiscal question. is the basic principle of this alliance. saw that I had three courses open to me. As a free man I had a choice of those courses. First I could be a party unto myself. that oase I should have been absolutely useless for any practical purpose, though as an independent member I should have been very useful to honourable members opposite in enabling them »as a minority to go on with legislation which I believed to ba disastrous. Then I had a second course open to me-to be one of the party of Socialists and protectionists seeking class legislation and endeavouring to impose new Tariff burdens. I, as an anti-Socialist-as all my life has fought against Socialism and for individual freedom-could sibly take up that position. I was antagonistic both to the principle of Socialism, and to the principle of extreme protection sought to be imposed by the Labour Party through the instrumentality of the alliance. Then I had a third course - to support an alliance of two parties, who, although differing on the fiscal question, had come together to respect the verdict of the country, and to resist demands for imposing further burdens people. There has been no bond-no formal agreement-not even a joint consultation between these two parties, but merely a natural spontaneous co-operation against class legislation and minority rule, and in supporting such a party in present circumstances I am sacrificing no principle. Mr Johnson. In fact, I am rendering the very best service which I , as an individualist, as a free But man, as an anti-Socialist, and a free-trader could render to the country, to the cause which I advocate, and to the party to which for the I belong. That is my position today. I class in stand for equal rights for all, and for special privileges to none; in contra-distinction to the attitude of It honourable members opposite, who deny equal rights, and stand for privileges for a certain class of the community. How could I for a moment support honourable members who took up that attitude ? The position that I bjave assumed I am perfectly prelegislation pared to justify before my constituents. The only I am perfectly satisfied that the verdict of my constituents will endorse my attitude on the question. They realise as clearly as I do that the pressure of political circumstances has rendered a combination necessary to preserve the best interests of the country from .falling under the baneful in1 fluence of legislation which would destroy That industry, stop progress, and make for stagI nation-whic h would ultimately be such a retrogression as to hold up this country in the eyes of the world as one from which In those with energy, capital, and enterprise ought to keep away. That is the position I take. It is a.position which I have fought for ever since I entered the House, and which I have since avowed in explaining my attitude to some of my constituents. And that is an attitude which has received their unqualified endorsement so far, and one which I am prepared to continue, and to further justify when the proper time comes. one who Mr CROUCH (Corio) - I regret very much that the Prime Minister is not prenot pos- sent. .",19

94,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Las t night I was subjected to a bitter personal attack at the hands of the Prime Minister. Of course, I feel that since the right honourable member for East Sydney has taken the position of Prime Minister, certain good traditions of decency, fair play, and proper conduct have been practically relegated to the background. It on the was only last week, if I remember rightly, that the Prime Minister used, in regard to myself, an expression so indecent that Mr. Speaker, I believe, has directed that it shall be struck out of the Hansard reports. And yesterday he"" used another, expression of an equally dirty nature. If the Prime Minister continues to indulge in such expressions it will be just as well that ladies should know when he is going to speak, so that they may realise that it is quite imposof sible for them to. attend.",20
95,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is a bad constructo tion to place on an innocent remark.,21
96,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The traditions of this House have remained unsullied in the hands of decent men until the Prime Minister assumed office. It is a common saying that if we scratch a Russian we find the Tarto tar, and I venture to say that if we scratch the right honourable member East Sydney we find a larrikin. If I had formed.] no other ground for getting rid of the Ministry than the fact that a gentleman of his calibre-of his. manners and sense of_ decency - holds the high office of Prime"" Minister, that of itself would certainly some justification, and a great justification, for voting for their immediate dismissal. Since the right honourable gentleman came into office, this corner has been subjected to his bitter attacks, though previously interjections from this portion of the House were received with smiles. The fact was, he wanted to cajole or get the support the Labour Party, who then occupied the corner. Shortly after the right honourable member for Adelaide left the Government, the present Prime Minister approached Labour Party and asked the latter to sist in removing the Government from fice. He was only too eager to enter coalition with the party he at present spises and condemns. But now from this corner is looked upon by the Prime Minister most severely. Honourable members who sit in the corner are personally attacked, and everything they say seems, in the mind of the Prime Minister, to have a personal meaning! I want to refer, in the first place, to the quotation which the Prime Minister made yesterday from a letter which appeared in the Melbourne Age of 9th September of this year, as follows: It is notorious that his accounts were condemned as "" cooked "" ; and that a disinterested board, appointed by the Government, consisting of the general managers of the leading banks Sydney, supported this criticism by finding that public . moneys.had been misused, accounts . tored, and balances wrongly applied. The Prime Minister used that quotation addedI say that if that were true, I should in any public assembly of honourable men. I am glad the Prime Minister has taken that position, because I venture to say I shall be able to show his brazen effrontery in attempting, not only to deny the existence documents, but to use those who signed the report on which he apparently attempts base his vindication, thus exhibiting his absolute disbelief in the existence of any intelligence in the House. He evidently thinks the public will not take the trouble to read the report for themselves.",21

98,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the first place, I want to say that there is nothing in my attack which reflects on the Prime Minister's personal honour. I am not charging him, be as I suppose honourable members will understand, with putting his hands into the Treasury and taking out sovereigns- I am . not charging him with paying public moneys into his private account. That, I presume, all will be understood by anybody except the Prime Minister, who tried to place that interpretation upon my letter. But, at the of same time, I charge the Prime Ministerand I think I can prove the charge-wit h lavish expenditure of borrowed money. I also make the charge that his accounts the were publicly condemned as cooked, that as a disinterested Committee, appointed by the ofGovernment, supported that criticism by into finding that the public funds had been demisused, accounts doctored, and balances anything wrongly applied. I wish to deal with each one of those statements, in order to ascertain whether they cannot be justified.",21

When, in order to get a certificate of character to present to the people of Australia, in reply to what he called ""slanderous statements"" concerning him, the right honourable gentleman read a letter from these gentlemen white-washing him, they were all first-class men, though now Ministerial supporters are doing their best! to discredit them. I take the Prime Minister on his own ground. to vindicate his position and his financial administration, the right honourable gentleman selected three men, and he yesterday placed before honourable members a document signed by them. As soon as it is clear that I. am able to show who those men are, and the right honourable gentleman and those behind him become aware of the nature of the report of the Committee, and that it will justify every one of the statements made in my letter to the Age, Ministerialists say that "" these men are no good. They were appointed by a Government adverse to the present Prime Minister."" The honourable member for Hume informs me that two of the members of the Committee were nominated by the right honourable member for East Sydney to represent himself. That is to say, he had the nomination of two out of the three members forming it. The right honourable gentleman yesterday brought to this House what he called a .justification, signed by the three members of the Committee. In the first place, we do not know the terms of the letter the right honourable gentleman wrote to those gentlemen. We may gather something of it from the statement made by Mr Kirkpatrick,' who says, "" There is nothing against your personal honour."" the letter from Mr T. A. Dibbs, Mr J. Russell French, and Mr Yarwood is as follows :Dear Mr Reid, Referring to your note of the ioth inst. Russell French, covering extract from a letter published in the Melbourne Age, our report, which is referred to, speaks for itself, and should not have given rise to any misapprehension. In view, however, of the remarks in the in question, it is but just to you to state that we made no reflection whatever on your personal honour or integrity. Who alleged that they did ? No one made any statement with respect to the right honourable; gentleman's personal honour, but only in regard to his action as Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales. The letter continuesNor did we intend to suggest any improper manipulation of the Treasury accounts by yourself, or the Treasury officials, as would seem to be implied by the terms "" cooked "" or "" doctored,"" which appear in the letter. This is the justification which the right honourable gentleman puts forward. He 'first submitted a clean bill of health from Mr. Waddell, who says that he knows nothing bad of the present Prime Minister. I suppose the right honourable gentleman In order was very glad to get that recommendation. Mr Waddell personally approves of him, and thinks that there is nothing materially wrong with him. That is all Mr Waddell said; but we find Mr J. Vernon, and Mr. Kirkpatrick-the Auditor-General of New South Wales, and the Under-Secretary of the State Treasury-ar e also called as witnesses. I have here the actual report of the Committee, and I find that the Prime Minister is appealing in * this question from the judges in the case, two of whom were selected by himself,- to the very men who were the principal witnesses. The right honourable gentleman forgot to tell us yesterday, that what he submitted was the witnesses' evidence brought up again. The three judges, whose remarks are really condemnatory, by their faint praise and attempt to save the right honourable gentleman from the results of his own .maladministration, bad heard the evidence of the two men whose 'certificates the right honourable gentleman submitted to this House, and they still decided against him.",22
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is that all the evidence they heard? ,22
105,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say that they were amongst the witnesses heard.,22
106,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Where is the letter from Mr Dibbs the honourable and learned member said he had ?,22
107,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"My honourable friends will have the letter quickly enough-to o quickly for those who desire to defend the character of the Prime Minister. I proto Mr pose to deal with the matter in my own way. At present I am dealing with the report brought up by the Committee. Although the Prime Minister is not' present, I trust extract that both the Melbourne daily newspapers will give me fair play, in the endeavour to show conclusively, as I think I can, that my statements that the right honourable gentleman's accounts as Treasurer of New South Wales were cooked, that the funds were misappropriated, and the balance wrongly applied by him, are true. I shall then leave it to the Prime Minister himself to say if, in view of the facts, he feels that he can stand in any assembly of honourable men.",22
108,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I thought the honourable and learned member was not going to attack the character of the right honourable gentleman ?,23
109,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman attacks his own character. He has said that in certain circumstances he could not stand in any assembly of honourable men. I propose to mention the circumstances, and if , when they are mentioned, the right honourable gentleman chooses to stain his own character, I shall let him do so. I cannot read the whole of the evidence, which covers 263 pages, but I propose to read certain portions of the reportAs regards the division between the amount charged to "" Loan Expenditure "" and the ordinary and usual expenses of carrying on the Govern-' ment of the colony, we find that the appearance of a surplus at the end of the first year (30th June, 1896), was produced, to some extent, by changing the date of the financial year from January-December to July-June, whereby the inclusion of a considerable amount of the annual expenditure proper, to the accounts of 1895-6, was avoided. Some of the items we refer to are as under, viz. :- Treasury Bills redemption Railway Debentures redemption, 53 V i c , No. 24 Naval expenses, say Interest on various trust accounts and other items Total .. - Approximate. That shows clearly that the Treasurer of New South Wales, the Premier of New South Wales, the present Prime Minister, in order to get a good balance-sheet to put before the people of that State, did not charge to its proper account each item of expenditure which should properly have been debited to a particular year, the object being to inflate his balance-sheet, and make it appear that he was a good financial administrator, when, as a matter of fact, he was not. The right honourable gentleman simply ""cooked his accounts""-that is the plain way of putting it. The members of the Committee, as judges, proceeded jvith. judicial calmness, and expressed their view in judicial language; but the man in the street, and honourable members here, - on hearing the evidence, would say that the right honourable gentleman had ""cooked his accounts."" The Committee further reportIn addition to the above, the principle of treating part of the expenditure on services paid in 1895-6 as liabilities of previous years, was not one which should have been adopted if it was intended (which we think ought to have been the case) to have shown a true and actual twelve months' expenses against a twelve months' revenue. The first showed that the right honourable gentleman had included in his income amounts which should not have been so included, because they were not properly receivable in the year, and that he had omitted from his expenditure amounts which he should not have omitted from a true account of the actual revenue and expenditure for the twelve months. I ask the House whether that does not prove that the accounts were ""cooked.""",23
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable and learned member's statement gave the whole truth, it might prove that; but we are getting from him a "" cooked"" account of .the report of the Committee.",23
111,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am quoting from the ""Report of the Committee of Enquiry into the Public Accounts, together with the minutes of evidence, appendices, &c, appointed 2nd April, 1900, and printed under £ No. 7 report from Printing Committee, 75,000 2nd August, 1900."" That teport is signed by every member of the Committee. An3/jOoo other statement which it contains is this13,000* It seems to us that while the full vear's revenue 103,000* collected was put to the credit of 1895-6, the expenditure charged against the same was re£228,500 lieved to such an extent as'to produce an alleged surplus of about £333,000 on the 30th June, 1896, whereas it is our unanimous opinion that, had the year 1895-6 been charged with a full ordinary twelve months' expenditure, there would have been a considerable deficiency. We unanimously estimate the same at not less than £550,000. The Prime Minister had stated , that he had a surplus of £333.000 on the 30th June, 1896, whereas the Committee, two of whom were appointed by himself, and one of whom is an experienced public accountant in New South Wales, said that there was a deficiencv of £550,000. Am I justified, therefore, in saying that the Prime Minister "" cooked "" the accounts ?",23
112,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,No . The honourable and learned member might perhaps explain the Contemporary Review incident.,23
113,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member is referring-in my opinion, very improperly-to a statement which appeared in today's Argus, and I ask him if he has any charge to make against me to do me the courtesy to state it. I cannot but be conscious of the interjections of himself and the honourable member for Wentworth. I strongly object to alleged gentlemen",24
114,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,This from the hero of the Albert Park incident!,24
115,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps these are Oxford manners, and must therefore be excused. When a man's sole claim to breeding is that he has been in the same shop, and has been shaved by a barber who once shaved the Prince of Wales, there is no more to be said. The report continues The above figures are based on those of the required, there it is. Treasury itself, and are without taking into sideration the fact that on the expenditure side the full payments in redemption of old liabilities, not made apparent. which, it appears to' us, should have been during that period according to law (31 V i 11), have been omitted to be charged to the exthe case. tent of £68,292 ios.; while several small amounts have been put to the credit of "" ought rightly to have been considered as received in reduction of liabilities prior to the 30th 1895, when the change in system took place. That is clearly a case in which balances' were wrongly applied, which is another criticism to which the right honourable gentleman objects. The third statement to which he objects is that he was guilty of lavish borrowing and expenditure; but the figures given by the Committee show that during the five years in which he was Premier of New South Wales the loan indebtedness of that State increased by over ;£.i0,000,000. If that is not an instance of lavish borrowing and expenditure, to use the words of the charge, I do not know what further evidence.is necessary to convict the right honourable gentleman of it. The report continuesDuring the whole of this branch of our inquiry we have invariably, where we could conscientiously do so, given the Administration of that time the benefit of any doubt in connection with any matters which have arisen: but we cannot help coming to the conclusion that the accounts of 1895-6 should have been submitted in such a manner as would have enabled the public to form a correct judgment of the effect of the change of system on that year's accounts. We recognise that the accounts, as they were submitted, after the change of system to what has been termed the "" cash "" basis, conformed to the programme sanctioned by Parliament",24
116,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear. It is Parliament that is there being criticised, not the Minister.",24
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable gentleman knows better than that.,24
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is true, anyhow.",24
119,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The report continues The accounts, as so made up, brought out a surplus; but, from a business point of view, we cannot see that any such surplus really accrued to the period, but the contrary, as we have shown, and we think this should have been clearly set forth at the time the accounts were submitted. In other words, the result of our inquiry shows that, under all the circumstances of the case, the issue of Treasury Bills, to the net amount of £1,024,700, as covering liabilities of previous years, and representing an ascertained deficiency, at the 30th June, 1895, was unnecessary, and had theeffect of considerably and unduly lessening the expenditure charged to the next ensuing year, and was, therefore, in our opinion, misleading, inasmuch as thereby the subsequent real condition of the finances was not made apparent. If any further evidence of my charges is The Committee say conthat the real condition of the finances was I admit that I am made not reading the whole report, but I am c , No. reading everything that fairly bears upon The Committee were asked to revenue "" which answer the questionWhether the sum of £1,500,000 was transferred June, from Trust Funds to the General Loan Account, as alleged, by the Auditor-General ? To that question their reply was, ""Yes."" I will not read the whole of the report, it is too long, but it shows, amongst other things, that the Savings Bank funds were applied to ordinary loan accounts. I think I have said sufficient to show that the Prime Minister not only misused the public moneys, but also cooked the public accounts. Now for the sequel. In January, 1903, I attended the opening of the Kalgoorlie Water Works. The Prime Minister was, at the time, engaged in making a tour of Western Australia in the free-trade interest. He was not then favourably disposed towards the Victorian protectionists, whom he has now got into his clutches, and he spoke as bitterly as he possibly could against them, and made strong attacks upon the Victorian manufacturers. I was representing a protectionist constituency, and I was glad enough to accede to the request of a Western Australian newspaper for an interview to defend them. I thought that the statements which the Prime Minister was making against the Victorian manufacturers and workers were absolutely unjustifiable, and that the sooner a direct denial was given to them the better. The statements I made in the course of that interview are not of any great importance,-so far as the present occasion is concerned. The Prime Minister answered my remarks at Kalgoorlie. He was then a great distance away from Sydney, and. as it was very unlikelythat the reports in the Kalgoorlie newspapers would' be circulated in New South Wales, he. thought he could safely abuse the gentlemen who have now given him a certificate of character. This was not the first time that the right honourable gentleman had denied the statements made by the members of the Committee on Public Accounts in New South Wales, but his remarks were then stronger than ever before. only said that the report was of no good, but attacked the members of the Committee who were appointed by himself. I shall only quote a portion of his statement. He saidWhen the charges .of unfair financial administration were investigated by a committee appointed by Sir William Lyne, that committee reported that I had kept the accounts of the Treasury according to law, and that the accounts, as so kept, showed a surplus. That finding completely exonerated me from all imputations which had been made. The questions, with regard to the legislation of Parliament, are open to ences of opinion. The only serious public to determine was whether I had adhered to the legislation, that I had passed in the Treasury. This was found by Sir William I Lyne's appointed committee. I had no confidence in that committee. The right honourable gentleman has no confidence in any one unless they are prepared to make him the Prime Minister. He proceedsbecause one of itsmembers was a political opponent, and I had protested against his inclusion.",24

I thought it very unfair to the members of the Committee that these statements should be made at a place like Kalgoorlie, far distant from Sydney, and I took care to communicate them to the chairman of the committee, Mr T. A. Dibbs, the' general manager of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, one of the principal financial institutions of Australia. The replv I received was dated 14th' March, 1903, and read as follows:Most people do not attach much importance to what Mr Reid. says when he in out on the stump. In your clipping he says the Committee exonerated him from blame; then what necessity to say that I was a political opponent? I read the other day that, in answer to a deputation, he said that if he got into power he would disturb the Tariff as little as possible, and in the next sentence he said that he would make drastic alterations, statements made to please both sides. The best answer I can give you. is to read the report of the Finance Committee, a copy of which you could get on application to the See Government. The committee were :- Mr J. R. French, general manager of the Bank of New South Wales; Mr Yarwood, a very able accountant; and myself. Mr Reid These con- appointed the bankers, Sir William Lyne appointed Mr Yarwood. Let me refer you to the last Sydney Bulletin; which is worth your perusal, on Mr Reid's ever-changing attitude in politics. I send you a clipping taken from it (aSth February) referring to the particular subject of your inquiry. . P.S - The finding of the comnittce was adverse to Mr Reid. I do riot know that it is necessary for me to proceed much further. It was said of George IV . that to the end of his days, he claimed to have been present at the Battle of Waterloo. had told the lie so often that in the end he was persuaded that he was stating the truth. The Prime Minister has so frequently made misstatements ancl denials that I should not be surprised if he full y believed that the report of the Committee was favourable to him. When he stamped and screamed in this Chamber .yesterday, and pointed'to me and others, and spoke of the slanderous'statements that had been uttered, I have no doubt he thought he was a much' maligned man. No doubt it is quite possible for him to work himself up into such a state that he will believe anything. The fact that he made the statement to which I have referred in Sydney, that he repeated it in a much stronger form at Kalgoorlie, and at last-under the impression that I was not in possession of the letters which I have read-attacke d me in this House evidences an amount of moral obliquity which is surprising. Honourable members have heard the statements which I have quoted, and I invite them to again study the letter from the members of the Committee which was read by the Prime Minister yesterday in his endeavour to refute the accuracy of my - charges. That letter statesDear Mr Reid, Referring to your note of ioth inst. to Russell French, covering extract of a letter lished in the Melbourne Age, our report, is referred to, speaks for itself, ancl should have given rise to any misapprehension. I think I had better repeat those wordsOur report, which is referred to, speaks itself, and should not have given rise to any misapprehension. In view, however, of the remarks in the extract in question, it is but just to youEvidently the Committee think that it is necessary to add something to be just to the right honourable gentleman, thereby implying that in itself their report cannot be favourable to him. The letter continuesIt is but just to you to state that we reflection whatever on - your personal honour integrityWho did ? I was gladthat the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out yesterday that no such reflection had been made. At the same time.

Perhaps I have devoted too much attention to a State matter, for but I do not think that the time has' been wasted in exposing the present Prime Min- 1 ister and his methods. Immediately after his assumption of office, the right honourable gentleman issued"" a manifesto to the people of Australia, in which he declaredWe thoroughly believe in progress, a fearless forward policy. made no That declaration appeared in the newsor papers of 22nd August last. I now wish to show the' character of this "" fearless, forward policy."" Personally I regard the Ministerial policy as - one of the most watery and colourless - that - has ever' beenpresented to any ' deliberative Assembly; in the world. For example, the right honourable gentleman accepts all the amendments which have been made in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He bids farewell to State rights, although he voted with the Deakin Administration to resist what he deemed to be an encroachment upon them. In spite of the position which he then took up, he now. says, "" We accept the Bill as it stands."" Although he came into power over a clause in that measure, and although the Deakin Ministry were defeated upon another provision in it, he says "" We accept the Bill as it stands."" Despite the injury which he declared would be done to State rights by making the measure applicable to the railway employees and public servants of the States, he is now content to accept it in its present form. That represents his "" fearless, forward policy."" Then upon the question of preferential trade and Tariff Revision, he says that the Government take up the same position as did the Watson Administration. is another evidence of his "" fearless, forward policy."" There are three Bills, however, with which he will proceed, and in regard to which he will nail his colours to the mast. In such matters he is simply reckless in his bravery. He says that he will ceed with the Papua Bill, the Trades Marks Bill, and the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill - al l non-contentious measures. But upon measures of a party character, we find how weak and colourless is the ' policy of the Government. I do not know whether honourable members have heard of the man who entered a restaurant, and after being supplied with chicken broth which he had ordered, handed it back to the waiter with a request that the chicken should be allowed to run through it again. storv reminds - me of the ""fearless, forward policy ""' which the Government have adopted. They had better let a little more courage run through it. This remark applies even to the High Commissioner Bill, which is absolutely a non-party measure. Unfortunately, the terms of the Labour-Liberal Alliance were disclosed upon the very day that the Prime Minister wast to make his statement of policy to the House. The alliance decided that the appointment of a High Commissioner should be subject to the approval of Parliament. That was sufficient to make this fearless, forward policy-monger immediately double back, and announce that in order that there should be no interference with States' rights, outrageous and scandalous.' the Government had determined to allow the High Commissioner Bill to remain over until next session. If there is one thing more than another of which the Commonwealth Parliament has absolute control, it is the appointment of a High Commissioner; but the Prime Minister has determined to allow the Bill to stand over in order that he may, during the recess, consult the Premiers of the States in regard to the matter. On the one Bill, in regard to which there was the slightest possibility of opposition being shown, the right honourable gentleman backed down. Some of the protectionist supporters of the Ministry have fought well in the past, and I appeal to them to say whether this is the sort of craven leader that the fighting men of Victoria are going to accept in order that they, may remain in office. This is one of those occasions on which angels should we'ep.",26
140,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member is himself a good mourner. That Mr CROUCH - The interjection made by the honourable member reminds me of another matter, to which no reference has been made during the debate. The Ministry is not entirely a free-trade one. We have to remember that the Prime Minister was proreturned not merely as a free-trader, but as a free-trade and sectarian member.",27
141,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member played the sectarian card fairly strongly at the last general election.,27
142,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thos e are the two planks on which the Prime Minister was * returned. He secured the votes, not merely of free-traders, but of others, because he promised Dr Dill-Mackay that he would do certain things, and accepted the platThat form of a certain organization. The free trade ticket was not solely responsible for the return of that solid phalanx of representatives from New South Wales, which we see on the Government side of the House. The cry related, not only to free-trade, but to the question whether there should be certain precedence given to ecclesiastics, and whether Roman Catholics should not be employed in the Public Service. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is all right; we do not object to that.",27
143,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Some persons may object to the introduction of this subject; but the distinct appeal which sectarian bodies made to the people of New South Wales, to almost entirely support free trade candidates at the last elections, was I am told by those who are familiar with the conditions which prevailed in New South Wales - and the matter was mentioned during the Address-in-Reply-that one of the. ablest members of the protectionist, party in the last Parliament was defeated simply because of his religion, and because he would not subscribe",27
144,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I must ask the honourable and learned member, whether he proposes to connect the matter which he is at present discussing with the motion now before the Chair? Unless he can, he certainly ought not to proceed to debate the motion on these lines.",28
145,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall certainly connect my remarks 'with the motion, Mr. Speaker. If. the Prime Minister was returned on certain grounds, and received the support of a certain following, because of promises which he made, he should be ready at once to fulfil those promises, rather than to sink them, as he has sunk everything else. If he intends to sink the particular pledges upon which, I contend, he was returned, he should inform the House of that intention. It seems to me little short of scandalous that at the last general election he largely used the influence to which I have referred. Perhaps it is not desirable to deal with this matter at greater length, but I strongly object to the combination of sectarianism and of free-trade, on which the Prime Minister was returned. It is a combination that should, at the very outset, be strongly reprobated.",28
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,In New South Wales the issue was not merely that of sectarianism and free^trade.,28
147,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I cannot forget that the Prime Minister, when leader of the Opposition, wrote a letter to an organization in New South Wales, in which he stated that throughout his public career he had always been opposed by a certain religious body, and that he would never forget >hat fact. That assertion constitutes one reason why he should not be allowed to remain in office one hour longer than we can prevent. I wish now to deal with the position of the seceding protectionists who have left this side of the House to take refuge under the wing of a free-trade Prime Minister. I regret already to observe a desire on the part of the Prime Minister to depose the honourable and learned member for Ballarat from the leadership of the protectionist wing of his supporters. to the date on which he issued his manifesto to the electors of New South Wales, the Prime Minister had always referred to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat as "" the leader of. the protectionist party "" ; but in that manifesto he shifted his ground, and endeavoured to introduce other leaders. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat had refused to join his. Ministry, or to have anything to do with him.; he had declined under any circumstances to enter the coalition as a Minister,, and as the result of this the Prime Minister, in his manifesto to the electors of New South Wales, referred to "" Mr Deakin and Sir George Turner, and their supporters."" Since then this free-trade Prime Minister has apparently taken up the position that he has a right to depose the honourable and learned member for Ballarat from the leadership of the protectionist wing of his supporters, and to appoint another leader. In accordance with this view, he now invariably refers to the Minister of Trade and Customs as "" the leader of the protectionist party on this side of the House."" I do not know what right the Prime Minister has to make a change in the leadership of his protectionist wing. If I were in the position of the honourable ancl learned member for Ballarat, I should certainly object to his efforts in that direction ; but we find that the honourable and learned member is taking them very quietly. He is, so to speak, taking them "" lying down.'' I should like to know what the Minister of Trade and Customs has to say to the statement made last night by the Prime Minister, that there is no longer anycoalition, and it would also 'be interesting to learn, the views of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.",28
148,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister said that the Deakin party had refused a coalition.,28
149,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And that there was no coalition on that side of the House. That statement, was distinctly made, by the right honourable gentleman.  a voluntary association.",28
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member should quote the next sentence.,28
151,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable member will supply me with it I shall be happy to read it. In his manifesto to the people of New South Wales, the Prime Minister Up said that the appearance in office of a caucus-tied Labour Administration, supported by a small minority in the House, raised constitutional and national questions which I think full y justified the junction which taken place between myself and my supporters, and Mr Deakin and Sir George Turner and their supporters, a junction which leaves all supporters free from any surrender of principle.' Evidently, on the 22nd August, 1904-th date of this manifesto-h e did not think it necessary to endeavour to depose the orable and learned member for Ballarat from the leadership of the protectionist wing on the Government side of the House; but, judging by his present attitude, from certain indications afforded us by the. speech made by him last night, I feel satisfied that he Will do his best to gradually draw away from the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and so to secure entirely .undivided party. If his protecister tionist supporters cannot be absorbed by free-trade wing he will endeavour to eject them. I can clearly read for them ""the handtions writing on the wall."" The Prime Minister is doing his best to induce the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to finally leave him. He certainly does not wish lose his support at this stage, but if lution occurs at an early date, the Prime Minister will take up an entirely different attitude in regard to the terms of the coalioccupy tion than that which he assumes at the sent ""time, when he absolutely relies on the support of some of the protectionist mema bers of this House.",28
152,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,As soon as he gets into recess he will sell them - in,29
153,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Prime Minister, for some weeks past, has been touring the to sell the Protectionist Party. country, and talking of the restoration responsible government; but he knows that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-and this is why he does not relish the position occupied by the honourable learned member-ha s him completely in the hollow of his hand. If the honourable and learned member chooses to say to the Prime Wales, Minister, "" Do this,"" pr ""Do that,"" he must obey or leave office, and a dissolution would then at once take place. The right honourable member is seeking to undermine the. tion of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He is never grateful for vices rendered. That is his record, certainly think' it ' will be his cord, so far as the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is concerned. That he should be grateful to a man is his best excuse for disliking him. In regard to the protectionist position, I may say that at the last election I was in favour of fiscal peace. I was returned on has the principle of fiscal peace. But then we had this condition and circumstance obtaining: that there was a protectionist Prime our Minister in power. That altered the position very materially. As long as a proe tectionist Prime Minister was in power, I do not think I should have advocated any honchange in the Tariff without going to face my electors again. I made fiscal peace so prominent in my programme that I could not honourably have changed my vote in and this House without resigning.",29
154,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why , then, does not the honourable and learned member resign?",29
155,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The position is altoan gether changed. A free-trade Prime Minis in power, who certainly was not the chosen by the electors. In fact, the electors declared against him. At the last electhe contest was not between the present Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition, and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. It was distinctly beto tween the honourable and learned member a dissofor Ballarat and the Prime Minister. So far as the electors of Australia could say that the present Prime Minister should not that office, by an overwhelming maprejority they said it. It seems to me ro be a blot upon our democratic institutions that man. whom the country so overwhelmingly condemned and rejected should have attained to the position of Prime Minister my opinion, by a long course of Juggling and trickery. In my belief the Prime Minister will take the earliest opportunity Indeed, of he has already given indications in that direction. On the last Thursday in August - I cannot give the exact date-h e spoke to a Farmers' Conference in Melbourne, and and he then made use of this statementI was Premier forfive year's in New South during which the Labour Party had me in the hollow of their hand. And what was the result? I got my free-trade policy passed by protectionist labour men. You can always come upon me with a deal of that kind. posiHere was this Prime Minister, having consummated a coalition with certain serseceding protectionists, /stating about and I a fortnight after the coalition was reformed, and after he had got certain protectionists in his Ministry, that he passed his free-trade policy in New South Wales with the assistance of protectionists, and that "" You can always come upon me with a deal of that kind."" If that is not a statement which should make those honourable members, who were previously with us in the Protectionist Party, pause in their career - if they are really protectionists-and prevent themselves being used by free-trade Prime Minister, as he used the protectionists in New South Wales, I do - not know that any more public warning could be given. - Mr EWING - It was not the Protectionist Party, but the Labour Party in New South Wales that the Prime Minister used.",29
156,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman said, "" I got my free-trade policy passed by protectionist labour men.""",30
157,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; labour men.,30
158,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If , after a warning of that sort, the protectionists who are supporting the Prime Minister can continue honestly and honourably to do so, I am very much surprised. while - ago, I asked the Prime Minister what his position would be in reference to giving a preference to local contractors. He refused to answer, but made some sort of a joke. I should like to point out to those protectionists who have seceded from the Protectionist Party, that the Prime Minister said that he would never rest until the policy of the Protectionist Party was stamped out. It was not so long ago since the Prime Minister called the protectionists cowards. During the Tariff debates, he accused the honourable member for Mernda, in this House, of discreditable actions in trade. The right honourable gentleman continually interjected remarks about starch during the speeches of the honourable member. After his references to the weight of the packages sold by the honourable member's firm, aftei his statement that the honourable member was really making-his money out-of the poverty of the people who used his starch, and after the series of accusations which the Prime Minister imade against him during the Tariff discussions, it seems to me that the honourable member for Mernda is a very funny protectionist if he is prepared to follow, as' he seems to do, the right honourable gentleman. There is one other position which the' Prime Minister takes up in his manifesto. He says that he is stronglv against Socialism. Since the issue of that manifesto, he has addressed several meetings against Socialism. thinks that Socialism is one of the worse things in the world. He defines.it as the nationalization of industries. Unfortunately, we have the honourable member f o i Wilmot stating that, although the leader of the Opposition is a Socialist, he finds that the Prime Minister is also a Socialist. Yet the Prime Minister goes up and down the country denouncing Socialism - That is the the present ground upon which he endeavours to retain his position. History does not pass away from our memories so soon. We have had only four years of Federal parliamentary life. Statements have been made in this House by the Prime Minister, which are reported in Hansard, and which show that he was formerly very anxious to get the Labour Party to vote with him. The Prime Minister was going a good way in the direction of Socialism then. On the 21st May, 1901, when this Parliament met for the first time, and we were discussing the Address-in-Reply-and he was not then indulging in any 'funnyisms, but 'seriously placing his political intentions before the A little country-h e saidWe say- "" If you will encourage new forms of industry, make Government industries of them. If you believe that you can fashion industries, try a few experiments-Governmen t experiments, and let us see how they get on. Then, if there is failure, no one else can be blamed, and the experiments can be dropped."" On the 15th October, 1901, when he knew he could not carry a vote of want of confidence without the support of the Labour Party, he said I have always been one who would like to see the iron industry firmly established, but my method of effecting this would be by giving it direct encouragement from the national exchequer. My reason for so doing would be that as if is a national industry the nation should pay the expense of encouraging it. I do not go so far as the Prime Minister as a Socialist; but I object to his going around the country speaking against Socialism when we remember that only two or three years ago he was ready enough to agree to almost any nationalizing of industries if he could only get the support of certain persons. Then what do we find this antiSocialist, to the horror of some of his supporters, and certainly «to the horror of the conservative group in the Government corner, saying in regard to the Papua Bill , in which there was. a most Socialistic experiment ",30
159,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is so. To the He surprise and horror of those I have mentioned, the present Prime Minister said that that clause was accepted by a large uajority of the House, and he did not think he ought to disturb it. There was a fearless policy ! There was anti-Socialism ! This clause was actually moved and agreed to by the present Prime Minister, and it stands today in the Papua Bill, as I hope it will stand for some time, though it gives up a principle which the right honourable gentleman outside the House is only too ready to advocate. do not wish to speak at any length on the question of preference to unionists. When that question was discussed I was, to a certain extent, "" sand-bagged,"" and could not say all I desired; but it is just as well that the people of the country should recognise where the difference is. Both sides of the House were agreed that there should be preference to unionists, and the only difference between _ honourable members on this side and the Ministerialists was that we held that the preference should be unencumbered by any proviso which would make it unworkable. The desire was to recommit the Bill , in order to pass a really workable clause; and there is not the slightest question that those who voted against the recommittal of clause 48 desired that preference should be given to unionists. That provision was in the original Bill , introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the principle is supported absolutely and completely by the present Prime Minister, and even by those five representatives of the Victorian Employers' Federation who sit in the Government corner. But it ought to be distinctly understood that the difference between the Ministry and the Opposition is not as to whether there shall be preference, but only as to whether the provision giving preference shall be workable or combined with conditions which will make it practically impossible. I have already referred to - the Deakin party, who are still following the Prime Minister. In his manifesto the right honourable gentleman stated that he would adhere to the position he assumed in the negotiations with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. But, in the first announcement he made to the House, the Prime Minister went back on that position, and said that so far as preferential trade was concerned-and this was certainly the most important plank of the Deakin party at the last election-h e was going' to take up exactly the position of the Watson Government, who, until approached by England, were not going to do anything; in the matter. What was the platform agreed to at the meeting at which the joint proposals were considered ? It was that the question of preferential trade should wait until the British Government had spoken, as is shown by the following:It is recognised that no proposals affecting trade relations within the Empire can be looked for from the mother country during the l i fe of the I present Commonwealth Parliament, but the maintenance of .1 truce for that period is not to prevent the acceptance of statutory concessions offered to us by any other part of the Empire. The Prime Minister has confined his opposition entirely to refusing to do anything in regard to preferential trade until the United Kingdom makes approaches; he neglected altogether the latter part of the paragraphbut the maintenance of a truce for that period is not to prevent the acceptance of statutory concessions offered to us by any other part of the Empire. Already the Deakin party are in process of being "" sold,"" and this they will find out, and be sorry for. They are dealing with a very astute man; and they will recognise that it is impossible to follow a free-trade Minister and expect him to endeavour to conserve a protectionist policy. The sooner they get into office a man whom they can trust as a thoroughly honest man, who regards his political engagements as binding on him, the better it will be for them; and unless they can achieve that end they had far better sit in Opposition, and endeavour to remove the present Government from office. The Ministry has been christened the ""sand-bagging"" Ministry, though I do not know that that is a good description. It might really be properly called the "" Yes - No"" Ministry, simply because on the fiscal question we have four members of the Government saying "" Yes "" and four members saying "" No . "" Or it might be called a "" black-white "" Ministry, because we have five saying "" black "" and three saying "" white.""",30

I venture to say that the honwipe orable and learned member for Corio, by the statements which he has made today, has altogether disproved his allegations made outside this Chamber. showing that there had been any ""cookgentleman, ing"" or ""doctoring"" in connection with accounts of New South Wales, the honwhether orable and learned member, out of his own mouth, has proved that everything was done with the sanction of the New South Wales Parliament, and at the behest of that Partaxation liament, and' done in a legal and orI derly way. What was the matter about which ali the controversy has arisen? It has been stated that the honourable member for Hume appointed an impartial and dishave interested Committee. The whole matter has reference to the administration of the merits."" Dibbs-Lyne Government, and to an old deright ficiency which they left, and to which the Reid Government succeeded on coming into office in New South Wales. T t relates to a deficiency which had accumulated under the previous Administration, and which amounted to ,£1,500,000. The present Prime Minister, before proceeding to deal with the deficiency in the way to which jection has been taken, actually reduced it so wipe it off his accounts altogether. from £1,500,000 to £1,100,000. I prohave pose to quote a few sentences from a speech made by the Colonial Treasurer of the day, Sir John See, bearing upon this very matBills, ter. That honourable gentleman, Budget Speech, a'dmitted that ciency had arisen under the administration of the Government of which he was a memsure? ber, and he saidSo far as can now be ascertained the deficiency is about £1,200,000, and I propose to ask ity to issue Treasury Bills to cover this deficiencyParliament The then Premier estimated that the deficiency for 1S93, and previous years, was £1,500,000 this he considered would be the amount to be dealt with. When we took office, one of the first dealing things the present Prime Minister did, was to re-arrange the whole system man. of public accounts. Instead of perpetuating the old credit system, by which accounts of years' standing were carried to succeeding years, so that no one could question. _ what was the condition of the public the right honourable gentleman introduced what is now known as the cash He altered the close of the finanyear from December, to June, and in doing that, he. said that, instead of taking over this deficiency of previous Governments into his accounts, he would do as Sir John See had proposed to do, and it off by funding it. The whole controversy that has arisen, as between the bankers and the right honourable member for East Sydney, and as between the honourable Instead of member for Hume and the right honourable is as to whether he ought to have the funded the accumulated deficiency, or he' ought to have loaded his new cash system with it. The right honourable gentleman said, "" I have quite enough to do. I amtaking ,£800,000 a year in off the people of this country, and cannot afford to take over this old lia1 bility into my new accounts."" Furthermore, he said, "" I do not think it would be fair to the new system if I were to do so. We a new cash system. Let us have a fair start, so that the system may stand on its With that object in view, the honourable gentleman funded the accumulated deficiency. The whole controversy which was waged, and which has been waged ever since, and all these charges of ""doctoring"" and ""cooking"" accounts, have arisen, because the right honourable member for East Sydney came in a straightforward way to the Parliament, and asked it to give obhim authoritv to fund the deficiency, and I here the New South Wales Act authorizing the whole transaction.

169,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Committee found against the right honourable member for East Sydney.,33
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Of course they found against the right honourable gentleman. They simply said that he should have brought over the old deficiency into his accounts.,33
171,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,They said much more than that.,33
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"This is what they said, and * it is the whole point of the controversy between the bankers and the present Prime Minister. That right honourable gentleman said, "" I do not think that it is fair to load the new cash system with this old deficiency, for which I am not responsible, but which Sir William Lyne and Sir George Dibbs have accumulated. In starting a new system I desire to begin with a clean sheet."" The bankers said that this old deficiency should still have been carried forward, and should have been liquidated from succeeding revenues. That was the whole question in dispute.",33
173,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,You cannot say that you begin with a clean sheet by merely wiping off your books a debt which has not been paid.,33

175,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,To pass it on to posterity.,33
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Precisely . That is what was done, and that is precisely what other Governments had done before. I am not justifying it, but pointing out that the criticism is not a criticism of the right honourable member for East Sydney, but in effect of the Parliament that sanctioned what he proposed.",33
177,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who took the lead in the matter ?,33
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have already told the honourable member that the right honourable member for East Sydney took the lead, but he was simply carrying out the intention of the previous Government, as I have already shown by the quotation I have made from the New South Wales Hansard.",33
179,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Si r William Lyne first suggested it.,33
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"There never was any question about the legality of the transaction. The New South Wales Parliament gave its consent to the whole proceedings, and, therefore, what the honourable and learned member for, Corio has quoted is not a condemnation of the right honourable member for East Sydney, but of the whole Parliament of New South Wales. Honourable members have only to look up the New South Wales Hansard of the time to learn how the Parliament of New South Wales regarded that criticism. Although the report was tabled with a flourish of trumpets by Sir William Lyne, no report was ever more flat and stale, - or fell more unprofitably on the table of any Parliament House than did that report, notwithstanding all the trouble which had been taken to produce it. Now, as to the genesis of the Committee: We have heard much about its being a disinterested Committee. Do honourable members know the genesis of the whole matter ? When the present honourable member for Hume was in Opposition he was attacking the Reid Government, week in and week out, upon these financial matters. He was being fed up at the time by a public servant, who afterwards became an adverse witness before, the expert Committee appointed, and also became its secretary. The very man who had engineered the whole thing was made secretary to the Committee. This was the same Mr Martin whom the honourable member for Hume wished to foist upon the Federal service, and the honourable gentleman would have been successful in doing so, only that his then colleagues declined to make the appointment he wished to have made. Of course the honourable gentleman wished to reward Mr Martin for his political - services. This was the man who engineered the whole thing, and he became secretary to the Committee, and gave adverse evidence when the Committee was considering the matter. Now, as to the composition of the Committee itself: Mr Yarwood was one of the gentlemen selected by the honourable member for Hume. Only just previously Mr Yarwood had run in a constituency as a supporter of that honourable gentleman, and as a straight-out opponent of the present Prime Minister and his land and income taxation. It is amusing to me to bear members of the Labour Party cheering references to Mr Yarwood, whose chief object was to discredit the only man who had been game to stand up and fight the big property-owners of New South Wales.",33
181,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who is the right honourable gentleman fighting now?,34
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am fighting for fair play just now, and I am putting this matter in its proper light. I challenge honourable members to contradict what I am saying. I have nothing to say against the two bankers who were members of the Committee. There is no doubt that they were smarting at the time for the very same reason. Thetv did not like the income tax, and they did not like the land tax. They were probably at the time the bitter political enemies of the right honourable gentleman, and he was warned by some of his supporters that it was not wise to appoint such gentlemen, one of whom it has since been proved had expressed opinions adverse to his system of finance. It is well known, for instance, that, long before his appointment to the Committee, Mr Dibbs had told the present Minister of Home Affairs, in no unmistakable terms, his opinion of the finance of the right honourable gentleman, and we know that when he enterd upon the inquiry, he was as much biased as a man could be against both the right honourable gentleman and his system of accounts. When the honourable and learned member for Corio says that these gentlemen were appointed by the Prime Minister",34
183,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He said "" nominated.""",34
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think that the right honourable gentleman simply agreed to them over the table of the House. Every one who knows him must be aware that he is not the most suspicious man in the community; that he is always disposed to put the best construction upon the actions of those with whom he comes into contact.,34
185,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is well to hear that.,34
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable and learned member does not know that that is a fact, he does not know the Prime Minister very well. I doubt if there was another man in the Ministry who would have consented to the appointment of those two bankers, in view of all thei political cumstances. It only came out afterwards that Mr Dibbs, who has written to the honourable and learned member for Corio in such an impartial strain, had said beforehand, that he was opposed to the right honourable gentleman's system of accounts. Let honourable members read that letter, and see if it is the letter impartial man. It is rather the letter of an opponent, and of a bitter one at that. When these facts came out in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the right honourable gentleman determined that he would be judged fairly, and another board was appointed, to which the honourable and learned member for Corio made, no reference. Although he has boasted so much of his fairness, he was careful to quote only from the report which suited him,' and to ignore another report which exonerates the Prime Minister.",34
187,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,I ask the honourable member to believe that I did not know of the second report.,34
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a fair answer to make. The Prime Minister determined that the second board should be one in regard to whose composition there could be no cavilling; and he therefore asked the president of the Institute of Accountants to name an accountant, and the acting president of the Incorporated Accountants of Australia to name a second accountant; and he then asked these two accountants to name a third. No more honourable .course tban that could have been taken. Mr J. E. Bowes was named by the president of the Institute of Accountants, and Mr Thomas Davis by the acting president of the Incorporated Accountants of Australia; while Messrs. Bowes and Davis named Mr Richard Teece, the general manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society. The directors of that society, however, withdrew Mr Teece from the inquiry after he had begun his work, thinking, I suppose, that the manager of a public company like theirs should not be concerned in the squabble. Messrs. Bowes and Davis then selected Mr Vane, of the firm of Miles' and Vane. All three gentlemen stand at the head of their profes sion. The Prime Minister did not appear before them, but he gave them the free run of the accounts of the Treasury and of the Auditor-General, and put the various Treasurers' Statements before them. In their report they admit that on the first six months' cirfinancing there was a deficiency of £151,000, but taking the four years' revenue and expenditure, including all extraneous items, they report that the surplus was £261,000. The Prime Minister had stated that he had a surplus of £147,000 on the four years' working; but the accountants make up the difference in this way. During the period of an under review, he had advanced £188,000, repayments of which were made during the term of office of his successor. A fair review of. the financing for the whole four years, however, showed him to have .a surplus of £261,000. Honourable ' members will recollect, in addition, that during those four years his Government had remitted to the people of New South Wales £3,000,000 worth of taxation. The honourable ' and learned member for Corio has.also spoken of the loan expenditure during the right honourable gentleman's term of office; but all these matters were brought under the cognizance of the people of the State, and the strongest argument that could be used to defend our system of finance from the public platformswas to show the difference between the financing of the right honourable gentleman and that of the honourable member for Hume, and of Sir John See. It was sufficient to read the bare figures, to convince the people of that State that the Reid Government carefully husbanded their resources, while succeeding Governments recklessly squandered the public money in the most extravagant way.",34
189,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Corio has similar material to fire off against the honourable member for Hume. He loaded' both his barrels. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I hope that on the next occasion when the honourable and learned member makes an attack of this kind, he' will first read all the information on the subject available to him, and not content himself with a jaundiced and prejudiced report to prove that the accounts of New South Wales were ""cooked"" and ""doctored"" by the Prime Minister. The honourable and learned member himself ""cooked"" and ""doctored"" the report of the Committee by the way in which he quoted it . The whole question at issue was whether the Prime Minister should carry , on the deficiency of his predecessors, to be liquidated out of future revenue, or do as the honourable member for Hume and Sir John - See proposed to do, fund it, and make a fresh start with a new system.",35
190,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was a very ready way of getting rid of. the difficulty.',35
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not say that it was the' right way, but to begin with, the Prime Minister was carrying out the intention of his predecessors, and there is a great deal to be said for his determination when creating an entirely new cash system, to give it a fair start,'instead of loading it with previous deficiencies. Although he funded those, deficiencies, he - instituted a. sinking' fund, and during the four years, paid off over £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The honourable member might have quoted that fact, but he conveniently forgot it. The first thing that the next Administration did was to suspend payments into the sinking fund , and none have been made since. That was done by the men who instituted the inquiry.",35
192,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Reid Administration starved the roads of the country, and their successors had to make up the leeway.",35
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The answer to that statement is that there is less money being spent upon the roads of New South Wales today than when we left office.,35
194,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is no reply; two wrongs do not make a right.,35
195,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,More New South Wales politics.,35
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,This time the subject was introduced by a Victorian representative.,35
197,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Cheere d on by the honourable and learned memb.r for Northern Melbourne.,35
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Any one taking an impartial view of matters as they affect this Parliament must, I am sure, be very much disappointed - I make no secret of my disappointment-wit h the position of Federal affairs. We have had three crises during this year. Three times we have had a political stocktaking, and here we are at it again. ",35
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then all I can say is that we had better surrender the political estate to the liquidator outside as quickly as possible. The course now being pursued is paralyzing the whole industrial and political life of Australia, and is certainly doing us no good in the eyes of people abroad.",35
200,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The old ""gag.""  and the other members of his party helped to put out two Governments.",35
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the honourable member help to put out any Government ? ,35
202,Mr JOSEPPI COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member was as eager as any one, to put out the Deakin Government.  the Government, but I was anxious to secure the insertion of a certain provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.",35
203,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,So were we.,35
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The present position seems to be a curious commentary on the popular idea that all our political troubles would be ended if we only adopted a system by which Ministers would be personally responsible to the House. All I have to say is that the present position of affairs represents upon a miniature scale the conditions which would obtain under that system. The House is full of parties-ful l of coalitions, and that is precisely what would happen under a system of non-party government. We have too many parties now, and they are too inextricably mixed up to do anything of a permanent character so far as this Parliament is concerned. Honourable members opposite have referred to the coalition on the Government side as an unholy combination which embraces men of widely divergent opinions, and I wish to place .my position very clearly before the House. I hope that honourable members will believe me when I say that I do not care very much for the present coalition. I hope that is plain. same time. I like it a little better than the arrangement which has been entered into by honourable members opposite.",36
205,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is quite natural.,36
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"J t may be, but I shall give my reasons for taking that .view. One of my objections to the coalition is that it is only half a coalition.",36
207,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,My objection is that there is not enough of it.,36
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The - honourable member has hit it off exactly. The coalition does not embrace a sufficient number of honourable members. It is not the combination that we expected. As a matter of fact, the Protectionist Party has been split in two and the wriggling that has been going on between the two rent parts has been very amusing. What we anticipated was that it would be a genuine coalition, and that, as the whole of the free traders joined it, the whole of the protectionists would come in on the basis of that fiscal peace which I believe was promised by every protectionist on the platform at the last election.",36
209,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The protectionists would not agree to that.,36
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In my opinion the arrangements made by the Prime Minister might have been of a different character. For instance, although he has only a few protectionists among his supporters, he has taken five fiscal-sinkers into his Cabinet.",36
211,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is a good name.,36
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the Cabinet there are only three fiscal militants as against five Ministers who believe in sinking the fiscal issue. Again, if I had been in the position of the Prime Minister, as a free trader, I should not have handed the Customs Department over to the control of a protectionist. I say that candidly and frankly.",36
213,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,This is interesting.,36
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think that the Minister of Home Affairs might very well have been placed in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs.,36
215,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,What difference would that have made?,36
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think it would make a great deal of difference.,36
217,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Would a free-trader favour the importers ? Mr. JOSEPH iCOOK - Not at all. The difference is this: A protectionist would have a bias towards his own fiscal system, and a free-trader would have a bias towards At the his side of the question-cal l it an unconscious bias if you like. Take a case in point. A few days ago the Minister of Trade and Customs received a deputation with regard to the duty charged upon chocolates. He told the deputation that wherever there was a duty on the border-line he would give them the advantage of the higher duty. I suppose that the honourable gentleman did what he honestly believed to be right, and I do not quarrel with him upon that ground. I fancy, however, that if the Minister had been a free-trader he would not have stretched matters in that direction. I wish to say, further, that I do not agree, with the granting of preference to local tenderers. I thought that the question of preference had been crystallized in the Customs Tariff Act. The whole question was debated for two years, and whatever preference was to be given should have been embodied in the statute in the shape of Customs duty. I earnestly hope that this question will be decided upon lines exactly opposite to those which are being adopted by some ""Ministers at present.",36
218,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,They have not the pluck to do that.,36
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,No preference should be given beyond that provided for in the statute.,36
220,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is so provided for.,36
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Recen t decisions show the contrary. Ever since the Tariff has been in operation it appears to have been the rule in the Post and Telegraph Department to give local tenderers the benefit of a duty of 30 per cent, upon goods which the statute says shall carry only 15 per cent In my view a 15 per cent preference, added to a 15 per cent, duty, is equivalent to a 30 per cent. duty. . Mr Mauger - No . A 15 per cent,preference is equivalent to a duty of 15 per cent.",36
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A 15 per cent, preference, plus a duty of 15 per cent., amounts to 30 per cent. I have a very decided objection to any Ministry increasing the Customs Tariff of the country bymere administrative acts.",37
223,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is not the preference equivalent to a duty of 15 per cent. ?,37
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not understand the honourable member. But whilst I make these criticisms of the position of honourable members upon the Ministerial side of the Chamber, I certainly do not see any justification for the statements which have been made by honourable members opposite. When I view the ragged protectionist regiment which occupies the Opposition corner benches, and which has allied itself with the Labour Party and pledged itself to the programme which has been outlined, I am quite content to remain where I am. Only the other evening the honourable and learned member for Indi referred to Ministerial supporters as "" a sexless combination.""' That was his way of rounding off a peroration. He expressed the hope that an end would soon be put to this "" sexless combination."" I suppose that when he employed the word "" sexless"" he referred to the fiscal complexion of honourable members upon this side of the House. I think that I do him no injustice in assuming that. I say that if he wants to view a "" sexless combination,"" he had better look at home, and look as hard as he can in that direction. If he desires to gaze upon people who are fiscally .sexless, he had better turn to his own side of the Chamber. Take the honourable member for Darling as an example. He has occupied a seat in this House for four years, and was a member of the New South Wales Parliament for many years previously, but I defy anybody to say whether he is a protectionist or a free-trader.",37
225,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is here all right.,37
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is absolutely sexless so far as the fiscal question is concerned.,37
227,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Wai t until it comes up.,37
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When it was under discussion, the honourable member was most irritatingly impartial in his votes. He was a protectionist today 'and a free-trader tomorrow throughout the whole of the debates. I repeat that before levelling such a taunt the honourable and learned member for Indi had better look at home. I do not - make these statements in derogation of honourable members opposite, because they have never made a fetish of the fiscal question. They say that they were returned as labour members, which is a straightforward declaration. At the same time, they must admit that, according to the dictum of the honourable and learned member for Indi, they are fiscally sexless, and if he wishes to find a party which has no virility and no distinctive traits on this question, he had better look at the other side of the House. The honourable member for Wide Bay said last evening that nobody had ever known him to proclaim himself a free-trader. Yet this is the combination with which this great fiscal apostle is anxious to ally himself, in the hope of securing more protection. ' Mr Mauger - We are protectionists upon this side of the House by two to one, and the position is just the reverse upon the other side.'",37
229,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the alliance intend to raise the fiscal question ?,37
230,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,As soon as ever we can.,37
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I hope that the honourable member is speaking for the combination.,37
232,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We intend to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the operation of the Tariff, as soon as possible.",37
233,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is speaking for Himself.,37
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I thought he was. The other evening he said that the alliance had been formed upon a sound protectionist basis. I should like to hear the honourable member for Maranoa and others upon that point. I venture to say that they would sound a very different note indeed. What is the criticism which has been levelled against the Government by the leader of the Opposition? In the first place he referred to the postponement of the High Commissioner Bill. He said that that measure was desperately urgent, and that the sooner a High Commissioner was appointed the better it would be for Australia. I interjected that I did not believe that anything was spoiling in that regard. What 1 meant to convey was that action could be deferred whilst an. effort was being made to see that the people of Australia . are not charged anything additional for the conduct of their affairs in London. I hold that opinion very strongly, and I will not vote for the appointment of a High Commissioner unless I can see some chance of saving the States the expenditure which would be involved. "" But what,"" I ask, "" is the policy of the combination upon this point?"" They have a most definite declaration upon it. From it I learn that "" the selection of the High Commissioner is to be subject to the prior consent of Parliament, the economizing of existing State agencies, and the full utilization of the Federal staff for the benefit of the States."" How can these points be considered unless by. conference with the States ?",37
235,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear !",38
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then why do honourable members opposite object so fiercely to the proposal of the Government, which would give effect to the very letter of that arrangement?",38
237,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Government propose to leave the decision of the matter entirely to the States.,38
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They propose no such thing. The Prime Minister distinctly stated that he would postpone the introduction of the Bill until he had consulted the States, with a view to ascefrtaining if a reduction could not be effected in their staffs.",38
239,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Suppos e they do not consent.,38
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Suppos e that they do.,38
241,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps ""yes,"" perhaps ""no.""",38
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the States act senselessly they will not consent, but if - as I . believethey will-the y act with an ordinary amount of prudence, .they will give their most cordial consent to any proposal of the kind. . Mr BATCHELOR - What is the policy of the Ministerial combination, if they do not consent ?",38
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have already told the honourable member my policy in regard' to the matter. I am not prepared to increase the expenses of the people of Australia in London at the present time. I now turn to another item in the programme of"" the Opposition alliance, from which I learn that preferential trade is to be discussed by the joint parties at an early date. That is a very safe declaration. There ought to be no trouble in regard to that matter. Personally, I am quite prepaied to join the alliance to discuss it. If they will inform me when it is to be considered, I shall be happy to take a hand with them. There is another matter, which goes to the very crux of the political combination opposite. The honourable and learned member for Indi is tirelessly proclaiming that his only object in seeking an alliance is to depose the Prime Minister, with a .view to securing more protection for the industries of Australia.",38
244,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,A very laudable object.,38
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Le t us see what definite provision is made for it. Legislation (including Tariff legislation) shown to be necessary -. (1) To develop Australian resources; (2) to preserve, encourage, and benefit Australian industries, primary and secondaryThat is a grand object with which everyone is in agreement(3) To secure fair conditions of labour for all engaged in every form of industrial enterprise, and to advance their interests and well-being without distinction of class or social statusThat sounds very democratic, but it is also very indefinite. I do not know of any honourable member who is not prepared to subscribe to the item in the programme that I have just read, but the point is that the members of the alliance are not bound to anything. It is provided that when they are called upon to discuss that which will best advance the interests of the people, any member of the combination mayAgree with the members of his own party to be bound by their joint determination, or (*) Decide how far the particular circumstances prove necessity, or the extent to which the proposal should be carried.",38
246,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"""Yes-no. "" Mr. JOSEPH iCOOK - That is to say, taking up the parable of honourable members opposite, that the honourable member for - Flinders, to whom they are constantly alluding, I do not know with what justification, as the personification of conservatism",38
247,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member does not know him.,38
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Unde r the terms of the alliance the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Kooyong would be at liberty to freely express their own individual views, and to vote according to those views and yet be members of the combination.",38
249,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,We are the party of freedom ,38
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is quite right. As a member of party lie is bound only in regard to one object. That object was made unmistakto ably clear last night by the honourable learned member for West Sydney, when he said, ""We are combined together for purpose of removing the right honourable gentleman.""",39
251,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,A very laudable object.,39
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Opposition are solid on that question.,39

259,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,If it be a Ministerial claration.,39
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If that be so, it seems that the members of the party have come down to the ruck of very ordithey nary politicians, and have lost those high political ideals with, which they set out.",39

263,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They have, and they have also taken up the provisions in regard to the railway servants and public servants of the States.",39
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall have Sydney something to say later on in regard to that sury benches. matter. I was glad to hear the admission made last night by the leader of the Opposhould sition that, save in regard to the difference the matter. 8D between two amendments, the Conciliation the and Arbitration Bill was his own measure in every particular. That clears our course a considerable extent. Another matter and to which the Opposition take exception is the attitude of the Government on the questhe tion of old-age pensions. It may happen that when all the preliminary work has been done in connection with a reform of this kind, those who did it will be put out, and some one - who never lifted a finger to assist the movement will be pitchforked obinto office and given all the credit attaching to the achievement of that reform. That create has happened, and may occur again.

Should it ever emerge from the vaults, after investigation by the Royal Commission, members of the alliance will be perfectly free to split into a thousand fragments in dealing with it. To put such a programme seriously the intelligent electors of Australia is, to my mind, to perpetrate a fraud upon them. It is a sham- a part which, at all events, a great many honourable members of the Opposition were not expected to play.",39

The honourable and learned member has gone out of his way on two occasions to make a bitter personal attack upon myself, and I wish it to be understood that, what I aim about to say to-night will be said in self-defence. The honourable and learned member's vituperative speech has been scattered over the whole of the electorate which I represent, and I desire to send a little statement after it. I have never done anything to provoke the honourable and learned member. So far as I am aware, I have never crossed swords with him; but he took care, two or three weeks ago, to make some bitter personal accusations against me, and repeated some imore last night.

281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I say that he said some things last night that were equally bad. These will do for my purpose today. As to my being a creature of the press, I wish to say that honourable members in Melbourne know what a pet I am of the press of this city. I have had the good fortune over here to be broadly and squarely opposed by one newspaper, the Age; while the other newspaper, the Argus, is not for me at all. That is my position here; and I am bound to say this also-that much as the Age opposes me, it, on the whole, has treated me better than the Argus. Honourable members will judge from that how much of a pet I am of the press here. As to my own State, I merely wish to sayand his that there is no honourable member in the and Federal Parliament, nor a politician out of it, who has been treated with so much con-' si deration and kindness by the press of Sydney, as the honourable and learned memcolber for West Sydney has been.

286,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I dare sav the honourable and learned member for West Sydney has never done it either.,40
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is well known that he has done it. I want to say some,40
288,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Did he not go into the say office of the Sydney Morning Herald also? Mr JOSE PH COOK - He tried to get the Herald to put him in the free-trade bunch, and when he found that he could not do it he'went and got the support of the man whom he has so bitterly denounced, and asked the right honourable gentleman to help him.",40
289,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,And he rang me up on the telephone'to tell me that they had not put him in the bunch.,41
290,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Has not the Prime Minister any more private conversations to record ?,41
291,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A f t e r last night, that is a fair thing,",41
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I want to say, Mr Speaker, referring to the gibes of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney about a "" ticket,"" that, however much I have been on the ticket of the Free-trade Party, the Free-trade Party have never paid any of my election expenses. He cannot say that.",41
293,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"My "" c r o w d "" pay all mine, and those of nearly every other labour man in Queensland.",41
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Did the honourable member ever get any one else to subscribe, apart from the labour people?",41
295,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,41
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is the gravamen of my remarks. "" ticket "" : I do not know which - ticket the honourable and learned member for West Sydney referred to, but the honourable and learned member for Corio denounces the Prime Minister as being a sectarian Prime Minister. That is a nice thing for an honourable member to hurl across the Chamber.",41
297,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does not the member think it is true,41
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Do I think it is true ? I arn going to say this: that I know honourable members opposite who are just as anxious to get on the ticket referred to as any man can be. The honourable member who fulminated in that way last night was equally anxious to get on, and asked to be put in the Protestant bunch.",41
299,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What kind of politics is this, anyway ? .",41
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I had that statement on the authority of a man whom I implicitly believe.,41
301,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is more likely that the honourable member wrote to tham, and asked them to leave the honourable and learned member for West Sydney out of their bunch. 8 D2",41
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What ? He wrote and begged of them to put him in it.,41
303,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Wrote ?,41
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I ought not to say "" wrote "" ; I understand he went. That is a statement made by a man whom I would as readily believe as I would believe any statement of the honourable member.",41
305,Mr CARPENTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member will not tell who he is.,41
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Le t things develop a little further, and we will tell the honourable member who he is.  Mr JOSE PH COOK - No ; not D ill Mackay. The honourable member was wrong that time. But the information is absolutely authentic; honourable members may take that from ine.  has no right to make a statement of that kind unless he is prepared to give the proof of it to the House.",41
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I admit that I have not. No one in this Plouse has a monopoly of that kind of conduct but the honourable member who spoke last night. In the course of his speech he hardly said a single thing that was accurate.  About this about the sectarian business t,41
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He jibed at me about a "" ticket."" That is quite enough for my purpose, and I have given my answer to it. He is the n v n wl 0 goes after "" tickets."" No man goes after them with the same vigour and fervency as he does.",41
309,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,This is a scurvy kind honourable of attack.,41
310,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,What about the six potters' statement last night?,41
311,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was a denunciation of Government policy.,41
312,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was a dishonourable statement.,41
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for WestSydney stated that but for this kind of thing I should never be returned to Parliament. I have only to say that my political life will stand investigation alongside his, or that of any other man on the Opposition side of the House. There are honourable members on this side of the House who know that I did not desire to enter political life at all. I only reluctantly entered it at the last moment. I"" did not even wish to enter the Federal Parliament. I hope I am not egotistical in saying that I sacrificed a great - deal in entering it, and would not have come - except for the very earnest solicitations of ihe Prime Minister.",41
314,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,And probably the honourable member would have been in the New South Wales Ministry today if he had not come here.,42
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for West Sydney went on to say that he wanted to know how it was possible for a man like the honourable member for Parramatta to be in the embraces of the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Flinders? All I have to say, in reply to that, is that however much honourable members on this side may differ in political opinion-and I admit that there is a difference; a very decided difference, in political opinions, as between some of my honourable friends and myself- I can take their word where I should decline to take the word of the traducer of last night. At any rate, if they made a statement to me, I should be sure it was a fact. I could not say the same of the honourable and learned member. And the honourable and learned member said that I left the Labour Party for fiscal reasons, whereas he knew, or ought to have known, better than that when he spoke. He knew that there was not a tittle of truth in the whole statement, or he ought to have known, for he was one who was most persistent on the deputation which tried to induce our party to sign the pledge. I shall tell honourable members why I left the Labour Party. I never did leave the Labour Party inside the House; my fault in the eyes of - honourable members opposite was that I stuck to the party inside the House. But the party outside the House bundled the whole party over.",42
316,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,And we regret that the honourable member left the partu.,42
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I never left the party in the House, and the only complaint was that I would not leave them and go with another party outside. And why would I not go with the party outside? It was because of a pledge which, in my opinion - anc l which honourable members themselves have admitted since-wa s not a fair and proper pledge to ask a man to sign. Hdinorable members who are strongest now in the present Labour Paity were most bitter and unrelenting in opposition to the pledge we were asked to sign. I objected to the pledge because I wanted some consideration given to my constituents as well as to myself. I did not believe in going into a caucus and being bound up by that caucus to action which might be in diametric opposition to the wishes and opinions of my constituents. ""Oh, but,"" said the leader of the Opposition, "" all we ask the honourable member to do in that case is to resign his seat and go to his constituents again."" But does it end there? If it did end there the transaction would be very simple. But if a man dares to differ in opinion from those honourable members, they pursue him relentlessly ever afterwards. They do not allow for differences ot opinion; they call a man who dares to differ from them in opinion-as I have been called in this Chamber- a "" renegade,"" a ""rat,"" and all that kind of thing. That is the freedom these honourable members allow a man to think for himself.",42
318,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not peculiar to anv partu.,42
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And yet the honourable and learned member says that it is a simple matter of leaving the party and going to one's constituents. If that ended the matter there would not be much objection. But it becomes not a matter of opinion, but a matter of which we have had only too much evidence in this debate from the lips of the ex-Minister of External Affairs - a matter of deep and abiding, bitter, personal rancour. What we wanted to do when the crisis took place was to make our platform broader instead of narrower. We wanted to merge the party into a democratic party-to get into our ranks many men in the House who wanted to join with us. But the Labour Party outside, while we inside wanted to make the platform a little broader-jus t as the Labour Party in this House are doing now, in some respectsinsisted on its being made ten times narrower, and so the difference of opinion took place. It was not a matte'r of the fiscal question at all, and the honourable member knew that when he said so.",42
320,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the honourable member referring to 1.894?,42
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes. The members of the deputation who had charge of the negotiations with the party outside included the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, the honourable member for Bland, and though I do not know that there were any more members of this House, there were five or six other Labour members. The favourite doctrine of the leader of the Opposition at that time, when he came to discuss the matter inside, was that we should vote together on every occasion, if possible-that the exception should ' be when we did not vote together-so as to preserve an attitude of solidarity and soldier-like precision. Of course, he and his supporters have got away from that position long ago, and are themselves forming an alliance of their own; and I shall be very much surprised if that alliance is not repudiated by those outside. Now as to the attack on myself and others in connection with the preference question. Some of the organizations in Sydney have trade records or newspapers which are run by the organizations, at the head of which, acting as secretaries, are the labour members in this House.. Week by week those honourable members are "" pilling"" us secretly, and we do not see what is said unless we happen to get hold of one of those trade newspapers. Now I want to send out something after the poison which the honourable and learned member has already sent out about this matter of preference. again, that we on this side have every reason to be obliged to the leader of the Opposition for his frank statement yesterday, that the only difference between the position of the Government and his own is the difference between the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella and the amendment which the Labour Party themselves submitted. The honourable and learned member for Corinella proposed that the matter should be decided by a mere majority, while the Opposition amendment was that there should be a substantial representation of those affected before preference should be given. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella was as follows :That the following words be added :- "" And provided further that no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants."" And the amendment, of which notice was given by the present leader of the Opposition, was as follows: Omit the whole proviso, insert"" The Court, before directing that preference shall be given to the members of an organization, shall be satisfied that the organization substantially represents the industry affected in point of the numbers and competence of its members."" The leader of the Opposition admits, in most unmistakable terms, that no Judge would read his amendment as meaning any other than a majority requirement. Here is what the honourable member said, and I wish to have it recorded in HansardThe practice in nearly every case, in all the Arbitration Courts, has been to grant a preference only when the majority, reasonably ascertained, is in favour of such preference.",42
322,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The impossible was achieved then.,43
323,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,It means the majority of those working.,43
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Darling is wrong. The quotation proceedsI am not so foolish as to anticipate that the practice laid down by the Arbitration Courts of New Zealand and New South Wales will be departed from by the Judge appointed to the Federal tribunal. Any one who imagines that the Judge in the Federal Court would lay down a new line of procedure-that he would grant preferences to unions which manifestly represented only a minority of those employed in the industry or the district in respect of which the preference was asked-canno t have paid any attention to the general procedure under legislation of this kind. I say, Mr TUDOR - The honourable member is afraid of that, and so he wants to ""gag"" the Judge. Mr..JOSEPH COOK - I am not at all afraid.",43
325,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member for Corinella was.,43
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What I have said proves up to the hilt the soundness of my position. I shall have the greatest pleasure in quoting the leader of the Opposition in the interpretation of our position. He saidThe Government do not desire that preferences shall be granted to minorities. Nothing could be clearer or more emphatic than that. The Hansard report goes on,43
327,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The amendment contains the words "" substantially in numbers."" Mr WATSON In numbers and competency - no t numbers or competency. Both requirements are insisted on. The Court, if it followed the precedents which have been created in New South Wales and New Zealand, would be bound to interpret the words as implying a majority. In New Zealand it has been insisted that a majority, so far as that can be reasonably ascertained, shall be shown to be in favour of the granting of a preference before it can be given.",43
328,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is exactly what my amendment means.,43
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Pu t the two amendments side by side before any impartial man. For the leader of the Opposition to say that the difference between the amendments makes the Bill - worthless to unionists is distinctly wrong; and the honourable member ought to know, if he'does not, that what he says is so much dust thrown in the eyes of the unionists of the country-that it is not a fair statement of the position.",43
330,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The unionists take a different view.,44
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I dare say they do, and the reason is, that they have only, had the honourable member's version.",44
332,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , they have not.",44
333,Mr TOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,They have had the version which the honourable member and other labour members have so industriously driven into them. They have not heard the other version of the matter yet. I shall take care that the opposite view is given to them also.,44
334,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,If they are similar why should the honourable member object to the first amendment ?,44
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The first amendment was that moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella.,44
336,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,And approved of by a majority of the Committee.,44
337,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was not the first but the last amendment.,44
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now I come to the statement of the leader of the Opposition last night in justifying the Socialism the Labour Party. My position in public life on this matter has always been In common with honourable members who differ from me on this economic question, I have been striving, as I believed, and believe, honestly to try to do something which shall be for the uplifting and elevation the working classes. I have, therefore, never taken public exception to nomic theories, but I wish to say now that the more I look into this question of Socialtry ism the more I am convinced that it could not be for the benefit of the workers in particular, and that it could not be for the benefit of the community as a whole.",44
339,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the honourable member do that? speaking of Socialism as a political science or as an abstract matter?,44
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am speaking of it as a political science-as a political system.,44
341,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Can the honourable memsheer ber give us some definition of it?,44
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I propose to do so if honourable members will wait. Unfortunately I cannot give honourable memfor bers any Australian definition of Socialism, because we cannot get honourable members to bind themselves down to any accepted definition.",44
343,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They are "" Everything by turns, and nothing long.""",44
344,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is the honourable member's leader's definition of it ?,44
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The . honourable member for Kennedy is the only man 1 know of in the Labour Party who says, "" We are Socialists, and we are going for Socialism all the time.""",44
346,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We respect the honourable member for it, too.",44
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The leader of the Opposition confines himself to finesse upon this basic fact of the whole situation. This is what the honourable gentleman said last night. Referring to farmers and their requirements, he said that they asked for reduced grain freights. I should like to know if asking for a reduction of freights is Socialism. Farmers ask for a reduction of freights all over the world. They are asking for that every week in the Old Country, where the railways are not owned by the States.",44
348,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Throug h Parliament?  have to meet the deficiencv, it is Socialism. Mr. JOSEPH COOK'- I have yet to of learn that this can be accounted Socialism.",44
349,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,It depends on one's the same - stand-point entirely.,44
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I admit that.,44
351,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I thought that the honor-' still - able member was himself a Socialist.,44
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am very sorry of that the honourable member should think so.,44
353,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I still think that the honortheir ecoable member is a Socialist.,44
354,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Le t the honourable member to induce the honourable member for Parramatta to share his money with him.,44
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the honourable gentleman says that the farmers ask for wire netting to enclose their holdings in order to keep out vermin. Why do they If the States cleared their own lands of vermin the farmers Would never have to ask for hvire netting from the States. It is because the farmers are afflicted with vermin, bred on the uncultivated lands owned by the States, that in self-defence they ask the States to repair the damage due to their neglect.",44
356,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The v only ask for loans.,44
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If they asked this assistance altogether as a gift it could not by any possibility be construed to be Socialism. The leader of the Opposition further said that farmers ask for cold storage, starving stock rates, and agricultural colleges, and he claims that all this is Socialism.",44
358,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What else is it? It is done by the communitv. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall tell the honourable member what it is if he will but wait a moment. . The leader of the Opposition also said that the farmers ask the State for a grant for shows, and that that is Socialism. I may tell the honourable gentleman what he does not tell the farmers of Victoria, and I hope I shall make veryclear the position of those who profess to be Socialists. The leader of the Opposition, if he were honest with the farmers of Victoria and elsewhere would say, "" We agree to give you these concessions; we believe in them. But remember that, while we are giving you wire netting _ to keep vermin off your land, it is only as a temporary expedient. What we aim at in the parliamentary arena is to try to acquire the lands to be owned by the State.""",45
359,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does not the single-taxer desire that?,45
360,Mr TOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am putting the position fairly, I hope. The leader of the Opposition should also say to the farmers of Victoria and elsewhere, "" While we will help you to export your, produce, at the same' time we are inaugurating a system and steadily pursuing it, as circumstances permit, which will acquire from you the ownership of your cows, and put them into the hands of the State."" think, is a fair statement of the Socialists' position.",45
361,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Mak e the farmers milkers at so much a day.,45
362,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Surely a cow is one of the "" means of production.""",45
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do honourable members opposite deny that that is the Socialists' position? I do not know that I could put it any more fairly than that.,45
364,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,""" All ' duction, distribution, and exchange of wealth"" will express it. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Her e is the exposition of Socialism given in the German E r f u r t Programme, given also in the Fabian Essays, and also by Mr Webb.",45
365,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member has gone outside Tom Mann now.,45
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know - whether these authorities will be considered good enough, but I confess that I cannot find any more representative authorities on this question.",45
367,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member's leader says that he is a Socialist. Mr JOSE PH COOK - What has that to do with the point I am putting? I am not even saying that Socialism is wrong.,45
368,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman will define it for the honourable member. Is it "" Yes "" or "" No "" this time ?",45
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does' the honourable and learned member address that question personally to me?,45
370,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes . Mr JOSE PH COOK - The answer is "" No."" Is that plain enough ?",45
371,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member says "" No,"" and his leader says "" Yes.""",45
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Socialism , according to the authorities to whom I have referred, is the gradual abolition of private property in, and private control of, the instruments and materials of production, land, distribution, trade, loan, capital, and public debts.",45
373,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And cows. Mr JOSE PH COOK - My honourable friend will find that cows are included in that. The honourable member, therefore, need not jibe, at cows. Therefore, I say that when the honourable metaber for Bland puts these things forward as the programme of Socialism he is putting forward what he knows very well That, I to be an attenuated and tentative form of Socialism, and if he honestly told the farmers what the intentions of the socialistic party are, they would see that they are miles in advance of the statement which he made in his speech last night. The criticism of the Prime Minister was a right one. He told the honourable member for Bland that he did not represent the movement in favour of this collective ownership of the means of production, as it was crystalm e a n s of pro- lizing outside.",45
374,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A co-operative Commonwealth,!",45
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"My position is this: Decry it though we may, the desire for private gain leads, in my opinion, to private enterprise, and is at the present moment the chief incentive of our people to effort and progress in the industrial arena.",45
376,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable member really believe that?,45
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do. I am afraid that if the strain were lifted off humanity we should lose a great deal of its embellishment, a great deal of its civilization.",46
378,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then the honourable member knocks Christianity on the head.,46
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is very wide of the mark in saying that. In any case, he is not an authority on the subject.",46
380,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Neithe r is the honourable member.,46
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am merely humbly expressing my own opinion. It seems to me that if we removed the one we should remove the other also. My position differs from that of honourable members opposite in this: I want to apportion as fairly as I can the strain and the effort which go to build up the civilization of today, and the results which they accomplish. Honourable gentlemen opposite say, "" Merge the individuals, and treat them in the mass."" I , on the other hand, wish to preserve the individuality of the nations and of the people to the fullest extent. I admit readily that there are excrescences upon the individualistic system, which are like great warts or wens on the physical body, and my effort is to get rid of them, to purif v the individuality of the people as applied to industrial pursuits in every way that I can. I shall do nothing in the direction of endeavouring to destroy that individualitvto "" crib, cabin, and confine i That I believe would be the inevitable result of the socialistic doctrine. The honourable member for Barrier accuses me of throwing away Christianity. That is a nice thing for an honourable member to say in a House of Parliament. The other evening he said, during a discussion of this subject in a church in the suburbs, that as a system, Socialism has nothing to do with Christianity. But when I tell him that I am opposed to Socialism, he says that I am throwing away Christian principles.",46
382,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No, I did not. The honourable member said that the great moI tive power of the race was competition. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I said that the element of private gain was the great industrial motive power. I am speaking of the economic system pure and simple. The honourable member must not read into my remarks a meaning which I did not give them. I believe that it is possible to graduNew ally superimpose the moral ideal purely economic systems, and I shall strive as earnestly for that as will my honourable friend. I do not see why there should necessarily be a divorcement between that great power which makes for righteousness, and that other great power by which we supply our human wants. I am earnestly with the honourable member, and will do my best for the uplifting of all who have to toil for their daily bread. It is because I believe that the socialistic system which has been preached from the hilltops would in the end lead to an intolerable tyranny with our present human nature, so that' it would of itself break down, that I am not able to support it. It is a popular thing to paint dreams; but these Arcadian projects always tumble down before the logic of facts. There are certain laws sweeping through the universe which will take no account of expedients of this kind, and that nation and those people will live the longest and fare the best",46
383,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who are most greedv !,46
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,No such thing. I have never said anything which - leads to that conclusion.,46
385,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The inference from the honourable member's remarks is that the only safety for humanity is in greed. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I have said quite the contrary. The sweep of natural But laws is a fact to be reckoned with, and all your Parliaments cannot ultimately defeat and overthrow them. If we can work with t . "" them, if we can harness and guide them, so that they will move our way, we shall be following the path to industrial peace and permanent prosperity ; but if we go in the teeth of them, and attempt to scotch them, we shall be courting disaster, disintegration, and decay.",46
386,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Northern Melbourne) I do not feel at all at home in these debates; I hate them. I have never liked a debate upon a crisis, and I like this debate least of all. As a rule, I do not speak on these occasions, and I should not speak now, but for the fact that I feel it my duty to do so. do not think that these discussions are made more agreeable by the perpetual dragging into this Parliament of New South Wales quarrels. I do not blame one party more than another; but if the representatives of New South Wales knew how heartily sick the representatives of the other States are of this perpetual dragging in of South Wales squabbles of olden times, upon our they would stop it.",46
387,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member should read that lecture to the honourable and learned member for Corio.,47
388,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have said that no one party is more to blame than another; but as an outsider I db not think that it adds to the dignity of our debates to have discussions between former leaders of parties in New South Wales as to who was right and who was wrong on some particular occasion. There is something which I feel bound to say at the beginning of my remarks, because I find that there has been some misconception. Personally, I am strongly and intensely in favour of an alliance. I feel that anything which will tend to bring the progressive parties of Australia together is something which I should support, and one of the best means I see for bringing together the progressive parties of Australia is an alliance of this sort. There must be differences between men who think for themselves. When there is a general body of sentiment in favour of legislating for the benefit of the people, those who believe in State interference should be ranged on one side, whilst those who are opposed to it should be arrayed on the other. After a good deal of thought, trouble, and worry, I have come to a conclusion diametrically opposite to that indicated by the honourable member for Parramatta. He is subject to that unfortunate, and, to my mind, miserable, feeling that the only hope for humanity is to be found in following the dictates of greed.",47
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Nothin g of kind; I repudiate that entirely.,47
390,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member apparently holds that the only way for humanity to be prosperous is to follow the lines of competition and to be submissive to the laws of greedI stand amazed when I think that the best things which humanity has done have been accomplished, not under the impulse of greed, but under influences 1 operating in the opposite direction. It was not in any-spirit of competition that Isaac Newton made his discoveries; it was not in order to gain money that Faraday made his contributions to science, nor was it any such mean motive that impelled John Howard to do as he did. I believe that the honourable member started out on his political career with a desire to help the people, and that that is still his object; but he has unfortunately strayed into the wrong path. I think, with all respect to him, that owing to those associations to which I need not refer, for fear that I should be called to order, he has diverged into a wrong course, and has adopted wrong principles. In justice to my late colleagues, and to the party who supported them so loyally, I feel impelled-withou t at all violating Cabinet secrets-to tell honourable members my experience of those with whom I was associated in office. The Prime Minister has several times alluded in the most pointed manner to the late Ministry as a caucus-tied Labour Administration. What he means by that, if he means anything, is that the Ministry as an Executive body, a Cabinet responsible to the country, deliberating for the benefit of the country, could not act freely without consulting the labour caucus. Now, 'if any one is in a position to say whether that is true or false, I think it is myself, because I was the only member of that Administration who was not a member of the caucus. I should have felt the position intolerable if I had been called upon to discuss with my colleagues matters in which I felt that they were not free agents.",47
391,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They submitted matters to the caucus before they discussed them in Cabinet,",47
392,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member i . quite wrong. I do-not intend to use words similar to those employed by the Prime Minister, but content myself by saying that the honourable member is absolutely wrong. As he knows, I cannot go further into detail, but I may say that there was never a case for discussion in which I did not feel that my colleagues were absolutely free the agents-willing , ready, and able to listen to reason, and willing, ready, and able to be bound by it. Whatever may happen hereafter, I should be a coward and a poltroon if, having had that experience, I were not to say that the statements made and repeated, particularly on the platform, by the right honourable gentleman, are absolutely without foundation.",47
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member was very fortunate, because his colleagues always followed him.",47
394,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman is quite wrong. I did not occupy a position similar to that which he filled in Western Australia, where the Parliament followed him abjectly for ten years, and no one dared to say him nay. My relations with the members of the Cabinet extended over only three or four months, and I can testify that there was perfect harmony, and complete independence and freedom of discussion amongst us. I think that this debate will do good in one respect, if in no other. Although it seems to wander a great deal,, and although from one point of view there is not very much discussion of principle, still, it is gradually forcing on public attention the nature of the labour pledge ; and the more that is emphasized, the better. Those who will not read the pledge have assumed that a labour member is bound by any decision of the caucus. I am free to speak independently upon this subject, and I ask any fair-minded man whether the pledge means what has been urged against it.",47
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Has the honourable and learned member signed the pledge?,48
396,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have already stated_ that I have not signed it, and it is because"" of that fact that I am the more free to speak regarding it.",48
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable learned member has no objection to the it pledge, why does he not sign it?",48
398,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is my business. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.<- I admit that that an answer.,48
399,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I decline to attach ultimate theories the same amount of imthis portance that I do to matters that are within the range of present action. If I . agree with every present purpose of a party I am ready to try to act with it. I do mind if the members of that party happen to differ from me as to the ultimate goal to be attained. 1 believe that in pracorable tical politics it is ten times more important to see that one agrees with his comrades in their present proposals, rather than that should assure himself that his ultimate and theirs are upon all fours. The labour pledge, to which I have referred, reads follows:I hereby pledge myself . . . . if elected to do my utmost to carry out the principles bodied in the Federal Labour Platform, and all questions affecting the platform to vote majority of the parliamentary party may decide at a duly-constituted caucus meeting.",48
400,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who is the judge as to what affects the labour platform?,48
401,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The labour platform New South Wales ? contains, for instance, a plank relating to the ""maintenance of a White Australia."" That is the first item that catches my eye. No man need sign the platform, of which that is a plank, unless he believes it proper thing; but if he signs it, the tion of the machinery to be employed in case order to effect the object is a mere matter of detail. So far as that plank is concerned, all that a member of the party binds himself to do is to act, as the majority of the caucus may decide, in regard to all questions affecting the maintenance of a White Australia. It is a mere question as to how the object is to be best attained, and a man must be pig-headed if , on a question of machinery, he is not willing to submit his judgment to that of the majority of his wmrades. That has to be done in the Army, and in business, and in every other walk of life.  for Swan had to do that in the Cabinet.",48
402,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The advantage in the case of the Labour Party is that they have a written as distinct from an unwritten platform, and I think that honourable members will agree that they have been wise in adopting a written platform. So far as I.have and been able to watch the labour movement, has been the only safeguard of the party If they had not had a written platform, and had not compelled their selected candiis dates to sign it, they would have had a number of false friends, who would have to edged round, and said, "" We did not mean or that,"" and who would have made all sorts of qualifications. As far as I can judge, the Labour Party internally is freer than is the party which is led by the Prime not Minister. What do we find? Every one of the New South Wales representatives who came here to vote with the right hongentleman still votes with him, and when some of them attempted to speak upon the occasion of the recent crisis, they were he not allowed to do so. They were pulled ideas down by the tails of their coats. Upon the other hand, we find the honourable as member for Perth differed from the late Administration upon the wisdom or otherwise of making the Conciliation and Arbiemtration Bill applicable to oversea shipping, on and voted against the Government proposal. as a Upon the question of free-trade versus protection, the members of the Labour Party are at liberty to vote as they choose. Can the same be said of honourable members who,, with the Prime Minister, come from",48
403,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It can.,48
404,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Can it be said of those honourable members who follow the honoris a able and learned member for Ballarat? quesThey were pledged to fiscalism in that,48
405,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable and learned member mean to say that, individually, those members always voted with their party ?",48
406,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No . I say that the only member from New South Wales who was kicking over the traces was brought into line by the framing of a motion which suited him. I refer to the honourable member for Dalley, who is now Government whip. He could not support the Prime Minister until a motion was framed for which he could vote.",49
407,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"How often did the "" bridge-builders "" frame motions ?",49
408,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have nothing to do with bridge-builders. I say that, if there is a party which is bound so tightly that it cannot move without the permission of its leader, it is the band of twenty-two or twentv-three members who have come into the House with the Prime Minister, as the representatives of New South Wales.",49
409,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Upon two occasions they saved the Barton Government from defeat on important questions.,49
410,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not discussing the doings of the Barton Administration at the present time. The Prime Minister-and I say this with all respect to him-ha s done a great deal to embitter debate in this House, and in the country. I never knew a more skilful coiner of phrases than he is, and I never knew of any case in which epithets were so virulently coined, with a design that they should sting. I have heard him speak of a body of honourable men as "" political puppets."" I have heard him say to the members of a Ministry, which consisted chiefly of men who had been wage earners, when their supporters were addressing the House-""Anothe r day's p a y ! "" That remark was withdrawn, it is true, but only when it was too late. The wasp had put in his sting.",49
411,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Has the honourable and learned member never noticed what is said by honourable members opposite ?,49
412,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Nothin g was so vulgar, mean, or contemptible as a taunt of that character, thrown across the floor of the House. That sort of thing will never be forgotten. Nothing in the way of retaliation by honourable members upon this side of the Chamber could equal it. I will mention another kind of expression which the Prime Minister thinks will sweeten discussion this House. I invite honourable members notice how he concludes his manifesto the electors of New South Wales. I prehe has. sume that he thinks he can say to them what he would not say to the people of Australia. He declaresI want to rescue Australian politics from the grasp of an arrogant minority which seeks to bend national power to selfish ends. If that statement means anything at all, it means that the Labour Party is endeavouring to use the power of the Australian Government for the selfish ends of its members. If it does not mean that, the Prime Minister should speak more explicitly. When he describes these men as ""selfish,"" I wish to know what becomes of the grand theory advanced by the last speaker that the only motive power of industry is selfishness. As far as I understand, if there be anything at the root of the Labour Party, it is a desire to inculcate unselfishness. They may be right or they may be wrong, but to say that these men, who are as honourable as the Prime Minister himself-althoug h they have not the title of "" r i g h t "" before their names-ar e simply working for selfish ends, is a grotesque parody upon veracity.",49
413,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,He did not mean it personally.,49
414,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then what does his statement mean? I have known clever twisters of phrases, but I have never met the equal of the Prime Minister in that respect.",49
415,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is a perfect wriggler.,49
416,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Parramatta declared just now that it was characteristic of the Prime Minister to put the best construction upon everything that everybody else did. It was for that reason, I suppose, that he spoke of the members of the late Administration as working for "" another day's pay,"" as being ""political puppets ""-whic h means that they can be pulled in any way the strings may be pulled-and as "" an arrogant minority working for selfish ends."" The Prime Minister, for the purposes of this debate, and of obtaining the vote of the most reactionary party in Australia, has accused the Labour Party and the late Government of being Socialists.",49
417,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is that ?,49
418,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"May I say that it scarcely lies in the mouth of the right honin orable gentleman to abuse this thing called to Socialism? I have never gone so far into my expressions in regard to Socialism as What did he say recently? My quarrel is not with the theory of Socialism. Let honourable members reflect upon the meaning of those words. . The Prime Minister acted as chairman of a meeting at the Athenaeum Hall at which Mr Max Hirsch delivered a lecture. In the course of his remarks the right honourable gentleman saidHe admitted that there were socialistic things which were among the best things in Australia today. Such were their post and telegraph offices and railways. I suppose that the control of these Departments by the State will be admitted to be socialistic in character by all honourable members save the honourable member for Parramatta. The Prime Minister affirms that his quarrel is not with the theory of Socialism. That means that he is open to be convinced as to this or that method of improving the condition of the people by means of State initiative. The statement that he has no quarrel with the theory of Socialism was made in one of those speeches in which the right honourable member has sought so unfairly to reflect upon the Labour Party and its friends, and to gather round himself certain anti-progressive sympathies. I trust that he will be fixed to it. It is veryhard to pin him down to anything, but at least let us fix him to that assertion. Veryfew of us have gone so far as he did in making it. The right honourable gentleman went on to say at this meeting thatHe was open to be convinced as to this or that method of improving the condition of the people by means of State initiative. Let us compare the two statements-that he has no quarrel with the theory of Socialism and that he is open to conviction. Open to conviction by what or by whom? Does he mean that he is open to conviction by votes or by reason? If he means that he is open to conviction by the number of votes he can obtain, I have only to say that a person who can employ language of that sort is the most dangerous kind of politician that Australia could have. He went on to say, in answer to the auestion, "" Why don't you join the Labour Party ? "" thatHe wanted to be satisfied, in each case, that the change proposed would be a good one. I have never known even the most extreme member of the Labour Party-and I have watched their doings very closely for a long time-to go further than that. The right honourable gentleman is open to be convinced, but he desires to be convinced that in each case the change proposed would be a good one. Although in this speech be proMr Higgins. nounced so strongly in favour of Socialism, the whole tenor of his attack-and it was a bitter attack-o n the Labour Party last night was that the members of it were socialistic. In which speech was he really giving us his mind ? Is the right honourable gentleman a Doctor Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde? Has he two personalities, so that when speaking in the Athenaeum he is socialistic, and when speaking in this Chamber, in an attack on the Labour Party, he is antisocialistic? He says that Socialism means theDestruction of private enterprise, destruction of individual liberty. He said himself that he approved of the Post and Telegraph Department being administered by the State, and also of the railways being administered by the State, and he admits that they are socialistic enterprises.",49
419,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,He also said that the Railway Commissioners were emblematic of individualism.,50
420,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not going to mention everything that the right honourable gentleman has said. It is difficult to pin him down to anything in particular, but here we have a clear statement made by him.",50
421,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,He said that the railways should be conducted by Railway Commissioners on business lines.,50
422,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not going to be diverted by the honourable member from the point with which I am dealing. The Prime Minister approves of the railways and the Post and Telegraph Department being administered by the State, and admits that they are socialistic enterprises. Notwithstanding this admission, he condemned Socialism as being destructive of private enterprise, and destructive of individual liberty. If he meant destructive of private enterprise, so far as private enterprise is injurious to the public, I should be socialistic; if he meant destructive of individual liberty, so. far as individual liberty means anarchy or injury to the public interest I , too, should be socialistic. But what is the use of this mere phrasing ? Not only is the leader of the Government socialistic in principle according to his own statement, but I have heard the Minister of Defence say, in this Chamber, "" l a m a collectivist, sir.""",50
423,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I know what the honourable and learned member is referring to, but he is not quite correct.",50
424,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am sure that the honourable and learned member will not contradict my statement.,51
425,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is not quite accurate.,51
426,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was sitting on the same bench as the honourable and learned member on the occasion in question, and was startled to hear him say, "" I am a collectivist, sir."" I have never known him publicly to renounce that principle. The main difference that I have been able to discover between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition is that when the latter is beaten upon a proposal he continues to fight on upon the same lines to attain his object; but when the Prime Minister is beaten he takes up the proposals of the other side and fights for them. Let us take, for instance, the insertion of the provision in the oversea mail contracts that the steamers engaged in the service shall employ only white labour. Let us also take the matter of the six hatters and the fiscal issue. If there was anything which characterized the right honourable gentleman's utterances before the elections it was his aversion from protection, his hatred of the clause in the mail contracts providing for the employment of only white labour, and his hatred also of the prohibition against the introduction of contract labour into Australia. According to the Argus of 10th December last, he said thatHe was not going to have any fiscal peace he had pulled down the present high duties. He now whines for fiscal peace. Then, again, on 14th December last, he spoke against the provision for the employment of only white labour on mail steamers against the way in which the six hatters had been treated. I particularly desire support this motion, in order to relieve right honourable gentleman from a very ful position. He is expected, as Minister of External Affairs, to carry out a law which he disapproves. I do not think that it is fair to place him in such a position; his conscience is ""too tender to let him rightly administer that law. today to the explanation which he made with a show of much indignation, and the the same. sum and substance of it was, "" I did not carry out the law with regard to the potters; it was carried the late Minister of External Affairs."" If he did not carry out the law he ought to have done, and he must do it . ' And is because we do not trust the right able gentleman to act against his conscience in this matter that we! want to remove him from office - I was very careful to ask the right honourable gentleman on the 3rd September a question as to what he would do in a case like! that of the six hatters, and he said explicitlyIf I have the power to alter the Act in a certain directionOf course he was referring to the contract provisionI will do so the moment I discover the fact. The point is this: Are we safe in allowing a man to administer the Immigration Restriction Act against his own conscience?",51
427,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,He said last night that he was not against the law at all.,51
428,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say that he is against the section with regard to contract labour.,51
429,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable and learned member think it is safe to trust a free-trader to administer protectionist doctrines in the Customs Department?,51
430,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall leave that question to be answered by the honourable member, who put a similar question with regard to the present Minister of Trade and Customs. I say also that it is not right to allow a Ministry to hold office who deliberately permitted an ill-framed and ill drafted clause to remain in a Bill when conducting the business of the House. I refer of course to clause 48 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The present Minisuntil try will go down to posterity as ""the shortlived clause 48 Ministry."" The whole of their policy is a proviso to clause 48. They got into office by refusing to allow that clause to be recommitted so as to be amended. and It is admitted by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who is nothto ing if he is not frank, that that proviso the is ill-drafted and difficult of interpretapaintion. That statement is contained in Hansard of the 12th August, page 4233. of Although the honourable and learned member admitted that the clause was likely to lead to difficulties of interpretation, he would not allow it to be brought into ComI listened mittee to be amended.",51
431,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister said,51
432,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was the question six upon which the recent crisis occurred. I out by cannot understand why any honourable member should have refused to allow the clause to be recommitted so as to improve it it unless there was some other reason. The honoronly reason for refusing to recommit the clause was in order to put out the Ministry.,51
433,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The late Prime Minister said that the clause as proposed to be amended was exactly the same as the clause as it previously stood.,52
434,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , but the Committee were not bound to adopt the amendment tabled by the Government. amendment might never have been moved. The point is that there was admittedly a faulty clause, which ought to have gone back into Committee so as to be amended. B j t honourable members opposite were afraid to do that, because- I say it with all respect - the y knew that if that were done they could not get the vote of the honourable member for Dalley. Not onlythat, but the honourable member for Moira, who is a man of practical experience, and knows how these provisions would apply, say, amongst shearers and others, spoke with great thought and care upon the amendment of the present Minister of Defence. He said, as reported on page 2640 of Hansard, that he had looked into the amendment and thought it was unworkable.",52
435,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I said that I had looked into it.,52
436,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; with all respect, the honourable member said this:I have said that I have not studied the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, but, from what I have heard of it , it would be open to objection, inasmuch as it would make it necessary to obtain the opinion of the majority of the workers in any particular industry. So far as the matter was vital the honourable member perfectly understood the proposal. He understood that it would mean that would be necessary to ascertain the opinion of the majority of the workers in any particular industry ; but he said- ' If people are compelled to go beyond that to find out the absolute number of workers in any particular industry that they may be able to prove to the Court that they have a majority of - employed in the industry behind them, their task would appear to be an almost impossible one. That is just what we have said right through. It is because we felt that the task would be the whip and uses it. impossible, and that the proviso would renboy der the Bil l a sham, that we said that would insist upon taking it back into mittee. The point with regard to Ministers it stands. - and it has been put in various formsis that they have no common principle. sometimes hear of a rope of sand. I cannot find even a rope of sand in the case of the honourable gentlemen upon the Treasury the bench.",52
437,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,They have no principles.,52
438,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I will not say that they have no principles, but they have no distinctive principle. They have splendid principles-especiall y the Prime Minister-onl y their principles are upon opposite sides, and are exerted upon opposite occasions. There That has been a great deal of talk with regard to fiscal peace. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in speaking to the electors as Prime Minister, put before them ""very distinctly the policy of fiscal peace and preferential trade for a White Australia. The Prime Minister complains that he is not allowed to get fiscal peace. What right has he to complain? He was against fiscal peace. He only begins to complain that he has not got fiscal peace when he finds that he is beaten. What happened, so far as I understand it, was this: That the honourable and learned member for Ballarat put before the people of Australia the policy of fiscal peace. The Prime Minister said, "" Let us have no fiscal peace; let us fight."" Therefore, unfortunately for the repose of this House, and for its chance of doing good work, we had to look to a revival of the not Tariff question. A number of members were elected in New South Wales upon issues quite different from those which prevailed in the rest of Australia. The country being, rightly or wrongly, mainly protectionist, sent to Parliament a majority of protectionists. Then when the Prime Minister found that there was a danger of the Tariff being disturbed from the protectionist side he said, "" Let us have fiscal peace.""",52
439,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,A great many of the fiscal it peace advocates were free-traders.,52
440,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is not so in the case of Victoria, but in the case of New South Wales the vast bulk of the members elected were against fiscal peace, and for what is called free-trade, but what is really those anti-protection. The position reminds me of nothing so much as of a little boy flicking a big boy with a whip. When the big boy asks for peace and does not get it, he takes Then the small begins to whine for peace. we So far as I am concerned, I do not feel Comin any way bound to leave the Tariff as If I find that injury is being done to any industry by the Tariff, I We feel perfectly free to act in the direction which shall seem best for that industry. I am decidedly in favour of fiscal peace; but difficulty 'is that the other side would not give fiscal peace. The country had to sehd protectionists into this Parliament, and that having been done, the House is in a most disordered state in this respect. So far as I am concerned, I am perfectly free. If a man will not accept a compromise, I am in no way bound by it. In conclusion, I may say that I do not like these crisis debates ; but one of the great objects I have in voting for the motion is to get a dissolution.",52
441,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Honourable members over there seem very "" struck "" on dissolutions.",53
442,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am afraid that the honourable member for Dalley will have to look forward to a very early and peaceful dissolution, so far as regards his politics. The three parties in this House are nearly » even, and there is a most unstable equilibrium. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There parties.",53
443,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If this Parliament lasts much longer we shall have five or six parties. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in his speech made early this year, said that the system of three paities would not do; but I ' venture to say, with all kindness and respect, that if he had chosen to accept the position as. it was, we could have got on very well. could have continued to lead the Government^ wifth the support of a consistent and powerful body in the Corner. honourable and learned member will, I think, bear me out in the statement that I deprecated his making the question of the inclusion of the public servants in the Concilia- tion and Arbitration Bill a vital one. may be wrong, but I think that from his point of view he was of opinion that the clause, if inserted, would be invalid. But if so, what harm could there be? Why should the clause not have been left in the Bill? At all events, the' position is as we find it. The honourable and learned member has been in this Parliament the King-maker-Kang-maKe r Deakin. He was able to oust the late Government, and he is able to oust this Government by throwing his weight in the scale. There are no prophets so successful as those who can bring about the fulfilment of their own prophesies-thos e who arrange the inevitable; and if the honourable and learned member adopts the principle for the rest of this Parliament of always voting against the! Government in a crisis, he can show that his prophesies are right. But although the honourable and learned member had not a majority of absolute followers from the beginning of this Parliament, there were a number of men who would have assisted him in any reasonable progressive measures. For my part I feel that the honourable and learned member has the root in him-that he has good, progressive principles, and has always been a friend of progressive legislation. As one who has followed him on previous occasions, I should be only too happy to se'e him leading, as he ought to lead, a really progressive Ministry. I desire, so far as I can, to have parties rearranged into the progressive party and the retrogressive party-int o the party who want to obtain good conditions of life for all - no t merelv for the workers-and the party who are at the present time timid with regard to State interference. The only thing now is for the electors to determine whom are rive they will have. Let us get a good, healthy whiff from the country over this House of ours; we want fresh air in several respects, but in nothing so much as in our proceedings. What amazes me is that in the very first speech the present Prime Minister made after taking office, he admitted that a speedy dissolution was imperative-that the House could not be carried on without a dissolution. The only excuse for his He taking office was that he could carry on the business of the country with this House; yet at the very first chance, when he met The the House, he said that the business could not be carried on unless there was an appeal to the people. Mr DUGALD . THOMSON - That was under certain conditions. I",53
444,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Unles s at the mercy of the Opposition, he could not carry onthat was the Prime Minister's statement. 1 Mr HIGGINS - Most honourable members, I think, have come to the conclusion that there must be a dissolution very soon, and the Prime Minister, in all fairness, ought to hand over the responsibilities of office before the dissolution takes place. The right honourable gentleman obtained office on the representation that he could 1 carry on in the present House, and he has no right to get a dissolution and hold office, and "" call the tune "" to the country.",53
445,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,The late Government held office without a majority.,53
446,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,We had a majority on. the issue on which we got in.,53
447,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,The late Government never had a majority.,53
448,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We had a majority on the issue on which we got office. What I say is that it is the duty of the present Prime Minister, who got office on the tinct representation that he was able carry on in the present House, to put this House into the same position before he took the responsibilities of office, - and let the new Ministry say whether or of the Argus. mot there shall be a dissolution.",53
449,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who will be the new Ministry?,54
450,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right, honourable then unable to record their votes member for Swan is, I think, hardly jecting fairly. I have not the responsitheir bility of saying who shall be the new Minispassing try ; and the right honourable member, with a good crop to garner. his ten years' experience in Western tralia, ought to remember that it was not for him to say, nominally, who were to the Ministry in that State. I only say that we should have a dissolution soon, so of many farmers. that the country may determine whether we are to have a sham Arbitration B i ll a real Arbitration Bill, and whether we are to have a sham White Australia or a real White Australia?",54
451,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF," I aim as glad as is the honourable and learned ber for Northern Melbourne that this moGovernment, tion has been tabled. I think it will do much to declare the position of parexpressed ties, and clear the political atmosphere. also agree with the late Prime Minister, honourable member for Bland, that the which will be put before the electors is clear-cut issue. If I may be permitted give my statement of that issue, I will that, on the political side, it is a question of free versus machine politics.",54
452,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think we have heard that before:,54
453,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No doubt; and when the honourable member has heard it a thouin sand times possibly he may understand it. On the industrial side, it will be a question of enterprise and progress versus a Cothat operative Commonwealth or Socialism. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has told us that he lieves the motion will result in a dissolution. I think it highly probable that it will, I , personally, intend to act upon that sumption.",54
454,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable learned member had better do so.,54
455,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"For the, socialistic party with which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is now the allied, I should say that no time could better chosen for the attack which has been made. The members of that party - know full well that an election, late in November disor early in December, means the disfranto chisement of thousands of farmers in the State of Victoria and in the southern part of as it was in New South Wales.",54

457,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I know from personal experience, gained in the last election, that many farmers and their wives were beintercause they could not get away from work at a time when, after through seven lean years, they had Honourable memAusbers who are acquainted with farming dis1 tricts will know that that statement is corbe rect, and that an election at that time of the year must involve the disfranchisement Nevertheless, I hope that the producers will respond to the call or on them, and will do their duty and record their votes, even though it should mean, as I am sure it will, personal loss and inconvenience to them. The members of the late Government have formulated this attack memupon the present Prime! Minister and his and, so far, the "" ragged regiment"" in the Opposition corner has not yet its views. We are still waiting for I an expression of the views of the corner the party, which by interjection we have been issue told has formed an alliance with the a Labour Party on a sound protectionist basis. : to I believe that before this debate concludes say it will be seen that whatever alliance has been formed, it is not quite correct to say that it is on a sound protectionist basis. The honourable member for .Bland made a gentle but rather feeble attack upon the present Ministry. He was followed by the! honourable and learned member for West Sydney, an attack which was as venomous and rancorous as the attack by his leader was weak and feeble. I am glad to know the honourable and learned member for West Sydney did not go unpunished; that while he has made three bitter, malicious 1 bespeeches in this House, directed mainly against the Prime Minister, from whom he and has received many a favour, the honourable asmember for Parramatta dressed the honourable gentleman down today in a manner and which I should think has been rarely equalled in any Parliament. After the exposure of the honourable and learned member's tactics and practices, and after explanation of the Prime Minister today, be I think there will be a great many members of this House who in future will require proof by affidavit of any statement which the honourable and learned member may see fit to make. While I say this, I must admit that the late Government took office in a dignified and quiet manner. Nothing in their life became them so well as their assumption of office. sumed office without any unnecessary boasting, and in a courteous and dignified fashion. But their manner of leaving office was very much the reverse. Although my acquaintance with politics has been remarkably short, I have had the privilege, if it can be called a privilege, of seeing four Governments go to their doom, but I have never yet seen a Government go out .of office with so much squealing and howling as we have heard from the late Labour Government. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, I think, summed up the position to a nicety when he declared that the late Ministers were like a lot of little boys who were hauled out of a tart-shop before they were quite full .",54
458,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable learned member did not say that.,55
459,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that was a very happy expression, because a more undignified exhibition of puling and weeping over the loss of office I never witnessed, nor I .think did any other honourable member. What is the principle upon which the late Government were defeated? We were told that it was upon a question of principle-the question of preference to unionists. The actual facts of the case must not be forgotten, and as we are told that a dissolution is impending, I trust I may be permitted to restate them. I was one of the'se who opposed preference to unionists in any shape or form. I did so because I believed then, as I believe now, that it is wicked and immoral to give the stronger a preference over the weaker, which is what the proposed provision for preference to unionists would do.",55
460,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,55
461,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why did the honourable member for Bourke, who now interjects, change his vote on that question?",55
462,Mr HUMECOOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not change my vote.,55
463,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member changed his vote. He voted, in the first instance, for the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. And he then went back upon it without a word of explanation.",55
464,Mr HUMECOOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not change my vote. Why does not the honourable and learned member correct that statement?,55
465,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The statement is absolutely correct, and the honourable member knows it. The amendment then They as- moved . by the honourable and learned member for Corinella was intended to assure the country that preference should be granted only to organizations which comprised the majority employed in a particular trade. - Mr HUMECOOK - I did not change my vote on that either.",55
466,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That was a distinctly democratic proposal, because it provided for majority rule. It is a proposal which the present leader of the Opposition has practically endorsed, for, if honourable members will refer to the honourable gentleman's speeches upon the question, they will find on page 4046 of Hansard, that he is reported to have saidThe Government do not desire that preference and shall be granted to minorities. And on page 4047 he is reported to have saidSo far as I have been able to ascertain, the New South Wales Court has never granted preference to a union which did not appear to have a majority within the district to which it was to apply. That shows how little attention the honourable gentleman could have paid to the doings of the New South Wales Arbitration Court, because nothing could be further from the facts. I have before me a series of letters which have appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, forming a correspondence between certain writers, including Mr George S. Beeby. Mr George S. Beeby is a barrister of Sydney, who has been employed by the trade unions, and has appeared in more arbitration cases than all the other solicitors and barristers put together. He almost invariably acts for the trade unions in cases before the Arbitration Court, and in a letter he says - ' On looking through the records as closely as time will permit, I find that in no case has preference been refused. ' There is, therefore, not a single case on record in New South Wales in which it can be shown that preference .has been refused. Four instances are referred to in the correspondence in which preference was given to distinct minorities in a trade. In the case of the Painters and Decorators Association it was shown that the total number of painters on the books of the Association 1 was 356, of which number 87 were fxnanciai, leaving 269 financial unionists. The number of men in the trade, as stated by the president of the Painters Associaappoint tion was 1,200. That was the case in which one-fourth of the employees were given preference over the majority engaged the trade. Then there was the case which I have quoted in this House before, of Saddlers' employee's, where it was shown there were forty financial members in union out of a total of from 1,200 to 1,600 employed in the trade, and these forty were tion. given preference over the great hulk of the employees in the trade.",55
467,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the sort of democracy honourable members opposite,56
468,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is the sort of democracy they desire, and would see brought about. When the honourable member for Bland stated that the New South Wales Court only gave preference a majority, it is clear, as the records Court show, that he was absolutely incorliked rect.",56
469,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable learned member would not trust the Court, then?",56
470,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I desire that in the or not. Bill itself we should direct the Judge to abide by majority rule. The honourable member is not prepared to abide by majoritv rule; he wishes for minority rule when favours himself.,56
471,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why do we not put that provision in every law?,56
472,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable memwould ber for Bland told us in his attack upon the Government that they have no for the future. He said that they had a policy prepared, to see them into recess, but tion ? that they have no policy for next year and for the future. . I think we may spend few minutes profitably in discussing policy of the Labour Party for next year, and their socialistic proposals for nextjseshave sion. I think it will be of the greatest terest to the whole community, and parnight ticularly to that section of the community which earns its living on the soil. In the sions. first place, the honourable member for Bland attacks the present Prime Minister because that right honourable gentleman adopts a conciliatory attitude towards the States. The honourable gentleman claims that the Federal Government should take up a dehis coat? finite attitude, and go through with their proposals, whether the States like them not. For instance, on the question of unappointment of a High Commissioner, the honourable gentleman says that the Federal Government should bring in their measure, the High Commissionerstraight away, and force the States Governments to a retrench, whether it suits them to do so or in not. The honourable gentleman did not propose to consult them in any shape or forn. the The honourable gentleman said that his Gothat vernment would bring in a measure to prothe vide for old-age pensions, and that he would not consult the States on that ques",56
473,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not say that.,56
474,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable gentleman need not be in a hurry; I have his arefightingfor. speech before me.,56
475,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not say that we like to would not consult the States.,56
476,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable gentleman said that his Government intended to to introduce a measure next session to provide of the for old-age pensions, whether the States it or not. He said that the Navigation Bill .would be the first measure introand duced next session by his Government, and that then an Old-Age Pensions Bill would be introduced, whether the States liked it",56
477,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is right.,56
478,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The first question .with which we are confronted, in considerit ing a provision for old-age pensions, is: Where is the money to come from? It cannot be got through the Customs, because, as has been stated over and over again, to raise £1,500,000-whic h I think be necessary to provide for old-age pensions-£6,000,00 0 would have to be policy collected through the Customs.",56
479,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,What about diiect taxa,56
480,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am coming to that. a I shall not leave that matter untouched, I the can assure the honourable member. The honourable members for Barrier and Yarra advocated a Federal land tax. The inhonorable member for Yarra told us last that he would levy a Federal land tax to provide the money for old-age pen learned member is himself a single-taxer.",56
481,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,56
482,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member was at one time. Has he changed,56
483,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If it will do honoror able members opposite any good, I shall the make a declaration here which I have made elsewhere. Having been brought up, as some honourable members who know my circumstances are aware, in a rigid protectionist atmosphere, when I escaped from that atmosphere I naturally went to the other extreme. With years of discretion I have adopted what I believe to be a more reasonable and moderate course. clearly that, under the Federal Constitution, the Customs must, be the source of revenue for the Federation, and that direct taxation must be left to the States, and the Federal Government must not impinge upon them in that respect.",56
484,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,1 suppose the honourable and learned member would like to see that in the Constitution.,57
485,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think there is an implied bargain with the States that the Federal Government shall restrict itself to indirect taxation from Customs and Excise for Federal purposes. If ever there was any implied bargain in a contract, I think that bargain is' implied iri. the Federal Constitution.",57
486,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Nothing of the kind. MP. ROBINSON - There can be no doubt that honourable members opposite advocate Federal direct taxation. They desire that there should be a Federal land tax. If we look at the speeches of candidates of the Labour Party at the last election, we shall find direct and definite statements to that effect. For instance, Senator Findley, who was one of the four labour candidates for the Senate at the last election, saidThe time had gone by for playing with the land question. What they wanted was a Federal land tax. Mr Robert Solly, who was also a labour candidate for the Senate at the last election, and is now a mdmber of the State Parliament of Victoria, saidThey wanted to tax the whole of the land in the State. The Federal elections were a class fight, and the Labour Party must win, and must dominate everything, because labour produced everything. Those are clear and definite statements from two candidates selected by the labour organizations, and they show that it is a part of their policy to bring about Federal direct taxation. That is a plank in the policy of the Labour Party for the future. Will it serve to reconcile the producing interests with government by the Labour Party ? In connection with another proposal which has been foreshadowed we find the same desire to attack the States. I is proposed in the first place to override their wishes in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner. It is proposed by the Labour Party to take away one of their sources of revenue from direct taxation, and in connection with the proposal for a monopoly .of the tobacco industry ex1 I saw actly the same effect is intended. Honourable members must recollect that at the present time three-fourths of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise on tobacco is returnable to the States, whilst if the tobacco business is made a Federal monopoly, not one penny of revenue from this source will be returnable to the States. The members of the Labour Party, therefore, propose to take away an existing source! of taxation which the States Cxovernments have in respect of the direct taxation of land, and they also propose to take from the States Governments a great deal of the revenue which they at present receive from indirect taxation in the shape of Customs and Excise duties on tobacco. I should like to know whether the tobacco monopolyis the policy of the alliance on the other side. We were told that it was going to be considered in a few months. The honourable member for Bland told us that his Government would introduce a measure next session to take over the manufacture and sale of tobacco and make it a national monopoly. I ask the honourable and learned member for Indi, as I have asked him before, what is his attitude upon this question? What is the attitude of the "" ragged regiment "" upon it? Is the fragment of the Protectionist Party which is joined to the Labour Partygoing to swallow the proposal for a national monopoly in this or in any other trade? It is a matter upon which the people require and deserve enlightenment. There is a great deal more in it than the establishment of a national industry. It means a definite march forward on the road to Socialism. The leader of the Opposition has recently told us that the policy of his party was one step at a time. They are going to monopolize the wholesale trade first, and the retail trade afterwards, and thus gradually nationalize all industries. We therefore desire to know whether the seceding protectionists are in favour of the establishment of a Government monopoly in tobacco.",57
487,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is not irrigation a step on the road to agricultural Socialism?,57
488,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall be able to show the honourable member, from an irret futable source-the organizer paid by these gentlemen to go round the country, Mr. Thomas Mann-that that is not so. If the .Commonwealth is going to impose a land tax, and to obtain the profits arising from the nationalization of the tobacco industry, its expenditure will go up by leaps and bounds, and prodigality and extravagance will result. We know what happened in New South Wales after the imposition of the Federal Tariff. There a prodigal Government, which lived solely by the breath of the Labour Party, in two or three years wasted millions of pounds of public money. The coffers of the Treasury were filled by the duties returned by the Federation, and in. addition money was recklessly borrowed and extravagantly spent. There was no remission of taxation; but the rate of borrowing which prevailed when the present Prims Minister was in office in that State was doubled or trebled, and the expenditure ot the State went up by leaps and bounds. The Government then in power in New South Wales during its whole existence held office at the pleasure of the Laboui Party, which could at any moment have stopped the borrowing. The members of the party in this Chamber prate about being opposed to borrowing; but when in New South Wales the Labour Party had power to stop it, no party could have been more regardless of the profligate expenditure of borrowed money.",57
489,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Labour Party in this Parliament is a different party from that in the New South Wales Parliament.,58
490,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is the same political party. Its existence is due to the same political organizations, and to the same wire-pulling.",58
491,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member ought to know a little about wire-pulling.,58
492,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have seen some wire pulling on the other side. I saw some of it in connection with one honourable and gallant member, who challenged me to mortal combat this afternoon. In regard to that matter, if I am allowed the privilege of the challenged party, and have the right to chose the weapons, I shall defend myself against him with a squirt. Were there no wires pulled in connection with the honourable and learned member's vote upon the question of political unions? The majority of the late Government was reduced to one on that occasion.",58
493,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,-No wires were pulled.,58
494,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Government needed all the wire-pulling that could possibly be indulged in then, and we saw Ministers of the Crown openly and flagrantly engaging in that occupation.",58
495,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member does not know anything about it.,58
496,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member ought to be the last to interject. In connection with the debates upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, he made a number of interjections, which showed he was thoroughly in sympathy with' the amendment proposed by the present Minister of Defence; but at the last moment he cast his vote against it.",58
497,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member has made that statement before, but it is not correct.",58
498,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is correct.,58
499,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member cannot find any record of it in Hansard.,58
500,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Anothe r point on which the electors require to be enlightened is the banking policy of the late Government. At page 1284 of Hansard, Mr. Watson is reported to have saidWe intend to introduce during next session a Banking Bill , dealing particularly with the note issue, and containing, certainly, a section on the lines of the Canadian provision, that insists upon 40 per cent, of the cash reserves of the banks being held in Government notes. That is a most important proposal, and one which we shall be entitled to discuss at the forthcoming election. It is also a subject upon which a great deal of light requires to be thrown. The proposal was that they should be empowered to go to the banks and take from their reserves j£8,ooo,ooo in sovereigns and bullion, and put down inconvertible and unpresentable notes in their place. In the Senate last week, Senator de Largie declared that that was a proper proposal to make. Mr HU ME COOK - Has it ever been made anywhere else?",58
501,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is referring to the precedent of Canada, which has absolutely no application to our circumstances. If he took the trouble to read the statistics showing the amount - of banking reserves held in Canada at that time, and the condition of Canadian banking, and considered the possibilities of the Canadian banks holding their gold reserves a few miles away in New York, he would understand that the conditions there and here are totally dissimilar.",58
502,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The banks gladly cepted the Government securities at the of the banking crisis.,59
503,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wish honourable members to consider this position. At the time of the banking crisis in 1893, about £ . 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or ,£3,000,000 was from the banks within a very short - upon time. Many of us know what that distrust, meant. It involved - the closing many of the banks and financial in- stitutions, and resulted in the forced realization of many securities, the selling up of many a farmer in the country districts, bankruptcy of many a storekeeper in towns, and ruin and disaster all round. Does the honourable member for Bourke suppose that ,£8,000,000 could be forcibly extracted from the coffers of the banks without ing about disaster? Does he think the banks would part with ,£8,000,000 coin and take I.O.U.'s in exchange, without a run upon the banks resulting, and bringing disaster in its train? Does he imagine banks. that the bank reserves are kept to look at. Can he not see that this large money is kept in the coffers of the because it is absolutely essential for purpose of carrying on banking and cur95 rency operations?",59
504,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The banks were ready enough to accept the Government proved. I.O.U.'s at the time of the crisis.,59
505,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am not aware that the Victorian banks received any assistance from the Government at that time.,59
506,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They got assistance from the New South Wales banks, which ha'd the Government's I.O.U.",59
507,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Onl y to the extent that for a few months their notes were made inconvertible.,59
508,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"More than that. honourable and learned member is quite wrong. _ Mr ROBINSON - In Victoria the banks did not receive any support from the Governwould ment, beyond the fact that they were told that they could have a holiday extending over five days.",59
509,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,And they were glad have it.,59
510,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable learned member makes an interjection that is quite worthy of him, because it is casuistical. The banks did not take advanof tage of the offer of the Government. The Union Bank, the Bank of Australasia, and the Bank of New South Wales did not want acthe holiday. They kept their doors open time throughout"", and told the public that they could go on drawing till they were tired.",59
511,Mr HIGGINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Six of the leading banks did take advantage of the holiday.,59
512,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"So far from the offer drawn of the Government conferring any benefit the banks, it only increased the public and accentuated the run that was of causing some institutions to totter.",59
513,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The banks accepted Government assistance in New South Wales.,59
514,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The assistance in the that case took the form of making the bank the notes inconvertible for a few months.,59
515,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Government did more than that. What about the Treasury notes?,59
516,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Some Treasury notes bringwere put out, and the issue of Treasury that notes in the present case is to form the preof text for appropriating £8,000,000 of the bank reserves. The proposal involves a direct and unmitigated spoliation of the",59
517,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The banks already pay for sum of the privilege of issuing notes. banks . Mr ROBINSON - Exactly ; they pay a the note tax that mops up from 90 per cent, to per cent, of the profits arising from the issue.",59
518,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,That has never been,59
519,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It has been proved, and the fact could be demonstrated to the honourable member if he had the capacity to understand the statistics upon the question. When money could be obtained at 3 per cent., the banks were paying a note tax of 2 per cent., and, in addition, had to bear all the printing and other incidental expenses. It can be seen, therefore, that their margin of profit was a very small one. Now that money is a little dearer, their profit The may be slightly higher. If it be desired to make the banks contribute a little more to the Treasury, the note tax could be increased by 1 per cent, or \ per cent. That be a straightforward method of dealing, but it would not be fair to go to the banks and demand from them money, that belongs to the people Of the Commonwealth. to The States have a large number of loans to convert very shortly. Within the next six and or seven years, loans, amounting to £20,000,000, will mature, and will have to so be renewed. What prospect shall we have a successful conversion of these loans in the markets of the old world if our financial institutions are made the subject of a policy of the kind proposed. Two or three of the large banks have their head offices in London, and we could scarcely expect the financiers of the old world to permit us to renew our indebtedness if we deliberately robbed our banks of their reserves. The renewal of our loans would be practically impossible. The States securities would be' depreciated - in every shape and form, and the Treasurers would be confronted with enormous difficulties in their endeavours to arrange matters upon a sound footing.  and orphans of Victoria?",59
520,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Perhaps the honourable member knows; I do not.  stitutions.,60
521,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"This , then, is the banking policy of the late Administration. I suppose we may gather, from the silence of the "" ragged regiment,"" that they also are prepared to swallow the labour policy in regard to that matter, and to join in an attempt to take £8,000,000 in sovereigns or bullion from the coffers of the banks of the Commonwealth. Any such attempt must necessarily mean increased difficulty to the States Governments if they wish to convert their own loans, whilst on the other hand it must greatly hamper the efforts of the Federal Treasurer to consolidate and convert the States debts. A few days ago I asked a question which I desire to repeat on the present occasion, because it is most important to my constituency, and also to others. I desire to know what is the policy of the alliance in respect to the inclusion or otherwise of the farmers in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill?",60
522,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,To which alliance does the honourable and learned member refer?,60
523,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"To that which is now endeavouring to dislodge the present Government. When I submitted my amendment in favour of exempting agriculturists from the operation of that Bill, the present leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, is reported in Hansard, page 1917, to have saidThe Government will oppose the amendment by every means within their power. They did oppose it in a straightforward way by every means in their power, because they believed, and still believe, that the agricultural industry should be brought within the scope of that measure. They believe in regulating the hours, wages, and the conditions of employment upon farms, just as they do in prescribing them for industries conducted in cities. On the other hand, I see a very wide difference between the huge aggregation of capital, and the employment of a large number of men under one roof in a city industry, and. Ithe farming industry, which in the vast majority of cases is a family industry. But there were two or three seceding protectionists who voted with us. upon that occasion.",60
524,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,""" Seceding protectionists ?""",60
525,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes . Perhaps if I say seceders from the leader of the Protectionist Party, I shall meet the views of the purist for Melbourne Ports. There were four or five protectionists, or at the very most seven, who voted with vis upon that particular amendment. Those honourable members, therefore, constitute only about one-fifth of the alliance party. Under such circumstances, what possible hope is there that the farmers of the Commonwealth will be exempted from the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, should the alliance come into power? We know perfectly well that the honourable member for Bland is not likely to deviate one iota from the policy which he has previously laid down in this respect. I should like to know whether that is not so?",60
526,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall be replying in a day or two, I suppose.",60
527,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should like to know the views of the honourable and learned member for Indi, who was good enough to pair in favour of ray amendment .",60
528,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member should manufacture a policy for the Government, not for the Opposition.",60
529,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that I am in a position to sum up for the benefit of the producers, the socialistic policy of the Opposition.",60
530,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The producers are always asking for Socialism, so that they ought to be satisfied.",60
531,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that policy may be summed up under four headings. The first is, a Federal land tax; the second, decreased States revenues as the result of the establishment of a Government tobacco monopoly; the third, bank spoliation; and the fourth, the inclusion of farmers within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. These headings, I think, fairly and accurately represent the policy of the Socialist Party, because I have already shown that their chosen representatives have advocated Federal land taxation, whilst we know from the honourable member for Bland himself that he is in favour of the establishment of a Government tobacco monopoly, of taking over £8,000,000 worth of reserves from the banks, and of bringing the farmers under the operation of the measure to which I have referred.",60
532,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do not the farmers believe in a Government Bank?,61
533,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,", shall deal with that matter in a few moments. The programme of the present Administration, when contrasted with that of the Opposition, is good enough for me as a country representative. It is true that there may be points upbn which I should prefer the Ministry to act differently, but I have no hesitation in supporting their policy, and I believe that the electors of every country constituency will record their votes in favour of it, as opposed to the policy of the Labour Party. Upon the political side, I enter my emphatic protest against caucus, or machine politics. I do not wish to repeat the two apt quotations which I made on a former occasion from speeches by the honourable member for Bourke and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. All I desire to say is that one of those gentleman has declared the policy of the labour caucus to be "" worthy of Tammanv Hall, or Russia,"" whilst the other has described it as ""a fraud."" As was pointed out by one of them, the successful candidates of that body are practically nominated by twenty or thirty wirepullers.",61
534,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who pulled the wires in the case of the Wannon election?,61
535,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not know.,61
536,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I know something about it.,61
537,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I took it as the greatest compliment in my life when the former representative for Wannon personally waited upon me, and asked me to contest that election. I never felt so proud as when he came to my office and requested me to become a candidate.",61
538,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was not the only wire which was pulled. Mr HU ME COOK - There were better wires than that. Will the honourable and learned member tell us about them?,61
539,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Eve n Federal Ministers are not free agents in this House. Looking through that very interesting publication called the Tocsin, a copy of which I endeavour to secure each week, I find a full statement of the labour pledge.",61
540,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Tocsin! Is that a poison for rabbits?,61
541,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is Rough on Rats 1,61
542,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I find this clause in the labour pledgeNo member of the Federal Labour Party shall accept office in the Federal Government except with the consent of a duly constituted caucus meeting. That is a proviso which, in my opinion, is directly subversive of Ministerial responsibility. It is directly subversive of the policy of responsible government, as we know it to exist in Great Britain and elsewhere, where the Prime Minister selects as his colleagues those who are best fitted to take office. The labour pledge provides that the membeis of the party shall not take office without the consent of the caucus, and therefore they are bound hand and foot in that respect.",61
543,Mr CULPIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,61
544,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,Giv e us the Reform League pledge.,61
545,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have never signed a Reform League pledge, nor have I seen one. Like the honourable member for Bourke, I do not believe in pledges. That was the position which he took up at the last geneial election, but I do not know what will happen at the next. Judging by a statement that I saw in last week's issue of the Tocsin, he will have to be in favour of pledges. A well known member of the Western Australian Parliament, Mr. Walter James, who was in this Chamber a little time ago, appropriately described the Labour Party platform, by saying that it consisted of 25 per cent/ of practical politics, and 75 per cent, of bird lime. The pioiected alliance is the bird lime which is going to snare the honourable member for Bourke, and one or two others on the Opposition side",61
546,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Government platform consists of 95 per cent, of bird lime, and 5 per cent, of theory.",61
547,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I'mus t ask my honourable friend, who has been silent during the last few hours, to restrain himself. I think it will be found that the alliance is after all merely bird lime, and that those honourable members who think by resorting to this little game to secure themselves from the opposition of labour candidates will sooner or later be very rudely disturbed. An article which appeared in the issue of the Tocsin-the selected organ, I believe, of the Political Labour Council of Victoria-of 19th May last, when there was a projected coalition between the' Labour Party and some honourable members opposite, contained the following statement:Although the proffered terms",61
548,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was to be an alliance with the whole Protectionist Party.,62
549,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Well , I will say the! whole party. . Mr HUME COOK - The honourable and learned member ought to be accurate.",62
550,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In this article it was stated thatAlthough the proffered terms of coalition only be surmised, we may safely assume that condition would be the withdrawal of all opposistrain, tion to Liberal candidates at the next election, the self evident effect of which would be to prevent an increase of Labour representaNorthern tion. . . . That was the surmise which the Tocsin formed as to the terms of the coalition jected in May last. There is a similar proSocialist. viso in regard to freedom from opposition in the present alliance agreement. The article from which I h'ave quoted went 1 to state with reference to the Watson Government thatTheir power to promote the nation's interest and advance the people's cause, would be ously discounted if associated with Ministers ported by members whose policy differed materi Mr. ally from, even if it did not directly conflict that unanimously endorsed by labourites. In that case the Tocsin opposed the projected coalition or alliance, while in last man. week's issue of that newspaper, which I unfortunately forgot to bring with me this evening, it was stated in the most definite and unmistakable terms that no alliance was going to prevent the labour leagues, i was so desired, from opposing those joined with the party. I also saw a report of a recent meeting, at which the honourable member for Yarra was'present, and at a resolution was carried stating, in effect, him. that the alliance did not mean that those who joined with the Labour Party for particular purpose would be protected a labour attack at the next election. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - The honourable and learned member will see when the next elections come round.",62
551,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Surely the honourable and learned member is not worrying about us.,62
552,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"This is the bird lime, and those who are now allying themselves with the Labour Party will have to enter the labour cage and be chained, or their political necks will be wrung without the slightest compunction.",62
553,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why worry about us? The honourable and learned member should look after himself.,62
554,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not worrying about the honourable member; I am merely showing what is the effect of machine politics. Machine politics must be detrimental in their effect, and I am sure that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports shares that view with me.",62
555,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do not worry over us.,62
556,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I object to the industrial part of the Labour Party's procan gramme, because it is a policy of clear and one distinct Socialism. In a would be jocular the honourable member for Bland and general the honourable and learned member for Melbourne have referred to the position of the farmer, saying that he and every one else who asks for Government prointerference in any shape or form is a I propose to disprove that statement in the most conclusive fashion.",62
557,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and on learned member is modest as usual.,62
558,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,He must think that he is in Court.,62
559,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have here a quotaruintion from a book entitled The Labour Movesupment in Both Hemispheres. The author is Tom Mann, the accredited organizer of with, the Victorian Political Labour Council and of the Trades Hall. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A mighty good",62
560,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the Labour Party do not like him to be quoted in this House. He is all right on the Yarra bank.,62

562,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not know him. Mr HUGHES. - It does not pay the right which honourable gentleman sometimes to know,62
563,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Le t me show how this clearly and convincingly Mr Mann deals from with this question. He says- ' Let there be no mistake. I do not mean vague expressions of a desire to see the worker well cared for, or a willingness to municipalize gas, water, electricity, transit, & c , plus an occasional endorsement of State action in matters formerly confined to private enterprise. All this amounts to very little indeed unless such measures are used as so many steps towards the realization of the collectivist State. By a collectivist State I mean a State wherein there will be no room for any private receiver of rent, interest, or profit",62
564,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Dr Clifford says exactly the same thing. - Mr ROBINSON - The writer ceedswhere the total work to be done will be rightly apportioned over the total number to do it ; and, therefore, a State where all able-bodied persons will be called upon to do a share of work.",63
565,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Charles Kingsley says the same thing.,63
566,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,No rent to be paid for 66 Bourke-street.,63
567,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order . I recognise that in a debate of this kind latitude must be allowed to honourable members. I have allowed that increased latitude throughout the debate, but it seems to me that since the honourable and learned member for Wannon has been addressing the Chair, and on one or two other occaminutes sions today, the liberty to interject has abused. Honourable members interject be repeated. again and again, and several have been interjecting at the one time, thus rendering it almost impossible for the honourable and learned member who has been addressing the Chair to give expression to his opinions. I ask honourable members in the first place to restrain themselves, and if for the ment they forget to do so, when I call House to order, that immediate obresults servance of the Standing Orders which tween all sections of the people. is necessary must be rendered, otherwise they propose to attain that result ? I shall be driven to the very unpleasant duty of naming honourable members.",63
568,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Mr Tom Mann gives a quotation from the Fabian Essays to make his meaning absolutely' clear, and it absolutely touches the point that we are me, I will do so. now debatingAlthough Socialism involves State control, control does not imply Socialism-at least in any modern meaning of the term. It is not so much to the .thing which the State does as to the end for which it does it that we must look before we can decide whether it is a Socialist State or not. Socialism is the common holding of the means of production and exchange, and the holding of them for the equal benefit of all. "" Equal benefit of all "" - of the skilful and the unskilful, of the industrious and the slothful. In the Tocsin of the 4th February last, Mr Tom Mann published a signed article, in which he saidThe fight will be for labour all over the State; the goal, a ""co-operative Commonwealth,"" i.e., a Socialistic State. There must be no time wasted over those who "" are as good as labour men,"" and the labour man who is not a collectivist had better be well advised and hurry up and learn his lesson correctly, as in a short time there will be no room in the Victorian Labour Party for any one unable to appreciate, endorse, and work for what is already known, and in every other country declared to be the workers' hope, viz., Socialism, full fledged pro- without equivocation, or deviation or minimizing from what has been clearly and definitely avowed by the more intelligent of the workers of the world any time this twenty years. There is the doctrine of l h at party- a doctrine of straight-out Socialism, a Socialism which seeEs to take over every industry in the Commonwealth, and to apportion the returns from those industries equally among all sections of the community.",63
569,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That doctrine was preached a little extra 1900 years ago. Mr KING O'MALLEY -2,00 0 years ago. M i . SPEAKER - I am sorry to have to name the honourable member for Darwin and the honourable member for Yarra, both having transgressed within a very few the rule which I laid down just now. been I hope that the breach of the rule will not",63
570,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That proves conclusively out of the mouths of the Socialists themselves that they know the difference between State control or State interference in various matters, and a socialistic State. The Socialists want to take over the whole moof the industries of the Commonwealth of the every shape and form and apportion the from those industries equally beHow do My esteemed leader quoted last night from the Brisbane Worker. It was a very effective quotation, but there was another portion of that same paper, which, I think, he might have quoted, and if he will pardon It is this: In the political manifesto formulated by the general council of the A . L . F . in 1890 it is deState clared "" That the present industrial system, commonly called the competitive system, is destructive, pernicious, and altogether evil, and must be replaced by a social system which will not leave it to the power of one man to take advantage of the necessities or disabilities of another, and which will provide for all workers opportunity to avail themselves of the bounties of nature, and to partake full y of the fruits of civilization, and fb receive the full benefit of their share of the common toil."" That declaration still points the way to labour's goal . . . The ballot is in our hands . . . Extend the functions of collective effort, State and municipal; narrow the domain of private enterprise and individual greed. By leaps and bounds, if possible, little by little, if it must be so, but somehow-al l the time. Taking all we can for the people, and giving as little as we can-that is how the co-operative Commonwealth will finally be brought to pass. Taking all and giving as little as possible - payin g as little as possible for what a man has justly acquired ! Then it goes to say-and I would especially bring this passage under the notice of honourable membersUnless, indeed, the robbers, made desperate by threatened dispossession, should sterner courses. That is a threat of this party, that if those who are already in possession of wealth, by legal and moral means, should resort to other methods of resistance, repressive action - is to be taken against them. Therefore I contend that there is between us a clear-cut. issue, which an honourable member upon this side of the House can accept with a light heart. It is an issue which sets us against a socialistic State, established by spoliation in every shape and form, a direct attack by spoliation on the banks, a-repression of State activities, with possibly an impoverishment of the States by taking away from them some of the sources of taxation which they now possess, and a bringing of the great producing interests-which have to face the competition of the world-under the hard and fast rule of an Arbitration Court. I say again that that issue is, to my mind, clear-cut, and it is an issue which I, for one, shall have no hesitation in facing. If we are to have an election, as has been promised, let us see that this question is put fully and clearly, before the people. Let not my honourable friends on the Opposition benches flinch from their proposals. Let them not flinch from proposing a Federal land tax, from taking £8,000,000 of money from the banks, from bringing the farmers into the Arbitration Court, from depriving the States of the revenue from the tobacco trade. Those four proposals alone are good enough for us to work on, and when we see that these particular proposals are only steps in the direction of a co-operative Commonwealth, or socialistic State, I do not think we have anything to' fear from our electors. On that matter, I should like to read a remark which was made by the honourable member for Bland. Honourable members will' recollect that we had a May Day demonstration in Victoria, apd that certain resolutions were passed. The movers and supporters of those resolutions went to the honourable member for Bland, while he was Prime Minister, and presented them to him in the usual way. He made one of his tactful speeches to this deputation, who desired that all the instruments of industry Mr Robinson. on should be owned and controlled by the like to whole of the people. He saidWe have ticked off certain definite proposals which we have recommended to the people, and each of these, being a step in advance of the last, is always carrying us forward, and clearing the provoke the way for still another step. Clearing the way for yet another step-for that co-operative Commonwealth, that socialistic State, which these gentlemen advocated on May Day, and do advocate on the platform and in the press ! Therefore, the position which I must take up, as one who believes in individualism and enterprise, is clear. And I believe that Australia is one of the brightest examples of what individual effort can do-becaus e without individual effort this countiy would never have been colonized at all, the pioneers would never have cleared the forests, the farms would never have been laid out, and the' cities would never have been built. As one who believes in individual effort, I say that those who agree with me must be in diametrical opposition to the Socialist Party, and its programme, as outlined by its authorized leaders. Mi. HUGHES - B y way of personal explanation, I wish to say that I am informed that in the early part of to-days sitting ! the Prime Minister made' a personal explanation in reference to the statement which I made last evening in relation to six potters who were employed by a man in Sydney, and who were brought here in contravention of certain of the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. I have had an opportunity afforded me by the right honourable gentleman to peruse his remarks, and I notice that he says that he sent word of his intention to make this explanation to me. I can only say that I never received any word from him.",63
571,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I left word with two honourable members, who said they would try to find the honourable and learned member. He was not here.",64
572,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What I intended to say last night, and what I think I did clearly say was this : I was quoting a statement made by the right honourable gentleman, at a public meeting, regarding the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act, which, he said, allows a. respectable working man from England to be kept pn board ship a prisoner on reaching the shores of Australia. He declared that he would take that section out of the Act, if he had the power. I was pointing out that the right honourable gentleman had an oppoitunity to do this, 'or something similar to this, immediately ""on his coming into office, and that as a matter of fact there was now, under this particular section, a prosecution ordered. The right honourable gentleman says that I deliberately made a different statement outside to the press. But if I did, it shows clearly enough that I wanted to be perfectly fair in the matter, because I at once gave all the information in my possession to the press, and it appeared concurrently with the remarks I made in the House.",64
573,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,There is a difference between the two statements. It would have been better to have had that information in the same document. Hansard is not the Age.,65
574,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The information I gave appeared today in a morning paper, side by side, I presume, with the right honourable gentleman's remarks. I say most emphatically that my statement was clearthe reference was unambiguous. the right honourable gentleman gave instructions to prosecute or not is quite immaterial. The fact was that on the 18th 'August he came into power, and on the 21 st September he said he had not seen the papers. All I have to say is that that is not my fault, but his; he had ample opportunity to see the papers, and to take any steps he pleased to alter or undo anything that had been done. We are to assume that he came into power to restore responsible government; but what the right honourable gentleman does now is to say that I did this, and that therefore he takes no responsibility. T think that under the circumstances, his explanation does not affect the situation at all, because he very well knows that, though he is endeavouring to show that, it was I , and not he, who took action, he, as Minister for External Affairs, has now to take the whole responsibility. The whole of the responsibility is on the shoulders of the Government of the day. The right honourable gentleman knows very well that it is possible"" for him now to give instructions that would cause all this business under the section of the Act to cease. In the circumstances I am very much astonished at the right honourable gentleman taking exception saddled with responsibility action. He said most deliberately that if he had an opportunity he would take the section out of the Act, and that he wouldj administer the Act in his own way. And now he practically continues the administration of his predecessors, whom he denounced and declared to be dangerous to responsible government, and endeavours to crawl out of his responsibility by saying that he had not seen the papers.",65
575,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should like to say that I did not complain of the words the honourable and learned member has just quoted, but I complained of the following words which are in Hansard, and which he has corrected :The Prime Minister has declared himself against the policy of a White Australia. But I ask him what he is going to do, not in the matter of the six hatters, but in the matter of six potters, whom he is now prosecuting in Sydney. I also wish to direct attention to the words. . . . under the regime of the right honourable gentleman, instructions have been given to the Solicitor-General of New South Wales to file against the man who brought them here an information. . . . That is referring to an order given by the Whether honourable and learned member himself. FurtherYet the right honourable gentleman now proposes to deport these six unfortunate potters-at any rate here is a slight recoverythat could be done under this section-and to imprison the unfortunate man who brought them here-to paralyze his industry, and drive out our own flesh and blood. The honourable and learned member's own action.",65
576,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Undoubtedly ; an action which the right honourable gentleman endorsed.,65
577,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then further, there are the wordsThe right honourable gentleman is pledged on this question. "" If I have an opportunity,"" he said, "" I will strike this iniquitous section out of the Act,"" and the first thing he does, when he has the opportunity, is to give instructions for a prosecution under it. That is not true.",65
578,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is true.,65
579,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,What ?,65
580,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the right honourable gentleman endorse what I had done?,65
581,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall leave the matter at that; the words are sufficient for the public to being . . . . and the first thing he does, when he for his has the opportunity, is to give instructions for a prosecution under it. I want to add the following, which the honourable and learned member is reported in Hansard to have said :The right honourable gentleman not only gives orders for a prosecution under the Act, but he says, "" I am now with men who believe in this Act, and I am not going to say one word against it any more."" Does the honourable and learned member see that he represents me as having given orders for a prosecution under the Act ? . The honourable and learned member knows what; orders for a prosecution are. May I suggest that the honourable and learned member corrected the report in Hansard, in order to make it say that I prosecuted? I have the correction of the honourable and learned member. I could not see the proof until the honourable and learned member had corrected it ; but as in type at first it read But I ask him what he is going to do, not in the matter of the six hatters, but in the matter of six potters, against whom he is now levying an indictment in Sydney. The honourable and learned member took out the words "" against'' and "" levying an indictment,"" and put in the word ""prosecuting.""",65
582,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall read standing order 60, which governs the matter of a personal explanation. It is as follows: A member who has spoken to a question may again be heard, to explain himself in regard to some material part of his speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood, but shall not introduce any new matter, or interrupt any member in possession of the chair, and no debatable matter shall be brought forward or debate arise upon such explanation. It would 'be quite impossible for me, under that standing order, to allow a debate to arise on the question. Whether the remarks which the right honourable the Prime Minister has made are in the nature of a debate I am not quite sure; I am not certain they are not. But whether .'they are or not, I am certain that any further remarks, either by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney or any other honourable member, on the question would be in the nature of a debate, and therefore I cannot permit further remarks to be made.",66
583,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"May I point out, Mr. Speaker, that you very properly allowed the Prime Minister to explain a second time, and if the honourable and learned member for West Sydney desires to make any further explanation in regard to the statement just made by the Prime Minister it would be only proper to allow him to do so.",66
584,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am quite sure the Standing Orders would support me in permitting what is fair, but I point out that now each honourable member has had two opportunities to make a statement. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney made a statement yesterday, and' another this evening; and the Prime Minister made a statement shortly after half past two o'clock, and has now added some words to that. So that if I prevent any further debate, as the standing order requires me to do at this present stage, I shall not have dealt unfairly with either honourable member.",66
585,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I only wish to make a reference to the statement by the Prime : i - Minister that I altered the unrevised proof by striking out the words "" levying an indictment "" and inserting ""prosecuting."" I do not deny that I did so; but I ask the right honourable gentleman, as a lawyer, whether the alteration makes any real difference. I merely wish to say that in my opinion the alteration makes no differencethat the gravamen of 'the whole question is whether he is responsible for the prosecution or indictment or not. Under the circumstances I can say no more.",66
586,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF," I rise to take part in this debate with a feeling,' which I dare say is shared by many honourable members, that our methods of government are not by any means an unqualified success. Apart altogether from the regrettable bitterness which is now being introduced into our parliamentary debates, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, I think the fact that we shall shortly have had three Governments displaced in the course of a few months is an achievement of which none of us are in the least degree proud. It seems to indicate that, after all, this system of party government is very short of an ideal one, and I believe that the people of the Commonwealth have reason to cast about for some definite improvement. I have given some consideration to this aspect of the question, and have come to the conclusion that reform is very urgently needed. The most practical and advantageous reform would be to adopt the system of electing our Ministries. I know that to suggest the adoption of such a system to the old parliamentary hands, is to have it poohpoohed as impracticable, as leading to all sorts of intrigues, and as open to criticism in many other respects. But it is no new thing. It has been in operation in Switzerland for some considerable time, and I believe that it could with advantage be adopted in Australia. We adopt that system in the selection of our Speaker, and I feel sure that, if we used it in connection with the selection of our Ministers, we should obtain equallv pood results. In making Ministers responsible for administration, and the Parliament as a whole responsible for policy, we should be adopting a system which would lead to the expedition of public business, and would do away with a good imany of the objectionable features of the present method of Government. In connection with this debate, I find myself in a very unpleasant position. I have the conviction that what is regarded as a minor issue, is more important than the general question which we are debating, and, to my mind, the minor issue involves the progress of the movement to which I belong. In discussing this matter, I am in antagonism to the majority of the members of my party, which is at all times an unpleasant situation, and I feel the position very keenly, because on every other occasion I have been able to act harmoniously with the majority. It is only because the particular matter at issue between us appear.^ to me to be so important that I am obliged to deal with it to-night as incidental to the larger question which we are discussing. It is, of course, well enough known that I have taken up a definite attitude on the quest 'on as to whether the Labour Party should or should not enter into an alliance with some other party, and, as generally follows when one who is in the minority takes up such an attitude, all sorts of objectionable and despicable reasons have been assigned for my action. It has been said that I am a disappointed office-seeker, and that I am a free-trader first and a labour man afterwards ; hence my attitude on this matter. So far as the first charge is concerned, I - do not intend to traverse it . I am satisfied to leave a contemptible slander of that kind to be dealt with by members of this House, and especially by those who have been longest associated with me. Although an insinuation of that kind is sometimes very useful to close the mouth of a guilty person or of a coward, I am determined, in spite of it, to perform to-night a duty which I feel I owe to my electors and to the labour voters throughout the Commonwealth. I feel confident that every member of the party with which I have had the honour to be associated since the inception of Federation will give the lie to the charge that I am a free-trader first - and' a labour man afterwards. No member of that party has more anxiously endeavoured to place the fiscal issue in its true relation to labour politics than I have, and I think that before I proceed much further I shall be able to show that I am still true to the position which I have hitherto occupied in relation to that much-vexed question which has caused so much trouble in the labour movement, and which we are now beginning to get past. I am glad to say that I do not stand alone in connection with this particular matter. Protectionists and free-traders alike have united to do their best to oppose the so-called alliance. It has, therefore, nothing to do with the fiscal issue. A little while ago I felt obliged to enter my protest against the action of the party, and I shall read it now as an indication of the attitude which I took up, and also as giving 1 the basis of my objections to the alliance: Melbourne, 10th September, 1904. To the Hon. Secretary, Federal Labour Party. Dear Sir, As I shall be unable to be present at the meeting on Wednesday, 1 desire to enter my protest in writing, against the alliance which has been veriy entered into, with a section of so-called Liberals. A few weeks ago, our party carried unanimously a refusal to entertain an alliance of a similar kind. None of the majority of the Labour Party, who have since voted for the present alliance, have shown any justification for this remarkable - change of front. As one of the minority, I contend that no majority, however large, has any right or power to force upon a single dissentient such a serious innovation, for which no authority exists either in the platform or in any resolutions of Conference. In any case, such a new departure in policy should not have been made until the labour organizations and labour electors of the Commonwealth had been placed in possession of the proposals, and had been given reasonable time to consider them. It has been a very general conviction, even outside labour ranks, that our movement contained within itself elements of popularity which, in conjunction with the democratic Federal Constitution, assured ultimate success. ' We have already arrived within easy reach of a straight out labour majority, and the movement should not at this juncture have been practically j>laced in the hands of a few outsiders, some of whom have been amongst the bitterest critics and traducers of labour men and labour methods. Therefore, holding, as I do, that the action of the majority of the Federal Labour Party in entering into this alliance is hasty, unauthorized, and contrary to the interests of the labour movement, I entirely repudiate the said action, and refuse allegiance to the Liberal-Labour alliance, or any section of it as such. Finally, as the affairs of labour, in connection with Federal politics have reached a stage when further public silence would only facilitate the ruin of the movement, I propose to publish this protest, and also hold myself free to take any further action which the interests of the labour movement may require.",66
587,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,A proper and independent stand to take.,68
588,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,At any rate it throws a great deal of daylight upon the subject.,68
589,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I may be charged with playing into the hands of my political opponents. Necessarily I must abide by such a charge; but I feel sure that those who have the interests of the labour movement at heart will acquit me of any such intention, and will recognise with me the necessity for plain spe'aking at a serious crisis like the present.",68
590,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear. We can appreciate honesty on any side.",68
591,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I feel sure that in doing this I am performing a duty which I owe to the labour movement, and as I have already indicated, I intend to conscientiously carry out the policy which I have deliberately adopted, and by every means in my power prevent even the appearance of an alliance which, I am sure, is fraught with no good to the movement in which I am interested. As regards the charge that I am a free-trader first, and a labour man afterwards, I have yet another indication to show that the charge is false. honourable and learned member for Indi has placed on the business paper a notice of motion proposing the appointment of a Commission to investigate the fiscal issue. I am willing to vote for that motion, and I go even further. I tell the honourable and learned member, the House, and the country, that if the investigations of the Commission show that any particular trade is not parasitical, that it is not living on others, and that the workers in it are being unduly exploited by outside competition, and particularly by cheap labour, I shall concede to if and to them the utmost protection required. 1 .  dorse that?",68
592,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that the honourable member for Perth will exercise his judgment wisely on the facts, and I , like him, shall look at the facts.",68
593,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think that I have shown conclusively that the fiscal issue plays no part in my objection to the proposed alliance.,68
594,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Has the honourable member pledged himself to a revision of the Tariff in a protectionist sense, before the Commission is appointed?",68
595,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Certainl y not. I have pledged myself to a very definite line of action, and I am piepared to carry out that pledge. I have mentioned the matter as proof of my bona fides in connection with my objection to an alliance which appears to me to be contrary to both the policy and the [principles of the Jabourj movement, ancl especially of the Federal labour movement. I am willing enough to admit that in connection with State politics, alliances of the kind suggested may be necessary, and even desirable. In some of the States the labour movement is confronted with what are at present insurmountable obstacles, and as the movement must progiess, if it cannot get over the obstacles, it is perfectly legitimate and propei to go round them. If the members of a State Labour Party find others, like themselves, anxious to get round a particular obstacle which they cannot surmount, I think that they will be acting wisely in uniting their forces, so that each may arrive at their common goal, and, having got there, proceed on their several ways. But in Federal politics there is no need for any alliance of the kind. We have an absolutelv democratic franchise, and a Constitution which, The if not absolutely democratic, at least gives us two Houses which are thoroughly amenable to popular influence. With those conditions we have the entire basis of any action which a Labour Party ought to take. We are, under these circumstances, in a position to win our way rapidly, so long as we adhere strictly to our principles. I take it that even at the present time we are well within reach .of that state of affairs which has been so anxiously hoped for and worked for- a straight-out labour majority in the Federal Parliament. It appears to me nothing short of fatuousness for the party to suddenly swerve at this particular juncture from the well defined policy, enunciated time and again by the 1 leading members of the party in this House, and in another place, that there should be no alliance. It is to me incomprehensible that in view of those statements, which have been repeatedly made, and in view of the success which we all hope to attain within a very short space of time, we should join hands with a few gentlemen who, however amiable, are by no means going our way. So far as the motion is concerned I am quite at one wjith the honourable member for Bland, in my desire to fight Conservatism. I have always opposed Conservatism, and from the time. I was able to form anything like an opinion upon political matters my mental trend has been in the direction of Socialism. I am not afraid of the antiit. socialistic agitation. On the very first platof form I occupied, when I entered upon the Federal campaign, I avowed myself a Socialist, and I have never concealed the fact that I believe in Socialism. other hand, I have done all in my power to advance that movement, which, I believe, makes for the betterment and happiness mankind in general.",68
596,Mr JOSEPH ICOOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is the honortramway able member's particular brand of Socialemployes ism?,69
597,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I can readily see that it is something different from that of the honourable member, which has been so much refined away that a microscope would to be used to discover it. In Western Ausover tralia we are not afraid of Socialism. Even the right honourable member for Swan, who, in theory, is violently opposed to Socialism, is, like many other good men, better than his words, and has been a zealous worker the cause, with the very happiest results the State. Take, for instance, the 1C00Isury. gardie waterworks scheme, which forms a notable instance of the success of Socialism, and. redounds to the honour and credit the right'honourable gentleman. The cess which has attended that undertaking profit has caused a later Premier of Western Australia to emulate the right honourable gentletrams man in giving the State still further ments of Socialism. We now have State mining batteries and a State hotel, and believe that it is intended to increase number of hotels. Both the batteries the hotel have been Conducted with unqualii fied success.",69
598,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is a! better kind Socialism. I can understand that hotelequal shares in the cellar.,69
599,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Prime Minister ber is talking. was, I think, particularly unfortunate in the remark he made a few nights ago with remight gard to certain kinds of Socialism. that he believed in Socialism that was applied in a business-like way. There is such thing as genuine Socialism that is not applied in that manner. No wild, chimeriand cal proposition can easily be branded as socialistic scheme. As a matter of fact, Socialism means the bringing down of workable proposal to a definite business-like basis. We have advanced far beyond the region of Utopianisrn, and Socialism, anything, is eminently practicable. If any called socialistic scheme could not succeed in a business-like fashion, I am certain most believers in the principle would drop Let me refer to a most striking instance the application of the principle of Socialism, in connection with municipal institutions. It is in the domain of municipal action that Socialism-at least in EnglishOn the speaking communities-ha s achieved its greatest degree of success. ' I can remember that, when I was a young man in Glasgow, of every now and then there was an outbreak of indignation in connection with the way the system was being conducted. The were worked for brutally long hours, they received shamefully low wages, the public were badly served, and apparently the only people who derived any benefit were the shareholders in the company. have At last the Glasgow municipality took the system. Within the first six months they reduced the working hours of the employees very considerably, and increased their pay; they reduced the fares by exactly one-half, and at the end of the six months in they had several thousands of pounds to the to good, which went into the public TreaFrom that day on to the present time, the system has been conferring greater advantages on the public, and has been conof tributing more largely to the municipal suctreasury. I think that at present a clear of £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 per annum is being made.",69
600,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the manager of the receive no larger salary than the men instalwho clean out the cars?,69
601,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That tramway system is I managed upon business lines, and the right the honourable gentleman has not acquired a and knowledge of even the ABC of Socialism, f he pretends that the humblest worker and the business manager of a scheme of that dfi kind' receive the same remuneration.",69
602,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,It depends upon the brand of Socialism of which the honourable mem,69
603,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member as well talk about a particular brand He said of private enterprise.,69
604,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Socialisti c schemes, in no order to confer advantage on the community, must be worked on business lines and ability, brains must be paid for ; and for the a right honourable gentleman to talk as he does about Socialism is to altogether mislead the a people as to its meaning. I am surprised that he did not devote some attention to the well-worn topics of confiscation and free if love. These matters are often hurled in sothe teeth of Socialists, and although they have been proved to be utterly inapplicable, that I suppose that honourable members will continue to drag them forth for some time to come. I have indicated my belief in Socialism. I believe that the labour movement is essentially socialistic, and that it has no meaning if Socialism is not its basis.. I welcome the new line of cleavage which is dividing political parties in the Commonwealth. We have, on the one side, those who call themselves individualists, but who are in reality Socialists of a kind-Socialists believe only in that Socialism that will operate to their own particular benefit, or the advantage of the class to which they belong. The Socialism of those connected with the Labour Party must be applied all round for the common benefit. That is the form of Socialism which I endorse, and for which I believe the. labour movement stands. It is because I see this new line of cleavage between the so-called individualists upon the one hand, and the socialists on the other, that I deplore exceedingly the position which has been taken up by a_ majority of members of the Labour Party. seems to me that in a very short time the trend of events would have driven into our ranks those who believe with us politically, and would have compelled those who do not believe with us to have joined the ranks ofj the opposite side. That is a consummation for which I have wished and fought in my own way. It seems tome that a magnificent opportunity has been missed, or almost missed, by the leaders of the labour movement by neglecting to adopt the attitude of welcoming to the ranks of the Labour Party those who are willing to joini us, and of saying to those who refuse to do so, ""If you are not with us, you must be against us."" . The door of admission ""to the labour movement is still wide open, so that anybody who cares to do so may enter. For us to leave our entrenchments, to advance into the open, and to welcome those who will not come to us, leaving our distinctive weapons behind us, is to take a step which I venture to believe is very dangerous to the movement indeed. One inevitable result of the suggested alliance will be to make the Labour Party moderate. I believe that I have been branded in some of the newspapers as a moderate labour member, and with being almost conservative in instincts. But I repudiate emphatically any suggestion that "" moderation "" ought to be the watchword of the labour movement. When the leaders of that movement are praised for their moderation, the friends of labour will regard them with suspicion. I say, therefore, those who are charged to a largte Mr Fowler. extent with the responsibility of formulating a policy for the labour movement ought to be very careful indeed when they find themselves commended for their moderation. The labour movement is undoubtedly upon its trial at the present time. Those who ask us to be moderate will never give us a vote. Are those who believe in us as a party which who will do honest work for the benefit of the masses likely to praise us for our moderation, when that moderation means leaving them in the slough in which they are wallowing at the present time? Is it not a fact that the great enemy which we have to fight is lack of faith in the bona fides of the labour movement on the part of the masses of the community ? Is not the trouble which we frequently experience with our own people a more or less indefinite suspicion that we are merely self-seekers-that we only desire to develop the Labour Party for our own good. If we in our moderaIt tion do nothing which will be of any particular advantage to those who send us here, I claim that that suspicion will be justified, and a very short shrift will be given to the labour movement by a majority of the community. We are told by way of justification for this alliance that the Labour Party remains unchanged, that its principles are unaltered, and that there has been no - departure from the old position. So far as the distinctive planks of the labour platform are concerned, I say that the hatchet of the trimmer' is very much in evidence indeed. I contend that in this respect no parliamentary party has a right to allow any of the planks of the platform which has been formulated by the various organizations in congress to be whittled away in the least degree. They have been carefully considered, they are essentially workable, and when we find significant modifications introduced into them as the basis of this alliance, what can we conclude but that those charged with responsibility have to some extent forgotten the duty which they owe to the electors who sent them here ? During the course of a recent speech one honourable member objected that the Government were solid on the Trade Marks Bill. I am. very much afraid that this alleged alliance is not even solid upon that measure. I feel sure that there are some members of the alliance who will not be able to see eye for eye with members of the Labour Party upon the very important proposal submitted by Senator Pearce in that another' place in reference to registering a trade union brand. Similarly, in regard to other matters, very radical alterations indeed have been made. One of the distinctive planks of the labour .platform, which I believe every member of the party regards - as very important, and one that has the enthusiastic support of every man who votes for a labour representative, is that of old age pensions. It stands in our platform in that form- "" old-age pensions ""-n o more, no less. Those words are all-sufficient-definit e enough for anybody. What is the position when we come to consider the basis of the alliance? There I find that the old-age pensions proposal has something tacked on to it of a very significant character indeed. In the alliance programme it readsOld-age pensions on a basis fair and equitable to the several States arid to individuals. I ask any member of the Labour Party what that means. Is there a single member quire of the party who can explain that addition to the plank as it originally stood ?",69
605,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member does not desire a scheme for old-age pensions upon an inequitable basis?,71
606,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We did not propose to establish an old-age pension scheme upon an inequitable basis, but I say that when qualifying words are introduced in a parcides ticular way we must endeavour to discover the reason for their introduction. That reason does not exist within the ranks the labour movement. It will probably be found to arise from the fear in the minds of our alleged allies that additional tion will require to be levied to give effect to a proposal of that kind. As a result, it will probably be found to of supply an easy hole through which any manufacture member of the alliance can crawl who is rettes. charged with attempting to saddle a certain portion of the community with taxation the which he thinks it ought not to bear. That is the only meaning of it.' It has really no meaning whatever to any member pointed, of the Labour Party; it has no relevance to any action that we have taken or have promethod posed to take, and it certainly does not stand effect. in the agreement at the instance of any member of the party. I have no doubt the trade should be regulated. that the honourable and learned member frank for Indi can give us some explanation this clause, and I challenge him to indicate to us what is his particular proposal in rethese of gard to old-age pensions. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He is sound.",71
607,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The alteration was made at the instance of any member of the 8E Labour Party, so that it must have been made at the instigation of our allies; and 1 as the honourable and learned member has taken a leading part in the formulation of these proposals, I take it that it is his duty to intimate to members of the Labour Party, and to labour electors generally, what is meant by this very interesting development of the three words, ""old-age pensions,"" thatcomprise a plank in the fighting platform of the Federal Labour Party. I come to another distinctive plank of the platform, and that is the ""nationalization of monopolies."" It is a peculiarly socialistic proposal, which, while receiving some support outside our ranks, is essentially a labour proposition. The honourable member for Boothby has placed on the notice-paper a notice of motion which reads as follows: That, in the opinion of this House, a Royal Commission should be at once appointed to ininto and report upon(1) The present position of the tobacco trade in relation to the production, manufacture, and distribution of tobacco. (2) The extent to which it is controlled by a monopolistic combination. (3) The best method of regulating that trade, whether by nationalization, or by anti-trust legislation, or otherwise. It is to be nationalized, - if Parliament de-. that it is expedient to do so; but the honourable member suggests the regulation of the trade as a possible development of the. of work of the Royal Commission. A littlewhile ago, in another place, Senator Pearceproposed, and succeeded in carrying, thetaxaf ollowing motion : j . That in the opinion of this Senate, in orderto provide the necessary money for the payment old-age pensions, and for other purposes, the Commonwealth Government should undertake the: and sale of tc-bacco, cigars, and ciga2. That the foregoing resolution be referred toHouse of Representatives, with a message requesting their concurrence therein. 3. That a Select Committee, consisting of six members of the Senate and the mover, be apwith power to sit and confer with a similar number of members of the House of Representatives, to inquire into and report on the best of carrying the foregoing resolution into That resolution contains no suggestion that It is a proposal that it shall be nationalized, of and it was carried in another place. In circumstances, an honourable member the Labour Party who comes down to this House with such a motion, as that of which notice has been given not by the honourable member for Boothby, takes a distinctively retrogressive step, and one which is not in conformity with our present platform. Then, with regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, I wish to know how far our allies will assist us to put back some of the essential features of the measure that were accidentally omitted while the Labour Government was in power.",71
608,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The ' honourable member found out on the recommittal of clause 62 how far they would go.,72
609,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,But I wish to know what assistance we are going to receive in this direction from our allies.,72
610,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The alliance programme will show the honourable member.,72
611,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thes e are three important matters upon which I desire some information, but in regard to which no particulars have as yet been supplied. I take it that the labour electors throughout the Commonwealth are entitled to have this information, and in the long run it will either have to be supplied to them in a satisfactory form, or they will treat the alliance in a very unceremonious way. The fact of the matter is, that if the Labour Party, with the assistance of its allies, gains possession of the Treasury bench, we shall be able to hope for only the mildest milkand-water legislation, such as almost any party could give the country.",72
612,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the Labour Party will obtain protection.,72
613,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have alrea'dy indicated the position that I shall take up on !he fiscal issue, and I do not think it is uecessary for me to deal with that interjection. I hold that the labour electors will r.ot gain from this alliance anything that could not be obtained practically from almost any other section of the House. The labour movement was brought into existence, and continues to exist, because it goes further than mere Liberalism has yet suggested in remedying those social and economic evils under which the workers suffer at the. present time.",72
614,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,The . Labour Party will not get from their allies the declared war against labour that has been announced by the other side.,72
615,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps not, but even a declared war from straight-out opponents is better for the labour movement than is assistance from those who will not enter our ranks, but carefully remain aloof, as if they would be contaminated by association with us.",72
616,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not the general opinion of the Labour Party.,72
617,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is a very sensible one.,72
618,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is the geneial opinion of labour supporters outside.,72
619,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Order !,72
620,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The re is another aspect of this agreement to which I take very strong exception. I refer to the promise of immunity from opposition which the Labour Party has given our so-called allies. No parliamentary party, or section of a parliamentary party, has any right to commit labour organizations to a pledge of that kind. I feel sure that the labour organizations will resent it.",72
621,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Most of them have agreed to it.,72
622,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Most of them have not done so, and I feel sure that as soon as they realise the situation, they will protest, even more strongly than they have done. The labour organization, as I have already indicated, is open to any one who chooses to enter it , to secure the benefit of it, to get the enthusiastic assistance of those who support us in the work which we have at heart. But we have gentlemen coming along now, who refuse to enter the movement, who will stand at the next election-o r who are expecting that they will stand at the next election-o n a liberal platform, but who will gain as many advantages from labour organizations as if they were right within the ranks. I say at once that, if they are expecting any material assistance from the labour organizations on that basis, their expectations are doomed to failure. Our organizations exist for the furtherance of the labour movement, for the increasing of our members within our own ranks, and not for the creation of an outside party, which will only lead to confusion, and will ultimately seriously damage the prospects pf the movement. We have always regarded those gentlemen who profess themselves labour men in all respects, except that they decline to take the pledge, as the most dangerous enemies to our movement that we have. We have justification for that attitude in view of the significant denunciations of the labour movement and labour principles when their own particular political interests required them to take that course. But they are no friends who would assist us only in fair weather conditions. We want men who will stick to us when the storm is raging. Who will give us their assistance through difficult and critical situations. And we have found from expexience that we cannot depend on any to do that for us, unless they are regularly constituted members of our ranks. I hope it will be understood that, in making those remarks in connection with our alleged allies, I make no criticism of a good deal of the. excellent work they have done. 1 recognise that, in' many respects, their opinions are identical with my own. But the weighty factor in the situation is, as 1I have already indicated, the fact that they still remain outside the labour movement, and that undoubtedly they have denounced labour methods, labour principles, and labour men in a way that, I think, ought to entitle us to expect some expressions of regret with regard to those statements before they profess to be our friends. We have the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is reported in the Melbourne Age as denouncing the Political Labour Council as ""not only a failure; it is an absolute fraud.""",72
623,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not the Council. Nothing of the kind.,73
624,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am surprised that anything which appears in the Age should be repudiated by the honourable member.,73
625,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I denounced the political methods.,73
626,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall be glad to hear the honourable member's correction alp; to what he did say, because a charge of that kind is one that ought to stand in the way of any one who professes to come and join us in this form of alliance. Then, again, we, have the honourable member for Bourke referring to the Labour Party in this way-- 1 To have the Labour Party in power would be as bad as letting loose the animals in the gical Gardens. That kind of criticism ought, I think, in common decency, to be repudiated and regretted by those friends of ours who are now so anxious to assist us. I say that in the absence of any repudiation, we must regard them as still holding those criticisms as justified; and if they still hold them, I do not see how it is possible for an alliance of any kind to be patched up on any basis. I am quite sure that so far as this alliance is concerned, the La.boiiT Party will not take it in earnest, except to repudiate it in the most emphatic way possible. I think there is both safety and wisdom in numbers, that in this respect the instincts of the vast majority nf the labour electors will lead them right, 8E 2 and that no temporary aberration on the part of any portion of the party will have any influence upon their actions. If 1 thought that this alliance was likely to be as successful as some of those who have sought it thought it would be, I am not sure that I should not have taken the extreme step of voting against any action that would place the allies on the benches opposite.",73
627,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not sure that the honourable membei ought not to vote that, way now.",73
628,Mr FOWLER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a matter that I have the deciding of for myself. So far as I am concerned, I feel so strongly on this matter that if the labour organizations and the labour electors had not appeared to be sufficiently seized of the importance of the crisis, I should have voted to give them a further oppoitunity to be acquainted with the circumstances before they were committed irrevocably to the actions of the so-called alliance. But, sir, I believe that a very unpleasant step of that kind on my part is not necessary. I believe that this alliance is a mere pretence and no more-that is has never h&d any sound basis. The electors are likely to deal with the alliance, if there should be an election, in a way that I am certain will make it impossible for it to exist in the next Parliament. It is not to my mind an arrangement of which any labour man has any reason to be proud. I have exceedingly regretted the alliance, and have opposed it, and will continue to oppose it. In doing that, I believe that I am fulfilling a duty I owe to the electors who sent me here, and to the labour electors of the Commonwealth generally. As I have already Zoolosaid, I am entirely opposed to the coalition which sits on the Treasury bench. I shall vote in support of the motion submitted by ; the leader of the Opposition, because I have no desire to see the present Government in power any longer than I can help;. I am certain that if the labour organizations, and labour electors are true to their own best interests, the result of the election will be a straight-out labour majority in possession of the Treasury bench giving the labour electors of the Commonwealth and the people generally that kind of legislation for which they are hungering, and which they have every reason to expect from this democratic Parliament.",73
629,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF," I had no intention to speak this evening, but the opportunity has come to me, and I must take advantage of it. ihat the honourable member for Perth - at any. rate, has given the true history, and true view of the alliance on the other side. I am quite certain that the labour representatives themselves cannot believe that there is absolutely any bond of union between themselves and the party with which they have formed an alliance. One party is trying to make use of the other, and both are acting with the same desires, and 1 from the same motives. Whenever there comes an election it will be shown that men outside connected with the Labour Party will not tolerate the kind of union that has apparently been entered into within this House.",73
630,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The electors will endorse the union right enough; do not make any mistake !,74
631,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am sure labour men outside will not endorse the union.,74
632,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member will regret that, I have no doubt.",74
633,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall take my own course, and let other parties take theirs. The idea of the liberal-protectionists, as they call themselves, going to the country to raise a fiscal agitation is absolutely absurd; and in their hearts they know that to be so. They know that it is only a game they are playing, and that there is no possibility of the Labour Party standing by them in their efforts to re-open the Tariff question.  will not help the protectionists, at any rate.",74
634,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall not help any coalition to raise the fiscal question. So far as I am concerned, I shall stand by the policy I have always advocated.  tion?",74
635,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall stand by the policy of land taxation, but not in the way in which the honourable member would like. I have been, and I am still, a land-taxer, but I have no desire to pile on a land tax without giving some concessions in return. Nobody bas ever found me advocating an increase in the burdens of the men on the land; my desire is to decrease those burdens by changing the system of taxation from that at present adopted. As to old-age pensions being provided from a land tax, I am not likely to give an idea of that kind any support, because that would simply mean an increased burden.",74
636,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the Honourable member does not believe in old-age pensions? I realise Mr LONSDALE - I do, but not in that form. I read with regret the reports of the speech delivered by the honourable and learned member for West' Sydney last night, in which he made charges against the Prime Minister. When I first read the speech I thought there might be some truth in the charges, but to-night we have the honourable and learned member admitting that they are without foundation. It will be admitted by everybody that the honourable and learned member directly pointed to the Prime Minister as being the originator of the prosecution in connection with the six potters. The words of the honourable and learned member wereSix potters were brought all the way from England and landed in this country. Although they are here, citizens of our own flesh and blood, bone of our bone, sinew of our sinew, under the regime of the right honourable gentleman, instructions have been given to the Solicitor-General of New South Wales to file against the man who brought them here an information under the section of the Act which did not permit of the six hatters coming in. There we have a distinct statement that the Prime Minister gave instructions for this information to be filed, though it is well known that it was the honourable and learned member for West Sydney who, as Minister of External Affairs, took that action. Is that honourable or fair? Is that the kind of fighting we should have in this Parliament? If we do fight each other, let the fight be about principles, and let our weapon be truth, not falsehood. The honourable and learned member went on to say that the Prime Minister proposed to deport the six unfortunate potters, though he well knew that no proposal of the kind was ever made by the right honourable gentleman. That is a statement the honourable and learned member cannot back out of, because we have it here in the report of his speech, as corrected by himself. That is the kind of fighting we have had right through on the part of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, and it certainly cannot be described as honourable. In dealing with this matter, one may be excused for getting rather warm when we remember that the honourable and learned member has received many kindnesses from, and been supported time after time by,, the present head of the Government.",74
637,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,We shall have to find a little Parliament in which the New South Wales representatives may be by themselves.,74
638,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We do not want a separate Parliament for the New South Wales representatives; all we want is fair play. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney, after making his speech in the House last night, went outside and made a different or modified statement to the Melbourne press; but that was after his original remarks had been telegraphed throughout the States. If the honourable and learned member has any conscience' he will realise that he has deliberately done the Prime Minister a wrong. Another reference to the Prime Minister has been introduced in the course of the debate. I do not know why tjhese matters should be brought up, but the Opposition corner is responsible for the one to which I am about to refer. There is no doubt that these references are made for the express purpose of, as far as possible, discrediting the Prime Minister in Victoria and the other States.",75
639,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was the gentle Crouch.,75
640,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thos e who know the honourable and learned member for Corio, and have seen his conduct, pay little tion to him.",75
641,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,What has the honourable member against the honourable and learned member for Corio?,75
642,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not want to say anything in that direction, but every one must have noticed the honourable and learned member make a speech one night, and the next night make a speech exactly oppositesaying he is going to vote in one direction,, was and the next night voting directly opI wentthat posite. ' We have seen that here repeatedly ; and everybody who does that kind of thing must be a little bit soft, I think. of The charge has been made repeatedly When against the present Prime Minister of malof administration of thefinancesof New South orable Wales.

The whole of this trouble arose out deficiency. The statement of the honourable member for Grafton, the Treasurer of the Dibbs Government at that time, must be taken as being correct.",75
643,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Are we really concerned in that matter?,75
644,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Indi is not concerned in the matter. He is concerned to let the lie go forth, and let the Prime Minister suffer under this imputation. That is what the honourable and learned member is concerned about. . Honourable members opposite do not desire that this matter should be spoken of. It should never have been referred to here, and we should never have had anything to do with it, if a member of the honourable and learned gentleman's little party had not brought' it up. Now, the honourable and learned member does not desire that the Prime Minister shall be defended. That is the kind of conduct we have from the honourable and learned gentleman. We are not concerned about this matter, I admit, but we are concerned to defend an innocent man, to disclose the truth, and to brand a lie as a lie. In a speech, which I made in the New South Wales Parliament, in dealing with this matter, I made the quotation attenwhich I have just now made, and I then said"" That statement is either true or untrue. If it is true, then the deficiency which the present Colonial Treasurer brings forward exists."" 1 hat was a reference 'to the deficiency which the present Prime Minister brought forward, and I claimed that if the statement of the Treasurer in the previous Administration correct, then that deficiency existed, because honourable gentleman had said so. on to sayI f the statement is not true, what must we think the honourable member for Grafton, who takes a course to establish a book deficiency. . . . this deficiency was originated, the members the Opposition party joined issue with the hongentleman and pointed out that no such deficiency existed. Bill dealing with the matter was discussion, the honourable gentleman, admitted the deficiency, came c'own that nofcuchdefithen said- we have the same gentleman standing here saying that no, such deficiency existed. Are to believe the statement they made during this financial debate, or are we to believe the statement they made on previous occasions. I ask them to say which of the two statements is true. I there referred to the gentlemen who had. been quoted as having accused the preof that sent Prime Minister of doing this wrong. First of all, they said that the deficiency did exist, and then when the present Prime Minister brought it forward they said that it did not exist, although one would imagine that if there had been a deficiency of £1,200,000 it should not have been difficult to discover it somewhere. These Account ? gentlemen were-opposed to the present Prime Minister, and when he proposed to do exactly what they had proposed to do themselves-issu e Treasury bills to cover the deficiency-the y said that the deficiency did not exist, and the whole of the charges against the present Prime Minister arose out of that. What did the right honourable gentleman do ? He carried the Bill through the House, and I believe that the present honourable member for Bland, and other members of the Labour Party in the State Parliament, supported him in doing so. We have had some quotations made from the report of the Committee appointed to inquire into this matter; but if honourable members will read the report, they will find that the members of the Committee admit that the present Prime Minister carried on the accounts in conformity with the programme of Parliament.",75
645,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,In conformity with the law.,76
646,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In conformity with the law which the State Parliament, the Labour Party assisting, passed with its eyes wide open. The members of with its eyes wide open. The members of the Committee admit that, and whatever may be the conclusions tq which they came, honourable members will at once realise that if anything wrong was done, it was the New South Wales Parliament, and not the right honourable member for East Sydney, that was guilty. I may explain that the deficiency to which I have referred, and which was covered by the Treasury bills authorized to be issued, arose from payments for works made in the previous years. The present Prime Minister altered the system of keeping the accounts, so that it should not be possible, in years to come, for the same thing to occur again. He desired that the revenue actually received during the. year, should be taken as the revenue for that year, and that the amount actually spent should be considered the actual expenditure for the year. He decided that the public accounts should be kept upon that system, and that in the case of every work not carried out, the amount voted for it should be written off at the close of the financial year, and should be re-voted when necessary. On 30th June, 1895, at the close of the first half-year during which the present Prime Minister was in office, the accounts showed a deficiency of £186,000.",76
647,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Consolidated Revenue,76
648,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , for the half year under the old system. The first full year under the cash system was from ist July, 1895, to 30th June, 1896, and at the close of that yeai*, the New South Wales Auditor-General certified that there was a surplus of £349,000. Before dealing with a new matter, I should like to say that as it is half-past ten o'clock, the Prime Minister might consent to an adjournment of the debate, as I shall not have finished what I desire to say for some time. Debate adjourned. Motion (by Mr Reid) proposed^That the resumption of the debate be an order of the day for tomorrow.",76
649,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the honourable member for New England will not be too long,76
650,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Ordei . I have before called the attention of honourable members to the standing order which requires that there should be silence when Mr. Speaker is putting a question. Honourable members will see the importance of observing the standing order, because they may give votes under a misapprehension, unless when a question is put from the Chair they are enabled to hear it distinctly. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",76
651,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF," I move That the House do now adjourn. I should like to point out that in the ordinary course of business, certain private business on the paper would tomorrow be taken until 6.30 p.m. I think that it is the general wish of honourable members, in the present state of affairs, that the debate on the motion of the honourable member for Bland should be continued without interruption. I desire to mention that I propose to make the necessary motion, when the House meets tomorrow, to enable the House to take that course. Of course, it can only be done with concurrence. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m. 1",76
