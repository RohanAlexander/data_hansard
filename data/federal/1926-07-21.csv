Will the Government consider favourably the erection of a national theatre at Canberra, the opening of which, synchronizing with the ceremonial opening of the Federal Farliament at Canberra, would be a suitable occasion for Shakespearian gala performances by Australian artists directed and led by Mr Allan Wilkie? 3.

22,Mr HILL,NATION AL THEATRE AT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Correspondence has'taken place within my department in regard to concessional fares for the Shakespearian company over the Commonwealth railways. My reply has 'been that, under the regulations of the Commonwealth Railways, theatrical companies are issued tickets at two-thirds of the ordinary fares, and are granted increased free luggage allowance, as well as receiving special rates for the carriage of theatrical scenery and luggage. 2. The Federal Capital Commission recently gave very full consideration to the question of the construction of a municipal theatre, but it was decided that such action would be premature at present. 3.

' SIR GEORGE BUCHANAN'S REPORTS. - Mr Bruce - I have laid on the table the report of Sir George Buchanan on the ports and harbours of North and North-western Australia. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) asked a question yesterday in regard to further reports by Sir George Buchanan, and I said that I had no idea when they would be received. To-day I received a cablegram from Sir George Buchanan saying that a further report dealing with transport in Australia generally was posted on the 15th July. PAPERS. The following papers were presented:« Ports of North and North-Western Australia - Report, dated 30th April, 1926, by Sir George Buchanan, - KC.I.E. Ordered to be printed. Meteorological Service-Repor t by the monwealth Meteorologist for the year 1924-25. CANBERRA HOUSES.",20
39,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) f2.57] - I move1. That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, namely:-The erection of cottages at Canberra. 2. That the committee have leave to meet Whilst the House is sitting. In connection with the preparations for the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra it is necessary to provide housing accommodation for civil servants. There is no prospect of private enterprise undertaking this work within the time available, or even at all, and there is no alternative to provision of the necessary housing by the Government. The Federal Capital Commission was asked to develop a scheme for the building of houses, and it prepared plans of various standard types for which tenders were called and accepted. The commission was under the impression that the erection of cottages did not come within the scope of the Public Works Committee Act; but this matter has been recently referred to the Crown Law authorities, who have advised that these cottages could not be regarded as a number of separate works, but must be considered as one work, and therefore come within the provisions of that statute. It is. therefore, desired to place this matter in order by referring it to the Public Works Committee, which will be invited, if this House approves, to deal with it as a special subject, provided leave is given for the committee to meet while the House is sitting. If this leave is not granted, the committer will be unable to bring in its report before Parliament rises. The delay that would be thus involved is undesirable, in view of the necessity of having the necessary housing completed and ready for occupation by the civil servants when they are transferred next year.. The commission has prepared standard types of plans and specifications with a view to keeping down the cost of the houses as much as possible; but the designs may be modified to suit the requirements of civil servants Comwho are now stating their wishes after inspection of them. It is not known what total number of each type will be required, pending the completion of returns by all civil servants affected. The estimated costs of the various types range from £950 to £2,030, and the average cost per house may, therefore, be taken to be under £1,500; but this will depend upon the proportion of lower-priced houses that may be required. I produce plans and specifications of the types of houses, and further particulars will be given in evidence before the committee. I understand that the committee is prepared to deal with this matter expeditiously, and will visit Adelaide at the week-end. It may not be possible for it to return to Melbourne before Wednesday, and the second portion of my motion, if agreed to, will cover the absence of honourable members from the House on Tuesday next.",21
40,Mr RODOERS,COMMONWEALTH,What effect will this inquiry have upon contracts already let?,21
41,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,I assume that the committee will report to the House on that aspect of the matter.,21
42,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH,Is it not extraordinary that the Government should allow building operations to commence and should then institute an inquiry as to whether the houses should be built?,21
43,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,"That is a matter upon which the House is entitled to express its opinion. The Government is taking immediate action to give effect to the declaration of the Crown Law authorities that the erection of these houses should have been referred to the Public Works Committee. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [3.0] The Government's reference amounts to closing the stable door after the horse has escaped,' since the proposal should have been submitted to the Public Works Committee before the work was begun. Contracts have already been let, and, if the committee' reported adversely where would the Government then stand V",21
44,Mr LISTER,COMMONWEALTH,"It is not likely that the committee would do that. Mr E . RILEY - I hope not. The decision of the Crown Law . authorities should administer a lesson to the Federal Capital Commission. MT . WEST - The f a u l t lies not with the commission but with the Government. Mr E . RILEY - In either case what object can be served by uow referring the work to the committee ? The Government should accept responsibility for what has been done, and say that the contracts must stand. The Government admits that the commission acted illegally in letting the contracts before referring the work to the committee. MT . FOSTER - Parliamen t as well as the Government is responsible for that. Mr E . RILEY - The work has gone so far that the Public Works Committee can now merely give its formal assent to it.",22
45,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH,"Does the honourable member think that it is too late to put the responsibility on the committee? Mr E . RLLEY - Yes , because the plans have been adopted and the contracts let. I hope that the erection of the cottages will not be delayed, because if Parliament is to meet at Canberra in May next, they will be required for the officers who are to be transferred there.",22
46,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH,"Hav e contracts for the whole of the 300 cottages been let ? MV. E . RILEY - I am told so. The Government should take the responsibility , and admit that a mistake has been made. I have received telegrams from Canberra' complaining of the slanderous remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) concerning the workmen employed there.",22
47,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH," Order ! The honourable member may not refer to remarks made in another debate. Mr E . RILEY - The honourable member has slandered certain Government em.' ployees, and I propose to defend them. He poses as a builder, but I doubt if he could build a fowlhouse. Some of those - men are as capable as any in Australia, and their work will bear comparison with that done in Melbourne or Sydney. The honourable member, who has no qualifications as a builder, should not have' ha'd the audacity to slander his own countrymen. The commission had a hard task in securing the necessary men for the work, at Canberra in the early stages, because plenty of employment was available in the building trade in the capital cities: Therefore, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to the men who were prepared to sacrifice the comfort of theirhomes, and undergo the rigorous winter conditions prevailing at Canberra.",22

52,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,"I do not think that I shall disclose a secret when I say that the Crown Law authorities pointed out that if the contracts were terminated the Commonwealth would sustain considerable loss. This showed conclusively that the contracts had been let, although the commission made it appear that it was letting contracts for one house at a time. The fact is that the contracts have'been let, and they cannot now be repudiated. The Public Works Committee may point out that a wrong course of action has been pursued, but the work must continue. The honourable member for South Sydney need not fear that the move to Canberra will be delayed. The building will go on all too rapidly. I hope this experience will be a lesson to the three kings of Canberra that they cannot override the provisions of an act of this Parliament. . Mr WATKINS - The Government should have referred the matter to the Public Works Committee.",22
53,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,"Evidentl y it did not - do so; but permitted the Commission to proceed to carry out its recommendation. I am pleased that-eve n at this eleventh hour I was going to say, but really it is later than that",23
54,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH,"Anyhow , it is a moral victory for the honourable member.",23
55,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,"It is an admission that the charges that were made were justified. T wish' to make a brief reference to .the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) in regard to his visit to Canberra. He, like myself, paid only a flying visit to the city, and was well paid for doing so. We did riot see the men at Avork for five minutes. The only man that the honourable member crossed swords with was a Scotch bricklayer, and very few words passed between them before the honourable member ran for his motor car as quickly as he could. He started to argue with this bricklayer about laying 1,000 bricks a day.",23
56,Mr SEABKOOK,COMMONWEALTH,"On a point of order, I wish to state that the honourable member is making a misstatement. I did not have one word with the bricklayer.",23
57,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,"That is not a point of order. If the honourable member thinks that his remarks are being misrepresented, he will have an opportunity to make a personal explanation later.",23
58,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,"It is quite true that the honourable member did not have one word with the bricklayer; he had half a dozen, and it was more than enough. It is unfair to charge the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) with saying that shoddy work was being done at Canberra.",23
59,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member is now referring to a previous debate of this session; that is not in order.,23
60,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,Has any one ever known of a public building being constructed as quickly as the . provisional Parliament House at Canberra?,23
61,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,"That work was a credit to the men engaged upon it, for it is being done speedily and well.""",23
62,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH,It is being done too speedily.,23
63,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) made a wise observation-a n unusual thing for himi-whe n he was speaking on this matter last week. He said that a good deal of the blundering was due to our unseemly haste to get to Canberra. I should be well pleased if it . took us 50 years to get there. I am glad that the Government took this step. It had only two courses in the matter, one of which was to bring down a bill to validate the illegal act that was done, and the other to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee. I think the right course has been taken. I should be glad to know whether the scope of reference to the committee will be sufficiently wide to enable it to inquire into the cost of the houses.",23
64,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH,"Lang) [3.15]. - The Government was well advised to seek the - authority of "" Parliament, through the Public Works Committee, for the expenditure involved in these Canberra contracts, but I did not gather from the Minister's remarks whether the scope of the inquiry would be wide enough to enable the committee to investigate the suitability of the types of .houses that are being erected. Perhaps the Minister will make that point clear when he replies. With regard to the workmanship in the houses at Canberra, so far as I can see, no fault can be found with it. Nor do I think there is any room for complaint about the quality of the materials that are being used. Perhaps, as regards the use of shingles with which some of the cottages are being roofed, there is room for difference - of opinion as to the wisdom of using such roofing material - Perhaps the committee could also inquire into that matter. I am quite sure that the Canberra Commission is doing its best, within the limited time at its disposal, to provide the necessary accommodation to enable the transfer to be made in May of next year. I do not think any blame is attachable to it for the oversight that has apparently occurred in connection with the letting of a contract exceeding £25,000 without reference to the Public Works Committee. I understand that the Public Works Commission is to be given permission to make its inquiries while Parliament is sitting, so that the inquiry may be expedited and any avoidable delay obviated. I hope that its report will be submitted . to the House before it rises for the vacation. Any ""fear that the work at Canberra will be delayed or interfered with on account of what has happened may, I think, be dismissed. Such interference would involve the country in serious financial loss, for the contractors would have to be compensated in case of any breach of their contract by the commission or the Government. The Public Works Committee, in view of all the circumstances, will undoubtedly pursue its inquiry as rapidly as possible and submit its report without delay, and very little expense is likely to result in consequence of the unfortunate oversight in not referring the matter to it in the first instance.",23
65,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,"Newcastle) [3.1S] I should not have risen to participate in this debate but for the apology that has just been made in behalf of the Ministry. I have no desire to throw the blame for this mistake on the shoulders of the commission. The Government should have seen that the matter was referred to the Public Works Committee, and it must accept responsibility for not having done so. So far as I can recollect, this is the first time that a mistake of this kind has been made, and the only thing we can do now is to rectify it and with the work. I trust that the reference to the committee will be broad enough to enable it to inquire into the value the cottages that are to be erected, intimate whether such heavy rents public servants have been notified will charged are really justifiable. I do think it is fair that Commonwealth officers with limited incomes should to pay high rents, which are really beyond their means, for the cottages.",24
66,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,Would the honourable member suggest writing down the capital cost?,24
67,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,"Yes . I hope that the committee will take the whole matter into consideration, and will see that suitable cottages are provided for public servants at a reasonable price - The initial mistake has been made, and it is of no use to cry over spilt milk now. It is necessary to get on with the job.",24
68,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH,"I wish to make a personal explanation. The statement of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) was not in accordance with the facts. I did not say anything to the bricklayer at Canberra, but I saw the honourable member for Ballarat and two other honourable members on that side of the House talk with him, and they wasted a lot of his time in doing so.",24
69,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,"Bass) [3.22] - I am pleased with the Government's action, which justifies the opposition of certain honourable members , to proposals for restricting the scope of,;the Public Works Committee. I hope that no time will be lost in inquiring into the erection of the cottages. I direct the attention of the Minister and the Government to the fact that thousands of .people are anxious to go to Canberra to witness the ceremony in connection with the opening of Parliament there. I suggest that the Government should proceed as quickly as possible with the erection not only of the cottages referred to, but also of as many others as possible. The taxpayers are finding the money for this venture, and those desirous of attending the opening ceremony, which will be one of the most important in our history, should, if possible, be provided with accommodation.",24
70,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"Maribyrnong) [3.24] I do not wish to cross swords with any get on honourable member on this side of the House on the question of apportioning the blame for the bungling that has taken of place. I am prepared, if necessary, to and have the blame. There is no doubt that as both the Federal Capital Commission and be the Government are to blame. Parlianot ment made the initial mistake of appointing a commission, and if the advice of have honourable members on this side 'had been taken, the bungling would not have occurred. We suggested that those who had previously been responsible for constructional work at Canberra should remain in charge. Although the appointment of the commission may relieve the Government of some responsibility, there is al. ready ample evidence that it needs watching carefully. I understand that about 2,000 cottages are needed, and, if they cost about £2,000 each, substantial profits will be made out of the Government. I hope that the committee will investigate the tenders submitted by contractors, and will inquire as to the cost of materials. A proper investigation will probably disclose that the contractors are calculating on a handsome profit. Australian workmen 'are the best in the world, notwithstanding the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), and, under proper supervision, Canberra could be built better and more cheaply by day labour than by contract. The members of the commission are believers in the contract system, and they will, therefore, play up to contractors. I am not imputing anything dishonest; but, because the commissioners believe that the contract system is the best, and will consequently favour contractors, they should be watched. Until the commission was appointed, works at Canberra proceeded satisfactorily under the control of departmental officers, who knew their jobs thoroughly. We are - now paying thousands of pounds a year to a commission to protect the funds of the Commonwealth, and it has already disregarded the provisions of an act of Parliament, and the expressed views of honourable members. As bricks and tiles are made at Canberra, and all conveniences exist there for the landing of materials on the job at the cheapest possible rate, it is strange that cottages should, cost such an enormous sum of money. I shall peruse with interest the report of the committee, and I hope that it will disclose something better than the contract method of building cottages.  --The fault has undoubtedly been with the commission and not with Parliament. The commission has exceeded its duties; but, at this stage, it is farcical for Government, at great expense, to send Public Works Committee to Canberra investigate something in regard to which it must report favourably. I do not mean that the committee must report that the houses are being built at a reasonable cost, but it must report in favour, of voting money to . continue the scheme. The members of the committee will appear to the public as automatons, who have to do as they are told. They will find fault with the buildings, and may allege that too much money is being spent; but in the end they will condone what is being done. An inquiry should be made as to the cost of these buildings, which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of other honourable members, is excessive. The commissioners have exceeded their duty by spending more money than they are entitled to spend, and now this Parliament should shoulder the responsibility and legalize what the commission has done, instead of placing the onus on the Public Works Committee. The report of the committee should have nothing to do with the voting of the money.",24
71,Mr LACEY,COMMONWEALTH,"Grey) [3.30] --The discussion this afternoon has justified the criticism in this Chamber the other day, when the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) moved to have this matter referred to the Public Works Committee. I would remind the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Perkins) that the members of the Public Works Committee inquire into every matter submitted to the Committee. They report on the facts as they find them, and are not influenced in any way by party considerations. I have risen nowchiefly because the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) has charged me with having made an attack upon the workers at Canberra. I contradict that statement and, in support of my contradiction, I propose to quote what I said on the matter.",25
72,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,Order ! The honourable member will not be in order in quoting from a previous debate of this session.,25
73,Mr LACEY,COMMONWEALTH,"I said that the houses at Canberra were jerry-built and went on to refer to the builders and not to the men who actually carried out the work. When a foreman is placed in charge of a job, the workers on the job have to carry the out his orders. What I condemned was the the system under which the houses were to built at Canberra. It will be remembered that I complained that some of the houses were roofed with, cheap shingles instead of with a better form of roofing. No one would charge the men who did that work with responsibility for the selection of the inferior roofing. I attributed the shoddy, work done at Canberra to speeding up under the contract system. The honourable member for Franklin did refer personally to the workers. He saidMany of these cottages have been built by day work.",25
74,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,Order ! The honourable member must not quote from a previous debate of this session.,26
75,Mr LACEY,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member for Franklin charged me this afternoon with having attacked the workmen at Canberra. I did not do so. It would not have been right for me to do so. What I attacked was the system under which the houses were built. The honourable member for Franklin said that many of the houses were built by day labour by men receiving 25s. and 30s. a day, who were not tradesmen. To-day he says that he did not make an attack upon the workmen. What he said is on record, and can be compared with the statement he made this afternoon. He has referred to time lost in a conversation with a workman. I was present when the conversation referred to took place. It did not occupy more than three or four minutes, and, as a matter of fact, the workman referred to did not cease his work for an instant during the conversation; he complained that the workers were condemned for not doing a great deal of work when, as a matter of fact, they were working as hard as they could. His grievance was that a number of persons were going about Canberra in motor cars, looking at the works m progress, while only a few were doing the hard graft, and he was one of them. I am very pleased that these works are to be referred to the Public Works Committee. The decision to make the reference is a victory for those who advocated the adoption of that course weeks ago.",26
76,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH,"Lilley) [3.36] - I Bhould not have taken part in the debate were it not for some remarks made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  seems to be in doubt as to whether the Public Works Committee, the Federal Capital Commission, or the Government is responsible for what has occurred. I desire to make a few brief quotations from the correspondence that has taken place. On the 21st May, the Public Works Committee addressed a letter to the Minister for Home and Territories, the material paragraph of which readsThe committee is unanimously and strongly of opinion that the carrying out of a work such as that indicated, involving a large expenditure of public money, is a distinct evasion of the act, and some members were desirous of ventilating the matter on the floor of the House. At my suggestion, however, they had consented to defer any such action for the present, and I am taking this opportunity of bringing - the matter under your notice in the hope that the committee may obtain your assurance that this project will be referred for its investigation before the work is put in hand. To that letter the Public Works Committee received a reply from the Minister for Home and Territories, dated 13th July, in which, referring to the failure to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, the statement is madeThe failure to do so is due entirely to inadvertence, it having been assumed, after full inquiry had been made, that this work, which embraces the construction of 500 cottages, was one in relation to the individual cottages, and not to the contract for the 500 as a whole. I am sure I need not stress to you or to your committee the fact that neither the commission nor my predecessor, in failing to refer the work to you, was either desirous of avoiding the provision of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act, or of showing any discourtesy to the committee. It has also to he borne in mind that the date for the transference of the Capital to Canberra would have to be postponed if the question of these cottages were now to be investigated by the Public Works Committee, as the commission, working at full pressure, would only he able to make the necessary arrangements for the transference on the 9th May, even if the work is not interrupted in any way. In view of these circumstances, the two courses which it appears possible to pursue are: (1) That there shall be a formal reference of the works to your committee, and that your committee should formally approve them, and in its report to the House set out the circumstances under which that formal approval is given; or (2) That a bill should be introduced into Parliament authorizing .the works. I have here the opinion of the Solicitor General, in the course of which he says The material fact to be considered in determining whether section 15 of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act applies in any - particular case is the estimated cost of completing any one work, and not the amount of money proposed to be expended, irrespective of the number of works to be completed. The question to be determined in the present instance is, therefore, whether the construction of the 300 cottages in question at Canberra in pursuance of the contracts let is one work, or whether the construction of each cottage is a separate work. I am, therefore, of opinion that the struction of the cottages in question stitutes one work for the purposes of 14 (4) of the Seat of Government Administration Act, and section 15 (1) of the Commonand wealth Public Works Committee Act, and as the total estimated expenditure appears exceed £25,000, the proposed work should referred to the Public Works Committee. To the letter from the Minister for Home and Territories the Public Works Comthat mittee sent a reply dated 16th July, the course of which it statedWhile anxious to avoid any action which tend in any way to delay the transfer of Seat of Government to Canberra, the committee, after carefully considering the matter in all its aspects, is of opinion that the only course can recommend is that the work be referred the usual way in accordance with section of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921. To that letter the committee received the following reply, dated 16th J u l y : I desire to acknowledge the receipt memo, of this date, relative to the question of referring to your committee the proposal to erect a number of cottages at Canberra, to inform you that it is noted that, upon a reference of this work being made to the committee, the committee will concentrate upon the subject, and endeavour to present its port to Parliament at the earliest possible It will be seen from the correspondence that it was the Public Works Committee that first brought this matter under the roads. notice of the Minister for Home . and Territories. I think that the correspondseparate work. ence proves that the Federal Capital Commission was quite innocent in the matter, and that there was no intended tesy to the Public Works Committee, or any desire to wilfully evade the Public Law Department say? Works Committee Act.",26
77,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH,The honourable memcided ber should not apologize for them. Some one was to blame.,27
78,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH,There is no occasion for anology. T think I have done only my duty in placing the facts of the matter before the House.,27
79,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,"""Parkes-Honorar y ter) [3.44] - The question resolves itself into whether the Federal Capital Commisthing. sion or the Government called for tenders for these works, and committed a breach of the Public Works Committee Act. When the Seat of Government Administration Bill was recently under consideration, it will be remembered that my reply to the second-reading debate on the measure was interrupted by the adjournment of the debate. I had at the time before conme the whole of the facts of the case, and conthe correspondence between the Public section Works Committee and the Government, it was my intention then to make a that, statement on the subject to the House. to It has been stated that the commision; or be the Government, or both, has tried to go behind the Public Works Committee Act. I have said previously, and I say again, nothing was further from the minds in of both the commission and the Government. When the matter was brought to may the notice of the Government, it was the immediately referred to the Crown Law authorities. The commission has certain it powers for the carrying out of works when in money is voted by Parliament for them. 15 It must be remembered that the commission is carrying out works every day. It is making roads, extending the sewer services, the electric light and power services, and the water mains, and all those of your works are costing more than £25,000. Mr M ' CGRATH - It is time that they, and too, were investigated.",27
80,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,"That is so. Every work which the commission undertakes, such as rethe construction of a road costing, say, date. £10,000, does not come within the Public Works Committee Act, but the commission may construct a number of such",27

If , as honourable members have said, the Government bad intended to camouflage the position, and to deceive this House, it might easily Minishave taken some other action.",27
85,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH,No one has said such a,27
86,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,"Honourable members have - today said that the Government and the commission had gone behind the back of Parliament to carry out certain works. Had the Government had any desire to deceive honourable members respecting the erection of cottages at Canberra, instead of moving to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, it could have .passed a validating measure through this House. Neither the Government nor the commission had any desire to go behind the back of Parliament to build works at Canberra. The commission has been straightforward throughout, and rightly referred the matter to the Government for decision. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) was absent when I replied to some of the statements that he made"" the other day respecting the use of shingle roofs at Canberra. I would in form him that only six houses there have shingle roofs, and that the residents of Sydney are today paying more for shingle roofs than for tiled roofs. That completely discredits the statement of honourable members that shingle roofs are shoddy and absolutely useless.",28

92,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH,"V e r y probably. I think that the House is satisfied generally that neither the Government nor the commission had any intention to go behind the back of Parliament. The Government has taken the first opportunity to bring the matter before Parliament, and I ask honourable members to agree to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee for consideration and report. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA OFFICES, CANBERRA .",28
93,Mr MARR,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [3.52] - I move That in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth public Works Committee Act 1913-21, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations :-The erection of a building at Canberra for accommodation of Commonwealth Departments. The report of the Public Works Commitltee was tabled in the House and ordered to be printed on the 7th of J u l y last. It was not circulated amongst honourable members u n t i l today because of the pressure of work in the printing office. In the approved plan of Canberra, a special zone has been created for parliamentary and official activities, and a proper layout has been made for all structures in this area, so' that the' permanent offices to accommodate the various administrative departments of the Commonwealth may be arranged in accordance with an orderly and dignified scheme, with due provision' to meet expansion for many generations. It will be remembered that the original proposal was that provisional buildings be erected, in the first instance, to accommodate the departments, but this House, on the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, passed a resolution on the 24th 7 August, 1923, that such provisional buildings be not authorized, but that an architectural competition be held instead for the design of the first unit of the permanent administrative offices. This competition was held, and the design for which the first premium was awarded was duly referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. Its report has recently been presented to Minister in - Parliament. The building, as proposed, will contain five floors, in cluding lower ground and mezzanine floors, and will be constructed of concrete, faced with stone. Australian materials will be utilized wherever possible in its completion. Its equipment will in clude hot water heating, vacuum cleaning, hot water service, a refectory, strong rooms, and modern appliances generally.' The planning aims at the convenient location of the departments, and a standard unit of floor space has been adopted to afford economic subdivision or utilization in large office spaces as may be found necessary. Access and internal communication by stairways and lifts have also received special study. The general finish will be as simple as-possible, consistent with the requirements of an important permanent national building at the Seat of Government. The estimated cost of the building is £631,819, but this should be addedArchitect's commission and expenses and quantities ... ... £44,227 Contingencies (5 per cent.) ... Inspection and supervisors .... Compound interest during construction at 6 per cent, during four years . Cost of competition ... Probable cost of detailed subdivision into offices ... ... Total Either of two corresponding sites-on on each side of trie main city axis-in government area is available for these offices, and it is proposed to erect building on whichever site affords the cheaper foundation. In due .course, when required, and subject to the prescribed quiries, the other site will be occupied by a building of similar design to for m adjourned. a balanced scheme. The conditions of competition provided that the winning design may be used in the future for the second building without employment of the successful architect, or payment of ported:any fee. . It is estimated that the building will require about four years completion, and when that is accomplished the balance of Central Administrative stalls will be transferred. cost of the building will be borne Federal Capital Commission. The Publie Works Committee has made a very read a first time. exhaustive inquiry into this proposal, and its report contains valuable suggestions for improvement and reductions in the cost of building. These will receive careful attention in working out the f u ther details of the project. This w i the first permanent governmental office to be erected at Canberra. Even ParliaDivision ment House, which is now nearing pletion, is a temporary building, estimated to serve from 60 to 100 years. Government intended in the first place to erect temporary offices, but the Public Works Committee reported unfavorably I on that proposal, and the House, on the 24th August, 1923, passed a resolution providing for the erection of permanent administrative offices. Plans and speciI fications were prepared and submitted to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report. It s report was tabled in House on the 7th of this month. The Mr Marr. to committee has recommended that the building of the administrative offices be proceeded with as speedily as possible, so that accommodation may be provided for '31,591 the public servants and the staff to be 10,000 transferred to Canberra with in the next three or four years. 102,352 Mr Foster - Will public tenders be 2,629 invited for the erection of the building?",28
94,Mr MARR,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I should think so. The 20,000 Government at present intends to call £210,799 for tenders for the work. The architrct whose design was accepted will supervise £842,618 the erection of the building. I cannot e say definitely whether the work will be the carried out by day labour or by contract, because that has not yet been decided by the Cabinet. The policy of the Government is to carry out permanent works by contract, and I understand that it will be in - adopted in this case. Debate (on motion by Mr CHARLTO N) ASSENT TO BILLS .

95,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Batman) [ 4 . 2 ] - In The discussing the budget, honourable members may either range the universe or confine their attention to a single theme. n the observations I have to offer I in tend to follow the latter course. W it h the approval of m y leader I move That the item be reduced by £1. f that amendment is agreed to, it will be a direction to the Ministry to request H is Excellency the Governor General to apthis point a royal commission to inquire into the various wireless services controlled, or partially controlled, by the Commonwealth, and especially(a) The relationship of the Ministry with the corporation known as Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, including the continued failure of the company to honour .the obligations entered into by it with the' Commonwealth. (b) The matter of royalties and other imposts exacted from the broadcasting companies and the general public by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited . - (c) The nature and value of capital, other than the moneys of the Commonwealth, including alleged patent Tights brought into the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on the date of its agreement with the Commonwealth. (d) The proper scope of the broadcasting service, its management, control, and finance. This is a subject which I have had occasion to ventilate in this Chamber on more than one occasion, but more particularly when it came ""before the Parliament in 1921, and when the agreement then - sanctioned was modified in 1924. It is necessary, therefore, that I should publish a synopsis of previous chapters, as it may well be that the pressure of other _ important matters and the flight of time have caused honourable members to lose the continuity of the narrative. Moreover, since I last spoke, new members have come into this Chamber. Regretf u l ly I have to admit that they have come from the wrong direction, carried in on a high tide of hysteria and terror artfully created by the Government which I have the honour to oppose. When the' honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was speaking in regard to land tax, upon which he is an acknowledged expert, he described the history of the taxation of Crown leaseholds as a drama, of which the phase with which he was then dealing was the fourth and final act. Following the example of the honourable member, but adopting a different analogy, I shall call my dissertation on wireless a saga, and I introduce it with these words of LongfellowAnd then the blue-eyed Norseman told . A saga of the days of olda"" saga which, however, will be supPostmaster-General, ported by history and will be regarded, if I may paraphrase the words employed by the new judge of the Arbitration Court, as an historical verity. I am glad to be able to give an historical review of the subject, because history is en the side of the Labour party. It is bearing out our prophecies and turning to dust and - - ashes the promises andprophecies of the Government. Therefore, in the public interest, history must be f a it h full y told. Besides, the poet has said, rightly, that "" hope springs eternal in the human .breast,-"" and we hope, in face of the inexorable logic of facts and history, that the Government may yet see its way to mend its course in regard to this most questionable and questioned agreement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited . The first epoch of this history may be said to have been ushered in by the d r a f t agreement presented to this Chamber by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable W . M . Hughes, in the latter days of December, 1921. I do not pretend to know what were the influences that persuaded the right honourable gentleman to accept the d r a f t agreement with the company, but I do know that he is still a director of it . The directorate consists of three representatives of the company and three representatives of the Commonwealth, the six electing a seventh director, and the whole seven, in due course, electing « chairman. The righ t honourable member for North Sydney is the seventh director, and I understand that, giving a wise and' broad interpretation of his position and powers, he has decided that he cannot, be removed unless by the unanimous decision of the other directors. That, I think, is characteristic of the right honourable gentleman. There is, however, .some time limit to his services, but no - doubt he will meet any change in the situation when the need arises. It was in December, 1921, or a little earlier, that that versatile gentleman, the present managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, first made his presence felt in the lobbies of this Parliament, where he wore out a good deal of shoe leather while addressing himself, - quite unsuccessfully, I am happy to know, to the then Postmaster-General (Mir. Wise), who, wisely but somewhat curtly, if not absolutely brutally, turned hi m down. Notwithstanding the strong stand taken by that Mr Fisk was active in other directions. This busy bee, after attempting to draw honey from the precincts of Federal Parliament House, proceeded to London, where he alighted on the then Prime Minister, who was attending an Imperial Conference. he was more successful with him than he had been with Mr Wise, for as soon as the right honourable gentleman to Australia he submitted the proposed agreement to this House for By common consent the agreement was one which this Parliament could not accept. We of the Labour party succeeded in rallying to our support sufficient members on the Ministerial side to have the question referred to a select The Opposition did everything possible to ensure that after the committee had dealt with the agreement it should come again before this House for further tion, but we were overborne, and the House decided that if the agreement were approved by the committee it might properly be signed by the Prime The agreement referred to the committee was of such a nature that it is hardly credible that any responsible man could have advocated its acceptance by Parliament. Pre-eminent amongst many radical defects was the provision that a majority of the directorate should Amalgamated Wireless Limited. say at this stage that for all the practical good that resulted from their efforts the committee and the Opposition well have saved themselves their because whatever was gained by the committee's inquiry and the suggestions which it subsequently made, and whatever improvements were made to the agreement as a result of its deliberations, have been successively given away by the present Government. Upon examination perts, the committee found that there was no scientific certainty that a commercial wireless service of the kind required between Australia and the United could in any circumstances be supplied in our present state of scientific ledge. In that regard I shall quote from the notes of - evidence accompanied the published report of the committee, and which have previously referred to in this I think that we owe it principally Senator Millen that these notes were prepared and embodied in the report, and the Prime Minister would, no doubt, be one of the first to acknowledge aocuracy, and the services rendered to Mr Brennan. the committee and the public by that honourable senator. On page 16 the report statesOn the one hand, the committee had the very Apparently valuable report of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy .Commission of 1920, which dearly defined a commercial wireless service as one returned that guaranteed rapid, reliable, and continuous operating for 24 hours every day, and which also very positively stated that such a service ratification. was not practical beyond a distance of 2,000 to 3,000 miles. On the other hand, they had before them the draft agreements of the Amalgamated Wireless Company and the Radio Communication Company, which inferential!/ set out that a one-step service between Australia and the United Kingdom was commercially committee. possible. The following reference is made on the same page, to Mr Fisk's position: consider a- Mr Fisk stated that the Marconi Company has developed devices which would effectively prevent atmospherics interfering with received signals, and that the efficiency of any system depended on the provision of such contriMinister. vance. He was unable, however, to adequately reply to the opinions expressed by certain noted physicists and wireless technicians that some really effective anti-atmospheric eliminating invention was still urgently required to remove this most serious limitation to long distance radio-telegraphy. Mr Fisk, under cross-examination, subrepresent mitted a number of documents. I should Let me here point out that this gentleman, who although our manager is without responsibility to - us, took upon himmight self ' to declare that this proposal, trouble, in which Commonwealth money was being invested to the extent of half a million, was, in fact, easily capable of consummation, whereas in truth and in fact he admitted, under cross-examination, that he had no scientific data to justify such a statement. He submitted of ex- a number of log books, and,, according to the notes of proceedingsThese documents indicated that signals had Kingdom been read from some of the European and American stations for a certain number of hours per day, but, unfortunately, no proknow- longed interception was made of any particular station. There was also a significant fact which noted in these logs of the very many requests sent out by trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific stations for repeats of messages transmitted been from points within comparatively short disChamber. tances, betokening the serious efiects of some to interfering agencies. Then the committee called Mr Coffey, of the Radio Department of the Post Office, who submitted a series of concrete their results of communications of this kind. It will be found, on turning to page 17 of the report, that at that stage there was no historic record of anything approaching a satisfactory commercial service of the nature for which we were bargaining. I recall these facts now because, while the Managing Director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited declared at that time that this system was so firmly established that it only awaited the necessary capital to enable it to be put into operation, the fact remains that even at the present time there is no scientific data upon which any sensible person would conclude that a commercial service of the kind promised could, be furnished.",29
96,Mr MAKIN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The contrary, rather, is the case.",32
97,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"That is so. I need hardly say that Mr Fisk, in making his declarations of the competency of Amalgamated Wireless Limited to "" deliver the goods,"" was obviously influenced by an intense desire to have £500,000 of Commonwealth money put into an undertaking which at that time had a capital, at the most, of £200,000. I propose to endeavour to show that that capital was largely of a fictitious character, and probably did not amount to as much as even £100,000. In addition to the Commonwealth, under the agreement, putting half a million into the company, the latter was to take over the Government plant at a valuation. If we turn to clause 6 of the agreement, which was executed on the 28th March, 1922-a n agreement approved of by the majority of the committee, although I , as a member of it , did not approve of it-w e find that the company was to take over the following:0. The sites, buildings, masts, plant and other assets of the stations, to be taken over by the company in accordance with paragraph h of clause 5 of this agreement, shall be taken over at a valuation to be made by a committee including two representatives of the company and two representatives of the Commonwealth, with an independent chairman to b« agreed upon by the other four representatives or a majority of them, and in default of agreement to be determined by arbitration in the manner provided by clause 20 of this agreement, the basis of valuation shall be the value of the assets for the purpose of supplying the new service to be undertaken by the company in pursuance of this agreement. Thi amount of the valuation shall bo credited to the Commonwealth in part payment for the 500.001 shares to be allotted to the Commonwealth and shall be deducted from the last payments of capital to be made by the Commonwealth. Under clause 5 the company undertook 5. In particular the company will forthwith undertake the following programme:(a) To construct, maintain, and operate in Australia the necessary stations and equipment for a direct com : mercial wireless service between Australia and the United Kingdom; (6) To provide and operate a system of feeder stations for wireless connection between the main high-power stations and the capital cities of all the States; (o) To equip and organise the feeder stations so as to provide communication with merchant ships around the coast of Australia; (d) To arrange that the rates to be charged lor messages between Australia and the United Kingdom transmitted or received by the company shall not exceed the following:Proposed Wireless Rates. Full rate messages, 2s. per word. Deferred messages, Is. per word. Week-end messages, 6d. (minimum, 10s. per message). Government messages, Is. per word. Press messages, 5d. per word. Deferred press messages, 3d. per word. (c) To arrange for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in the United Kingdom; (/) To provide the main trunk stations in Australia and the United Kingdom within two years from the date of this agreement; {g) To arrange within two years from the date of this agreement for the erection and operation of a station in Canada capable of commercial communication with the high-power station in Australia, and so equipped as to afford facilities for distributing traffic throughout .N(*rth America. Those were the main undertakings of the company; but, of course, it had become obvious to the committee and to the Prime Minister that it was rclle to enter into an agreement with an optimistic gentleman such as the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited without substantial guarantees, particularly in view of the facts elicited by the committee, not with the aid of Mr Fisk, but in spite of him, as to the technical and scientific difficulties in the way. The Prime Minister, who was chairman of the committee, and became Treasurer at about that time, was probably the mo3t insistent member in exacting guarantees from the company. I mention that, cause history discloses that, although was the strongest, as chairman of the committee, in standing for guarantees, as Prime Minister he has been the the weakest in giving them away. At the top of page 10 of the agreement we read "" That the company shall not enter into or be a party to any commercial trust combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business."" pass on with the single remark that undertaking also has been broken. That was the subject of some comment, and many questions were repeatedly asked myself and other honourable members as to when the company would proceed to ' ' deliver the goods."" The Prime Minister, in reviewing the matter afterwards, when many extensions of timcj for which there did not appear to be any justification had been granted, said that the tender of the Marconi Company was accepted in September, 1923, and that it contemless plated the erection in Australia of a station with 20 masts, each 800 feet high, at an approximate cost of £480,000. It was at that stage that the Marconi and Trust first came before the footlights. Members of the Labour party had suslowing pected, and alleged, that Amalgamated ""Wireless Limited was an agent of the act: Marconi Trust, although it did not appear in that light in the agreement with Commonwealth. On the contrary, we agreement, namely:were to have an all-Australian and British company, which was not to be associated with any trust. If Amalgamated Wireless Limited was not to operate the stations, why did it enter into the agreement the Commonwealth for their erection and for the ""delivery of the goods?"" Most naturally, and as we had suspected it would, it immediately entered into an agreement with the Marconi trust. Tenders were called for, and were returnable at such short notice that it was perfectly obvious that only the Marconi trust, which had the fullest information on the matter, could possibly tender. We appealed to the Government to grant an extension of fcime afc least for the acceptance of tenders, but it said, "" No ; the matter is too urgent to grant an extension of time for even a few weeks."" But it was not too urgent to extend the time for months and years to satisfy this comAfr. Brennan. bepany. Of course, Amalgamated Wireless he Limited may as well have entered into an agreement with itself, or at least with ""' father."" We recognize that, apart from financial g if t of this generous Government, Amalgamated Wireless L i m i ted is insignificant in comparison with the Marconi trust. The two companies are or substantially one, or so closely akin as to make the difference between them 1 negligible. At all events, an agreement that was made under which the Marconi trust undertook to build stations and to give us the specified commercial service. by Subsequently, according to practice, it applied for an extension of time. When I submitted to the Prime M i nister a question as to whether, in view of the repeated failure of the Marconi trust to carry out its contract, he would cancel the agreement, as he had every right to do, he said that he had no intention of doing so-. Then came the anti-climax, the introduction of the WireAgreement Bill , in 1924, which subsequently became an act of this Parliament, the effect of which, to sum it all up, was to confirm the company in all its rights, to relieve it of ail its material obligations. That is clearly shown by the folclause, which appears in the new .agreement, which is the schedule to the The company shall be relieved from the the following obligations under the principal (a) Its obligation to arrange for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in the TJnited Kingdom under sub-clause (e) of clause 5 of the principal agreement; (5) its obligation under sub-clause (d) of with clause 5 of the principal agreement to arrange the rates to be charged for messages between Australia and the United Kingdom transmitted or received by the company; (o) its obligation to provide a main trunk station in the United Kingdom in pursuance of sub-clause (/) of clause 5 of the principal agreement; (d) its obligation to arrange for the erection and operation of a station in Canada in accordance with subclause {g) of clause 5 of the principal agreement; (e) its obligation under clause 12 of the principal agreement to enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of stations in the United Kingdom and Canada in pursuance of sub-clauses (/) and [g) of clause 5 of the principal agreement; (/) its guarantee, referred to in clause 12 of the principal agreement, to make provision for a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the TJnited Kingdom and Canada hereinbefore referred to. That gives away without consideration everything that the right honourable gentleman had taken such pains to secure, and upon which he had prided himself so much and so justifiably, i u connection with the work of the committee. It is true that' that measure is an act of Parliament, and it is not for me to quarrel with the wisdom of Parliament in passing it ; but it is for me, in giving the history of this matter, to state that what was done then was done through this Government misrepresenting the position. The Prime Minister, in introducing that bill, which was to relieve the company of its obligations, said that the new beam system that had been invented had completely revolutionized wireless, and changed the whole aspect of this matter. In passing, I make the following comment on that statement. First of all, so far from the beam system being new in 1924, Marconi had applied for a patent for it in 1917, and his application was rejected on the ground of want of novelty. As for the system revolutionizing wireless, the fact is that neither by the beam nor the high-power system has it yet been demonstrated that a commercial service is possible. One admitted fact about the beam system is that, if it meant anything at all, it meant cheaper and lower-powered stations and less expense. But the company, instead of requiring less and giving more, is giving less and requiring more. In fact, it is requiring the whole of the £500,000 which this Commonwealth so unwisely contracted to give. On the 28th August, 1924, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) asked the Prime Minister the following pertinent questions in regard to the matter.:1. Whether the full sum of £500,001 has paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limited for the 500,001 shares? 2. If the full sum has not been paid, amount has been paid? 3. Will the saving effected by the erection of a beam instead of a high power station any effect on the Government's liability in purpose connection with this company ? 4. Will the change of system result in money being required from the Commonwealth Government? To which the Prime Minister replied1. No. 2. £112,500 48. 6d., representing called-up capital to the amount of is. 6d. a share. 3. If it is found that the beam system will meet ultimate requirements, the Government's liability might be expected to be less than it otherwise would have been. 4. See No. 3. That was a very subtle jest from such an unlikely quarter. The Prime Minister said, in effect, "" If the cost is less, it will cost us less "" ; but he was not quite sure about it . The evidence before us at that time was that a beam station was being erected in England for about £36,000. Yet under the new agreement with the Amalgamted Wireless Limited, beam stations to be erected in Australia were estimated to cost the extravagant maximum of £120,000. The reason that the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited wanted the £500,001 was that he intended to spend £480,000 on a high-powered station. In the light of the facts before us, £120,000 was undoubtedly an extravagant maximum for a beam station; but it certainly gave opportunity for much saving as against £480,000 for a high-power station. A little later I shall suggest some reasons for' requiring the larger sum, but I wish to return for a few moments to the new wireless agreement of 1924, in which the managing director set out the excuses, rather than the reasons, which the company gave for asking, and asking not in vain, to be relieved of its obligations. These are set out in the preamble of the act as follows:Whereas at the time of the making of the principal agreement the parties thereto believed that the British Government would be ready and willing to grant licences for the erection and operation of a trunk station and other stations in the United Kingdom for communication with Australia: And whereas the British Government refuses to grant been licences for the erection and operation of commercial wireless stations in the United Kingdom, with a view to communication with what Australia, and the Marconi Company is by reason thereof unable to obtain the necessary licence to erect or operate the said trunk have stations in the United Kingdom for that less It was said, in effect, that the company wasled - to believe that the British Government would issue licences for the erection of these stations in England, and that, by not doing so, it had deceived the company. I wish to say that successive British governments have made it perfectly clear that they would not give a licence to the Marconi trust to control wireless traffic with Australia. It is equally certain, on the other, hand, that the British Government would at any time issue a licence to this Government to erect and operate stations in England for the purpose of communication with Australia. Although I am not aware that I am famous for having placed any stones in the temple of Empire, I must say that it is a very poor compliment to British governments, whether Labour, Liberal, or Conservative, to allege that they have, in a churlish way, stood in the light of Australia providing . inter-Empire wireless communication. There is not a single historical fact upon which such a. charge could be justly made, though there aro abundant facts to show that various British Governments have regarded the operations of this partly German, partly American, and partly Italian and French trust as being inimical to Britain. I think they rightly refused, in our interests as well as their own, to allow it to be the sole controlling agency of wireless communication with-Australia.",32
98,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The honourable member should know that the British Government has refused equally to grant licences to the Australian Government, Amalgamated Wireless Limited, or anyone else, and that it says the business should be managed through the post office.",35
99,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The British _ Government's contention is that the business must he controlled by the British Government itself. Does the right honourable gentleman expect to be allowed to establish in the heart of Britain power stations that are not subject to the control and supervision of the British Government? Would we allow Great Britain, or any other country, to construct in Australia, for the purpose of communication with the world, stations over which we had no control? And would be allow a foreign trust to do so? Assuredly we would not.",35
100,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Licence s are granted by the British Government for communication with foreign countries. ' Mr BRENNAN - I know that; but they are limited in number and purpose, and are under strict British supervision.",35
101,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The Marconi company has a licence to communicate with foreign countries.,35
102,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"But it is a limited licence, and the operations of the company are under the supervision of the British Government. The right of a foreigner in Great Britain to communicate, under supervision, with foreigners, is decidedly different from the right of the Marconi trust to control inter-Empire communication.",35
103,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,No one has asked for that.,35
104,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The right honourable gentleman has said that it was a breach of faith by the British Government that prevented the Marconi trust from carrying out its obligations. He cannot substantiate that statement. The Honorary Minister (Mr Marr), when he was seeking to discredit me and others who had spoken on this subject, raised the poiut just mentioned by the Prime Minister. He introduced his speech with the observation that "" Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,"" and he very soon proved that he was no angel. The Marconi trust has been allowed to erect a station in England, as has been frequently mentioned; but the conditions are that the station is not to cost more than £50,000, that it is to be subject to British control, and that it is to be built on the principle of ""no goods no payment."" I find nothing in the conditions applicable to that station about relieving the Marconi trust of its obligations. The Prime Minister, on the 28th August, 1924, in supporting the - view that the British Government had broken faith, - saidMr Bonar Law, the then Prime Minister of Great Britain, made a statement that has always been interpreted to mean that the British Government was prepared to alter ita policy in regard to the issue of licences to private companies or individuals for the erection of stations for communication with the dominions. He saidIt was not considered any longer necessary to exclude private enterprise from participating in wireless within the Empire, and the Government were ready to issue licences for wireless stations in this country for communication with the dominions, colonies, and foreign countries, subject to the conditions necessary, and subject to Great Britain controlling the suitable arrangements for the working of the traffic. The quotation from a speech by Mr Bonar Law is the modified declaration upon which the Prime M in ister relies for proof of his statement that the British has broken f a it h . The attitude of the B r it i sh Government has been the same throughout. One peculiarity of the second broken agreement;-whic h does not, by the way, entirely abrogate the previous agreement-is that the Parliament was asked to give these concessions on condition that the company entered into further agreements with other companies to supply the service. Clause 3 of the agreement readsUpon the company entering into an agreement(a) providing to the satisfaction of the representatives of the Commonwealth and the board of directors of the company for the erection in Australia of a main trunk station capable of providing (as soon as a suitable corresponding station has been erected in the United Kingdom and/or Canada) a commercial wireless service to communicate with such corresponding stations with a traffic capacity as regards each' of such corresponding stations of at least twenty-one thousand hundred (21,600) words per day each way for three hundred (300) days per year at an estimated capital cost not exceeding one hundred and twenty thousand pounds (£120,000) - Mr BRENNAN (6) containing guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the board of directors for the erection of the said main trunk station and for its capability to provide the service stipulated in the last preceding paragraph; the company shall be relieved of the following obligations under the Principal Agreement. That is the same arrangement as before. The company was to agree, and the GoAmalgamated Wireless, in 1921. vernment was to have guarantees; and the Government signed the agreement cheerfully. The guarantee was entered when int o by the company, and subsequently dishonoured. The Leader of the Opposidom tion (Mr Charlton) asked some questions of the Prime Minister on the 3rd June, of the present year-this brings us up to date-and they were answered on the 14th June. The first of those questions wasIs it a fact that the contract signed in January, 1025, between the Amalgamated Wireless Company and the Marconi Company for the erection of beam wireless stations in Australia contained a provision for the completion of the stations within nine months of Government the sites being available? Honourable members will understand that the agreement referred to was that which the relieving bill required the company to enter into to secure the service. The answer to the question was- "" Yes."" Therefore, it is a fact that the contract signed in January, 1925, provided for the erection of the beam wireless station within nine months of the site being made available. The next question asked by the Leader of the Oppositon wasWhen were the sites made available? And the answer was1st May, 1925. If we add nine months to May, 1925, we arriveat the time when we were to have a service of 21,600 words both. ways. The third question wasWhat are the reasons for the long delay in the completion of the stations in Australia and in England? The answer was another gemsix The delays are due to a variety of causes beyond the control of the Amalgamated WirelesB Company.",35
105,Mr SCULLIN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"What were those causes ? - Who knows? The fourth question wasIs there any foundation for the statement that grave technical defects in the beam wireless system may cause a radical alteration In the system? And to that the Prime Minister repliedI am advised that the statement is without foundation, and that all technical difficulties have been solved. The technical difficulties had been solved, according to the managing, director of The Leader of the Opposition further askedWill the Prime Minister inform the House it may be expected that the direct ser; vices between Australia and the United King: and Canada will be commenced? The Prime Minister's reply to that question wasThis question has been referred by cable to the Marconi Company, who are the tractors for the erection of the station, and the following is their reply:-""Coa l strike causing great difficulty in obtaining supplies of march of scientific progress. materials necessary for completion stations. In consequence of this, regret cannot anticipate communication will be it effected between England and Australia until some date - in October, and Australia and in Canada until end November or 'beginning December.""

Something, has been done. Stations erected at Kockbank and but no service is available. honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) asked what were the causes beyond the control of Amalgamated Wireless No one knows. It is probably true that this Parliament. there are causes beyond the control, beyond the knowledge, of that firm. Beam wireless had not been sufficiently veloped scientifically to enable the comHe askedpany to pledge itself, and to pledge the Commonwealth in the way it was allowed to do in 1921; and the position was pracment tically Tmartered' in 1924. Still this comaudited pany hoodwinks the Government with proof the company? mises that it knows it cannot fulfil, or at The reply was the best hopes that it may be able to fulfil.

Fisk, had understated the difficulties, and had attempted to mislead the committee regarding them. Itknew, or ought have known,, when it entered into the second agreement, that the position was practically unchanged.

I find amongst the assets of the company '* Patent rights, £ 9 3 , 0 0 0 ."" that item. I say that when the committee considered this question in 1921 it had expert evidence before it to show that many of the patents claimed by the Marconi trust were either expired and valueless, or were at least contested. evidence of which the committee took serious notice that claims made as to the value of Marconi's patents were grossly exaggerated. I ask the Prime Minister whether any one has examined the value of these patents alleged to be worth £93,000. The Commonwealth is the principal shareholder in Amalgamated Wireless Limited. On paper it has 50 per cent., and one more of the shares. I venture to say that the Commonwealth owns four-fifths of the capital actually in vested. Surely we should know something about the value of these patents, especially in the light of the history of that matter, and also because when it was before Parliament on a previous occasion a very interesting address was given by Senator Millen, to whom I have just referred. Referring to the history of actions brought by the Marconi trust against the Commonwealth, he pointed out that we had brought Mr Swinburne, an expert from England, to examine the authenticity of the patents claimed by the Marconi' trust, and that gentleman had reported favourably to the Commonwealth in the action then brought against it by that very trust. In spite of that fact the Government of the time unloaded a good deal of Commonwealth money under pressure.of an action by the trust on whom it is now dependent. Senator Duncan, interjecting in the course of Senator Millen's speech, and referring to the Marconi trust, saidYou did not know what sharp people you were dealing with. Senator Millen repliedThere is not a shadow of doubt about that. We did not; and in view of this sharp practice so many of us have lost all faith in the propositions that the Government would be well advised to tear up the whole agreement and end the' business. I have That was advice fro m a friend.

Here is another item from the balance-sheet"" War loan bonds and fixed deposits£36,000."" I take no exception to that. . It is gratifying to know that some of the money we put into this business is in vested in safe securities. I quote again from the balance-sheet;-'. ' Cost to date of establishment of new £ 1 1 9 , 9 4 8 . "" Then there is an amount for cash in hand, profit"" and loss account. The most interesting item of this balance-sheet is "" Operating expenses, directors' and auditors' fees, and general administrative expenses, £ 1 2 8 , 2 9 1 . "" Mr E . RILEY - Is that for one year?",38
110,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"So the balance sheet says. It is for the year ended the 30th June, 1925. Mr E . RILEY - That needs inquiry.",39
111,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I can suggest some explanation for it . It possibly occurs in this way: In the report we find that the chairman and managing director "" are at present abroad arranging agreements."" In another report I find these wordsOur company's managing director has recently returned with his staff. During the year they investigated the latest high power commercial wireless telegraph service, the latest developments in wireless telephony and broadcasting, and also the latest manufacturing methods in Britain, on the Continent, and in America. ' They made arrangements valuable to the company's business, and they brought back much information the value of which is very high. But, apparently, not capable of being assessed at £128,291 . I give the figures as they appear before me in a copy of the balance-sheet, but they may be subject to correction. In any case, they seem almost incredible. Even if they should turn out to be incorrect, the fact remains that the whole of the management and its staff are under no responsibility to this Parliament. The managing director is probably receiving a salary - I hazard the guess-of £3,000 and £4,000 a year. a judge is appointed to the H i gh Court of the Commonwealth at a salary of £3,000 a year, one of the highest appointments in the g if t of this Parliament, he is subject to the ultimate control of the Parliament. Every member of the Public Service passes, as to his salary, under review before this Parliament every year before a penny can be paid to him ; but the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited has no responsibility whatever to this Parliament. We have no control over Mr . Fisk. He gambols like an irresponsible bellwether in the rich pastures which the Commonwealth provides for him, but, by a most unnatural inversion of the usual order, instead of yielding himself to the service- shears of the Commonwealth taxpayer,, the taxpayer has to yield himself to Mr Fisk, to be shorn in due course. In Queen-street, Melbourne, and in Yorkstreet, Sydney,, are immense buildings 1 erected by Amalgamated Wireless Limited , and in them a staff of workers is engaged carrying on business and selling the manufactures of that company. We know nothing about them, who they are, what they do, or how they are paid. We know nothing about any system of bonuses, gifts, or graft which exists between the managing director and any other person. We only know that we have invested £500,001 in this company, and that those who contracted to deliver the goods have flagrantly dishonoured their undertakings. Is it not time that the Commonwealth Government was censured for this? In 1924 we made out a case respecting the then broken agreements, and the Prime Minister then succeeded in obtaining the vote of the majority of honourable members on this side of the House by virtue of the new guarantees which he was able to secure for their acceptance. Now after two years of f u t i l it y on the part of the company, the Government should be prenared to admit that we have made out a case. Surely it will either retrace its steps, and relinquish the business altogether, or at least put the cards on the table, and let us investigate the facts. I do not believe, on the facts before us, that Amalgamated Wireless Limite d has £50,000 of assets, apart from our money. The money in the company,- for all practical purposes, is ours. The honourable between member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), to When whose diligence I am indebted for some of my information, asked several questions in the House the other day. He asked, "" What amount has been paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limite d for working expenses to 30th June, 1926 ?"" The answer was, "" £251,958 l is . 9 d . "" He asked,. "" What is the total amount that has - been paid to the capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited to 30th June, 1926?"" The answer was ""£250,000 10s."" He asked, "" What is the total amount that the Government has received from Amalgamated Wireless Limite d to 30th Junej 1926?"" The answer was £106,228 l is . lOd. That leaves a debit balance of £145,729 19s. l i d . The honourable member for Hindmarsh asked, "" Do the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless Limited share equally in any profits received from the transactions of the partnership %"" The answer was, "" The wealth Government, as holder of 500,001 shares in the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited , will receive just over half of the profits of the Company, if any."" The honourable member for Hindmarsh asked, ""Does the Commonwealth Government accept full liability for the losses in the business transactions of the partnership in wireless matters between the Amalgamated Wireless Limited / and the Commonwealth Government ? "" The answer was, "" No, the only losses the Commonwealth Government would bear would be those as a shareholder in the Company.'] That is not very consoling to us. To bring the matter absolutely up to date, we find in the Estimates, page 405, under the Postmaster-General's Department, the item, "" Subscription to capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited 1926-27, £250,001; erection of wireless stations and testing and experimental equipment, £2,000."" seems to me that we not only paid up in full , but have exceeded our liability of £500,000.",39
112,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,That item has nothing to do with Amalgamated Wireless Limited .,40
113,Mr BEENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The total amount to be subscribed is £500,001. The total of him in making this bargain. amount subscribed to the 30th June, 1926, including £50,000 paid from revenue 1921-22, was £250,000. The total subWhen scription to the 30th June, 1927, is estiaway mated at £500,001. No goods have been received, and yet the capital is to be full y paid up. There is no guarantee any value in return, because repeated guarantees of defaulting debtors are of no use. There is no guarantee that vernment has to justify its actions. the goods will be delivered. Those honorshall able members who have cared to inquire, know that no guarantee can be given cause there is no scientific knowledge to justify a guarantee of the kind. company goes its way, and carries on its business in its palatial places in * and Queen streets. It levies a toll of for every 25s. that private individuals throughout Australia pay for their wireless licences. It levies toll upon the strength of its patents. I challenge the value of its patents, and its right to make these exactions on the people of Australia.",40
114,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The honourable member Common- will agree that as that matter is the subject of inquiry it cannot be discussed.,40
115,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I believe it to be a dishonest transaction, but if the matter is sub judice, I leave it at that. It will probably be said that we have Commonwealth representatives on the board. We have, but who are they and to what extent are they answerable to us? They join the board and hear the announcements of the managing director-the gentleman who toured America and the Continent with his staff-and with the other directors they say "" Aye "" to his recommendations. They draw their fees and depart. To what other extent are they responsible to us? We can no doubt recall them, but we have no supervision of them, no means of knowing what they do, or what are the impulses which move them when they meet on a directorate. From every point of view it is high time that we called a halt respecting Amalgamated Wireless Limited. It would be It generous and veracious for the Government at least to admit that it has made a mistake. I would feel much more respect for the Prime Minister, for whom at present I certainly entertain great respect, if he would candidly admit that he has been taken in , and that the influence of the Marconi Trust has been too subtle for him, having got the best He should take the opportunity which now in presents itself to cancel the agreement. this Government keeps on giving concessions to a contracting party, concessions which have a monetary value, it is doing politically as dishonest a thing of as if it were dipping its hands into the the Treasury and paying out the cash of the Commonwealth to that party. The GoT. take the opportunity to check the figures that I have quoted, one item of bewhich is enormous, and may conceivably be a typographical error but, whether it is This so or not, the principle is not affected. The Government deserves the severest censure York of this House for investing large sums 5s. of money in a public company on a purely experimental and speculative enterprise; - for entering into a fresh agreement with a defaulting party to a previous agreement, without obtaining adequate security for the interests of the Commonwealth in either agreement; for not attempting to enforce such agreement; for not investigating the real value of the alleged capital of the other contracting party; for paying into the company large sums of money in excess of its proven requirements, without audit or investigation as to how its moneys have been spent; and for allowing the company improperly to levy toll on the general public in respect of broadcasting.",40
116,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for .External Affairs) [5.28] - I have heard the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) speak on many occasions in regard to wireless, and today I anticipated that in view of the all-embracing character of the amendment that he has moved, his speech would comtain some substance, and constitute at least what might be termed an indictment of the Government and its action. actually he said nothing that be has not said many times before, and which he did not mention on a censure motion moved on a previous occasion. however, necessary that I should deal again with the subjects raised by the honourable member. He referred to the beginning of the transaction under review, when an agreement' was placed on the table of this House for the establishment .of a high-powered station in Australia, and the investment by the Commonwealth Government of £500,000 in Amalgamated Wireless Limited . agreement was the subject of investigation by a committee of which I was chairman, and the honourable gentleman a member. When we began our investigations we found that long-distance wireless on a commercial basis was not quite so simple and so sure as certain persons appeared to think. We had to investigate the technical possibilities of less for a distance as great as that between Great Britain and Australia. After hearing a great deal of evidence, the committee came to the conclusion that there was a prospect of a service being established and maintained between Great B r it a in and Australia, and, having regard to the tremendous importance to Australia of new and improved methods of communication, it recommended the agreement for acceptance, subject to certain modifications. To all the proceedings of the committee the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was a party. He was one of the two lawyers who drafted the amended agreement, and at that time he gave no indication of dissent from the views of the majorit y of the committee. When the investigation had been completed, and every member of the committee was under the impression that the modified agreement had received unanimous approval, the honourable member forwarded a dissenting report. The honourable member had had ample opportunity to raise many of the objections which he has voiced today, but the only question to which he addressed himself was whether the patents which Amalgamated Wireless Limite d claimed to own were of the value stated in its balance-sheet. If the honourable member was at that time seized of the importance of the matters with which he has dealt today he should have But brought them before the committee. The fact that he failed to do so is evidence that these criticisms are mere afterthoughts. The real substance of the It is, honourable member's objection to the agreement has always been that the control of wireless services should be retained by the postal department, and that no contract should be let to any p r i vate company. That view the honourable member is quite entitled to hold, but the majority of honourable members of this Parliament in 1921 did not agree with him, and decided to r at if y the agreement That with Amalgamated Wireless Limited . To-day the honourable member has told us that we should have examined the assets of the company in order to ascertain whether they actually held the patents, land, and other things which they claim to possess. The honourable member did not make that suggestion in 1921, probably because he knew perfectly wire- well that such a course of action would be ludicrous. When he is thinking of investing a portion of that surplus wealth that I hope he possesses in a. company, the balance-sheet of which, duly certified by a reputable firm of auditors, he has studied, does he proceed to inspect the title deeds of the land which the company is supposed to hold, and does he appoint a valuator to check the values set down in the statement of assets and liabilities? Of course not, and the honourable member was talking arrant nonsense when he suggested that the Government should have made such an inquiry in regard to"" Amalgamated ""Wireless Limited . In dealing with the original agreement he referred particularly to paragraph 6, which contemplated the taking over by the company of the coastal wireless stations which had been, up to that time, operated by the postal department. This clause of the agreement provided that representatives of both parties should be appointed to value the assets to be taken over, and if they could not agree upon a valuation, an independent chairman should be appointed. The Commonwealth was to be entitled to set against its subscription to the company the amount of the valuation finally agreed upon. The honourable member for Batman wrongly said that nothing has been done to give effect to that provision of the agreement. Representatives of the parties did examine the stations and plant. Naturally their valuations d if -. fered, and Mr Swanton, an independent expert, was appointed to adjudicate between them. Thus all the requirements of paragraph 6 have been complied with .",41
117,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The Prime Minister is speaking of the Commonwealth's plant. I said that the Government did not analyze the value of the company's plant.,42
118,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,I have dealt with plant of the company.,42
119,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The right honourable gentleman does not answer my criticism merely by declaring it to be arrant sense.,42
120,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I indicated that when the honourable member served on the comstacles mittee he completely forgot to give any of the admirable advice he has given day. In regard to the high-power stathere tion and the maintenance of an overseas service, the agreement provided that the company should construct and maintain a high-power station in Australia and reciprocal stations in Great Britain Canada. Tenders for the erection of Australian station were called. The orable member for Batman said that i sufficient time was allowed for tenders be. received, with the result that only the Empire. Marconi Company could tender. That an old charge that has been refuted previous occasions. The main point the honourable member's criticism today [170] was that Amalgamated Wireless Limite d was relieved of its obligations under the agreement, and that the Marconi Company was relieved of its contract to erect a station in Great Britain . He said that the act passed in 1924 confirmed Amalgamated Wireless Limited in all its rights, and relieved it of all its obligations. A f t e r tenders had been invited in the ordinary way, a contract was made by Amalgamated Wireless Limited with the Marconi Company for the erection of a high-power station in Australia. One very prudent condition of the contract with the Marconi Company was that Amalgamated Wireless Limited required it to take over the obligation to provide a reciprocal station in Great Britain . Both when the original agreement was made, and subsequently when the contract was let to the Marconi Company, it was believed that the British Government would be prepared to issue a licence for the erection and maintenance of a high power station in Great Britain. The honourable member for Batman had a good deal to say about the British Government's refusal to do that. One of the witnesses before the select committee was the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr . Hughes), who stated that the institution of a chain system of wireless, which in volved the erection of a series of stations each with a radius of 2,000 miles, had the been discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1921, He had declared that such a system would 'not suit Australia, which proposed to endeavour to establish direct nonwireless communication with the United Kingdom, and the British Government had indicated that it would place no obi n the way of the establishment of the necessary station. The right honortoable member told the committee that was not the least shadow of doubt that the erection of such a station would be permitted, and that the station would be licensed by the British Government. Subsequent history disproved that stateand ment. Mr Bonar Law had made a statethe ment in the House of Commons that the honBritish Government was prepared to n - issue licences for the erection of to stations for communication with in the The subsequent ' actions of is the Commonwealth "" Gbvernment and on Amalgamated Wireless Limited were of based upon that assurance. Later, however,"" the British Government declined to act in accordance with the promise given by Mr Bonar Law on behalf of his for Ministry, and declared that no licence would be issued for a high-power wireless station communicating within the Empire. I stress the words "" within the Empire."" When that happened, it was obvious that we could not hold the company to the obcountries, ligation to provide, equip, and operate a lar licence. station in Great Britain. Consequently, the 1924 agreement was drawn up, and was endorsed by this Parliament. agreement relieved Amalgamated Wireless Limited of an obligation which it was i m possible for it to fulfil , because of the action of the British Government. Does anybody suggest that there is anything sinister in the fact that the company not held to its contract, and that damages were not sought for the non-fulfilment terms that could not be carried out ? That is my first reply to the statement that agreement was one to confirm the pany in all its rights and to relieve all its obligations. The suggestion ludicrous. I am amazed that an honourable memsinister ber should take up the attitude that honourable member for Batman (Mr Brenthat nan) assumed regarding the British Golicence vernment's action in the matter licences. His enthusiastic support of action was due to his wish to suggest there was some sinister connection the Commonwealth Government Marconi Company. He wished it to be inferred that the British"" Government saw through the Marconi Company, and was determined not to grant it a licence. suggested this, and tried to establish connection between the Government and the Marconi in order that he might do harm to the preslightest sent administration. I ask the honourable member to reflect whether, knowing the circumstances as he did, that was a proper thing for him to do. As a matter of fact the Marconi Company today has a licence from the British Government to commuago. nicate by wireless in Great Britain foreign countries. But the British vernment has said to Australia and the other dominions, "" We shall not grant licence to you or to any to communicate by wireless from stations in Great Britain."" Personally, taken a determined attitude on that ter, and I propose to continue to do I recognize that every government Mr Bruce. titled to say who shall receive a licence wireless transmission within its territory; but the protest that I have made, and will continue to make, is against the action of the British Government in - granting licences in Great Britain for wireless ' communication with foreign and refusing to give us a simi",42
121,Mr MAKIN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Can the right honourable it gentleman say why the British GovernThat ment will not grant this licence!,43
122,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"It wishes to retain control of wireless within the Empire. We have indicated our willingness to give any guarantees, and abide by any conditions was intended to safeguard Empire communication, that the British Government may of choose to prescribe; but we do not subscribe to the view that the whole of our the business should be conducted through comthe British Post Office while wirei t of less communication between other counis tries may be conducted through other agencies to which licences have been issued. The honourable member, however, suggested that there was some connection between this Govern the ment and the Marconi Company, and the reason why we could not obtain a from the B r it is h Government was of that that Government was suspicious of that the Marconi Company, with which the that Commonwealth Government appeared to between be so friendly. For that suggestion, and the there is not the slightest foundation. The other matter that the honourable member emphasized was the cancellation He of the original contract for the establisha ment of a high-power station and the Commonwealth substitution of a beam station in its place. Company He suggested that there - was not the ground for believing that a beam station would be a success, and spoke as though the conditions - relating to wireless were exactly the same now as they were three or f o ur . years The fact is that great adwith vances have been made, and it cannot Go-' now be disputed that the beam system is successful, and can be operated over great a distances. To have persisted in the oricompany ginal proposal to erect a high-power station, at a cost of nearly £500,000, in I have stead of substituting for it a beam station matat a maximum cost of £120,000, would so. have meant ignoring these advances in is enwireless communication.",43
123,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Why do wireless stations cost four times as much in Great Britain as they do in Australia?,44
124,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"They do not. The British station was to cost £44,920, if a public electrical supply was available, or £50,420 if that was not available. The figure mentioned by the honourable member for Batman was not the correct one. The honourable member spoke about Australian material in a manner intended to prejudice the fair consideration of the whole matter, and therefore it is necessary for me to give the exact facts. When the question of supplying Australian material arose, the chairman of the board, who is one of the directors nominated by the Government, communicated with the Ministry and asked what was its attitude on the matter. I replied that the directors should ensure that the same system was. adopted in regard to purchases by Amalgamated Wireless Limited as operated in Commonwealth departments; that a certain preference, in addition to the tariff protection, was to be given. The actual amount of the preference was indicated, but, for obvious reasons, it is not desirable that it should be made public. There is no justification for the suggestion that all the material was to be imported, and that Australian industries were to be overlooked. The honourable member referred to the fees paid to the board of directors. He took the balance sheet and quoted the sum of £128,000 which appeared on the expenditure side in the ordinary trading account. He did not explain that that figure represented the expenditure for the conduct of the business of the company for a year, nor did he quote figures from the other side of the balance-sheet showing what business had been done. In the accounts of even the most successful trading concern, the expenditure is affected by the quantity of business done ; but the honourable member tried to give the impression that this £128,000 was made up of excessive travelling fees paid to directors and other improper items. In the Wireless Agreement Act it is provided that three of the directors of the company shall represent the Commonmonwealth and three other directors the old company, and that there shall be a seventh director, but it is not provided that the seventh director shall be the chairman. At the present time, the Government directors are Sir George Mason Allard, Sir William Vicars, and Senator J. D. Millen. The honourable member quoted with a good deal of approval the ojjinions of Senator Millen, and he is probably convinced that the interests of the Commonwealth are fairly well safeguarded by having Senator Millen on the board. There are three other directors representing the shareholders in the old company, and the seventh director is the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who was appointed to the board when Prime Minister, and when great difficulty was experienced in obtaining a seventh director acceptable to both sides. The chairman of the board is Sir George Mason Allard, a director nominated by the Government. That fact should convince the committee that the Government's interests are fairly well represented. The chairman was elected by the vote of the whole board. Another point that the honourable member dealt with had reference to patents. I shall not deal at length with that matter at present, for legal actions are pending, both with regard to patents for transmission, such as would interest broadcasting companies, and patents with regard to reception which would apply to receiving sets owned by individuals. It was extraordinarily improper for a member of the House to enter upon a discussion of the matter seeing that it is sub judice. Although one might forgive the ordinary lay member, it is difficult to forgive a member who is a legal practitioner, for having expressed the opinion that the honourable member for. Batman did in the few words he said about the patents owned by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, especially as he had no personal knowledge of them.",44
125,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,I had knowledge of them long before the litigation commenced.,44
126,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Althoug h the validity of these patents is the subject-matter of action in our law courts, the honourable member, notwithstanding that he is a lawyer, did not hesitate to suggest that the patents of Amalgamated Wireless Limited were worthless. It was extremely improper for him to do so. Another matter which the honourable gentleman presented to the committee-as he always does in these circumstances i way that suits him , and irrespective the facts of the case-ha d relation to amount which had been paid by the Gocalled vernment to Amalgamated Wireless Limited in connection with the operation of our coastal stations. A f t e r the agreepany ment was entered into with Amalgamated Wireless Limited the coastal stations, conducted by the Government, were handed over to the company to work on up behalf of the Government, but the Government accepted for three years the responsibility for the actual operating losses. On this point the following questions were asked me in this HouseWhat amount has been paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limited for working expenses to the 30th June, 19261 What is the total amount that the Government has received from the rewas about £200,000. ceipts of Amalgamated Wireless Limited to the 30th June, 1926? My replies were-£251,958 and £106,228 lis. lOd. Those figures show that the paid out £147,729 19s. lid. more than was received, or something like a year under this heading. The able member for Batman told the comscribed by the other shareholders. mittee, on the strength of figures that quoted, that this was a fairly good thing for Amalgamated Wireless Limited, an amazing undertaking for the ment. The honourable member member of the Wireless Committee, and he knows, what is not known to the majority of honourable members of committee, that prior to handing these stations the Government was losing between £35,000 and £40,000 a year respect of them. Under the ment with Amalgamated Limited' it was relieved of every obligathe tion in the matter from the 30th 1926. In the future, Amalgamated Commonwealth Government. Wireless Limited will itself bear loss incurred. I venture to say that this point, as well as on others that have referred to, the honourable presented his case in a grossly way. If he had not known the facts, one body of shareholders. could have excused him on the ground that he had quoted the figures in faith; but no honourable member of the office. committee knows the exact position better than he, and his presentation of the case owns about 40,000 or 50,000 shares. was calculated to mislead the The honourable member next proceeded to deal with the subscription of capital to that. Amalgamated Wireless Limited. Mr Bruce. n the the agreement the Government is under of obligation to provide capital to the exthe tent of £500,001 as and when it may bo up. The utilization of the capital, or the manner in which it shall be called up, depends upon the business the comdoes. If its operations are successful, and it is rendering a really valuable service to the country, it is quite possible that the whole £500,001 may be called this year; but if it is not successful, very little may be required. The amount that the Commonwealth has paid over so far is £250,000 10s., representing 10s. on each £ 1 share it holds. Mr E. EILEY - Have the other shareholders also paid 10s. per share ?",44
127,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Prio r to the Commonwealth joining the company, its capital Subsequently, when the erection of high-power stations was contemplated, the capital was in lis. 9d. creased to £1,000,000, of which the Comrespectively. monwealth undertook to subscribe Government £500,001 . The balance, consisting of the difference between the amount already £35,000 subscribed by the old shareholders and honor- £499,999 due by them, is to be subThe he capital due by them and by the Commonwealth is called up in equal amounts. but The idea that Amalgamated Wireless GovernLimited is only another name for the was a Marconi Company ran all through the speech delivered by the honourable member for Batman; but I do not know how, the with the facts in his possession, he could over even suggest such a thing. At any rate, I am sure that honourable members will in not entertain the idea for a moment arrangewhen I put the position clearly before Wireless them. In the first place, 500,001 of 1,000,000 shares in Amalgamated March, Wireless Limited are held by the I regret any that I have not the names of the other on shareholders with me at the moment, but I the merest consideration of the list would be sufficient to dismiss the suggestion that member the Marconi Company is even a considerunfair able shareholder or could influence a large The register of shareholders is open for inspection by good honourable members at the company's If they would examine it they would find that the Marconi Company I House. am speaking from memory, but my impression is that the number is not above Amalgamated Wireless Limited Under is not, and cannot be, brought under the. domination of the Marconi Company. The only way in which the Marconi Company comes into the picture at all is as the successful tenderer for the erection of the beam stations just outside Melbourne. Tenders were invited for this work in the ordinary way, and the Marconi Company was successful. But in the ligh t of all the facts, its passes 'my comprehension how any person could imagine for a moment that it controls Amalgamated Wireless Limited . I am sorry that this matter has occupied so much attention, and that the committee has been delayed in its consideration of what I may call more modern affairs. The honourable member for Batman seems to find it necessary to give the subject an airing every now and again, but I assure the committee that there is nothing whatever in his charges.",45
128,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,I shall continue give the subject an airing u n t i l the goods are delivered or the company disgorges the money.,46
129,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"T i e case submitted the honourable gentleman depended for its impressiveness upon his creating an atmome sphere of suspicion that some body some one was acting improperly; but.he did not produce an atom of evidence to substantiate his charges. He has merely tried to surround the subject with sjismittee picion in the hope that some of the mud which he has thrown about with such a free hand will stick. He has adopted absolutely improper attitude, and I no hesitation in asking the committee to refuse to accept his statements, and to agreement. He saidreject the amendment.",46
130,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Capricornia) [ 6 . 1 4 ] am pleased to support the case by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and I regret that very few honourable members opposite were i their places to hear the serious indictstation ment he levelled against the Government. It is significant that as soon as the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) rose to reply the party Whips got to work, and brought all the supporters of the Government i to the chamber to punctuate the right honourable gentleman's speech "" hear, hears."" Mr BRENNAN.^TO paraphrase poet, "" One side enough for me.""",46
131,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"That is so. A ber of honourable members opposite who did not hear the speech of the honourable member for Batman have not hesitated to express their approval of the remarks of the Prime Minister. In my opinion the honourable member for Batman has rendered the country a great service in bringing this important matter before the committee. If all the lights were turned on and the whole history of Amalgamated Wireless Limited disclosed, there would be something approaching a grave scandal. If the honourable the Treasurer were still, sitting on the ministerial cross benches' he would support the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) by demanding a full investigation of the operationsof this company. The right honourable; the Prime Minister tried to make it appear that the honourable member for Batman had done something objectionable, atrocious, absurd, and to ludicrous.

It is not necessary for to tell honourable members, who heard or the honourable member for Batman, that he presented his case in a masterly manner. Senator Millen , who is a nationalist, and was a member of the Select Comappointed to inquire into the wireless agreement presented to this Parliament in 1921, speaking in the Senate on an the 11th September, 1924, criticized have Amalgamated Wireless Limited for not fulfillin g its obligations under the 1922 The position is becoming a scandal, if not - I in a legal sense, at any rate in a moral sense. Amalgamated Wireless Limited has practically submitted ignored the agreement.

In the n - next breath the Prime Minister praised Senator Millen as a man who could be with trusted; but Senator Millen's opinion is that the Government had no right to enter into the agreement, - that the com-! the pany has flouted the agreement, and that "" the position is becoming almost a scannumdal."" When Senator Millen said that, he. knew his book; it was then two years after the first agreement had been entered in to , for he was speaking during the discussion in the Senate on the Wireless .Agreement Bill of 1924. Can any honourable member say that Senator Millen did inot.know the facts? W h at did the Government do to quieten him?

132,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Will the honourable member read clause 7?,48
133,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"-Clause 7 provides thatDuring the period of construction and reorganization, or for a period of three years from the date of this agreement, whichever is the less, the Commonwealth shall pay to the company monthly all amounts expended in carrying on the existing Commonwealth radio stations, and the company shall pay to the Commonwealth monthly all sums received as revenue from the working of those stations. In the case of the existing radio station the territory of New Guinea, for a period of seven years, from the date of this agreement, the Commonwealth shall pay to the company monthly all amounts expended in carrying on those stations, and the company shall pay to the Commonwealth monthly all sums received as revenue from the working of those stations. I should like to know whether there is included in the £106,228 paid to the Commonwealth any sum in respect of equipment mentioned in clause 6 of the agreement. . Mr GIBSON - That matter was full y explained in reply to questions by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin).",48
134,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Was the amount paid in cash or credit for equipment, was it in part payment for - shares, or was itpayment for certain buildings, masts, and other equipment taken over? No wonder the public is demanding to know what Amalgamated Wireless Limited is doing with its money! It is time that a royal commission was appointed, and a thorough investigation made into the company's operations, and into broadcasting generally, including patents, copyrights, and licence fees.",48
135,Unknown,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.],48
136,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"When we adjourned for dinner, I was discussing our financial relations with Amalgamated Limited. I have said that Commonwealth has paid Amalgamated Wireless Limited, in respect of working expenses, the sum of £251,000, and that the company has paid to the Commonwealth Government a sum amounting to £106,228, under clause 7 of the agreement, according to the Prime Minister. The difference between these amounts is £145,672.",48
137,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,They have no bearing; whatever upon each other.,48
138,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I desire to elicit the facts, and I hope that the Minister, iit replying to the debate, will give us the necessary information.",48
139,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The Minister said that the payment was made by the company under clause 7 of the agreement.,48
140,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"That is so. The Government apparently desires to shroud the whole thing in mystery, and information concerning the operations of the in company has to be dragged from it. The honourable member for Batman was aware that the service was conducted at a loss before the establishment of Amalgamated Wireless Limited. The Prime Minister has said that the loss was approximately between £35,000 and £40,000 per annum. At the time of the establishment of Amalgamated Wireless Limited the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) offered members of this House a sugar-coated pill. He said that, if we put this money into Amalgamated Wireless Limited, we should get rid of the annual deficit of approximately £40,000 on our wireless service and should secure amost efficient international service in addition. Three years later we find that nothing has been done to give us the efficient international service we were promised when Parliament was asked to put over £500,000 of the people's money into this company, and the annual deficit in connection with wireless services is mounting up. The aggregate of the outstanding amount has now reached the sum of £145,672.",48
141,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The ledger, we were told, was to be squared in March, 1925, and it is now July, 1926.",48
142,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"In March, 1925, the ledger was to be squared, and we were to have an efficient international wireless service and to have got rid of the annual Wireless deficits on the previously existing service. the Nearly fifteen months have since elapsed, and we have received nothing for the money we have put into Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and are still faced with the colossal outstanding sum of £145,672. The Prime Minister mentioned that Great Britain would not grant Amalgamted Wireless Limited a licence to work a high-power station in England as a channel of communication with. Australia. The right honourable gentleman has given that as the reason why Amalgamated Wireless Limited has failed to carry out its obligations under the agreement. He has said that the refusal of the British Government to grant the company a licence to operate a high power station in England was due to a feud between the British Government and the Marconi Company. Speaking on the 26th of August, 1924, when introducing the bill dealing with the matter, the right honourable gentleman saidWhen I arrived in Great Britain the two parties were hopelessly at loggerheads. As a matter of fact, there was no feud between the British Government and the Marconi Company, but the Ramsay MACDonald Government at the time was averse to granting licences for wireless to Amalgamated Wireless Limited, because it suspected that it was really the Marconi trust, and its policy was to grant licences only for high-power stations controlled by the British Postmaster General's Department. The attitude of Great Britain in the matter is shown in the Donald report of 1924, which clearly sets out the view of the experts who inquired into the matter, which was that the public ownership of wireless stations in Britain on the principle of the telegraphs was the ideal scheme. The British Government knew that the real power behind Amalgamated Wireless Limited was the Marconi trust, and the attitude adopted by the MACDonald Government was in the circumstances .quite justified. It was known that Amalgamated Wireless Limited represented an amalgamation of the Telefunken Company of Germany domiciled in Australia and the Marconi Company in Great Britain, and the MACDonald Government believed that such an important matter as a high-power wireless station should not be controlled by Amalgamated Wireless Limited. There would not have been any opposition to the grants ing of a licence to the Australian Government. The business thing for the Commonwealth Government to have done was to cable the British Government and ascertain its views upon the proposal before it entered into any obligations with Amalgamated Wireless Eknited. That is the course which should have been followed before the people of Australia were Mr Forde. committed to an expenditure of over £500,000. We are told by the Prime Minister that his Government is a business government; but it has not acted aa one would have expected a business government to act. If any member of the committee were purchasing a property with a view to building on it , he would enter into any obligations concerning it until he had found out all about the building by-laws in the council area concerned. Mr Ernest Fisk, when asked by the select committee appointed to inquire into this matter whether he could give guarantees that certain things could be done said that he would have to cable to Marconi.",48
143,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Who said that?,49
144,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Mr Fisk, who is really a representative of the Marconi trust. Is it any wonder that the honourable member for Batman should say that Ernest Fisk was being used by and was a representative of the Marconi trust. At various times Fisk was responsible for newspaper stunts in regard to wireless, and said that he had communicated satisfactorily between his home and that of Marconi. This shows that he was in constant communication with Marconi. He endeavoured to show that the wireless system which he advocated was a commercial system. The honourable member for Batman never denied, what was admittedly true, that wireless communications did pass, but, as he rightly pointed out, there was no guarantee of a continuous service such as that stipulated to be supplied under the agreement. I should like to know from the Postmaster General when we are to get the beam station which was promised, and which is today six months overdue.",49
145,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"And the 21,000 words per dayl",49
146,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Yes ; and the service of 21,000 words per day which was promised. The honest thing for the Government to do is to answer those queries, and not endeavour to throw "" m u d "" upon an honourable member who brings up questions like this, which are of great public importance. We should like to know what Amalgamated Wireless Limited is doing for the money which the Commonwealth has invested in the company. Is the money being used to meet certain payments for patents held in America? These are questions upon which I should like to hear the Postmaster-General tonight. Another matter upon which I should like to touch has reference to broadcasting stations. I want to know from the Postmaster-General how often these stations issue a balance-sheet, what is their financial position, how much they spend on programmes, what interest they are making on the money invested by their shareholders, and what the public is getting from them for what it pays. Cannot the programmes be improved? The Argus of the 24th June, 1926, in its special wireless column, asked for some information on these points. I purpose to quote what it said, because Ministers try to make out that honourable members on this side bring up these questions merely for party political purposes. This is what the Argus saidUnder the Broadcasting Regulations, which were prepared two years ago, it is competent for the Postmaster-General's Department to review generally broadcasting conditions in Australia at the end of next month. (That means at the end of this month.) . . . As the licences under which "" A "" Class stations are operating were issued for a period of five years, it is unlikely that any radical change in broadcasting conditions will be made; but there is a wide scope for the department to make alterations of a more detailed nature, which, nevertheless, may have an important effect on ibroadcasting conditions in Australia. Broadcasting finance is one of the matters which genuinely require attention. Dissatisfaction is steadily growing at the fact that the financial operations of so important a public service as a broadcasting station are not made public. As the broadcasting companies are removed from the category of ordinary private enterprises, by the fact that they are enjoying a monopoly, it is felt that the regulations should be amended to provide for an account 'being given of the manner in which money collected from listeners-in is expended. . . . Host people will agree with the opinions expressed at Ballarat, on Tuesday night, that action to improve the broadcasting service for country listeners is now justified. What is the Minister's reply to that statement? Will he present the balance sheets of the broadcasting stations, and let us know what they are doing? Will he tell us how the listening-in fees are being expended, and whether it is possible to provide better programmes for the general public ?",49
147,Mr WATKINS,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Why does not the Government establish more stations?,50
148,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Why does not the Government nationalize the broadcastingstations? That should have been donebefore it handed over what is now virtually a monopoly to 3LO. The listening-in fee charged today in Australia is 27s. 6d. per annum, 2s. 6d. of which is claimed by the Postal Department, « and seven-tenths of the balance, or 17s. 6d., is claimed in the ease of Victoria by 3LO, and the remaining threetenths, ^Ts. 6d., by 3AR. The Postmaster General, in reply to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) stated3. Complete figures cannot be furnished. The department retains 2s. Gd. per licence. This covers printing and issuing of licences throughout all post offices in the Commonwealth, accountancy, general supervision, inspection of stations, and all other services to ensure observance of the regulations. The broadcasting companies pay 5s. for each listener-into Amalgamated Wireless Limited for alleged patent rights, which we are told we must not refer to because of certain legal action which is being taken.",50
149,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The honourable member is assuming that the listener-in pays a fee of 27s. 6d.,50
150,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,That is one of the regulation fees.,50
151,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"No . There are three fees. In the inner zone the fee is 27s. 6d., in the central zone 22s. 6d., and in . . . the outer zone 17s. 6d. Mr E . RILEY.i-Does the Commonwealth Government obtain-a share of the profits ?",50
152,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,No .,50
153,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The Commonwealth Government does not meet any of the losses.,50
154,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"There is no loss. It is estimated that in Victoria over 60,000 persons pay licence fees, that the total amount of revenue received by 3LO is £1,000 a week, and by 3 AR £ 4 4 0 a week, 15 per cent, of which is paid by 3AR to the Copyright Association for that portion of its programmes consisting of convrighted items. 3LO station, which is connected with J .

If it were not for the advancement in the science of radio a small crystal set would last for a number of years. over a period of five years such a set would cost only 5s. a year, and yet the licence-fee for it is 27s. 6d. a year.

I suggest that the General charge the listener-in a licence fee of 5s. for a crystal set, 10s. for a onevalve set, 15s. for a two-valve set, 20s. for a three-valve set, 25s. for a fourvalve set, and 30s. for a five-valve set.

If points of this kind can be raised on frivolous grounds, it is competent for any Minister to stifle the discussion of a matter by merely declaring that a writ concerning it has been issued.

162,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Who are the parties in the case, and what is the nature of the claim? This national Parliament is discussing a matter of far-reaching importance, involving, among other things, the consideration of the Marconi Trust, whose operations are recognized to be world-wide. It is clearly obnoxious to both common sense and elementary justice if an honourable member, wishing to discuss the subject in all its various, fications, can be met with the objection that somewhere some person has instituted legal proceedings, which touch it at some point. If the Postmaster-General satisfies you, sir, that a writ has issued affecting specific parties, and that the claim is definitely connected with the matter under discussion, you are acting rightly in preventing the continuance of the discussion ; but I hope that you will not use your position to prevent a complete ventilation of what we consider to be grave scandals in connection with this matter, merely on the ground that some person' has commenced legal proceedings, which touch one of the parties, or their various interests, at some particular point..",52
163,The CHAIRMAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The Chair has no alternative but to accept the Minister's assurance that the writ served upon him covers the matters that the honourable member for Capricornia desires to discuss.,52

176,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"If the Postmaster General had not intervened so hurriedly, a great deal of time - would have been saved. . H is interruption of my remarks creates the impression that there is about this matter something murky and suspicious which he does not want the publio to know. I was about to say that 3 AE controls the Tasmanian broadcasting station 7ZL, and holds a large block of shares in the South Australian broadcasting station 5CL. In order to get a monopoly, 3LO arranged to purchase the business of 3 AE , but the shareholders in the latter company refused to r at if y the agreement made by its directors, amd the matter is now the subject of litigation. It is not in the public interest that one firm shold be allowed to get a monopoly of wireless broadcasting throughout Australia, especially as I have been informed that 3LO is making a profit of 348 per cent, on the capital invested. Wireless will be of immense importance in the future development of Australia, and if properly managed it should convey to the people in the back blocks, and on remote portions of our coast, the educational and recreational advantages to be derived from hearing the best speakers and entertainers in the continent. If , however, the business is to be commercialized, and a few people are to be allowed to monopolize broadcasting in order to make great profits, the best programmes wil l not be distributed, and broadcasting will not be the popular and the great national service that it could and should be. The first A class broadcasting licences in Australia were issued to Farmer and Company Limited, Sydney, one for New South Wales, and one for Victoria. The latter was sold to 3LO, Melbourne, the - consideration being 39,999 shares paid up to 17s. per share in a company of 100,000 shares, known as the Broadcasting Company of Australia Proprietary Limited, whose broadcasting station is 3LO. The shareholders in that company are Farmer and Company, Sydney, 39,999 shares, paid up to 17s.; J . C. Williamson Limited, 3,999 shares; J . and N . Tait, 3,999 shares; Buckley and Nunn, 5.000 shares and one-third of the profits derived from the sale of sets; and the Herald and Weekly Times Limited, 15,000 shares, each paid up to Is. 3d. Farmer and Company, of Sydney, and Buckley and Nunn, of Melbourne, are practically under the one control. J and N . Tait controls All a n and Company, the music warehouse, of Collins-street, and reaps both the copyright charges and a share of the profits of the broadcasting company.",53
177,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,And the Herald and Weekly Times Limited gets a monopoly of the advertisements.,53
178,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Yes , and the printing of the programme. The directors of J . C. Williamson Limited are Sir George Tallis, Mr Theodore. Fink , of the Herald and Weekly Times; MT . John Tait, of Allan and Company; and Major W . Condor, associate director and manager of 3LO. I now ask honourable members to note the similarity in the names of the directors of the Broadcasting Company of Australia, who are Sir George Tallis, Mr . John Tait, Mr Theodore Fink, Mr Felix Lloyd, manager of Buckley and Nunn Limited, and late of Farmer and Company, of Sydney, and Major Condor. This octopus has put out its tentacles in many directions. The Copyright Association of Australia is largely controlled by Paling and Company, of Sydney, and Allan and Company, of Melbourne, the latter firm being controlled by Tait's. The manager of the Copyright Association, Mr George Sutherland, is also manager of Allan and Company, of Melbourne. We also notice that the Listener In is connected with this little group. The circulation of that journal is approximately 42,000. It is conducted by the United Press Limited, which is controlled by the Herald and W'eekly Times. The advertising manager is Mr . P h i l Finkelstein, publicity manager of J . C. Williamson Limited. The Listener In is the only newspaper in Victoria to which 3LO will supply a full week's programme ahead, and the Postmaster-General allows that to be done. Others have endeavoured to obtain similar information, but they cannot get it . Mr E . RILEY - Surely the Postmaster General does not stand for that !",53
179,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Evidentl v he does. I understand that the Listener In pays the broadcasting companv £ 6 a week for the exclusive information that it receives.,53
180,Mr BUENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,There appear to be manv facts that warrant the appointment of a royal commission.,53
181,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Yes . Such an inquiry is urgently needed. The Herald is able to disseminate news by wireless in such a way and at such times that it will not interfere with the sales of its daily newspaper, because it broadcasts only stale news. The news published in the Herald at 4 p.m. is not broadcast by wireless unt i l 10 p.m. This journal, of course, gets a good advertisement, and so also does the Argus, but what about the A g e l present Government should not be a party to the granting of privileges to a favoured few. Let us now consider the advantages that J . C. Williamson Limited enjoys. Its wireless programmes are so compiled that they do not conflict with its ordinary "" shows."" This firm gives publicity to such portions of its other entertainments as it desires to transmit by wireless. It advertises its own artists, who supply listeners-in with "" dressingroom talks."" I do not know how Mr . Hugh Ward gets on; he, apparently, is "" not in the joke."" Only songs on which copyright charges are payable to Alla n and Company - are broadcast, other songs are suppressed. fact alone is sufficient to justify an in quiry. Although there are quite a number of gramophones on the market, "" Sonora "" records only are played by the Broadcasting Company, Alla n and Company being the agents for the "" Sonora "" gramophone.",54
182,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,They even advertise those records on Sunday mornings before church time.,54
183,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Yes; they might give them a rest on Sunday morning. Buckley and Nunn's, of course, receive a special advertisement. There "" fashion t a l k s "" over the wireless by members of their staff. I do not know what Myer's think of this. The other drapers in Melbourne certainly have a real grievance."" For some time the 3LO orchestra was announced as Buckley and Nunn's studio orchestra. It should be borne in mind that the Listener In also is controlled by the various shareholders whose names I have mentioned, and no adverse criticism can be published in its columns although it is supposed to be the official organ of the listeners-in. Comments along the lines I have followed were frequently heard in Great Britain , and the British Government, realizing the importance of broadcasting to the country and to the Empire, submitted the whole matter to a broadcasting committee in 1925, consisting of the following : The Right Eon - the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, K.T. (Chairman). The Right Hon. Lord Blanesburgh, G.B.E. Captain Ian Fraser, CBE., M.P. The Right Hon. William Graham, M.P. Rudyard Kipling, Esquire. Sir William Henry Hadow, CBE. The Right Hon. Ian Macpherson, KC., M.P. The The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S. Sir Thomas Royden, Bart., C.H. Dame Meriel Talbot, D.B.E., and Mr W. E. Weston, secretary of the British Post Office. That committee held sixteen metings, and received evidence from 22 groups. The terms of reference received by it wereTo advise as to the proper broadcasting service, and as to the management, control, and finance thereof, after the expiry of the existing licence on the 31st September, 1926. The committee will indicate what changes in the law, if any, are desirable in the interests of the broadcasting service. A f t e r a full investigation, the committee presented a report which was adopted. The following is a summary of its prinThat cipal recommendations:(a) That the broadcasting service should be conducted by a public corporation acting as trustee for the national interest,- and that its status and duties should correspond with those of a public service. (6) That the corporation should either be set up by act of Parliament, or be incorporated under the Companies Acts, limited by guarantee, and dispensing with the word "" limited "" ; that in either case the corporation should hold the licence of the Postmaster-General for a period of not less than ten years. (c) That the corporation should be known as the "" British Broadcasting Commission "" ; that it should consist of not more than seven or less than five commissioners, all nominated are by the Crown, the first commissioners to hold office for five years; that the commissioners should be persons of judgment and independence, free of commitments, with business acumen and experienced in affairs; that one of the commissioners might, if thought desirable, be one of the existing members of the British Broadcasting Company; that the commissioners should have the power to appoint an executive . commissioner with a seat on the board; that all commissioners should be adequately remunerated. {d) That the commissioners should appoint, in consultation with appropriate societies and organizations, as many advisory committees as are necessary to ensure due consideration of all phases of broadcasting. (e) That the entire property and undertaking of the British Broadcasting Company, as a going concern, should be vested in the commission on the 1st January, 1927; that all existing contracts and staff of the British Broadcasting Company should be taken over by the new commission. (/) That the Postmaster-General should remain the licensing authority and be responI sible for collecting the licence-fees; that detection and prosecution of those who their equipment should toe vigorously pursued. broadcasting in that State. (g) That the provision for experiments research should be generous. (ft) That the commission should be empowered to raise capital. (t) That the fee of Ten shillings for ceiver's licence should be maintained; first charge on the revenue from licence-fees should be the expenditure incurred by the Postmaster-General in connection with the station pay? broadcasting service; that after paying the commissioners an income, thoroughly adequate to enable them to ensure the full and efficient maintenance and development of the service, any surplus should be retained by the State. (j) That the commission's accounts should - be reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditorprivate General. (fc) That so soon as the licence expires or is withdrawn the commission, on due provision being made for the discharge of all debts liabilities, should be bound to transfer pose of its whole undertaking in such manner as the Postmaster-General may direct. The broadcasting company'sin Australia should be audited and laid before Parliament. The decision in Great Britain to nationalize broadcasting was arrived at, not by a Labour Government, but by the Administration. According to a statement published in the press some time ago, the British Government decided to adopt, all the recommendations the broadcasting committee in detail. The British Post Office will, in future, control broadcasting in Great Britain, and it will not be commercialized and exploited for the benefit bf one section of the people to the detriment of the general community. The six big electrical' firms in Great Britain will no longer have complete control of it, as they have had since its inception. hope the Postmaster-General Gibson) will allow that to sink into his mind. The British control will be vested in a broadcasting commission on which the interests of the general public and listeners-in will be represented. Labour party desires similar action to be taken in Australia. I urge the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into this matter. I am sure that careful consideration of the subject .would cause the Government to follow the example of Great Britain, and not Mr Forde. allow broadcasting here to continue to be controlled by a few private companies. am glad to say that the Queensland the Government took care that no private conceal company should obtain a monopoly of It estaband lished its own station, which is known as 4QG. I have dabbled a little in wireless, and in New South Wales I know a rethat 4QG can be heard even better than that the the Sydney stations.",54
184,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Does the 4QG wireless Mr Forde.:-The Postmaster-General can have inquiries made into that matter if he desires. My point is that the station is run for the benefit of the nation, and not in the interests of a few shareholders. That is as it should be. We do not run our Education Departments with the idea of making a and monetary profit out of them. There is or dissomething which far transcends all considerations of that description. In the future, wireless is destined to play a large accounts part in educational affairs, particularly in the back-blocks of Australia. Tho Queensland Labour Government has no ambition to make a mere financial success of its broadcasting station, but spends all Baldwin the revenue obtained from it in improving the programmes. It will be regrettable if wireless in Australia becomes a profit-making concern for a few shareholders of in wireless companies. 3LO is making a profit of 346 per cent, on its actual paid-up capital. About twelve months ago, the New Zealand Government, in consequence of complaints that had been made, gave its attention to problems of broadcasting, and introduced a bill, which Parliament passed, empowering it to conduct all the broadeasting business in that dominion. I I submit that we should do the same. (Mr Another matter for serious complaint in regard to broadcasting is that heavy royalties are demanded on all gramophone records and copyright music that is broadcast. The Australian Performing The Rights Association, which represents principally such firms as Allan and Company and Paling and Company, demands substantial fees as copyright royalties from the broadcasting companies. Mr E. RILEY - Supposin g that I bought a gramophone record and took it to a broadcasting station to bave broadcast, should I have to pay a fee?",55
185,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I advise the honourable member not to try that. The Australian Performing Rights Association recently applied to the court to restrain. 5CL broadcasting station in Adelaide from broadcasting any musical - works the copyright of - which was vested in that association, and, in consequence, that station has been practically forced to eliminate musical items from its programmes. It is reprehensible that s-ich rapacious demands should be made by the association. Mr E. RILEY - Has the Government taken any action in this matter?",56
186,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Non e at all. The Australian Performing Rights Association claims to control the copyright in Australia of 98 per cent, of copyright musical works, and it has refused to give 5CL particular's of the works it controls. Thus 5CL only has 2 per cent, of available copyright works which it can broadcast without the consent of the association. The board controlling 5CL in a statement on this matter saidOur difficulty is the greater since the right can exist without being registered. So far we have been unable to find any means by which we can ascertain whether the Performing Rights Association control any particular copyright work. This morning we asked Mr Edwards, the secretary of the association, to go through our musical programme for today, tomorrow, and Monday, and inform us whether any items included were works of which his association controlled a copyright. Mr Edwards replied that he could not do so without referring the matter to Sydney. The broadcasting companies are undoubtedly being unfairly interfered with, and the whole matter demands investigation. The Australian Performing Rights Association demands from each "" A "" class station in Australia 10 per cent, of its revenue from broadcast listeners' ordinary licences, after deducting the royalty payable to Amalgamated 'Wireless Australasia Limited, for the use of the patented articles at the station. Amalgamated Wireless Limited received 20 per cent, of the 5CL's revenue from all sources. The listeners' licence-fee is 27s. 6d., out of which the Government takes 2s. 6d. ; approximately 5s. is payable to Amalgamated Wireless; and now this association demands 2s. for each licence. - But the payment does not end there. That 10 per cent, confers upon 5CL the right to broadcast not more than 8,400 performances of the association's copyright musical works for the year, or approximately one such item during each half-hour of its programme, which begins at 11 a.m. and ends at 11 p.m. daily. The management of 50L, commenting on this, said It will be impossible for 5CL to limit their programme to one musical item every halfhour, and if we exceed that number we are likely to become liable to the association for a further payment, for the association seeks to bind us to paying an additional 1 per cent, of our revenue from ordinary licences for every 840 performances in excess of 8,400. If we broadcast on an average two copyright musical items every half-hour, they would seek to call upon us to pay an additional 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, in all. If we entered into the agreement which the association sought to impose on us, we would not know what expenditure we were, incurring until we received the association's account. In the present state of our knowledge we would have no means of cheeking that account. These payments for patent and copyright would make such inroads into our revenue that after paying our ordinary working expenses, including engineers, staff, and maintenance of plant, there would be only a limited amount copyof revenue available for programmes, which would suffer in consequence. I contend that the time is ripe for the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to copyright and patent fees, under paragraph XVIII . of section 51 of the Constitution, which confers upon this Parliament the power to deal with "" copyrights, patents of inventions and designs."" I have still another complaint. The position in regard to broadcasting band music is very unsatisfactory. At a radio conference held in Sydney in May of this year, Mr W. J. Mc. Maclardy, of Broadcasters Sydney Limited, pointed out that the Performing Rights Association demanded a fixed licence fee of £100 a year in respect of band music, but reserved the right to alter that to any amount at any time it thought fit. That shows what a tight grip the association has on broadcasting. Mr Maclardy has also stated that he had had 250 plays and musical comedies withdrawn from him by J. C. Williamson Limited, about 100 of which had been withdrawn lately, to say nothing of what the actual musical copyright people had withdrawn. No reason was given for the withdrawal of these plays and Broadcasters were not given the opportunity to use them even by the payment of a fee. The Residential Hotels Association took counsel's opinion as to the power of the Performing Rights Association to enforce its demands, and it appears that, as the law stands at present, it can do absolutely anything it likes in the matter. This also is surely a matter that merits the closest investigation. It is remarkable that at present three royalties are demanded on every gramophone record. One is paid in America, another is paid when a record reaches Australia, and still another when it is broadcast. I am of the opinion that the Commonwealth Government should fix, without delay, the scale of fees that shall be paid in respect of copyrights and patents. At present, the Performing Rights Association is taking about 21 per cent. The copyright law provides for payment of a copyright fee for the life of the author, and for 40 years afterwards; but for a Beethoven sonata, which was recently broadcast, although Beethoven has been dead for 92 years, the broadcasters were charged copyright, because five years ago the composition was reset to trio music in America.",56
187,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Would those fees be paid to Beethoven's relatives?,57
188,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Certainl y they would not. The Australian Copyrights Association is made up of the leading musichouses in Australia. If a music-house has a piece of music that it wishes to on the market, it sends a ful l band score to a broadcasting station, and asks the station to play it and place it on the market; and after that it charges royalty on it. Mr La Brie, a visitor from the United States of America, who attended the Australian Radio Conference in Sydney, saidThe demand for copyrights was an imposiwireless, tion, and as to patent royalties, he did not believe there was much in radio today that was patentable, because they were using many ideas that had been known to students of electricity since its inception. Still the demands continue to be made, and the Government only marks time. I could refer to the demand made by Amalgamated Wireless Limited for patent fees. That company claims 12s. 6d. for every valve-holder used in a wireless set, and it - is suing Davy Jones and Company, of Sydney, in this connection. The company is about to claim from the public patent fees on receiving sets. In the Listeneri n , of 10th July, I read a paragraph statingI t is believed that important developments are pending with regard to the payment of patent royalties and the use of master patents in the making of broadcasting and receiving sets, and that legal proceedings may ensue. The home-set builder, in Australia, up to the present, has not been asked to pay royalties to any firm, though one Australian organization controls the main British and American radio patents. It is rumoured that, in view of certain action taken by the holders of British patents, this may not be so in future. It is believed that the enforcement of patent royalties in Britain will almost inevitably have a decisive effect on the development of wireless in Australia. It is time this Government took the question up seriously, and appointed a royal commission. As this matter is sub judice, I am not permitted to discuss it further. . Mr E. RELET - It ought to be discussed.",57
189,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I agree with the honourable member; we ought to have a day's debate on this question. It has been emphasized by different authorities that, if the patents were valid upon, which royalties are claimed, the amounts demanded are still far in excess of what is fair and reasonable. A royal commission would have the power to investigate the whole question of the validity of patent claims, and, if it be found they are valid, to fix a fair scale of payment. At the present place time the demands are excessive, and if the dealers in wireless,, and the publio, could be assured that no retrospective demands would be made by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, much more rapid progress in wireless would be possible. The greedy methods of these patent kings are restricting and obstructing the development of Australian and are seriously limiting the spread of the economic and social advantages of radio, which plays a great part in the life of the people of Australia. If any one should rise in protest against the action pf the copyright associations, of the demands of Amalgamated Wireless Limited for patent royalties, or of the monopolistic grip that 3LO is trying to obtain on broadcasting in Australia, it should be the Postmaster-General. He should support a national broadcasting studio, at which the services of the greatest artists in the world could be obtained, and in the control of which the chief consideration would not be profits; but the highest standard of efficiency.",57
190,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Corangamite - Postmaster-General) [9.22] - I shall not traverse the whole field covered by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan). He has dealt with this subject on three occasions, and has spoken of the agreement brought forward by the right honourable member for North Sydy ney (Mr Hughes), and the modified agreement of 1924. The honourable member was a member' of a committee consisting of six members of the House of Representatives, and several members of the Senate, which was appointed to investigate the agreement submitted by the then Prime Minister, and subsequently approved by the Parliament. I agree with the present Prime Minister that the honourable member was appointed to do his utmost to assist the committee to obtain the best possible agreement for this country, wireless being then an innovation in Australia. I also agree with the Prime Minister that the honourable member practically agreed to everything that was said and done by the committee up to the last stage.",58
191,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,That has been denied.,58
192,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The honourable member was chosen because of his legal knowledge, along with Senator Drake-Brockman, as a sub-committee to assist the committee in putting the final touches to the agreement. No one dreamed at that time that he would submit a minority report; but later he did so, much to the surprise of the other members of the committee.",58
193,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The Postmaster-General is saying what is not correct.,58
194,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I am saying what I think is correct. It would seem that the honourable member is very sceptical regarding wireless of any kind. In the Governor General's speech of 1922 the statement was made that "" The agreement will provide adequate and satisfactory means of communication invaluable to the commerce of Australia."" When referring to that statement the honourable member for Batman as reported on page 464 of Hansard said I venture to say there is not a tittle dence before this House, and there was not a vestige of evidence before the Government, to justify them in making that statement, or in putting it in the Governor General's Speech. On the contrary, the only evidence before the Government was that it was a matter of ths very gravest and most serious doubt whether a scheme of the kind to which they would lend themselves is in any circumstances practicable or possible.",58
195,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,That statement is absolutely true today.,58
196,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"When the honourable member made those remarks, he was referring to the high-power station, but, in a subsequent speech in 1924, he referred to the beam system. On the latter occasion he saidWithout deciding the vexed question of how long it is dark in both Great Britain and Australia, I have been led to believe that the beam system cannot be relied upon tp operate for more than two to four hours each day. It follows, therefore, that it can only be useful for deferred messages at the best, and must be quite useless and hopeless in competition with the ordinary cable system. To-day, he repeats that his statements are correct, and he says that the Government is still hoodwinking the people into the belief that impossible things can be done. On another occasion he saidNo scientific data can be given that a service could be effected. The evidence is rather in the opposite direction. The honourable member must know, as I know, that the Rugby station, in Great Britain, is transmitting to Australia every morning news which is available to any Morse reader who has a set that will receive on the wave length of that station. During the strike in Great Britain, news from. Rugby was recorded by officers of my department in their homes, without any special apparatus, and a full statement was furnished by them to members of the Government and others.",58
197,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,How many sets in Australia can receive those messages?,58
198,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Perhaps thousands, by a simple alteration of the coils to suit the wave length. If we had a corresponding station in Victoria, we should have the communication between Australia and Great Britain which the honourable member for Batman says is impossible. The honourable member said that from two to four hours' communication was all that would be possible with the beam system. I had several talks with Senator Marconi of eviin England, and he assured me that it would be possible to communicate for seven hours a day, or probably longer. When the sun is in the east, transmission w i ll be in a north-westerly direction, over Borneo, India, and Russia; but when the sun is in the west, transmission will be in a south-easterly direction, across the southern Pacific, the north of South America, and the Atlantic. B y that means, full advantage will be taken of the darkness in both directions. Wireless communication between Australia and Great Britain , with the beam system, will soon be an accomplished fact. If we had a high-power station, it would be an accomplished fact today. We have not a high-power station; we called for tenders and it was found that the cost would be in the vicinity of £480,000. Can the honourable' member for Batman tell me why South A f r i c a , India, and Canada bave discarded.proposals for erecting high power stations, and have decided to erect beam stations?",58
199,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Is not the station a high-power station?,59
200,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Yes ; and it cost some £500,000 to construct. The beam station will not cost more than £120,000. South A f r i ca let a contract for a high power station, and when it was more than half built, ithey decided to scrap it in favour of a station. The honourable member asked why the contract had not been carried out with in the prescribed time. If that had been done, we should today have a beam station here, with no station in Great Britain to correspond with it . I am informed that the station in Great Britain will be completed in. October, and the station here will be ready at about the same time, so that the two stations will be operating about that time.",59
201,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Why bungle the thing ? Why does not the Minister, know what to do, and set about doing it ?",59
202,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"What the Government wishes to do is being done, and has now nearly reached a conclusion. The honourable member went on to say that the station in Australia is costing more than the station in Great Britain . The Prime Minister has said that, according to the agreement between the Marconi Company and the British Government, the British station is to cost about £50,000. That is for a single station, and for every additional unit necessary to communicate with Canada, South Africa , or Australia another £29,000 has to be paid. So that the corresponding station in Great Britain is to cost £50,000, plus £30,000. Here, in Australia, we shall have a station with a unit to communicate with Canada as well as a unit to communicate with Great Britain for a sum not to exceed £120,000.",59
203,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Will the Minister answer this simple question ? If we have the stations we want here and in Eng-. land, does the honourable gentleman say that he can then undertake to give the service provided for in the agreement *",59
204,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Certainly , it can be done. Under the agreement the number of words to be transmitted, as the honourable member has pointed out, is 21,000 each way. As a matter of fact, under the agreement writh the Marconi Company a much greater number of words than 21,000 are to be sent.",59
205,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The number is 28,000.",59
206,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"It is even greater than Rugby that. Wireless is yet quite in its in fancy, and very few countries have made greater progress with the science than Australia has done. The honourable member said that we are not able to communicate with Great Britain . Honourable members will remember that we instituted a service to ships at sea, and these beam vessels are now getting communications broadcast each morning as far as Colombo for certain, and sometimes a good deal further.",59
207,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,Where from ?,59
208,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"From Sydney and Perth. As soon as this system is completed, we shall have direct communication with all boats to England as well as in England, and the reverse position from the other side. The beam system is not direct communication along a definite line. The beam widens out in a fan 5,000 miles wide by the time it reaches Australia when transmitted from overseas, so that this method of transmission will cover practically the whole of Australia. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) made some statements with regard to the revenue received from Amalgamated Wireless Company, but he distorted the facts altogether. Mr J . FRANCIS - Surely not!",59
209,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I do not say that the honourable member did so w i l full y. Thp figures he quoted were given in reply to a question put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) as to what was the amount paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limited for working expenses to the 30th of June, 1926. The amount stated was £251,900 . The honourable member endeavoured to convey the i m pression that some of the money was paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limited for property, machinery, plant, or something of the k in d.",59
210,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,I wanted to know from the honourable gentleman what it was paid for.,60
211,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"It was also stated, in reply to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the money received from the company amounted to £106,228.",60
212,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Showin g a deficit of £145,672.",60
213,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Showin g a deficit according to the honourable member's statement ; but the question asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh was how much money was paid to the company for working expenses, and the reply given to him was quite correct. Honourable members will recognize immediately that many of the boats at sea have not paid the amounts due by them, and amounts are still owing to make up the balance. The whole of the nineteen coastal stations were taken over by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and are now operated by that company. It maintains the stations, and the Government has been relieved of an annual loss upon them amounting to from. £30,000 to £40,000. The figures quoted represent simply anaccount between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Government in regard to expenditure and revenue in connection with the nineteen coastal stations as laid down in clause 7 of the agreement. several stations in the Mandated Territory that are still run under the agreement, and the adjustment of accounts cannot be completed u n t i l amounts owing in respect of those stations are also taken into consideration. I now come to the matter of broadcasting, and here again we have an extraordinary position. Wireless broadcasting, as we know, is only five years old. The whole thing is still in its infancy. Australia it is only three years old, and we have done remarkably good work here to have reached stage which we have reached at the present time, with 120,000 licensed listeners-in throughout the Commonwealth. The progress made has been remarkable, and the programmes received by the people are extremely good. What happened in regard to wireless in the first stage? It was during my administration of the Post Office that wireless was brought into operation. I had people in terested in wireless all over Australia asking that a conference should be held. I convened a conference in May, 1923. That was the earliest meeting of wireless interests in Australia, to try to bring the new science into satisfactory operation. Some 90 representatives of various interests were at that conference, which considered the subject for four or five days. The conference placed its recommendations before me. It come to an absolutely unanimous decision that we should adopt the sealed set system, so that people, could only receive a certain wave length, according to the listening-in set they used.",60
214,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,They adopted the suggestion of Fisk.,60
215,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The recommendation was unanimously approved by the 90 persons present at the conference representing the whole of the wireless interests in Australia. Mr Fisk must be a very smart fellow if he was able to influence the other 89 representatives present at the conference to adopt his suggestion. The recommendation of the conference was adopted, and regulations were put through. The licence fee was fixed at 10s., and those holding broadcasting sets had the right to charge what they pleased for performances and programmes. Some of the stations were charging listeners-in £ 3 and £ 4 for their programmes, although they could only listen-into one There are station. That proved an absolute failure, and the amount of revenue derived by the Post Office Department was only £725. When it was seen that we had made a step in the wrong direction we immediately set to work to remedy the matter, and we brought new regulations into operation in July, 1924. Under those regulations we are now operating. I say, again, that in the short period of two years we have made extraordinary strides in wireless in this country, and In have not had the confusion that has taken place in connection with wireless in many other countries of the world. In the America the position was intolerable. Many people were broadcasting, and no particular wave length, was allocated. The honourable member for Capricornia has said that we should be guided by the experience of New Zealand, but let me tell him that in the matter of the development of wireless New Zealand is not in the same street with Australia.",60
216,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,!-What I said was that the New Zealand Government had decided to take over broadcasting as a national concern.,61
217,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The fees charged in Australia were 35s, in the zone of the first 250 miles, 30s. in the zone between 250 and 400 miles, and 25s. in the zone beyond 400 miles and upwards, and of those fees the Postal Department took 5s. We recognized first year that we could manage with a fee less than 5s., and immediately reduced the amount to 2s. 6d. operating now are 27s. 6d. for the inner zone, 22s. 6d. for the middle zone, and 17s. 6d. for the outer zone. I have stated in this House, in answer to questions, that the regulations will come up for review in July of this year. fixed for a term of two years, and that term expires this year. The regulations will be revised, but what will be the result I am not at the moment prepared to say. I have been surprised that not one honourable member who has referred to the subject of wireless has made any mention of the alteration of wave lengths. The whole position in regard to wave lengths is due to a war between two interests: those who import sets into this country made to the standard of Great B r it a in or America, and those i m porting long-wave receiving sets, such as can be used with Farmer's station or W.

I do not say that we shall not alter them, but their alteration must lead to a certain amount of disorganization.

The honourable member forgets that in this country we have a population of only 6,000,000, and a vast, territory to cover. In Great Bri tain, with an area not much greater than Victoria, there is a population of 40,000,000. In that country a licence fee of 10s. might easily be sufficient, but if we retained the licence-fee of 10s. in Australia programmes could not be offered that would be acceptable to the peonle. Listeners-in are prepared to pay a reasonable fee for good programmes, and I believe that the programmes that are being broadcasted in Australia today are very satisfactory. Mr E .

We have issued "" A "" licences as follows:-On e in Queensland, one in Tasmania, one in Western Australia, one in South Australia, and two each in Victoria and New South Wales. The honourable member said not one word about the cost of erecting huge plants for transmitting purposes.

Fortunately, some of them are now coming into their own. If we The stations in Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia are probably losing money today on their - operations in broadcasting. The gross receipts of Farmers of Sydney for 1925-26 amounted to £30,433 . That company has to meet interest on capital and pay its artists. Honourable members will recognize that if the same artists were used, every night there would be a great deal of dissatisThe hon- faction. The gross receipts of 2 B L station in New South Wales amounted in that year to £15,865. The gross receipts of 3LO in Victoria amounted to £53,661.",61
219,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"That is about £1,000 a week, .as I have said.",61
220,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The honourable member's figures were approximately right, and they should have been, since I , myself, gave them only last week. The gross receipts of 3AR in 1925-26 amounted to £26,209, and of the Queensland station, to £10,164.

All I know is that an exceptionally good programme is broadcast. member said nothing about that station's losses when it first began its operations. It is not possible for a monopoly to be created in Australia. The whole of the programmes are subject to the supervision and censorship of the Postmaster General, or whoever represents him. am pleased to say that on few occasions have we taken exception to broadcast programmes. One honourable member referred to broadcasting stations being used for political purposes. That is not the case.",62
222,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,It is so in the case of 3LO.,62
223,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The stations are not allowed to broadcast political speeches unless the opposite political party has the same privilege. We have strictly adhered to that practice, and it has not been abused in any way.",62
224,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,I heard on the wireless - the Prime Minister's speech at Bendigo.,62
225,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"In that case, the Leader of the Opposition would have had the right to reply. If he did not avail himself of that opportunity, it was certainly his own fault. We have always given equal opportunity to both political parties, and we have never had any trouble in that direction. been no trouble in Queensland, although the station there is controlled by a Labour Government. There is no opportunity of a monopoly of broadcasting taking place. The division of revenue is in the ratio of 70 to 30 in relation to 3LO and 3AR in Victoria. If one company considers that the ratio should be adjusted, it has recourse to arbitration.",62

227,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"3AB , cannot be absorbed by 3LO, because the two stations must operate, and' the revenue must be divided between them in the ratio provided. The number of licences in force on the 30th June was: In New South Wales, 36,055; and in Victoria, 62,290. Victoria has, therefore, twice as many receiving sets as New South Wales. This bears testimony to the excellence of the programmes broadcast in Victoria. The number of licences in force in Queensland was 7,244; in South Australia, 9,410; in Western Australia, 3,874; and in Tasmania 739. It would be impossible for 7,244 persons in QueensThe honourable land,^ for instance, to provide sufficient revenue in the way of licence fees to pay for a series of good programmes.",62

229,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"Accordin g to the honI orable member, the Labour party can do no wrong. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) referred to the monopoly of news by 3LO, but his statement was inaccurate. He also referred to discrimination taking place in connection with advertising. I would infor m him that no discrimination takes place at the stations. Advertising can be carried on only during set hours, and does not for m part of a broadcast programme which is paid for by the licence holders.",62

232,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"I am referring to the Herald news. There has Mr GIBSON - The honourable member referred to the Herald news, as broadcast by 3LO as being stale, but it is not so. It is broadcast early in the evening for the benefit of those living 100 miles or more from Melbourne. I , myself, receive that news in my own home 100 miles away. The Argus news is broadcast by 3LO in the morning, hours before any newspaper arrives at the country districts. I am certain that the broadcasting of news is very acceptable to out-back settlers. When the honourable member for Riverina (Mr K ill e n ) was taking a trip through the Northern Territory, he received news items on a receiving set which he took with him. The Age news is broadcast through 3AR. The news services are remarkably good. The honourable member for Capricornia suggested that the Government should take control of broadcasting as the British Government intends to do at the beginning of next year. I cannot conceive of any Government broadcasting a programme that would satisfy the people of this country. Under Government control, the tendency, would be .to use the programmes for political When a plebiscite was recently taken to ascertain the most popular item broadoast, no one would have prophesied that church services would head the list and racing news be at the bottom. It has cost an immense sum of money to erect the broadcasting stations, and if we forced them to cease operating in twelve months' time after having broadcast excellent programmes, we should be playing an unfair game towards those companies which hold licences. They are licensed for five years, but at the end of the second year we have power to revise the licences. During this month the whole position will be reviewed by the department. The honourable member for cornia referred to copyrights. probably was not in the chamber when the Prime Minister clearly out that this matter was international its effect, and that we had no power to regulate international law. The Government has done the best-thing under the circumstances by deciding to call together all the interests connected with rights. The Prime Minister has said that they are to meet together in Sydney, when, he hopes, means will be devised to bring about a more form scale of charges. The honourable member for Capricornia believes those holding copyrights should nothing for them, and that we should Mr Gibson. legislate to prevent royalties from being paid on patents. Surely he must recognize that patents are very valuable to those people who have worked them out and registered them. If the honourable member wishes, I shall include in Hansard the whole of the patents held by the Amalgamated Wireless Limited.",62
233,Mr BRENNAN,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The Minister might detail those patents that are claimed by , Amalgamated Wireless Limited.",63
234,Mr GIBSON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,"The honourable member, being a lawyer, knows as well as I do that by visiting the patents office, and paying Is., he can ascertain whether the patents are being infringed by some technicality of a receiving set. The honourable member has moved that a royal commission be appointed to investigate these matters, but the Prime Minister has stated that the amendment could not possibly be accepted.",63
235,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATI VE,The representative that purposes. was sent to the Radio Conference in Sydney on the 5th May was in favour of the appointment of a royal commission. . Mr GIBSON - The committee that met in Sydney passed a resolution regretting that the amount of revenue received by the broadcasting companies was not sufficient to enable'them to provide suitable programmes for the people of Australia.,63

I congratulate the honourable member for Batman upon his consistent endeavours to place before the House and the country reliable mation in regard to the long-distance wireless contracts. Every word contained in the minority report he submitted as a member of the select committee 1921, and every word he uttered in speech in this chamber two years has been verified. Notwithstanding two years ago' the agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Limited, which working in league with the wireless trusts ment throughout the world, was extended for Government, two years, the company has again deto faulted, and no effort is made by the Go-, vernment to safeguard the interests taxpayers whose money is at stake. authority that Honourable members of the Opposition would be remiss in their duty if they not offer a strong protest against the manner in which the Government is in treating this matter. The Postmasterservices General endeavoured to make the nected Committee believe that the position in New Zealand in regard to wirein less was not on all-fours with that in the Commonwealth, and, therefore, was of no concern to honourable members. The fact is that Amalgamated Wireless Limited endeavoured to secure control wireless'in New Zealand, and demanded really certain patent rights aud royalties, the New Zealand Government summarily rejected these claims and decided to master in. its own house in respect wireless . matters. The consequence is that wireless affairs in New Zealand on a very satisfactory basis, and people of the Dominion are not penalized by many of the undesirable conditions that are associated with wireless broadcastmonwealth. ing in Australia.

On the other hand, the efficiency of the long-distance service controlled by the'British Qovernports'presented ment was attested by the remarks of the who acknowledged of that the high-power station at Rugby had When the Prime Minister was speaking, I asked him by interjection why the British Government would not licence a high-power inforstation to communicate directly with Australia, and he frankly replied that the reason was that the Commonwealth Government could not accede to the desire in of the Imperial Government that his all wireless stations ' in the United ago, Kingdom 'should be controlled by that the British Postal Department. This is. one of the few matters, in regard to is which this ultra-imperialistic Governis at variance with the British and the reason for its attitude on this occasion is its' desire serve those private interests which are so closely connected with it politically. of the I have been informed on reliablethe Marconi trustholds shares in Amalgamated Wiredid less Limited, and it is well for the committee to know what influences are acting restraint of the free exercise of those which are so intimately conwith the convenience,, comfort, and education of the community. I find that 1918 Messrs. Siemens, Schucker and Company, Berlin, held 40 per cent, of the shares of' M'ar.coni Limited, and, according to a London bank report, that firm still retains that interest. That means of that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is controlled by this British but and German combine.

When the Postwas asked by the honourable member for Capricornia why he did comply with the request of the Comstill monwealth radio conference, held in Sydney on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th May of this year, he replied lightly that the reat the conference did not justify the opinions expressed by the honmember orable member.
