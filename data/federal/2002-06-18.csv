There are a great many areas of need that budget, but I am going to focus my attention area of children. I would like to talk a little in the sector, given that the government has problems in the budget. We are getting anecdotes bers, from parents, from councils, from service of the greatest problems at the moment is the outside school hours care places that are Jenkins, I am sure that you and others in does control the number of places and therefore placed in care in both of those sectors. It does long day care centres, and the numbers in family because many of the centres themselves are full many parents. The government also controls care, and we are now seeing real problems arising an adequate level. In last year's budget, 5,500 new places were ages at that time.

Mr Deputy Speaker this chamber would be aware that the government the number of children that are able to be not control the number of child-care places in day care are dramatically increasing, partly and partly because it is a popular option for the number of places in outside school hours because those numbers have not been set at allocated, and there were already severe shortin the ocean. Many people working in the area offer some relief, but they have been bitterly The Family Day Care Council and the Victorian organisations across the country, lobbied the extra places to be allocated.

In many cases where they have always appropriate-they have no other option dren to go home on their own. This is obviously supporting. The problem has been exacerbated by the introduction government argues that it has made child care control in the provision of outside school hours the Deputy Speaker wanted to turn up and say, hours care for two hours, I am happy to pay full vide a spot to his child above the cap that the is set just to control the amount of money that number of children.
