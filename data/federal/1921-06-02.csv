15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"I have received from the honourable' member for Barrier the intimation that he desires - to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance;' viz., "" The"" menace to the world's peace involved is the growing estrangement between the United States of America and the. British Empire, due in part to the awful state of affairs existing in Ireland under the British occupation, as depicted in the report of the American - Commission ou. Conditions ih Ireland."" . Mx. CONSIDIKrE (Barrierj [2.33] In its issue of the 25th September last the New York Nation, a newspaper of international standing, which exercises an immense influence in . the moulding of publio opinion in the United States of America, published the following editorial under the caption, "" No War with England"":It re because they believe that war between England and the United States would be the greatest calamity which could befall the world, andbecause they feel that the two countries are rapidly drifting apart, that the editors of The Nation have invited one hundred of their fellow-citizens to form a committee to investigate, through a commission, the charges and counter-charges of atrocities in Ireland. 'Ihe case of Mayor MCSwiney, and the other hunger strikers, has stirred this country profoundly. So conservative a newspaper as the Chicago Tribute declares that the ""Irish situation seriously involves the UnitedStates, and the case of MieSwiney is the .Irish questioni just .now at its highest point of drama."" This, the most powerful newspaper of the Middle West, declares that if MCSwiney starves to death this blunder ""might conceivably affect the peace of the world."" The words are ominously like those used by President MCKinley; and the interventionists in Cuba in 1898, who maintained that the United States could not tolerate such terrible conditions at its door The Nation then sent the following telegram to all the members of the United States Senate, many members of the House of Representatives, the Governors of all the States, the mayors of ahout seventy-five leading cities, the editors of about twenty leading newspapers, including such papers as the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Boston Transcript, the Philadelphia.Ledger, the Pittsburg Leader, some thirty-five heads of universities or colleges and professors, Bishops of the Roman Catholic, Protestant Episcopal, and Methodist Episcopal churches, a large number of heads of unions and labour 'organizations', and men and women in other walks of life:The struggle between Great Britain and Ireland, which has gone for many months with increasing use of armed force.by both parties, is widely reported to be accompanied 'by atrocitiesplanned by British. Government and answeredin kind by Irish people. One grave result is rapid growth oft anti-British feeling which seriously threatens .unspeakable calamity of war between United States and Great Britain and endangers peace of the world. In the interest of peace and international' friendship the editors of The Vation earnestly invite you to serve as a member non-partisan committee of representative Americans with power to add to their number, who shall designate a select commission to sit at Washington or elsewhere for impartial investigation of reported atrocities in Ireland, regarding, which the British Ambassadorand Professor De Valera, and others,, shall be invited to submit evidence. Proposal does not contemplate any recommendation regarding future relations between Great Britain and Ireland. The Nation's invitation resulted in the acceptance by such a large number of those circularized, that the Committee of one hundred had to be .enlarged' forthwith to a Committee of -150, comprising five Governors of States, ten United .States Senators, twelve Congressmen, the mayors of 1 fifteen cities, two Judges, two Jewish Rabbis, seven Brotestant Episcopalian Bishops, four Methodist Episcopalian Bishops-, the Cardinal; an Archbishop and 1 four Roman Catholic Bishops, eleven labour union officials, an ex-ambassador, many ex-Governors - and exrsenators, educationists; editors and proprietors of newspapers,.and other prominent citizens of the United States. A ballot taken by this Committee of 150 resulted in the election of the'following persons to serve as a Commission to inquire into the conditions in Ireland:JANE ADDAMS - As a worker, lecturer, and writer for social betterment, she has won a reputation that makes her one of the most distinguished women in the world, one who has never refused a call to high public service. For over thirty years' Miss Addams has been head of Hull House, Chicago. She is Chairwoman of the Women's Peace Party, and of the International Committee for Permanent Peace, and in 19I9 served as President of the International Congress of Women, held in Switzerland. JOSEPH WINGATE EOLK - A native of Tennessee; his public career has been largely identified with the State of Missouri. He won his .spurs as circuit attorney, in St. Louis, by fearlessly exposing political corruption. He was subsequently, elected Governor by the State on the democratic ticket by a large.majority in a Republican year. His record as Governor stands as one of the particularly bright spots im American political life. During the Wilson Administration he served for a time as solicitor for the State Department, and since 1914 has been chief counsel for the later-State Commerce Commission. He is also general counsel for the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. JAMES H. MAURERi-For many years he has been President of the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labour. He is known as an authority on labour conditions and problems, and is a power in the progressive wing of the American Federation of Labour. Mr Maurer has. served several' terms as a member of the Pennsylvania State Legislature for the Reading district. FREDERICK CLEMSON HOWE - He is one of' the - foremost American authorities on economic and.social subjects, particularly on taxation and municipal government He has been Professor of Law at the Cleveland College of Law, Lecturer on Taxation at Western. University, and Lecturer on Municipal Administration and Politics at the University of Wis-' consin. He. has held several public offices, including that of Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of New York, from 1914 to 1919. He rendered conspicuous service as an expert on international affairs attached to the American delegation at the Peace Conference. DAVID I . WALSH - He has had a notable public career in his native State. Admitted to the Bar in 1S97, he began his public service as a moderator at town meetings, was elected to the Massachusetts . House of Representatives, and served subsequently as Lieutenant-Governor and Governor. He was chosen as delegate at large to the Massachusetts Convention in 1917. His term as a United States senator began last year, and as a new member his vigorous personality immediately made itself felt. "" If I considered my. personal desires, I would decline the service offered,"" he wired The Nation, "" but the patriotic and humanitarian aspects of this service compel me to forget self. I will servo with other members who will undertake this work with open mind and without prejudice of any kind."" Subsequently, the following were added to the Commission: - Rev. Norman Thomas, of New York; Major Oliver P. Newman, of ""Washington, D.C.; Senator George W. Norris, of Nebraska. The Commission applied to the British authorities so that no obstacle would be placed in the way of witnesses desiring to give evidence, and received a formal assurance from the British Ambassador that no person would be refused a passport on the ground that he or she desired to give evidence on either side. Subsequently, the British Ambassador, on 23rd October, 1920, wrote to the - secretary of this Commission, and concluded his letter with the following words:I may add that nothing will be done by the British Government to encourage the holding of this inquiry, or to assist witnesses to appear before the Committee. (Signed) AUCKLAND GEDDES. Tn response to an inquiry, by the Chicago Tribune, Mr De'Valera, the President of the Irish .Republic, said he welcomed the inquiry, but did not believe the British Government would facilitate being placed before the Commission, and that owing to the command of the sea being held by the British Navy, it would be very difficult for witnesses to give evidence in the United States free from molestation, and also that there was no guarantee that when the witnesses returned to Ireland, they would not be - made the object of fury of the army of occupation. The Commission held its first sitting at the Hotel Lafayette, Washington, D.C., on ISth November, 1920, Mr Considine. when the chairman (Commissioner Howe), made the following statement:This is the first session of the hearings of the American Commission on Ireland. The motives which call this Commission into existence and its purposes as formulated by the Commission are as follow:He then repeated what had practically been stated by the editors of The Nation in the leading article referred to, when they sought to bring this Commission .into existence. Thirty-eight witnesses were examined by the Commission at Washington, consisting of English men and women, Scotchmen, and American and Irish people, and including five members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, with service in Ireland extending from two months to thirteen years. As the result of their investigations the Commission sought permission from the British Embassy to send a delegation to visit Ireland, but were refused passports by the British Government. In consequence, the Commission was not able to proceed either to Great Britain or to Ireland in order to conduct its investigations personally on the spot. It dealt, however, with a great mass of testimony that was secured from British official reports, statistics, and parliamentary papers, and the report of the British Labour Mission to Ireland. On 6th April the Commission published its unanimous findings as follows: We find that the Irish people are deprived of the protection of British law to which they would be entitled as subjects of the British King. They are likewise deprived of the moral protection granted by international law, to which they would be entitled as belligerents. They are at the mercy of Imperial British Forces, which, acting contrary both to all law and to all standards of human conduct, have instituted in Ireland a ""terror,"" the evidence regarding which, seems to prove that 1. The Imperial British Government has created and introduced into Ireland a Force of at least 78,000 men, many of them youthful evidence and inexperienced, and some of them convicts; and has incited that Force to unbridled violence. 2. The Imperial British Forces in Ireland have indiscriminately, killed innocent men, women a.nd children; have discriminately .assassinated persons suspected of being Republicans; have tortured and shot prisoners whilst In custody, adopting the subterfuge of "" refusal to halt,"" and "" attempting to escape""; and have attributed to alleged "" Sinn Fein extremists'"" the British assassination of prominent Irish Republicans. 3. House burning and wanton destruction of villages and cities by Imperial British Forces under Imperial British officers hive been countenanced and ordered by officials of the British Government; and elaborate provisions by gasoline sprays and bombs have been made in a number of instances for systematic incendiarism as part of a plan of terrorism. 4. A campaign for the destruction of the means of existence of the Irish people bas been conducted by the burning of factories; creameries, crops, and farm implements, and the shooting of farm animals. This campaign is carried on regardless of the political views of their owners, and results in widespread and acute suffering among women and children. 5. Acting under a series of proclamations issued by the competent military authorities of the Imperial British Forces, hostages are carried by Forces exposed to the fire of a Republican Army; fines are levied upon towns and villages as punishments for alleged offences of individuals; private property is destroyed in reprisals for acts with which the owners have no connection; and the civilian population is subjected to an inquisition upon the theory that individuals are in possession of information valuable to the Military Forces of Great Britain. These acts of the Imperial British Forces are contrary .to the laws of peace or war among modern civilized nations. 0. This "" terror"" has failed to re-establish Imperial British civil government in Ireland. Throughout the greater part of Ireland British Courts have ceased to function; local, county, and city Governments refuse to recognise British authority; and British civil officials fulfil no function of service to the. Irish people. 7. In spite of the British "" terror,"" the majority of the Irish people, having sanctioned by ballot the Irish Republic, give their allegiance to it, pay taxes to it, and respect the decisions of its Courts and of its civil A supplementary report deals with the religious issues in Ireland in an equally plain and admirable fashion, as follows :Outside of a part of Ulster, Catholics and Protestants live in peace and harmony, and their political opinions are not primarily a matter of religion. Even.in Ulster, religious bigotry is not by nny means wholly spontaneous, but is artificially stirred up by those whose economic and political interests are served by dividing the people. While it obviously lies beyond our province to pass final judgment upon the various aspects of the Ulster issue, we have not only a right, but a duty as American Protestants, to denounce the degradation of religion by such pogroms as occurred last summer. Upon this wo owe it to our fellow religionists, both in America and in Ulster, to speak plainly. Those were the conclusions of these representative American citizens-the findings of a Commission, as is stated in its report, composed of American Protestants, who felt it tlieir duty to appeal to their co-religionists in Ulster and in the United States to put .an end to the damnable state of affairs that has been in existence in Ireland since the right of the Irish people to determine their, own destiny in accordance with their own ideas and aspirations has been attempted to be smothered by armed forces at the dictation of the Imperial Government. The findings of this representative American Commission have been proved up to the hilt by statements made by no les3 an authority than General Sir Hubert De La Poer Gough, a military officer who, at the timo of the threatened Ulster rebellion in Ireland, resigned his commission sooner than be a party to using armed forces against the Ulster people. He has expressed himself in such language as the following:The Union has failed irrevocably, and after long trial. Law and order has given place to a bloody and brutal anarchy, in which the armed agents of the Crown violate every law in aimless and vindictive and insolent savagery. Is there a single Irishman or woman whose blood does not boil at these things, and who does not demand the end of English rule, and the right of the Irish to govern themselves?",20
16,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"I rise to order. I direct your attention, sir, to the fact that the honourable member has been reading for the last twenty minutes. He. has officials. been doing nothing but read. Mr CoNsroiNE - That is not true.",23
17,Sir BOBEKT BEST,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"Vil e and hideous slanders on the Empire, too! Sir JOSEPH Coox -'-The honourable member has not made two words of comment since he rose, and I submit to you that he is not making a speech, but is taking advantage of his privileges in the House, to read a document in extenso. Por twenty minutes he has read reports, and I submit that he may not do so. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKE B (Hon. J. M. Chanter) - I followed the honourable member while he was speaking, and took it that he was reading from the report of a Commission in America. He had, however, finished his reading of that document, and had begun to speak extempore. He then began to read from some other document before the point of order was raised. I call the honourable member's attention to the fact that it is against the Standing Orders for an honourable member to read his own speech; but I know - of no 'Standing order ""which forbids an honourable member to read extracts: from other speeches, so long as they are in conformity with our rules. Mr CfONSLDINE - Did you say, sir, that it was against the: Standing Orders for me to jreadtmyown speech?",23
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,Yes .,24
19,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"'That is what I did not do, as the Treasurer himself pointed' out. Sir JOSEPH COOK*-My complaint is that the honourable member is reading, somebody else's speech.",24
20,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"As you, sir, pointed out to the right honourable member, I had quoted extensively from the American Commission's Teport on conditions in Ireland.",24
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"It will make a very nice little pamphlet, will it not?",24
22,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"Possibly ; and I hope the right honourable member will lend me his aid in distributing it. As you, sir, have upheld my right to make my speech in my own way, so long as L do not transgress the rules of the House, I shall continue the brief quotation that I was making from the expressions of opinion of General GoughEngland has departed further from her own standards,, and further from the standards even of any nation in the world, not excepting the Turk and the Zulu, that has ever been, known in history before. She is doing irreparable harm* to the interests of her own Empire, and to her good name, by the .circula- tion of accounts, which are daily proved to be only too true, of what is being done in Ireland from day to day. In an impoverished bankrupt world she is recklessly adding another area of:ruin and destruction. We realise .that-on every ground Ireland must have full national self-government, with, no greater and no other limitations than are imposed on Canada, Australia, - or South Africa. I quote the concluding portion, so as to be perfectly fair to General Gough. I - draw the attention of honourable members to the tremendous advance in thought made by this general, the leader of the British Fifth Army on the ""Western Front, who-refused in 1914. to be used:by the British Government for the purpose of coercing Ulster, and who since the waT has so radically revised his opinion as the result of his study of the conditions at present existing in his native land. The gentleman whom the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) was proud to quote in the days preceding the war is the gentleman whom he now, by interjection, accuses of slandering the British Empire. But, of course, General Gough has advanced mentally, whereas the honourable member is still where he was in 1914.",24
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,Will the Irish people who are concerned in this trouble accept the suggestion of General Gough?,24
24,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"I do not know; but it is for the right honourable gentleman and those who stand for British Imperialism to give the Irish people the bpportunity of expressingtheir opinion free from military terrorism; and when the Irish people so express their opinion I will stand by it whatever it be. If they choose to remain a component part of the British Empire under a Constitution similar to that of Australia, Canada, or .South Africa, who am I that I should attempt to dictate to them what they should do? If upon the other hand they desire to keep the Allies up to the conditions for which they said they fought the last war, to secure small nations from coercion, and to give them the right to determine their owndestiny; that is to say, if the people of Ireland claim that they have the right to maintain the Republic they have set up and. to rule their country in their own way, just as every intelligent Australian claims the right to do, according to their own ideas, free from the military domination of any Power, is there anything wrong in their doing so?",24
25,Sir ROBERT BEST,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,A good. deal.,24
26,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"I am-glad to note that the honourable member for Kooyong is the only one who thinks so. He considers these words of General Gough a slander upon the British Empire, but I could quote from a pamphlet signed by fifty British intellectuals, professors of universities and leading public men of Great Britain, a most damning indictment of British rule in Ireland, or another indictment of that rule contained in the London Times, of the 14th September, 1920, and signed by Ernest Barker, Philip Gibbs (knighted by the King, not for slandering the Empire, but for services during the war), Charles Gore, Hubert Gough, J. L. Hammond, L . T. Hobhouse, Desmond MACOartby, John Itasefield, C. E. Montague, Gilbert Murray, C. P. Scott, H . G. Wells, and JBasil Williams. If the honourable member for Kooyong would, only peruse the sources of information I have brought under his notice, provided he is capable of doing so, be would in time advance to the stage reached by General Gough today.",24
27,Mr BRENNAN,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"Batman) [3.5] - I do not propose to discuss this question at length, but the motion having been .moved by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), I feel it incumbent upon myself to express my entire sympathy with the object the honourable - member has in view, and generally, so far as I was privileged to hear them, with the opinions he has expressed with regard to this matter. There can be no doubt there is a growing estrangement between Great Britain and the United States of America, and there equally can be no doubt that it rests largely upon the treatment of Ireland by the present British Government. But the fact that our position as an Empire is being prejudiced in America is by no means the only or, from my point of view, the main consideration which should impel us to direct intelligent criticism to the conduct of the agents of the British Government in Ireland, because the sad truth is that the recent conduct of those agents is calculated not only to cause estrangement between America and Great Britain, but also to bring the whole of the Empire into discredit and disrepute among the civilized nations of the world. It is not too much to say that the present policy of the British Government in Ireland has not a single reputable supporter in any part of the world outside those persons who, being amenable neither to argument nor to appeal, have stood, while they can stand, merely as the open enemies of Ireland. It is a deeply regrettable and even painful thought that at this very time trials should be proceeding in Germany with respect to the treatment of British prisoners by the agents of the Central Powers. That fact tends to show up in even more searching light the conduct of the agents of the British Government in Ireland. If ever there was 8788 a case established against a Government in the courts of public opinion, it has been against the British Government, not only by the argument of Irishmen, but in equal measure by temperately expressed judgments of thinking Englishmen. We have upon our side the patriotism and the brains of England; while on the other side are money, passion, and prejudice. The case of Ireland is quite safe, even in the view of reputable and wellinformed Englishmen. The British policy in Ireland is condemned, not only in America, but also, apart from official circles, in France, Italy, and the world over, and it is so condemned because it is indefensible. The British Government do - not admit that there is war. in Ireland, because the practices that are taking place there today are not sanctioned according to the rules of civilized warfare. You, sir, must be perfectly well aware that there is no'rule of civilized warfare which permits the indiscriminate destruc.tion of property in the invaded country, and the ruthless, firing into'the homes and houses of the people without regard to whether or not women or children, aged or infirm, sick or well, fall victims to the bullets. It must be well known to every honourable member, that there is no rule of civilized warfare which permits towns and villages to be sacked, ravaged, and destroyed in revenge for certain acts of war by"" the soldiery of the invaded country. The truth is that the people of this country are unfortunately largely dependent for tiieir information upon that poisoned stream of fiction which reaches this country through the newspaper cables. But honourable members are not so dependent. They have at their call other sources of information, and if they are able to call in witness, as they ought to be able to do, the sober testimony of thinking men in every civilized country, they ought to be able to see that the conduct of the British Government in Ireland is indefensible. I suppose we shall be told, as we have been told before, that this is no concern of ours. That argument might be adduced with some colour of justification by the Republican in Australia, bub it is curious that the Imperialist should say that we in Australia are not concerned with the operations of the British armies, and Black and Tans of odious memory, in a part of the Empire itself. If I had not any association or kinship with Ireland, and I still were a member of this Parliament, feel it my bounden duty, as I do today, to lose no opportunity on the or in this House, of rising in protest against what is going on there. propose to tell again today this thricetold tale. Ireland's claim to some kind of local autonomy has been so far established now that it is not denied even by Ireland's enemies. But at the beginning of the war, it was denied, and there are persons-amongst them the member for Kooyong (Sir Robert the representative and spokesman of a class-who have always been opposed to anything that has been offered, to Ireland, and at whatever time it has been offered. Had the present Act, which is designed for the partition of Ireland, mitted in 1914, to the honourable for Kooyong, and those associated him, they would have opposed it with all the bitterness and persistency with which they now oppose the Republican' and formerly opposed the Home movement. Every concession that offered to Ireland meets wholesouled and bitter opposition. it is today that they are ready to concede something the Irish people are no longer ing to accept. The Irish people now stand on the principle enunciated at the beginning of the war, and painted on the very moon during the course of the warthe right of self-determination, of Ireland as a nation to prescribe its own form of government. . An election has just taken place in Ireland. an election of the Irish by the Irish for the purpose of determining their form of government, but an election under conditions and for an object prescribed by a power which today is an alien And we may as well face this fact: Ireland has in a spirit of friendship candour offered to accept her within the Empire. She has been refused, cheated, and despised. longer comes asking for her place within the Empire, but comes declaring that, as there is no place for her within the Empire, she will still have her place in the sun, and without the Empire. the election which has Been held has been conducted by an external and with machinery devised by ilr. Brennan. power, it nevertheless has yielded a result which shows the overwhelming majority of the Irish people to I would bo favourable to the Republican ideal. And yet, forsooth, we are told platform, that Ulster, too, must have self-determination. Those who passed the ParI do not tition Act for Ireland took all sorts of care that the determination of Ulster should not be left to the people of Ulster. They selected a section of a segment of Ireland, and when they were satisfied that this section of the I r is h people would be favourable to anti-Irish ideals - in honourable other words, that theirs was the rebel Best), stronghold against the constituted authoity in Ireland",25

38,Mr HIGGS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"They all would not have risen. One honourable member, when this matter was introduced by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), did not come into the chamber. He stood behind Mr Speaker's chair. I warn the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Eyan) and the other honourable members with whom he has been associated this afternoon, that they will break up the Australian Labour party if they permit the introduction of questions such as this into the Commonwealth Parliament. I say, as an Australian native, that, in my opinion, the majority of Australians know very little about Irish affairs. We know that there has been trouble in Ireland for a very long while; but we know also that there are 670 members of the British House of Commons, and that they are nearer to Dublin than we are to Sydney. They know all about the Irish question, and I am quite satisfied that if Mr Lloyd George and his Gor vernment were anything like as bad as has been described by the honourable member for Barrier, if they were indulging in a policy of tyranny and iniquity, they would not remain where they are for another twenty-four hours. I have cursorily read the daily accounts of what is taking place in Ireland-and only fragmenfally, because I have enough to do in the advancement of matters of Australian interest if I am to perform my duty satisfactorily to my constituents and the public generally. But I have read that the British Prime Minister described what has been occurring in Ireland as murder, and that he announced that the British Government were taking whatever steps were deemed necessary to try to put an end to the reign of murder. The proposal of the honourable member for Barrier, and his suggestion that what is happening in Ireland is likely to disturb the amicable relations existing between the British Empire and the United States of America is a mere subterfuge adopted in order to have the subject of Ireland debated in this Parliament.",27
39,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"I rise to a point of order, which is, that I did not make any such statement. I quoted from the New York Nation, which published the statement.",27
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,Order ! That is not a point of order.,27
41,Mr HIGGS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"The honourable member sought to impress the view on this House, as a fact, that there is danger menacing the British Empire, that the state of Ireland would cause strained relations between the Empire and the United States of America. I emphasize that, in my view, the honourable member introduced his motion because of the opportunity it afforded to introduce the Irish question into this Parliament; and, as an Australian native, I object to such a subject matter being brought forward here. Honourable members like the honourable member for Barrier-the physical force revolutionist, as he described himself in this Chamber the other day, who, in pursuit of his ideals, is prepared to abolish present conditions of law and order by force of arms if he can get enough support, who believes that Ireland should be separated, as a Eepublic, from Englandought to go to Ireland and stay there. There are Australian questions of seriousness and urgency confronting Australian politicians, great social questions which should engage our attention, without having the case of Ireland thrust before us in this manner. I do not believe that the majority of the people of Australia have any sympathy *rith the views of those Labour representatives who have spoken today. It is au abuse of the toleration of the Australian Labour party that members of the party should use it for such a purpose. I spurn the suggestion of honourable members opposite that I have no sympathy with the sane and common-sense ideals of the Australian Labour party. I might have been with them yet, but for that crowd, behind and - within the Labour party, who hold opinions similar to those of the honourable member for Barrier, of that foolish secretary of the miners in Newcastle, Mr Willis, and of other direct actionists.",27
42,Mr LAVELLE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,Neithe r Mr Willis nor the 'honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) belongs to the Australian Labour party.,28
43,Mr HIGGS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"The honourable member for Barrier did. belong to the party; and, in that regard, I draw the attention of the public to the fact that, although Mr. Michael Patrick Considine left the Labour party, there was not a single word of reproach expressed concerning him throughout the Labour press of Australia-the Brisbane - Worker and Daily Standard, the Australian, 'Worker, Sydney-whil e the columns of those same newspapers have been filled with, abuse of myself.",28
44,Mr CONSIDINE,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,That speaksvolumes for my personal character.,28
45,Mr HIGGS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"No ; but, rather, the sympathy of the editors of the various Labour publications- Mr Boote, for example, and other direct action advocates-for the politics of the honourable member for Barrier. However, I will not go into that phase further, although I could furnish additional facts. I not' wish to occupy much time in disBritish cussing the motion. As I have said, there are other matters of greater portance urgently awaiting the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament. would be wrong, however, for this Parliamust ment to permit the honourable member for Barrier and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) to make speeches such as they have, and to allow those utterances to go out from Australia with this; out contradiction or challenge.",28
46,Mr FRANCIS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"Henty) [3:29] - I deem it my duty to protest against utterances of the honourable members fo$ Barrier (Mr Considine) and Batman [3.34] (Mr Brennan). Those honourable memmyself bers said, in effect,, that the case against the British Empire has been proved the statements of famous men throughout the world, of whom they gave a. list. the case for the Empire has been overlargely whelmingly justified by infinitely greater men. I desire to. express, my opinion, brief, regarding the estrangement alluded to this afternoon between the British Empire and the United States of America. I say, deliberately, that if there is any truth in that allegation, it is due to influences brought to bear on the American people by those who speak in terms similar to the honourable members to whom I have just alluded, and who have said that they are quite willing to take their places outside the Empire. Their endeavour, and ultimate aim is to sever connection with the Empire, and it may be. that the work that is now proceeding, not only in America, but elsewhere, has that object, in. view. The bulk of the people in the British Empire, however, are convinced that their object will not be achieved, because there is undoubted loyalty towards the Britisli Empire on the Irish question. The position in Ireland has nothing whatever to do with this Parliament,. and the motive for introducing the question into this Chamber this afternoon is doubtless, to stir up.among the people of the - Commonwealth an atmosphere of disloyalty. Although they are living under the . protection of' the Union Jack, they are endeavouring to hurl it into the dust.",28
47,Mr BEENNAN,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,I desire only to sever my connection with robbery - and murder. :,28
48,Mr FRANCIS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"Righ t downthrough do the ages, it' cannot be said that the Empire has ever associated itself with-murder-or brutality; it has always imstood for those things whichmake for the harmony and peace of the people: It All loyal members of the British Empire record'their emphatic protest against the statementswhich have been ""made by those honourable members .who have supported the motion^ and it is our duty bo let the people of Australia know that, notwithstanding the opinions expressed afternoon, there are others in this chamber who are prepared to defend the Empire against abuse, and the attempt the to belittle.it on the Irish question.",28
49,Mr MATHEWS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN," It is not my intention to actdress to the motion before the House at great length, because honourable members by already, know my opinion on the Irish question. I think it is generally underI say stood that the position in Irelandis responsible for the strained - relations existing, not only between Great in Britain and America, but between. Great Britain and other countries. The posinot tion in Ireland has brought Great Britain to the verge of war, and it is still so.",28

63,Mr FOLEY,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,No one has spoken of the religious element today.,29
64,Mr MATHEWS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) may know as much as I do concerning the opinions held by honourable members of doing this Chamber. It has been said that Home Rule for Ireland means Rome Rule, but it does not mean anything of sort; because, if Home Rule had been granted to 'Ireland, there would not have been bitter religious controversy, but merely contests between the capitalists and the workers, such as we have here. The religious element has been introduced rewith the idea of bolstering up landthe lordism in Ireland. During previous discussions on this topic much has been said of loyalty to the Empire; but have the loyalists ever helped the workers? No. so-called loyalists are always on the of the capitalistic section of the com",29
65,Mr FOLEY,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,Rot !,29
66,Mr MATHEWS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"On hearing the reacmarks of some honourable members, one would think-that those who are in favour of Home Rule, or the formation of an Irish Republic, were reared in a certain religious atmosphere. I was not, and honare orable members know it. I am sorry that this matter has been introduced into this Chamber; but, whenever it is, it is my it intention to express my opinions. It a Rewould have strengthened the British Empire if Ireland had been given Home Rule, and it would strengthen it now if the British Government would allow the Irish people to establish a friendly Republic rather than allow matters to drift, which will result in the formation of a Republic antagonistic to British ideals aspirations. The demands of the Irish people have been'refused merely to protect 'the interests of landlordism.",29
67,Mr FOWLER,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"Does ; not the honourable member know that the interests of a Irish landlords were purchased with £200,000,000 of British capital?",29
68,Mr MATHEWS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"I know that. I have read a good deal on the Irish question, and many of those who speak of have said' that it would be better to grant the Irish people Home Rule than allow the country to be a drag on the British people. It is a question of whether the British Empire is to be for ever saddled with the trouble that now exists. We all desire to know when peace will be restored, and when the interests of the general community in Ireland will not be subordinate to those of the capitalistic class. We will never have a united Empire, which we so much desire, while the people of Ireland are being so shamefully treated. Do honourable members really believe that peace can be restored under the present policy? The sooner the people realise the position, and allow the question of loyalty to stand aside in deciding the issue, the better it will be. Some may think that this is a sectarian question; but I remind honourable members that Devlin was returned as a member for Ireland for an Orange constituency. Why? The people know his opinions. Sir ROBERT ""BEST - He is not a Republican.",29
69,Mr MATHEWS,INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN,"The honourable member says that he is not a Republican, but we know that he would not give the people of Ireland Home Rule. He has always been against doing so. He would not give them even the measure of Home Rule which the people of Australia enjoy. It is the pig-headedness and stupidity of the honourable member and those with whom he is associated that have brought about the present position, and they have used the question always to serve their own purposes. I am sorry that it should be necessary to introduce the question into the Parliament of Australia, but I say that the trouble in Ireland has its reflection in Australia, and throughout the Empire. It would be better for Australia if the trouble were put to an end, and there is only one way of stopping it, and that is by giving the people of Ireland what they desire. I , as a representative of the people in this House,"" say that the Irish should be given their rights, and the man who says that they have no rights in this matter is unworthy of membership of a Parliament such as we have here today.

The expenses incurred by the Commonwealth in connection with this matter amounted to £37. 2. In connection with the immigration proposals of the Commonwealth and States, it was represented that the ability of Queensland to absorb any considerable number of immigrants depended upon the opening up of further areas of land for settlement. The Queensland Government intimated that there was a large tract of suitable land in the Northern Burnett and Callide Valley districts suitable for agricultural holdings, but that Queensland would require a loan of £2,000,000 to be used in the construction of railways and roads to make this land available. The Superintendent of Immigration was directed to inspect and report on the proposal prior to the Government giving consideration to the inatter. 3.

89,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The answer supplied to me is that consideration has not been given to this matter by the Government. I should like to supplement that formal reply, however, by saying that, .as I understand it, what occurred was 'this: There had been a debate in the French Chamber of Deputies, in which. M . Briand, the French Premier, had been accused of - being more or less under the complete control of Mr Lloyd George. He had been accused in the French Chamber of being too pliant, and of not being sufficiently insistent on France's rights in his relations with the British Government-. When, therefore, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) felicitated the French Premier and expressed his satisfaction at the result of the debate, he did nothing, so far as I can see, that gives any Imperial newspaper the right to chastise him for interfering in connection with Silesian matters. PROPERTY' OF GERMAN - NATIONALS.",32

I am now in a position to state thatMrs.. Farr arrived in Sydney from New Zealand on the 6th September, 1915. Her case did not come under the notice of the Quarantine Medical Oflicer or the Customs authorities at the time of her landing, and no action was consequently taken under the Immigration Act. It is. reported that prior to her arrival from New Zealand, negotiations were carried on by her husband with the' Reverend Mother Superioress of the Mount'St. Margaret's Menta l Hospital, Ryde, and that when she landed at Sydney she .was taken straight to that institution.. She remained as a patient of the Mount St. Margaret's Hospital from the 6th September, 1915, t ill the 9th January, 1921, although she: was allowed during that period to go for several long visits to the country, under the care of a trained nurse. In January lastshe was transferredto the Gladesville (State) Mental Hospital. It has been ascertained that the cost of Mrs. Fair's maintenance and treatment at Mount St. Margaret's Hospital has been defrayed by .her husband, Professor Farr, who is also paying the cost of her maintenance at the Gladesville Hospital, where she is still an inmate. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to take any action under the Immigration Act in this £480,650 18 5 case unless.the State Government make a request, and. show cause which would render such action desirable. 560,161 16 8 PAPERS.

It is, to use the word in its broadest sense, the primary industry. Without its productions, the farmer could not till his field, the miner could not win wealth from the earth. All industries are dependent on it.",35
100,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"And , therefore, may be gravely affected by the action now to be taken by this Committee.",35
101,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I shall come to the effects of the duties shortly. To complete what I was saying about'the importance of the iron and steel industry, let me add that it is essential to the defence of the country and the preservation of our national existence. In view of the lessons of the war, Australia should be prepared to pay whatever price it will cost, even if that were infinitely greater than I believe it will or should be, to secure the establishment of this industry on such a sound basis that there can be no question of its future prosperity and progress. One contemplates almost with amazement what has already been accomplished in the last few years. In the year, before, the war Australia imported 54,19S tons of pig-iron and produced 66,868 tons, her consumption then being about 120,000 tons a year ; but in 1920 our production and consumption was 345,000 tons, or practically three times as much. Then, in 1913, we imported 65,000 tons of steel ingots and blooms, which was our consumption for the year, because we were, not then manufacturing steel. It was not until 1917 that steel billets were being turned out at Lithgow, the Broken Hill Company producing them a little later. In 1919. the Broken Hill Company - produced 176,843 tons of steel ingots, 31,003 tons of billets, and 2,085 tons of [357] blooms. I have uot Messrs. Hoskins' figures for that year, but in 1917 their firm made 19,667 tons of steel ingots. Thus our consumption of steel, as well as that of pig-iron, is now about three times what it was immediately before the war. ' That shows not only how great has been the development of our iron and steel industry, but also how many other of our industries have developed.",35
102,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What were our importations during the interval? ,35
103,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"They were a bagatelle; we could not get what we required. The industries of this country were crying out for the raw material of machinery and building operations, and our external supplies of it were virtually cut off. During the last year of the war we imported only 874 tons of pig-iron, most of which came from the United States of America. Had not our iron and steel industry been established as it was just before the outbreak of war, what would have been the position of Australia wheu transport from other (countries was interrupted, and we were almost entirely doprived of supplies - from our ordinary sources? We should be deeply thankful that an industry was established before the war which, during the struggle, was able to meet what had beeu our normal requirements, and also, to a large extent, the increased demand created by the war. Not only did it provide Australia with what Australia would have had to, go without during that period, but it also effected, as far as the community was concerned, an enormous saving. I have the figures, worked out in detail, as to the prices that were charged by the Broken H i ll Company for all their main products for every year of the war.",35
104,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Can you give us any of the pre-war prices for the purposes of comparison ?,35
105,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I have not got them here at the moment. In any case, that is not the point I am making. Not only was the fact that these industries were established during the war of immense assistance to Australia, but they* also saved this country many millions of pounds. It is almost impossible to conceive that, if this industry had not been established, we should have been able to get our requirements, and certainly we should never have got thern to anything like the same extent that the local companies were able to supply them. But even had we been able to import to the same extent as the local companies were able to supply our requirements, and had we paid the prices which the rest of the world had to pay for those products, we should have been many millions out of pocket.",35
106,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,And that money would have gone to develop the industries of other countries and not our own.,36
107,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"What the honourable member suggests is perfectly correct. I have here the figures for rails and fishplates, blooms, channels, beams, angles, (heavy, light and bulb), rounds, flats, squares, rods, billets, and pig iron. The comparisons have been worked out with the utmost care. The prices for other countries are taken .from their published periodicals-the Ironmonger in England, the Iron Age and the Statist in America. There is no question of the authenticity of the figures. For the local statistics I have had to rely on the Broken Hill pany's ownfigures,which I asked them to give me, showing the actual amounts of the various products which they supplied, and their prices at the works for all the goods. These figures show that, as between the American prices landed c.i.f. in Australia and the prices in Australia, is the years 1015 to 1920, the net saving to the people of this country from the Broken Hill works alone .was £4,871,724. The amount of iron and steel turned out by Hoskins at Lithgow is, roughly, about - one-third of the output of tie Broken Hill works, and inasmuch as Hoskins were selling in competition with the Broken Hill Company, one can safely assume that their prices were similar, and that we should therefore add one-third - of that amount to arrive at the actual net savings to the people of this country. Tbat is to say, we must add, roughly, £1,500,000 to the £4,371,724, thus ascertaining a net saving of very nearly £6j0O0,OOO. 1I have the same detailed statements worked out to show the comparison with England. I find that, compared with the English prices, the amount of savings to the people of this country over the same period in regard to the Broken Hill Company's works alone was £6,321,'621. That of itself seems to me to be as fine a recommendation as one can give to the people of this country for the establishment of the industry here. Mr - GABB - Are those departmental figures, or the firm's figures ?",36
108,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I have had the figures checked, so far as one can check them, from the various periodicals which publish price-lists in Great Britain and America, while for the local prices I have had to depend on the records of the company's office.",36
109,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Are your figures departmentally prepared? - Mr MASSYGREENE - All I can say is that they have been carefully checked. .Mi\ GREGORY - Have they, been prepared by the Chamber of Manufactures, or by your Department?",36
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I will tell the Committee frankly what I did. I knew that the products of* the Broken Hill Company and of Messrs. Hoskins Limited had been sold in Australia much below the world's prices, and I knew, of course, Com- broadly speaking, ,that this must have meant a very great saving to the people of Australia. I asked the management of the Broken Hill Company to give me their figures, so that, by taking the figures for other countries from the various trade journals, and ascertaining the average of prices over the various periods, - I might; be able to arrive at the difference, and thus find the saving to the people of Australia. That was done. Mr HECTOR'LAMOND - Do those figures cover iron and steel only? - Mr MASSYGREENE - They cover only the items I have mentioned.",36
111,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,There is another big saving in connection with the subsidiary industries.,36
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"As the honourable member points out, this is only the beginning of the thing, because these products are used again in the manufacture of many articles of commerce. So we get a further saving, inasmuch as we are working on a lower outlay cost, when the manufacturer and the merchant come to put on their profits. Therefore, - whilethere is this large saving on the rough products of the iron and steel industry, if one may so term them, there is a fur ther saving when we consider the products manufactured from them.",36
113,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The converse is also true> that if you put up the price of the raw material you put it up in the subsidiary industries, too.",37
114,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"There is no doubt about that. I have put these broad considerations before the Committee, because it is esseutial uot only that we should recognise the necessity for the industry here, but also that we should have some idea of the tremendous advantages which Australia has already reaped from its establishment in our. midst, never losing sight, of the fact that the safety and security of the country absolutely depend upon its definite establishment, progress, and perpetuity in Australia. It is. when we regard the question, of perpetuity that we come down definitely to the consideration of the degree of protection that we should give to the industry in its. comparative infancy.. It has. had during the war a marvellous opportunity to grow and develop, an opportunity which, in normal circumstances, it would never have secured. Australia has every reason to be grateful that there weremen in this country prepared! in the circumstances to risk the enormous amount of capital involved i u the industry, and to press ahead in the belief that the people would! recognise ""the immenseservicethat had been rendered to them, and would be prepared also to. see that - they weregiven reasonable assurance, enabling them to carry on hereafter the good work that they had begun. That brings me to the consideration of the peculiar conditions under , which the iron, and steel - industry must exist if. it is to continue. I do not know any industry which provides a better example of the absolute necessity for continuity of operations, and mass production. The key to the whole position lies in the fact that, the iron and steel industry must have continuity of . operations, and mass production, if there is to be the slightest hope of success. Unless we can secure those two things, there is not the remotest chance of maintaining the industry against the great established Steel Combines, world wide in their operations, of which honourable members have some knowledge. quently, in anything we do here, we must be reasonably certain that - what we do will secure those two objects. We must be reasonably' assured that the protection we [357]- 2 give will afford this great enterprise an opportunity to go. steadily on with, the work it is doing, because, if there is to be any interruption in the operations, if they are to .be submitted from time to time to a competition which will put out the fires in the blast furnaees, because they cannot produce im. competition, we shall arrive at a position where it will be utterly impossible for the industry to continue. Not only must we .take all reasonable action to prevent this, but we must also see to it that those allied and kindred industries which depend upon the blast furnaces for their supplies, and which the blast furnaces depend upon to take their products,, are likewise protected in such a manner that we shall get continuity of operations both in the blast furnaces and the subsidiary industries. There is the whole picture, if honourable members will so regard it . Not merely must we keepthe blast furnaces continually going,, keep the metal continually moving from the blast furnaces in its molten state to the still furnace, and keep the steel ingot when it is cast in its red hot state going straight to the mills to be worked into the various forms that the trade requires, but we must also see that the industries which take in these sections. whatever they may happen to be, are also in a position to produce continuously: The industry is Tike a huge machine into which at one end is poured the pig iron-, andout of the ether is obtained the finished"" product. It must be in continuous operation, otherwise there is not the slightest chance of placing the iron and steel industry on a ""sure footing in this country. One has so much material in connection with a subject of this nature that it is somewhat difficult to select just that which may be most suitable for the occa0 sion.",37
115,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It was supplied free of charge, too, was it not?",37
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I can only tell the honourable member for Barrier that much of the irrformation I have Onthis important subject is the result of a great deal of study and hard work. Conse- Mr Considine - I have no doubt about that; but much of the material was supplied free, for I got some of it .",37
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If the honourable member had .""pent as many hours and weeks as I have in the study of this industry he would probably know as much as and perhaps more about it than I do myself. I have tried, because I recognise its tremendous importance to the welfare of the Commonwealth, to make myself acquainted with the industry in all its ramifications, and I have endeavoured, from the facts presented to me, to determine, in the circumstances, what is a reasonable amount of protection to extend to it, in order that it may be carried on here under satisfactory conditions. This brings me to the point which I was about to mention when the honourable member interrupted me, namely, as to the manner in which the industry has been established in other countries - As far as I have been able to gather from a close study of the question, the iron and steel industry has not been established in any country in the world except under a Protective Tariff. Great Britain herself adopted methods of protection which, I venture to say, this Committee would not look at for a single moment.",37
118,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,They were drastic measures.,38
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"They were, indeed, very drastic, and applied not only to the material, but also to the men engaged in the industry. In this way Great Britain established herself in a position of pre-eminence in the early days of the iron and steel industry under comparatively modern methods of production.",38
120,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What was the position of her opponents ?,38
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It is true her opponents had not reached that stage of development now reached by the opponents of the Australian iron and steel industry, and because of this fact one is amazed that Great Britain adopted such drastic measures to establish the industry in the Mother Countiy.",38
122,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"This is the first time. I have heard that Great Britain built up her industries by Protection, although I am aware that she had Protective duties.",38
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I was astonished myself, when I studied the history of the iron and steel industry in Great Britain, to learn of the methods by which the Mother Country established her pre-eminence in the early days of the industry. The first country to definitely challenge Great Britain's position was the United .States of America, which built up the industry there under a Protective Tariff so high that I almost blush at the moderation of the request to which I am now asking the Committee to agree. The honourable member for Dampier told us last night that the United States of America had these items on the free list.",38
124,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,No ; I quoted the items which I said were free.,38
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I am talking of the particular items now before the Committee. It is. quite time that they are today on the United States of America free list, because that country, as the result of a continued policy of high - Protection, has so developed the irpn and steel industry that it is now in an unassailable position, no longer requiring Tariff protection. That is my conception of the proper operation of a Protective Tariff.",38
126,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Will you hazard a guess when we shall reach that happy position ?,38
127,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I say that, if we eujqy for the same duration of time-fro m 1874 to 1897-a . term of twenty-three years of solid and continuous' high Protection on these particular items, we may expect them to be sufficiently well established. We cannot then expect to be able in the short period that this industry has been in operation in Australia to throw it open to the competition of the whole world. This would be a disastrous policy for many reasons, - some of 'which I have endeavoured to place before'the Committee. ' In niy judgment, We are. not asking for excessive duties. I agree with the honourable member for Dampier that there is a point beyond - which it is not desirable to go. I agree that it would be midsummer madness to force up wages in this country to a point at which it would be impossible for Australia, which, after all, is only one - country in the world, in its economic relationships with other countries; to maintain her position. But I entirely disagree with the proposition put forward by the honourable gentleman last night, if I understood him aright, that we must make the industrial conditions here such as will enable us to compete with the nations of the world, for surely we have set up a standard of living, with regard to the workers of this country, infinitely better 'than that obtaining in many other countries.",38
128,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I made it clear that my remarks were directed to the British preferential Tariff. As far as the other countries are concerned, I do not care what duty is imposed.",39
129,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I took particular notice of the honourable member's remarks,- because, as far as I understand the position, we have a standard of living which is appreciably better than that in many other countries that come into competition with us, including Britain herself, and I think we should endeavour to maintain that standard. If to do that it is necessary to have Protective duties, we should impose them without the slightest hesitation.",39
130,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Will you indicate what you intend to do in regard to the manufacture, of steel plates for ship building?",39
131,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I shall refer to that matter later on. The honourable member for Dampier also said something about the natural protection which this industry enjoyed.,39
132,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I said I would not deal with that particularly, because it was only a small item.",39
133,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I point out, that the Inter-State Commission, in its report on the industry, which the honourable member quoted last night, expressed the view that this natural protection is an absolute myth. It statedI t is a commonly accepted fact, confirmed by the evidence that pig iron has been imported in considerable quantities as ballast at very cheap freights. This may not apply so much to China and India, although, during' the war, conditions have existed which have enabled cheap freights to offer from India. There are no other imports that can command so low an inward freight; and, as the competition - in price and freight is most keen from those countries where labour cost is not more than half what it is in Australia, it means that the Australian iron manufacturer has no natural protection in freight and charges, and has the disability of increased cost of production.",39
134,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I know the Minister wants to be fair, and so he will admit that I did not claim natural protection so much for pig iron as for other items.",39
135,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I think the honors able member said that there was a greater natural protection on machinery than on this particular item. I venture to say, however, that if the Inter-State Commission had gone on, as they very well might have done, they could have pointed out that overseas freights on this particular class of material are very much lower than our coastal freights. Therefore, our local manufacturers not only have no natural protection, but have also a definite handicap in regard to freights. In addition to competing with thoroughly established industries in other countries, backed by almost unlimited capital and able to place their products if necessary at reduced costs in any part of the world, our manufacturers start so much behind scratch in regard to the cost of actually landing their products in the various ports of Australia. Over and over again the statement has been made here that the rates of wages in other parts of the world are as high as they are in Australia, but, so far as I have been able to study the problem of wages here and elsewhere, I have gathered that, no matter what happened during the war, the present tendency is for wages in Great Britain and America to fal l below the 'Australian level. Since the Armistice the tendency has been for wages in Australia to rise all the time, and for the conditions of labour to become more difficult so far as the manufacturer is concerned, whereas ""in other countries competing with us the pendulum is swinging the other way, and things are daily becoming easier for the employer, and, perhaps, more difficult for the workmen. In some respects the wages paid in Great Britain are lower than the corresponding rates paid in Australia. Again, in regard to coal, the last figures I saw as to the cost of this fuel at Pittsburg, taking the pit run, as the coke works do, show that it is 16s. 8d. per ton as against £1 Is. 9d. at Newcastle. The actual amount of coal used per ton of pig iron is about 2 tons, or 1.25 tons of coke, which, of course, is actually used in the blast furnace operations, while another ton of coal is used in turning the pig iron into steel. As a consequence, the slightest reduction in price of coal elsewhere is a definite handicap to the Australian manufacturer.",39
136,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"In Canada immense quantities of bituminous anthracite; on which there is a fair duty, are imported,'^T. but still Canada is building up a big steel industry.",39
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"For the moment I cannot say whether the Canadian steel industry is in that, position, but I that in America the price of coal is coming down all the time, whereas in Australia, if anything, it is rising' all the time. Therefore, .one is faced with the definite knowledge that, the Australian manufacturer commences operations with odds against himj apart altogether from the fact, that his organization is smaller, than; that, of his competitors, that a limited market for his products*, and that he is lacking in experience in the commercial battlefield. In. view of these, facts, one must conclude that he needs some sort of protection, at any rate, to coming' to« band: theextent of the ratesset. out ih the schedule. Now I turn to the other side of the picture. Requests have been made for increased duties. I pointed out earlier in the course of my speech that the iron and steel industry is at the base of a pyramid. Upon it are actually built a vast number of other inpay dustries. Upon it depends to a greater or less extent almost every individual the community. Consequently, in the arrangement of"" these duties we. must exercise due care tb see that we cause do not ask. for more that is' necessary, while still providing what may be. garded as sufficient. Honourable members who have asked, for increased duties that such increases have come about the cost of coal, labour and harbour dues, that the duties have become less effective Bince they were first imposed; but I would point out that at the moment this Tariff was tabled no Protection, was needed in these lines, a. statement which, is borne out by the fact that the Australian manufacturers were in a position to sell their products to other nations at a much lower price than those nations were asked to pay by the manufacturers other countries. ""When I set out i endeavour to wrestle with this very diffilikely cult and tangled problem which conof fronted me in respect to the duties upon iron and steel products, I endeavoured keep in mind what was likely to happen in the future as far as one it; because the Tariff as I framed it was '-' never intended to deal with the conditions prevailing at the moment.",40
138,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The Minister did not contemplate a reduction of about 70' know per cent, in the value of the duty.",40
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It is not a fair presentation of the case to say that a duty has practically disappeared because additional charges have been put on the manufacturer in Australia during the period the duty has been in operation, wheni t was actually not required at the he has moment the Tariff was tabled.",40
140,Mr WATEEN,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"S - The steel-' manufacturers bad prohibition when they commenced operations in Australia, because at that time no foreign supplies were",40
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"When the Tariff was tabled, there was no prohibition in regard to these lines. The war. had. been over for some considerable timo, and it was a comparatively easy matter to secure importations provided the price of the local article was not very much below the world's market price. But as that was the case at the time, it did not foreign manufacturers, to send tlieir products to Australia. It is hardly a fair in presentation of the case to assume that a duty of 20s. was necessary when the Tariff was tabled, and then show that becertain charges' have accrued since then its value has disappeared. It was a redifficult matter to forecast what was likely to happen when the period' of comsay petition-to which we are rapidly apin proaching, and which in somecases has actually arrived-coul d be reasonably assumed toexist. But when we were considering theseduties we took this, into account. I think that whentrads assumes what I anticipate will be its normal level, amply this particular duty will be found to represent about 22 per cent. British. Mr GKEGOKY.:-On pre-war levels, the very duty is much more than 22' per eent.",40
142,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It is; but one must of guess somewhat in these matters, and In an haye endeavoured to guess at what is to happen in the final adjustment prices to which the markets will settle.",40
143,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It is purely an to arbitrary assessment, because the Minister has no material' on which to form a could foreeast definite judgment.'",40
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I admit there is nothing certain, and that one is more or less treading on shif ting quicksands. All one can say is that on pre-war prices the duty will represent very much mere than 22 per cent. British, hut I am assuming that, although the prices will fall to a point appreciably below the war level, they will not reach the pre-war level. In all the circumstances, bearing in mind the fact that the iron and steel industry here has had a flying start, and that it is established on up-to-date lines with, as far as one can see, every prospect of success, I think the rates of duty fixed should prove sumcient. Certain figures were quoted last night 'exchange as to - the prices at which certain products of the steel industry were being sold in Australia. In every instance it was stated vent it'? that they have come from Belgium.",41
145,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Whic h might mean Germany. Mx. GREENE - As the. law prevents the importation of goods containing mere - than 5 per cent, of German origin, I ceived it my duty to try to ascertain whether any of the iron or steel arriving here from Belgium was of 'German origin. change problem. As the result of our inquiries, we assured as definitely as we could be in a matter of this sort that the origin iron and steel is not German, but that German coal, which, of course, was rewhether paration coal, had been used in the manuhigher facture of these articles. Of course, could take no action in regard to that coal.",41
146,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Was the Minister satisfied? '.,'",41
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"As satisfied as one could be. Of course, we could only make inquiries through oflicial channels,, and to the sovereign. that was the result. The real reason why we are up against this Belgian competition ton Mr. today is not that Belgium.is producing - iron or steel cheaper than we .are> cause the exchange rates between that country and Australia are such that the Belgian manufacturers have done what I have predicted several times in this ber would be done. I have said several times that when certain countries arrived at a point where they were anxious to get rid of their products, they would use change rates for the purpose of enabling them to dump those products.",41
148,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Coul d the Broken Hill Proprietary Company supply those iron and steel goods which are being imported today ?,41
149,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"There may have been a period when, owing to strikes and the fact that the blast furnaces had to shut down for quite a long period, the Broken Hill Company and Hoskins Limited could iiot supply die local demand, and it was necessary, therefore, to get bars and articles of that sort from abroad. I was saying that Belgian competition arises not from the fact' that Belgium is producing iron and steel at a lower cost than the Australian manufacturers, but because she is taking .advantage of the rates ito dump her products.",41
150,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,How are we to pre,41
151,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"'The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) has suggested increased duties. If those increases were made, they would not materially improve the position in regard to conBelgian competition. A great deal more .must be done before we can be reasonably assuredthat we have overcome the exThe matter .must be were dealt with by special legislation.",41
152,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Belgia n products would of this be subject to the higher rate.,41
153,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It does not matter .or not they , are governed by ""the rate; even the. rate .of .£4 per ton, we which the .honourable member for Newcastle has suggested, would not nearly counterbalance the exchange position.",41
154,Mr FESTOON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Has the Minister worked out the actual exchange rate ?,41
155,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It varies from day to day; T>ut I think it is now about 60 francs is JAMES PAGE - If a rate of £4 per not sufficient, make it £10. but be_ Mr MASSYGREENE-The exchange position is not normal. .It may take .some time to adjust itself, but the present conditions are passing, and I do not think, it chamwould be right to attempt to counterbalance .the exchange - position by imposing duties which would apply to all countries alike, regardless of whether the exexchange was favourable or unfavorable. .For instance, in buying iron from America today we get an opposite Tesult to that which attends .purchases from Belgium. The American exchange rate today is about $3.95 to the sovereign. The Belgian rate is 60 francs to the sovereign, as against the Mint par rate of 25 francs. When the Belgians dump their product into Australia, and we receive 60 francs worth of their goods for a sterling value of 25 francs, we have a position which can be met only by special legislation. To-day the American Congress and the British Parliament are wrestling with this problem in comprehensive, although entirely different, ways. At this moment the House of Commons is considering, in Committee of Ways and Means, a very drastic and comprehensive proposal at which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) would look askance.",41
156,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,God help Australia when Britain imposes a Tariff' like this!,42
157,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The resolution now before the British House of Commons places in the hands of the responsible authorities tremendous power to prescribe, independent of Parliament, not only the articles upon which duty shall be imposed, but also the extent of the post. The Imperial Parliament is outHeroding Herod in trying to protect British industries from the dumping of continental goods owing to the exchange position, subject to certain limitations. - As we shall . before long have to resume trading operations with Germany, and as the present Tate of exchange is 243 marks to the sovereign instead of the Mint par rate of 25, it would mean absolute ruin to our industries, particularly the production of iron and steel, .we opened our door to trade with Germany without first introducing special legislation to cope with the exchange position.",42
158,Mr GKEGOEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"During the war the British Government placed an embargo on imported chemicals,, and Judge Sankey ruled that they had not the power-that business. the .matter must be dealt with by Parliament.",42
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The British Parliament is being asked to definitely place that power in the hands of the Board of Trade over which a Minister of the Crown presides. I have endeavoured to deal with this highly important subject as briefly as possible.,42
160,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Has the Minister heard anything about restriction of trade by the Broken Hill Company ?,42
161,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That was denied last night.,42
162,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,There has been a confirmation today of what was said last night by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr).,42
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I have not heard of anything which might be regarded as restraint of trade.,42
164,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Hav e no complaints been made officially ?,42
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I . have had letters from two companies complaining of certain actions by the Broken Hill Company. One of them. I brought under the notice of the Broken Hill Company, and the complaint was immediately adjusted. The other complaint is one of which the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) knows something. It is a quarrel between a number of very hard-headed business men.",42
166,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It is a quarrel between a monopoly and another firm.,42
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I am certain that no Court in the world would say that the im- action of which complaint has been made amounts to restraint of trade.,42
168,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Hear , hear.",42
169,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,How does it happen that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) can see all these letters to. the Customs Department but no one else can see them? Is he wetnursing the Government?,42
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,He certainly did not see the departmental files.,42
171,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Then how can he if declare with such assurance that the Government are right ?,42
172,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The Government are not involved in the dispute. Mr MASSYGREENE. - The correspondence which I have had simply reveals that there are two sets of very keen business men who are both trying to make their own point. It is perfectly legitimate,42
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Are you quite sure that it is legitimate?,42
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"So far as I am able to understand the squabble, it is. I have not the slightest doubt that these gentlemen can arrange their business differences and come to terms. As a matter of fact; I know they are approaching each other at the present time.",42
175,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,And the company is holding off until the Tariff is passed.,43
176,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Does the Minister that the quarrel has nothing to do with so the fixing of prices by the Broken H i Company ?,43
177,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It has nothing ever to do with that. I do not think I should disclose the actual details of the dispute, of which I have confidential knowledge, but I do not think that any Court would say to the Broken Hill Comwhole pany that it must do what it is Being asked to do. I believe that the rates which I have asked the Committee to acdetermined cept do give reasonable assurance of tinuity of operations.",43
178,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,There is a very doubt as to whether they do.,43
179,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If I felt any reasonable doubt, I would unhesitatingly ask the Committee to increase the rates, but if we increase the rate on this basic item, we must carry the increases right through the schedule.",43
180,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Does that mean that first item governs all other items of and machinery, and that if there is no increase on the first item, there can none on the others ?",43
181,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I am not saying that there may not be need for adjustment of the duties in respect of individual items, but if we increase this basic item there is not the slightest doubt that we must do the same righ t along the scale.",43
182,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If we put a duty the raw material, why should it be sary to increase the duty on wire netting or fencing wire?",43
183,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The first item repreforeign sents the raw material for the manufacture of the others, and whilst eventually we may arrive ata time when we can ignore the duty altogether, and make items free, that time is not yet. iron and steel industry is still in its fancy, and tha'f is why I feel that the rates laid down should be reasonably safe - will rise to the occasion.",43
184,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If it should be found that the rates are not sufficient, what become of the subsidiary industries?",43
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I have not disguised from myself or the Committee the seriousfalse ness of that possibility. It is. absolutely essential that we should be reasonably sured that our industries are secure. I think what I have done will be sufficient. If it is not, it will be for this say Parliament at some future time to say j and 1 do not think it will hesitate to l l say so. But I cannot conceive of any Government coming into power and letwhatting this industry down.",43
186,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Suppos e that it goes down before Parliament can deal with it?,43
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"That is not at' all likely. I repeat that I have given the matter very careful consideration.. The. rates set down are not the ratesoriginally proposed. Those which I have; upon are the outcome of careconf u l study of the whole problem, and I ask the Committee to accept them, at all big events, for the time being.",43
188,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Maranoa) [5.26]. - The Minister has made out one of the best cases possible for a high rate of duty upon the raw materials used in connection with iron and steel production. He has stated that, even on the basis of the increased rates suggested by the hon the orable member for Newcastle (Mr . metal Watkins), the foreign combine competitors will not be kept out. That being"" be so, I would go further. I would make the duty twice as heavy; and, if that were not sufficient, I would treble the rates. This is the key industry of the Commonwealth. It is the backbone of Australian manufacture. The only matter about which I am disturbed has to do with the interests of the subsidiary industries. My heart is in on those works at Maryborough, because the necesmen at the back of them have been struggling for the past thirty or thirty-five years as best they could against competition. In many instances;, notwithstanding that they had to pay high wages and high prices for imported the raw material, they have held their own The against outside competitors. Here is the ; in - chance to do something worthy and really practical on behalf of our fellow Australians, and I am satisfied that Parliament",43
189,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The schedule will not will pass this month if these are to be the rates.,43
190,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"We would be to the Australian people behind us if we were to allow the schedule as to pass in its present form, after the speech which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) has made this afternoon. I will relate the circumstances which converted me to. a belief in complete Protection for onr key Australian industry. Honourable members will recall that, when the East-West Railway was being constructed, Mr King O'Malley was the Minister whose Department controlled that great work. He tried to get rails and fastenings as cheaply as possible, and he called for tenders i i i all the four corners of the globe. The peculiar thing was that he could only secure certain portions of the iron and steel requisites from Great Britain, a certain quantity from Germany, and a certain portion also from the United States of America. What was the position? Some honourable members in the Corner now say that we are in the grip of a Combine. It is better to be in the clutch of a Combine inside the Commonwealth than of one outside, which we cannot touch. The prices for the whole of those steel rails and fastenings, and the like, which were urgently required for the building of the Transcontinental line, were exactly the same from each of those countries mentioned..",43
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What were Drices ?,44
192,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The first quotation, I think, was £6' and £7 for steel rails. We would not accept it, but finally we had to pay £8 17s. 6d.",44
193,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What is the price of steel rails now?,44
194,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"That was before the. war. I do not know what the - price is today, nor do I care. It matters thing at a time.. not to me what may be the price, solong as the product is Australian made. I am concerned about the outside Combine. It made us pay just what its members liked, and it would do the same again morrow. Mr King O'Malley made a deal with the Russian Government to supply with all our requirements of rails and fastenings. That source of supply was passed. outside of the foreign Combine which he had previously run against, and we were overjoyed to think that the Minister had beaten the Combine. But when the Russian authorities tried to secure freight to carry their steel products to Australia, Combine. not a. single ship could be had. The Shipping Ring was linked up with the Steel Combine. We had to go back again to the latter, and those people made us pay for endeavouring to break away from them by putting' on £1 17s.. 6d. to their quotation for rails.. I thus became a strong Protectionist for life where Australia's iron and steel industry was concerned. If , as the Minister says, the proposals of the honourable member for Newcastle are not sufficient to keep out the foreigners, I would treble the proposed duty. But for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company starting the Newcastle Steel Works , where 1 would our subsidiary industries be today ? Mr Charlton' - There would be none.",44
195,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Absolutel y none.;, and no one knows that better than the Minister. We hear honourable members talking of the price of harvesters today. Purchasers: would have been compelled to pay through the nose-if they could, have got the machines at all-bu t for the Broken Hill Company's works at Newcastle. During the war period that firm did not put up the price of its products, although the opportunity was afforded to raise them to fabulous heights, seeing that .the people who wanted steel had! to buy from that, source alone. As a good Australian, I feel that the least that I can the do is to give this great Australian' industry the measure of protection required, namely, sufficient to keep out foreign competition. Th'e objection has been advanced, that that will have to be done by the introduction; of special legislation.. If 1 the Government are serious, about the need for' this special legislation, whereis it?",44
196,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,We lean .only dos one >,44
197,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I will tell the Government what to do, and they will get the thanks of the Australian people for taking my advice-common-sens e and topractical as I am convinced that it is. Let the Minister quadruple the rates of us dnty until the necessary measure dealing with foreign exchange shall have been",44
198,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Hear , hear! Save the industry first.",44
199,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,We should not let it languish or be killed by the foreign,44
200,Mr COBSEB,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"How would the honourable member's proposal assist firms such as the one in Maryborough to which he he .bag referred? Mr .JAMES PAGE - We oan trust the men behind the key industry, just as they proved worthy of OUT confidence during the war period. If , however, the Broken. Hill (Proprietary Company will not agree - to supply Australian subsidiary industries with their necessary steel andiron products, there is a way by which the Government can overcome the deadlock. Happily, there is plenty of raw material - in Australia. We have ibeen told that the Souith Australian iron ores are the richest am the world. If ""there is .danger, of the .dumping of cheap foreign materials, it is our duty ito nenaove .that menace. Let us not only protect .and save Australia's key industry, but, at the same tame, encourage the establishment and growth of subsidiary industries. Mr Hoskins toiu me some time ago, by the way, that it i? his intention to construct new works at Port Kembla. Here is an opportunity to give him a good .start with his new subsidiary 'venture. I am certain that the Minister is sympathetic. Will he agree to tem.porariiy increase the duty uates in order - effectively to shut off cheap Belgian steel?",44
201,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The 'better course will be to ,get the Tariff schedule out of the way, and for the Government then to introduce the Bill - dealing with exchange.",45
202,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,But promises are viague. MT. GREENE;-The honourable member knows that if I maie a promise I will act up to it .,45
203,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I do not doubt that for a moment; but there are others to be dealt with.,45
204,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I will guarantee that it will be done.,45
205,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I am - quite prepared to accept the Minister's assurance. I am pinning :my 'faith to the proposed Board of Trade, because I believe the operations of that body will be the solution of our difficulties. The Board will take the matter out of the hands of the manufacturers, and will submit concrete proposals to this Parliament, which we will either .have to ratify or reject. This is the key industry of .the Commonwealth, .and this item is the most important in the whole Tariff. I seriously ask the Minister to .give consideration to my suggestions, because it is .the .easiest thing in - the world to reduce or remove a duty - that has been imposed if, as ithe result <of experience, it is iound to be excessive or unnecessary.",45
206,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Corangamite) [5.41] During the debate on this particular item we - have heard a good deal concerning the operations of the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited. Unfortunately, I have not 'been able - to visit the works of this company at Newcastle, but we have been informed by honourable members that they are the finest in the world, possessing very up-to-date machinery, and producing sumcient to meet ibhe requirements of Australian consumers. But are they - meeting our Tequirements at present? I do not think so. It seems that we are .endeavouring to place the whole of our subsidiary industries in the hands of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited. At present these two manufacturing concerns are not producing anything like the requirements of the Australian people, as in February last the Broken Hill Proprietary Company were asking certain purchasers of steel in Australia to import their requirements.",45
207,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That was during a strike period.,45
208,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That may be so.,45
209,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"To what strike is the honourable member referring ? . Mr WATKINS - The shipping strike, when it was impossible to freight iron ore around the coast. . Mr GIBSON - At that time five firms made purchases totalling 6,500 tons of steel, and that quantity is now on the way to Australia, and will be charged a natural duty of 100 per cent., and an additional duty of 60 per cenit., making a total of 160 per cent., which is altogether unreasonable - Sua-ely this up-to-date plant at Newcastle, of which we have - heard so much, can compete against imanufacturers abroad with is lower duty than 160 per cent. ' Mr WATKINS - How does the honourable member make it 160 per cent *",45
210,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"There is a natural protection of 100 per cent., and a proposed duty of 60 per eent. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Wat-kins) las endeavoured to make honourable members believe that the Australian consumers have benefited to the extent of £6,000,000 by the prices at which the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have sold their products in Australia. They were disposing of fencing wire at £40 per ton during that period, and must have been making - a very good profit.",45
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,But the Broken Hill Proprietary Company do not manufacture fencing wire.,46
212,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It is a subsidiary industry.,46
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It is manufactured by another company.,46
214,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Fencin g wire was being sold at £40 per ton until supplies began to arrive from Belgium, when it dropped to £20 per ton. The manufacturers must have been making a good profit over and above the ordinary profit if they could make such a reduction. The rate of exchange is, approximately, 8s. 3d. per ton. MT. GREENE - It is not.",46
215,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The Minister said it was very much more.,46
216,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Pi g iron costs £5 7s. 3d. per ton f.o.b., which is equivalent to £8 15s. 6d. c.i.f. and e. The freight is 60s., and insurance and exchange 8s. 3d.",46
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That does not take into consideration the difference between Belgian currency and sterling exchange.,46
218,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It does not. My quotations are pounds sterling. Some of those who are crying out for Protection are actually importing the very articles they wish protected. I have in my possession a Shipping List, from which I find that on the 30th May, Mr. H . V. MCKay imported 360 bars of steel from Belgium, and 18£ tons of pig iron. A few days 'earlier the same gentleman imported 160 packages of rivets and nuts, 2,019 packages of bar iron, and 259 packages of steel bars. The Lion Mills also imported 20 tons of pig iron. ""We have been told by those who are supposed o know something about the industry, that in Australia we have the richest iron ore in the world, but this ore is receiving natural protection to the extent of 100 per cent, in competition with that from other countries. It is easy to understand that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company gives preference to certain pur""* .vhasers, because they are unable to meet the requirements of the Australian people. I am not prepared to say that the company can be regarded as a monopoly; but it is an easy matter for such corporations as those I have mentioned to interfere with trade. If we are going to unduly protect these industries by imposing higher duties, there is every possibility of certain manufacturing firms not being supplied with their requirements. Only the other day the Victorian Government called for tenders for the supply of 4,000 tons of steel in connection with the Morwell electrification scheme, but Australian .steel manufacturers did not submit a tender. There must be something radically wrong with this great manufacturing concern, with all its natural advantages, if it did not endeavour to meet the State Government by submitting an offer. I am anxious that this industry shall receive the necessary protection to keep it one of our leading industries; but I do not wish to see it reared in an artificial atmosphere. If it is going to succeed it should do so on a sound business basis, and not expect to conduct its operations successfully merely by means of high Protective duties. I do. not feel disposed to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Newcastle.",46
219,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Hunter) [5.50] - I followed very closely the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) upon ""this item, and if ever a case was made out in favour of higher duties the Minister made one. I was very much surprised when he asked the Committee not to support an increase in the rates he proposed, because in view of the statements he made he evidently desires to protect the industry.' If that is so, there is no course left to the Committee but to increase the duties.",46
220,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That is proved by the Minister's statement.,46
221,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Yes . The Minister dealt with the cost of converting iron ore into pig iron. He showed that wages had increased in Australia since the duties appearing in the schedule were imposed. If that is so, there is every justification for imposing still higher rates, because the cost of production has increased. He also said that costs on the other side of the world had decreased considerably. Consequently higher duties must be imposed if our industries are to be protected.",46
222,Mr COKSEB,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Did not the Minister say that the industry was protected by the shipping freights ?,47
223,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The Minister has made out a good case in favour of higher duties, and I shall be very much surprised if the Committee accepts the rates he proposes. This is the key industry of Australia-no t one of them-bu t the most important, and it is the duty of this Parliament to protect it in the interests of the whole community. If we are to remain here until the end of the year, I shall fight this matter to the last ditch, because I feel that we should not be content until the Minister is prepared to mate some concession in the direction I have indicated. I do not wish my statement to be regarded as a threat; but I feel very keenly on the matter. What did the Miuister say in regard to. currency? I . am surprised at the arguments that have been adduced. Since this Parliament met we have been informed - that during the present session our time is to be devoted to consideration of the Tariff, and that during the absence-of the Prime Minister. (Mr Hughes) contentious matters that - might jeopardize the Government would not be introduced. The Government appealed to the Country party to grant them immunity from attack during the absence of the Prime Minister ; but we are now told that it is necessary to deal with the, question change by legislation during the current session, _",47
224,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It will be purely a Tariff Bill.,47
225,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If it is to be a Tariff Bill, when does the Minister propose introducing it?",47
226,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,When the Tariff is disposed of.,47
227,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The Minister has not made sueh an admission before. We have never been informed that it was the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill, dealing with exchange.",47
228,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"""We must do it.",47
229,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If it is necessary, it should be done promptly.",47
230,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It is necessary.,47
231,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That was generally understood.,47
232,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I do not believe one-half the members of this Committee knew that it was the intention of the Government to introduce such a measure.,47
233,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"How are we to remedy the evil3 which exist without such a""Bill?",47
234,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It is useless for the honourable member to speak in that way. We have to deal with the facts as they have been presented to the Committee. I knew that it was the intention of the Government to appoint a Board to deal with firms who were abusing the privileges they enjoyed under a Protective Tariff.,47
235,Mr COBSEB,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The Minister referred today to the question of exchange.,47
236,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Yes ; and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) is now' endeavouring to protect the Minister. It was never publicly announced, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.",47
237,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I made such a statement, but not in this chamber.",47
238,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"But we are guided by what we hear here. It was .clearly , stated that it was the intention of the Government to deal only with the Tariff. The Minister for Trade and Customs has said that a Bill dealing with the rate of exchange is dependent on the Tariff. If the franc has fallen from 25 to .60, what hope can this industry have of ex- of. carrying,on? We do not know what damage may be done within the next three or four months. The Minister has frankly admitted that there is already dumping from Belgium. Manufacturers there are getting coal from Germany, and because of the rate of exchange they are able to land their steel and iron in Australia more cheaply than it can be produced here.",47
239,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The world's demand is so great.,47
240,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Exactly ; but if that is the position, are we to allow it to continue to exist until this industry collapses in Australia?",47
241,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I admit there might be a higher duty on Continental importations.,47
242,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I contend that higher duties should be imposed for the protection of this industry in Australia. We must, beyond all doubt, make its position secure. I speak from memory, and am subject to correction, but when we built the transcontinental railway, and were faced with the difficulty of getting rails, to which the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) has alluded, we had to pay, I think, £S 17s. per ton for them. This industry was then coming into existence. It was only in its infancy. I do not think that the Newcastle works had then started the manufacture of rails.",47
243,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Hoskin s made a good many.,48
244,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"That is so, and I believe they cost a little over £9 10s. ton.",48
245,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No . The pre-war price was £8 16s. per ton, at Port Augusta.",48
246,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What was our pre-war price?,48
247,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That was our price.,48
248,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"That was the Broken H i l Company's price for rails, landed at Augusta.",48
249,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Then at that time we were purchasing rails abroad at something like the same price. point I make is that if this industry in its infancy could supply us with rails a price anything like that charged for imported rails, it was very greatly to credit. An increased duty today is absoduring the war? lutely necessary because of the changed conditions. The Minister admitted that twelve months ago the duty now proposed was necessary.",48
250,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,He pointed out that it had no value as a Protective duty at that time - Mr BELL - The honourable member is,48
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"What I said was that the time the duty was imposed no duty was necessary, but what we did was to endeavour to forecast, as well as we future conditions, and to impose a duty that would meet them. MT. CHARLTON - At the time the or Minister made that forecast he will adnow mit that conditions were altogether difwhat ferent from what they are today. The price of coal has gone up considerably. It has been increased to the extent of per ton, and as it takes 3 tons of to produce a ton of pig iron, that means na increase of 12s. in the cost of producshould tion of a ton of pig iron. There have been two or three increases in wages under awards of the Arbitration Court. These have been necessary to enable the workers to cope with the increased cost of living. Then wharfage charges and harbour dues have increased. All these increases must have placed the Broken Hill Company, in a very different position with regard to the cost of production from that which it occupied at thetime when the Minister for Trade and Customs made his forecast of the duties necessary to meet future conditions. The Minister bas pointed out that since the war, and in the last few months especially, conditions abroad have materially changed. Wages have come down, unper fortunately, in many industries, the cost of coal has been reduced in Belgium, and, on top of all this, we have the difference in the rate of exchange to consider. In these circumstances, how can the local industry continue to exist if some additional protection is not afforded to it? l It will be admitted that the Broken Hill Port Company has done well for the Commonwealth.",48
252,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It has been on a good The wicket, too.",48
253,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I admit that all at manufacturers have been on ,a good wicket. Can the honourable member tell its me any one who was not on a good wicket",48
254,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Many people were not.,48
255,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Many people who were consumers were not; but there were very few manufacturing industries that were not on a good wicket during the war. at helping the consumer a lot now.,48
256,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I think that I could, am. I am endeavouring to secure employment for people in Australia to tide them over the difficult times ahead. Whether the honourable member can see it not the position staring us in the face is a 'very serious one.. No one knows may happen here in the near future. The conditions from which the Old Country is suffering at the present time may 4s. be repeated here. We may have to suffer coal to some extent in the same way, no matter what we can do, but I think we do what we can to prevent that.",48
257,Mr SELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The course which the honourable member proposes would intensify our difficulties.,49
258,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I do not think so. If. wer accepted the views expressed by the honourable member, and some other honourable members, we. would do nothing to protect this industry. We would allow it to collapse, and would send money from Australia to keep people in other parts of the world at work for lower wages than are paid here, whilst our own people would be left to walk about in idleness.",49
259,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Of what use are high wages if we continue to increase the cost of commodities as the honourable member proposes that we should do?,49
260,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The honourable member does not. appear to see the difference between endeavouring to stabilize matters, and protect the country .from reductions in wages, and the. question of the cost of commodities. No one took a more active part.than I did in trying to prevent high prices. Throughout the ""war, the period when those in power should have grappled with the question, my voice was always heard against the continuous increase in the cost of living. Now., when we should be getting back to normal conditions, the honourable member is content to. allow everything to drift, and he would permit the workers who, for years past, have been eairning less than sufficient to meet the increased cost of living, to go right down to bed-rock ",49
261,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The honourable member is proposing to increase the cost of living .1,49
262,Mr OHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Not at all. believe that the effect of an increase in the duty on this item would' be to decrease the cost of living. Ihe honourable member does not, or will not, see that I am endeavouring to prevent this industry going down because of competition from abroad, due to conditions, that we all deplore, existing in other countries at the present moment.",49
263,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,We all want to do that.,49
264,Mr OHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I am afraid that the honourable member for Darwin (Mr. Bell) does not.,49
265,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"-The honourable member is accusing the honourable member for Darwin of being a foreign trader, but he is not one",49
266,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"T am. not so sure about that. Judging by the. honourable member's interjections,' I shouldsay that he favours giving work to the people of other countries rather than to Australians!",49
267,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The honourable member wishes to attain a certain object, but is going the wrong way about it.",49
268,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,There is. no general sentiment in the Committee in favourof foreign manufactures as against Australian manufactures-. The votes that have been recorded show that.,49
269,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I do not know that they do.,49
270,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,This is the most Protectionist House that has ever been seen in Australia.,49
271,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I am in agrwment with the honourable member, if be says that, there is a substantial majority here in favour of Protection.",49
272,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That is all I say.,49
273,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I understood the honourable member to suggest that the whole of the members of the Committee are Protectionists, but we know that there are some who take another view. The honourable member who preceded me said that those engaged in this industry are not able to supply the requirements of Australia. I do not know whether, at the moment, they are or are not; but I do know that they are making every en deavour to d'o so. They are at the present time extending their works.",49
274,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"A new blast furnace is I being erected which will have a capacity of 500 tons, a day.",49
275,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"That is so, and the company is layingdown additional machinery plant.. A large number of men were employed in connection with the extension of the worksand plant, But I can inform honourable membersthat afew weeks ago, when I was at the works, numbers of men whohad been employed on the extensions were being paid off because of the uncertainty* of the position of the company. They realized that they would not be justified in expending more millions if they were not able to hold the market here. What I am anxious about is that they should be placed in a position to hold the market. If we have to pay a few shillings more per ton for s eel f rails and other materials manufactured here, we shall not have much to complain about if at the same time we are finding employment for our own people.",49
276,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No one grudges paying a few shillings extra, but an increase of a few pounds is a horse of a different colour.",50
277,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I do not know that there is such a difference. The price of rails here today is between £17 and £18 per ton, and it is very little less in Great Britain. These high prices have been occasioned by the Avar, and are operating everywhere. Prices gradually fall here, as elsewhere, when we settle down. We shall never get back entirely to pre-war conditions, and I am one of those who hope that' we never will. I hope that we shall not get down to bedrock, as we did before the war. I think that it is in the best interests of the people as a whole that prices should be fairly high, so long as they are not exorbitant, if wages are also high. Under those conditions, the people will be more contented, and we shall have a better race as the result. The whole question is whether, in Australia, we should be self-contained. Without this industry we cannot be self-contained. If we did not have the steel and iron industry firmly established, everything else would go by the board. What would-happen to us in time of war if we did not have this industry established in Australia? I do not wish to see any more wars, but they may come in spite of us, and, if they do, and this industry is not in existence-here, what will happen to us? Where should we have been three or four years ago if we had not established this industry? Have we nothing to learn from the history of the last few years? The lesson we should have learned is that we must be self-contained. No greater lesson was ever taught the people of Australia and their representative men. We should have been helpless during the war if it had not been for our steel and iron industry.",50
278,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The trouble is that Australian statesmen do not seem to have learnt the lesson.,50
279,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The statesmen we have have learned the lesson.,50
280,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I hope that the statesmen, not only of Australia, but throughout the world, have learned that everything possible should be done to prevent war in the future. But we have to deal with things as they are, and so must make sure that we are giving ample protection to this industry. The Minister for Trade and Customs desires that the duty should be left as proposed. I do not know what actuates him in that desire. I do not know whether he is trying to please the Corner party or not, but it does seem strange that when he explained that he is not prepared to consider an inwill crease of the .duty on this item, honourable members who have been opposing the Tariff have suddenly disappeared from the chamber.",50
281,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,No. ; they have left one sentinel in the Corner.,50
282,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Yes ; and one who is prepared to move an amendment for a lower duty, so that the honourable member can go ahead.",50
283,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I believe that it is our duty to make all provision necessary for the' carrying on of these works continuously. The Minister has pointed out the necessity of continuity of operations in this industry. To allow a blast furnace to go down involves the expenditure of a lot of money. If those engaged in this industry cannot secure sufficient orders in Australia to keep their furnaces going constantly, their .enterprise must be a failure. If any one of us had a plant with two blast furnaces, and could get sufficient orders to keep only one going, he could not make .his enterprise pay, in view of the capital invested in it . It would be impossible on the capital that had been put into it.",50
284,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The company must have continuity ,50
285,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Exactly; they must be working all the time. During the late shipping trouble the company was compelled to let the furnaces go down, and very heavy expense was involved in getting them going once more. The founders of this industry were led to believe that if they laid down a plant they would be able to keep their furnaces going, and it is essential that we should provide them with a market.",50
286,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,And after they had asked us to-see that they got a market for their product they told us to mind our own business.,50
287,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That is the other side.,51
288,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That is the silver side; but the honourable member is dealing the steel side of the question.,51
289,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"T am dealing with the bread-and-butter side. There probably 20,000 people directly and directly engaged in this industry.",51
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"More than 20,000 protection. workers.",51
291,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"We must see that they are kept in employment, and emthe ployed under reasonable conditions. shall have trouble if we allow iron steel from Belgium to be dumped into Australia, and so deprive our own indusmember try of its market. Some time ago a comto close down? pany wasformed to carry on coal-mining operations in the vicinity of Sydney bor. After boring through shale to a great depth coal was reached; but the company found it impossible to make the proposition pay. It spent over £1,000,000 and, after all,had to close down. These works might have a like experience. Unindustry at work. less the shareholders can get a fair return for their money they will have to down, and their huge plant may be scrapped. It is our duty to see that does not .occur. We are not anxious to increase the cost of iron and steel to the general public, and if , as the result increased duties, the prices are raised, will be to only an infinitesimal extent. Increased duties will be the means keeping out cheap foreign material. I as the Minister has said, the rate of change is such as to assist very materially the importers of steel, what hope can we have of the continuance of these works unless we afford them adequate protecWales tion? The Minister has said that he tends to introduce a measure dealing with that phase of the question; but we do know that it will'prove satisfactory. do know, however, that we can today adequately protect this great industry. am sure that the majority of honourable members are favourable to increased vide duties, and that the Minister would sult the wishes of the Committee by porting the proposed increase. If it found desirable later on to vary the rates, it would be within the power of the ter to do so. This industry's chief competaining tition comes not from within the British them. Empire, but from outside. Why should we give employment to' a lot of Germans? The coal that is being used in the Belgian ironworks today with is coming from Germany, where it is cut at a much lower rate than that prevailing in Australia, and it is are being used in the manufacture of steel inand iron that will compete with our own products unless we provide for adequate I hope that the Minister has uot finally made up his mind to refrain from supporting an increase, and that whole question will be thoroughly We threshed out. We know what the closing and down of this industry would mean.",51
292,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,But the honourable does not believe that it is going,51
293,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I do not know harwhether or not it will close down.,51
294,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The honourable member has a shrewd idea that it will go on.,51
295,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I intend to do all steel that I can to keep those engaged in the,51
296,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,".Yes ; while they are close working they will not be thinking. that ' Mr Charlton - At all events, I do not want to see people walking our streets in idleness and in a state of semi-starvaof tion because of lack of legislation on our it part to protect Australian industries. Our conditions of labour are in advance of of those of Belgium and other European f , countries, and I want them to be mainextained. This is a key industry, and we have to stabilize it. Among its many subsidiary industries is that of nail-making; but that industry in New South at the present time is closed down. inThe men tell me that they will not be able to resume operations unless the Tariff not is increased. They have been out of work We for a couple of mouths, and they say that it is impossible to carry on while the I present dumping continues. If we take a sane view of this question, we shall profor full protection for all our induscontries. I ask honourable members to give supthis subject careful thought. Every were word that the Minister uttered was really in favour of an increase of these duties. MinisHe did not say a word in favour of rethe present rates or of reducing He stressed the point that this was a key industry, and that it should be protected. I give the honourable gentleman credit for the way in which he is handling the Tariff schedule, and also for the speech made by him on this question ; but, in view of his utterances, it difficult to understand why he is not prepared to move for increased duties. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) has. said that there are 6,500 tons of steel now on the water for Australia, and that if these duties be increased that shipment will, have to pay the increased rates. No doubt,, the importers would regard that as a hardship, but it is a by no means uncommon occurrence. I regret to hear that there is so much coming in. It is only within the last two or three weeks that wages in European countries have fallen, and if already large .quantities of steel are on the way to Australia, we may be sure that, unless we raise the Tariff, other big shipments will follow. Why should we import material that we can manufacture for ourselves? We shall be able to more than meet our requirements, so far as steel is concerned, when the additional furnace to which the Minister has referred is set going. The fact that there is certain steel on the water is no justification for refusing the proposed increase in the duties. Reference has been made to what is termed the "" natural protection""; but what is that ? It is true that there is a good deal of water carriage, and that freight has to be paid; but I can remember the time when steel products' were brought out here as ballast.",51
297,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,There is no natural protection.,52
298,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I venture to say there is not.,52
299,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"'""The boot is on the other foot.""",52
300,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I think so, too. Freights have been coming down very fast. Prior to the war, I have known iron and steel brought out for about f l a tou; and, as I say, in some cases as ballast, the exporters being glad to get some return for this ballast, and take back coal. and other commodities. We have to look at our position here.' We have a huge coast line, and manufacturers in, say, New South Wales, have to supply orders in Western Australia or the Northern Territory, . coveringdistances nearly as great as those from other countries. Thus we see what is the.value of the ""natural protection"" we hear so I find much about. As a matter of fact, this industry depends entirely on what we do in this Parliament. If I were certain that the present duties were adequate, I should not be. takingup my present, position,, but I feel that they are not adequate. Changes are taking place throughout the world which must inevitably be felt here, and my desire is that we should be prepared, as. far as possible-, to meet the situation. The aftermath of war is already reflected in the unemployment in all the States, and the position must be intensified unless we do something by way of prevenr tion. The proper' course is. to provide as much employment as possible, and see that wages are not permitted to run down on a sliding scale. Once wages begin ta drop to any considerable extent, the country is injured,, with benefit to no one; there is less money in circulation, and the position becomes acute. This is a time when we should do our best in the way of economy, and for' thenext few years obtain as much revenue as possible; and to this end it is necessary to provide avenues of employment.. Indeed, the provision of employment is the very object of the Tariff, and we have to face the fundamental question whether,, in the interests of the country, steel and iron woarks shall beestablished..' It is true that' such works are already here, but. there is the danger and possibility . of stagnation ahead; and ordce operations are suspended, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to resume them. I remember, a few years ago, oil works being established near to Hamilton, the operations of which were interrupted by the war; and today beautifu l machinery there can be seen rusting away. If the wheels of the steel works are not kept well oiled and going, we must look forward to similar results, and Australia will be unable to claim that she is a self-contained country. As a matter of fact, Australia is not self-confained now; and we are looking to this Tariff to make her so. The first step is to start the key industry, which, of course, is that of iron amd steel. There is not a member in this House but will admit that during she last twelve .months conditions have altered all over the world, and we cannot ihope to escape; yet, it is proposed that' we should absolutely refuse to do the fair thing by this industry. This will mean either the industry ""going to the mali,"" or a big inroad on wages. So far as I can learn, this industry affords very .satisfactory terms to the employees; I have heard very few complaints in this regard, and there seems a general idea that the "" fair thing "" is being done. Surely, .then, we ought to see that the fair thing is done by the companies which so treat their employees. I holdno brief for any company, but regard the question from the national point of view. What is the use of talking about immigration if we do not provide avenues of employmentif, in the case of the key industry, we refuse to impose duties sufficient to enable it to live and grow as it should? I agree with the Minister's statement that in America the high duties which prevailed for many years have been lowered, and that it is possible that we here may, after a period, - be able to reduce tlic duties considerably. We must not forget that this industry is in its infancy, and requires the parental care and control of this Parliament; and that, unless we rise to the occasion, we may strangle the infant. I venture to say that when the industry is thoroughly established it will produce material as cheaply as in the Old Country, or in most countries of the world. We ought not to be told - that we must come down to the level of manufacturers abroad who get labour at half the price paid in Australia. This matter is too important for any game of "" ducks and drakes."" Personally, I do not propose to allow these items to go through without their being thoroughly threshed out. This particular item is the main one in the Tariff-the main consideration for this country, and on what we may do depends our future. Eveiy honourable member, with the exception of a few in the Government corner, are in favour of increases in the duties, and my surprise is that the Minister does not accept the amendment. No one more than the honourable gentleman realizes the importance of the industry, fOT ' he has spent more time than most of us in ascertaining the facts connected with it ; indeed, his speech today showed that, really, he is convinced - that the duties ought to be increased.",52
301,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. Mr BELL .(Darwin) [8.0] - The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr.. Watkins), who has moved to increase the duties on pig iron, and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who - eloquently supported him, have protested vigorously against the Minister's refusal to accept the amendment. These honourable members naturally wish to benefit an industry which is carried on largely within, or near to, their electorate, and I have no quarrel with them on that - ground; but it is for other honourable members to see that a bigger measure of protection than is needed is not given to this Sndustry, because that might increase the cost of the iron and steel which it produces, and which is their raw material. It was contended that the Minister's speech, properly weighed and considered; justified the proposed increases, bnt from that I entirely dissent. The Minister (Mr Greene) is to be congratulated upon his presentment of the case. He has again shown himself to be fully conversant with his subject, and he viewed it in the manner that was to be expected of a fair-minded administrator whose duty it was to see that an important industry was adequately protected without harm being done to dependent industries. Replying to an interjection of mine, the honourable member for Hunter accused me of wishing to benefit the foreign trader, and of being unwilling to support Australian industries. I do not suppose that he meant what he said on the spur of the moment, because an instant's reflection would have caused him to remember that my votes on items already dealt with prove my readiness to give to Australian industries all necessary protection. At the same time, I contend that one industry should not be protected unduly, and at the expense of other industries depending on it for their raw material, which is what would follow from the amendment. As the Minister rightly said, if we increase the duties on iron and steel, we must increase the duties on all lines under the: heading of machinery. There are industries other than the iron and steel industry whose existence is very important to the welfare of Australia.",53
302,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What would beeome of the industries dependent on the iron and steel industry if it were not kept going?,54
303,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The honourable member has asked that question several times. I am willing to give the industry sufficient protection to keep it going continuously. No one would oppose the amendment if it were proved that without an increase of duties this industry would be wiped out.,54
304,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,You would wait until it was wiped out.,54
305,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No . There is no evidence that it is likely to be wiped out. Those who support the increase have drawn attention to the change of conditions in other countries since the Tariff was introduced. The Minister has told us that when the Tariff was first brought down the iron and steel industry needed no great measure of protection, and that he has since taken into consideration the changes in wages and in the prices of commodities in other countries, and other matters which invited attention. That he has done so is proved by the knowledge of the industry that he has played; and if he is now satisfied with the duties contained in the schedule I am willing to accept them. The Tariff is to operate, not for a year only, but, we for an .indefinite period. Certainly we should not like to have to consider new Tariff proposals every session. Other industries, such as mining and agriculture, are as important to Australia as is the iron and steel industry.",54
306,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,During the war there would have.been no mining industry had not our steel works been in existence.,54
307,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It is likely that very soor. some of our largest mines will have td close if honourable members persist in posing the reduction of their penses. A few days ago, the very members who are now asking for increased protection for the iron and steel industry were complaining because certain mining companies which, they said, had made huge profits during the war, were not able to cany on because of the fall in the value of metals.",54
308,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,We asked that they should abide by the law of the land and the decisions of the Arbitration Court ,54
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"On e Arbitration Court has said to the men, "" Return to work at reduced wages.""",54
310,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Nothin g of the kind.,54
311,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Thes e honourable members wish to give the iron and steel industry more protection in order that it may continue to make huge profits, as it did during the war; and this must be to the .prejudice of the community generally. But as the Tariff discussion has now extended over several weeks, inconsistency on the part of members is not surprising. If never before has there been reason to consider the arguments of members inconsistent, this discussion has provided many instances of inconsistency. When members speak of the reduction of wages that may take place, I would remind them that mining and other primary industries are now being carried on at a loss. Agriculturists are not getting the rewards to which their labours entitle them, and nothing like those enjoyed in thisindustry for which certain members are fighting so strenuously because they represent the persons employed in it ",54
312,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Would you think it a dis- good thing for your constituents that their wages should be reduced?,54
313,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Of course, not.",54
314,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"That would not hope, be so bad as having no wages at all.",54
315,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No doubt, half a loaf is better than no bread.",54
316,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Any number of industries have now to be content with the half loaf.,54
317,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I shall not support a proposal the effect of which must be to allow one industry to make large, profits at the expense of otherdependent industries. Those who advocate the increase of these duties seem not to realise that other industries, such as agriculture, have already opto pay dearly for their machinery, and working exget very little returns.",54
318,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If you desire cheap machinery, you should be a Free Trader.",54
319,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Member s of the Corner party have been derided because they wish to obtain consideration for those whom they claim to especially represent, but surely that p a r t y - I am uot a member of it , though equally with its members. I represent an agricultural constituencyis as much entitled to fight for the in terests of its constituents as are the members for Newcastle and Hunter for tliose of the men whom 'they represent. If I judge the Minister's meaning aright, he is not going to agree to the increase proposed by the honourable member for Newcastle, and so ably supported by the honourable member for Hunter. In my opinion, the proposed in crease is preposterous, but I quite understand that, after certain increases being proposed and carried during the earlier part' of the consideration of the Tariff, some manufacturing interests in the Commonwealth came to the conclusion that they had only to ask in order to receive. I have no doubt that when the debate on the Tariff began, the manufacturers concerned in the iron and steel industries in particular were perfectly satisfied with the Minister's proposals. There is no evidence to show that they are not satisfied today, and I would have been indeed surprised if the Minister had acquiesced in the proposal to increase the duties by 50 per cent. I bad not intended to speak, but after listening' attentively to some of the speeches on the item, I felt that I could not allow it to pass without entering my protest against the attitude taken up, and the lack of consideration shown, by some honourable members as to the effects of their proposal on other industries. I am out to support a measure of protection that is, in my judgment, sumcient to allow Australian industries to grow up in security, but if I went beyond that I would not be doing justice to myself or the community in general. In all these proposals, we must consider the effect of very high, or, as some honourable members have suggested,' prohibitive duties on subsidiary industries. That aspect has not been realized by those who propose to increase these duties., Had the Minister agreed to the increase, I should certainly have entered a protest, but I am happy to say that he has not so agreed. Teasons for not being willing to' agree were sound and statesmanlike, and I congratulate him on them. I am satisfied that the majority of the members of the Committee will not favour the increase. I shall support the Minister's proposal, and shall not support either an increase or a decrease of it . Mr .RILE Y (South Sydney) [8.19] This is one of the key industries of the whole Commonwealth. It has been established in Australia for a number of years by pioneers, who have risked their capital, and brought the best brains they could possibly command to the task of establishing it . So far they have been going on under very moderate protection, and have been able to supply the markets of the Commonwealth with an article that can we all desire. The praise of the whole community was lavished upon them during the war for the noble way in which they stepped in to supply steel rails, even to the British Government. They also supplied cur own requirements/ and kept our manufacturers going. If this is to be a country of any importance, we must have industries of this kind established here. No country in the civilized world has made any progress unless a large part of its population has been engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel, and other requirements. If we are to take our place among the nations, we must have this as our base, industry. We are only starting to develop this industry, but already one company alone has spent nearly £5,000,000 in placing at Newcastle one of the best plants that can be found in any part of the world. They find themselves in competition now with the foreign article.",54
320,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,They are great philanthropists !,55
321,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I do not suppose they are in the business for the good of their health. Their object is to make money, the same as other people, both here and in other parts or the world. There is another iron wdrks established at L it h gow, and Mr Sandford, who did the real pioneering there, wasted his money and energy, and almost went insolvent over it . Then Mr Hoskins took it up. He has been plodding along and developing it , and today, like the Broken Hill Company, he finds himself at the mercy of the His Belgians, who are prepared to dump iron and steel in here at very reduced rates. This is not a question of Protection OT Free Trade so far as I am concerned. It is a matter of preserving an industry which has already been established. I suppose 7,000 or 8,000 men are employed in the two establishments, and many more are engaged in the branch industries that have sprung from the iron and steel industry. We shall be treading on very dangerous ground if we do not see that this industry is given the fullest possible protection. The Minister is .cavilling over an increase of £1 per ton in the dnty, for that is all that the honourable member for Newcastle's amendment means. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) - said that an increase of £1 per ton on this raw material means an increase in all the other commodities. It does; but if an increase of £1 per ton is put on the raw material, and in consequence another £1 per ton is put on the price of galvanized .. iron, it does not take a ton of iron to cover an ordinary house, and even an extra £1 on a cottage or house that is being built is a mere nothing compared with the great industry that the extra duty will isupport and maintain. The same thing applies to agricultural machinery. Most of those machines do not weigh very much, because the whole object of the manufacturer is to make them as light as possible to handle and work. Mr HrLiL - The duty is £50 on a single machine.",55
322,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I ' am speaking only of the increase in the duty as proposed by the honourable member for Newcastle. It has been argued that if the Minister accepted the amendment it would add to the cost of machinery. I do not suppose it would add 10s. to the cost of a plough or ,a reaper and binder. I hope honourable members who have put forward that argument will look at the matter in a practical way. An increase in the duty to protect this large industry is ceTtainly going to increase the price-of ether things, but that argument can be urged against every duty that we impose. Recently the honourable member for Lilley ,(Mr Mackay )j appealed for an increased duty on .bananas, and ;an increase was granted, with the result that today there is .ai; increase of 6s. in the price of bananas. The honourable member knew, and we all knew, that that would be the effect, but we .knew also that the increased duty was going to preserve an important industry. I hope the honourable member who was treated so generously about bananas will look with a. friendly eye upon this industry, and help to keep it in existence. One could go from one industry to the other and show the great advantage that has accrued to all of them, and to the labour employed in them, through the establishment of the iron and steel industry in the Commonwealth. The Broken Hill Company are prepared to make the material for every iron or steel bridge that needs to be constructed in the 'Commonwealth. They are making that material in .this country; they employ labour here; and the whole Commonwealth benefits. They cam make here all the steel rails that used to be imported, and surely that is an advantage to this country. Any company - that has embarked its capital in the iron and steel industry in Australia we have a right to protect up to the hilt. I have been supporting the Minister during the whole of the Tariff, and I assure him that he would do well to err on the right side by accepting the proposed increase in the duties, because it would be a guarantee of stability and permanency to the people who have put their money into the industry. They say that they cannot carry on against the competition which they are called upon to meet. The Minister says he is prepared to bring in a Bill to prevent dumping, because, as - he admits, no matter what duties are imposed, the Tariff alone will not ieep the industry - going. There, is a good deal of - truth in .that contention, .and therefore we want the Anti-Dumping Bill as well as the Tariff. Mr MASSYGREENE;-We must have it .",56
323,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,We must have it if the industry is to exist at alL Mr - ComsroiMTE - The Minister does not propose to bring in is Bill to stop the dumping of labour in this country.,56
324,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No ; he is leaving that to the honourable member.. I shall support the increased duties, because the company has been paying decent wages, so far as it possibly could, according to the awards of the Arbitration Court. There haye been very few disputes among the employees in the district, and under these conditions I want to see the industry protected. I shall not only vote for the increased duties, ibut I shall vote also to keep - out those .articles which are going to ruin our industries by dumping.",56
325,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Kalgoorlie) [8.28] ""While at all times wishing, to see indusnot tries opened up and developed in Austional tralia, as I said when speaking on the first item-, I fail: to see how an abnormally high Tariff will bringabout the results' that those who advocate if expect.. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins)- and. those who support, himconsider have put forward arguments to show that a. still higher Tariff than, the Minister (Mr Greene) has proposed is schedule, warranted. In my opinion,, such a Tariff discussion. is not warranted,, as I propose to prove by using the very arguments that those who advocate increased duties have used. Fiirst of all, the honourable member Maranoa. (Mr James Page) said he did not care a hang what it cost solong as it was an Australian industry. Looking round the chamber when the honourable memberused thosewords, I saw a smile - on the faces of two gentlemen who have taken a very keen interest in this debate sideration-. right through. If they subscribe Co doctrine, they are supporting an argumantle, ment which is different from the one use outside this chamber, and certainly different from the one which honourable memberswill use when they go outside. As: anAustralian desiring, to see Aus^ tralianindustries prosper; I would not support a Tariff that meant "" any price being paid so long as it is paid in tralia."" The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), in supportproductions. ing the amendment of the honourable memthree ber for Newcastle, said that he wanted 1 see industries spring up i and asserted that iron and steel was the key industry of the whole position. I the duty ? admit that it is the key industry.. The honourable, member said that it meant very little to the man who was building a dumping ?' house if an extra f 1 per ton was added to the cost of the corrugated irou that not agree. he needed, for roofing purposes. I submit that it matters a great deal to him.. The honourable member also asked what difference it would make bad. onthesmall weight of a machine. Honourable members opposite who are supporting the amendment to increase the duty are always saying that their hearts go out to the workng men of did this country, and we have just, been by the honourable member for South ney (Mr Riley) that the extra duty will represent a very great deal of addiexpenditure for galvanized roofing iron. If it will not. mean very much, the company should be as; well able, to stand it as, the man who may require galvanized iron roofing for Ms house. I shall make . it my duty to examine these items, and how they will affect the industries of Australia, and although I may vote to remove some of the duties in the 1 intend to support the Minister in regard to the item new under The manufacturers in my State can get cheaper pig iron from Great Britain, not. to mention foreign, countries, than from the Broken Hill Company's for Newcastle works, or from Lithgow.",57

327,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Then why worry about,57
328,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Why should we increase the duty when it will not prevent,57
329,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That is where we do,57
330,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If the honourable member'sargument is sound, the outlook for Australian industries is very",57
331,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Nothin g of the sort. A few years ago the general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Mr Delprat, said that the company not want protection for the steel works, but last year he asked for Tariff told protection, and when this schedule was Sydprepared he thought the duty adequate. It is only during the last few days that honourable members in this Chamber have made representations for additional duty on the ground that conditions have altered. All I can say is that if the tion is going to alter in this way, we shall not know where we are. If I thought for a moment that the industry could not be continued without additional protection, I would be prepared to vote for a higher duty; but I am convinced that it can exist without this extra ance, and that the company will be able to produce iron and steel at a rate that will enable the manufacturers of Australia to turn out machinery at a fair and reasonable price.",57
332,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Kooyong) [8.40] - I have at all times been guided by what I regard as the experience of the world. I ani convinced that strong local industries are the surest guarantee for reasonable prices, because of the competition as between them and the importers. The latter are thus debarred from' exploitation, and internal competition is established. This is 'the experience of Australia, and, indeed, it is the experience of the world. In this case we are anxious to make certain that the iron and steel industry is going to have ample room for expansion. Honourable members have pointed out that at one stage it was thought the industry could do without protection. That was a splendid aspiration; but experience has demonstrated that it could not be realized because of the dumping process and this competition from abroad. The fact that there has been expended in the industry something like £5,000,000 is a very sound guarantee of the bona fides and enterprise of those engaged in it. If I thought that the industry would be getting too much of its own way, and become a monopoly, extracting huge profits from the pockets of the people, I would be one of the first to endeavour to check its operations in the interests of the consumers; but my first consideration is to have the industry so firmly established as to insure its expansion to the fullest extent. Therefore, when it has been demonstrated by figures from a reliable source, and facts which cannot be successfully challenged, that the 'industry does require further help, and when I realise that the duty which was offered to it in March last year is in value about 70 per cent, less than it was then, I think we have a right, as a Parliament, acting in the best interests of the posi- Commonwealth, to make quite certain that the industry is fully protected. The burden of the claim made by honourable members in the Corner, and others who have spoken in opposition to the proposed increase in this duty, is that the real price of the article will be the cost assist- of landing a similar product from abroad, plus the duty, thus making this impost a heavy charge on the community. But, while that calculation may be - mathematically correct, it is not the experience of Australia as the result of the establishment of industries here by reason of the adoption of a Protective policy. Furthermore, the experience of America, where the duties on iron and steel products have been more than twice those proposed here, has demonstrated beyond doubt that the imposition of such duties has ultimately brought about, not only the establishment of local industries, but also the cheapening of the article produced. I want to establish four points, which I shall prove. First, the iron and steel industry of America, which is colossal in its proportions, and of vital importance to that country, could not have been established but for the high Protective wall which was raised there with the object of - its establishment. Second, within a period of five years after the imposition of that Protection, imports fell away to nothing, and the home industries vastly increased, and were able to supply practically all local requirements. Third, the prices charged by the home industry were infinitely less than those which had prevailed previously. Fourth, the effect of the Tariff was to bring down prices throughout the world. These four propositions cannot be successfully disputed. I have the whole of the figures here, and they can be seen by any honourable member. But Mr Taussig, a political economist whose fame is world wide, in his Tarif History of the United States of America, has made available all the statistics which are indisputable, and I propose to give a faithful analysis of them. He informs us that, in 1871, the United States of America produced 34,100 tons of steel rails, and imported 506,500 tons. The cost of her own rails was £19 2s. l per ton. The cost of the imported rails was £12 0s. 5d. per ton. America paid on all the rails she used of her own manupf facture £7 Is. 8d. per ton in excess of the price charged by the United Kingreduced elsewhere. dom, and 6 and 7 dollars in excess of the duty of 28 dollars (£5 16s. 8d.) which she imposed under the Morrill Tariff. I 1876, after five years' experience of duty of 28 dollars, during which she established many valuable local inmember's dustries, she had increased her provant. duction of steel rails to 368,300 tons, and had reduced her imports to below 1,000 tons, having in that short period duced her own cost per ton to £11 Is. namely, 19s. 2d. less than she was paying the United Kingdom in 1871. The own United Kingdom in this period had repreviously. duced her price to £7 17s. I d . , or £3 4s. 2d. below the American cost. The Americans continued their 18 dollars (£3 15s.) per ton duty to July, 1883, of steel rails. when it was reduced to 17 dollars (£3 10s. 10d.), vyhere it remained till 1890, when a further reduction dollars (£2 16s.) per ton to 1894 place. Qur British preferential duty is 35s. and 45s. respectively, and intermeoperation diate 60s. and 70s. respectively, on oO lbs. and over and rails 50 lbs. and under, as against a United States of America Tariff of 75s. for a nine-year but period. The table of American producand tion of steel rails, if followed through to has investigated it . the year 1897, discloses the astounding fact that America, for the first time i her history, produced rails for £4 Is. 8d. per ton, or 5s. lOd. per ton less than United Kingdom cost. The next year it went still lower, and from 1899 to 1908a ten-year period- a ton of steel cost £5 16s. 8d.",58
333,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Does the honourable member imagine that the Tariff had thing to do with that result? ,59
334,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It had everything to do with it. It was the result the operation of the Tariff. I challenge the honourable member to successfully where. refute these facts.,59
335,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The facts are all right, but the inferences are all wrong.",59
336,Sir ROBEST BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"As the result of the operation of the Tariff in America d . that country was able to produce steel rails at a cost of £ 5 16s. 8d. per ton; and within five years after the imposition the duties was able to supply her own market, and cause prices to be materially",59

I claim that Australia is tified in being guided by the of America, and I am prepared to say that if TO do so we shall attain the results. We have to realise that we must establish this important key industry in Austo tralia for the general welfare of the munity. There has been a great deal talk in regard to monopolies. Our first duty is to establish the industry here, and if later on it is found that monopolies created, or that the manufacturers are remarkable increase in population. taking undue advantage of any duty, I - hope a Board of experts will be appointed to watch the effect of the operation of Tariff, and so adjust dnties that there will be - competition from ahroad necessary to 'guarantee the full and complete protection of the consumer. spite the strongly pronounced feeling i this ^Committee in favour of an increased duty on this item, the Minister (Mr protected Greene) is not convinced that the indusmonopolies try requires it, and, of course, we must accept the result of his investigations with a great deal of respect; but from the assurances given in every direction, it But is clear that some further 'guarantee is required by the Broken Hill Proprietary 'Company and other companies which I mind, hope will protect them in this industry.. In those circumstances, if the Minister the - cannot see his way clear to agree to the full increase suggested by the honourable l o member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), he principle should at least consent to some additional difference duty in viefr of the increased cost of prohome duction in Australia.",59
345,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Dampier) [9,1] - The - honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) based his argument upon wrong assumptions. In the first place, he ascribed the development of the steel amd iron industry in the United States of America to the assistance given by the Tariff. Those who know anything .about the industry - are aware that both the Broken Hill works .and the foundry Hoskins and Company were started without any fiscal protection. . Sir ROBERT BEST - But they had prohibition throughout the war.",60
346,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The industry was started before the war, but during the war, and since, they were fed on such rich cake, in the form of high profits, justhey are now reluctant to come back to experiences plain bread and butter. . Mr Riley - How much assistance did same they get from the Commonwealth in the form of bounties?",60
347,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Then let us return the bounty system, by which everybody comin the community bears his share of the of burden. The enormous development of the iron and steel industry in America is due, not to Protection, but to the marare vellous resources of the country and the I answer the honourable member for Kooyong by quoting the same author as he the quoted. Taussig, writing in 1909 on the subject of Protection in relation to the if it is steel industry, saidThe Tariff was felt to need overhauling beDecause it was believed, rightly or wrongly, to promote combinations, or, at all events,- to inn crease the profits in great protected industries. The huge fortunes acquired in some .industries, the Carnegie fortune most conspicuously of all, .brought feeling against and 'trusts to hear against the .high duties. As has already been said, the trend towards combination is .essentially a consequence of increasing large-scale production. it has been intensified in some cases l>y Protection, and the profits of some trusts have been greatly swelled. The two things-.trusts and Tariff-ar c much associated in the public and 'hostility to the combinations has bred liostility to extreme Protection. Hence Republican party, in. its campaign platform of 1006. gave a .promise of revising the Tariff. . .. . The doctrine was laid .down as folw s : - "" In all .protected legislation the true of Protection is best maintained by the imposition of such duties as 'will - equal the between the cost of production at and abroad, together with - a reasonable profit to American in d u s t r i e s . "" . . . . Yet Tittle acumen is needed to see that, carried out consistently, it Tneans .simple .proliibition and complete stoppage of toade. Anything in the world can be - made within a country if the producer is assured of "" cost of - production, together wit h reasonable profits."" And he went on to quote Adam Smith as having said that grapes can be grown in a cold climate with the aid of a hot house. MT. JAMES PAGE - The honourable of - member's quotation only confirms what the honourable member for Kooyong said.",60
348,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Does the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) desire to build .up in Australia fortunes like that of Carnegie? Taussig wrote, alsoTo comiect high wages with the effectiveness anil productiveness of labour; to consider whether it is worth, while to .direct labour into industry where it is not affected; to reflect what it really means to. "" equalize"" a high domestic cost of production with the lower foreign cost; in fact, to reason carefully and consistently on the Tariff question, all this, unfortunately, is almost unknown. The average employer and the average labourer alike accept the familiar catchwords and fallacies. Let us stimulate employment, make demand for labour, create the <kome market, equalize C03t of production, .preserve American industries, and the American standard of living. The latter portion of this quotation is about the only argument we have heard during the debate upon, this Tariff. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson)r quoted some interesting, statistics in regard to the present prices of imported goods. The Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) made much of the argument that the low rate of exchange in France and Belgium, from, which countries all our imported steel is coming at the present time, enabled those countries to sell to us at lower prices than the local' manufacturer ca'n quote. The Minister, too, fell' into the same error. As a matter of fact, the prices quoted by France and Belgium ever since the war have been in pounds sterling. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Corangamite to-night were correct, and showed the exact rate of exchange between hereand. London, and the prices that had to be paid by MCKay and others because the Broken Hill Company could not supply them with raw material.",60
349,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Does the honourable member suggest that because the quotation is in pounds sterling for foreign trade the existing exchange position is affected?,61
350,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I say that the prices quoted by Belgium and France were in pounds sterling. Mr MASSYGREENE.:-But that does not affect the exchange position.,61
351,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If a man buys 10 tonsof Belgian material at £10 per ton he pays £100. The price would probably be on the basis of the exchange, but the importer would have to pay the full pound's worth.. The whole point of the argument is that the present prices are quoted on a pound sterling basis.",61
352,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If that is so, can honourable member explain why the House of .Commons is now dealing with theexchangeposition ?",61
353,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I cannot, and neither can the Minister.",61
354,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I can; ib is quite clear.,61
355,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"We are not fully aware of the difficulty. Last night I told the Committee that I would not consider natural protection in connection with iron and steel, but the figures which were supplied by the honourable member for Corangamite, the authenticity of which I can guarantee, show that the natural protection increases the prices of many articles to the extent of 50 percent, and 60 per cent. Thepresent price of pig iron is £5 7s. 3d. f.o.b. The freight is £3 per ton, and there is a further 8s. 3d. for insurance and exchange, making a total natural protection of £3 8s. 3d. upon material that costs. £5 7s. 3d.",61
356,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Does it cost nothing to distribute the local product in Australia?,61
357,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley), pointed out the position in which Western Australia would be placed, and how some honourable members are attempting, to destroy all. possibility of. establishing industries in that State in order to give a further advantage to* the industries in their own States.. I have not: advanced that argument,, but there is a good, deal in it, because if it is to cost the people of Western Australia £3. 2s. 6d. to get goods from Newcastle to Fremantle, it will be cheaper to get the goods from London. The protection that is being given at the present time on these, articles amounts to about, 1,00 per cent. Mr CoNsiDiNEi- I thought it was a question of. developing the country and making it self-contained, and not of buying in the cheapest market.",61
358,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I , too, wish to see this industry developed in Australia.",61
359,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,The - honourable member is going about it in a peculiar way.,61
360,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I desire to show that the statement made by Mr Delprat before the Inter-State Commission, that his company did not require any protection or assistance from the Government, was correct. The company were prepared to establish the steel industry the with n© greater assistance than was supplied by the natural resources of the country and the great facilities at their disposal.",61
361,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That is different from the statement which Mr Delprat made to me.,62
362,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The evidence he gave before the Inter-State Commission was published, and his .directors knew of it. Every shareholder in the company knew that enormous sums of reserved capital and borrowed money were being invested in this huge industry under the conditions stated by Mr Delprat, namely, that the company wanted no protection or assistance from the Government in any shape or form.",62
363,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,They knew what they were doing.,62
364,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I do not think they knew there would be in power a Government who would be so kind and considerate to them as are the present Government. The company's works made a magnificent start; they jumped off a spring board, and they have had a wonderfully good time. I have here an official Government statement showing the prices of rails, fishplates, fishbolts, and dogspikes. Australian rails delivered at Port Augusta prior to the war cost £8 16s. The price in 1918-the maximum war-time quotation-wa s £19 5s.; but the price today, also for delivery at Port Augusta, is still as.high as £17 15s./ an increase over the pre-war price of more than 100 per cent. Similar prices in respect of plates are:-£1 1 2s. delivered at Port Augusta prior to the war; £23 5s., the highest war-period price; and £21 15s. today. The cost of fishbolts before the war was £21 6s.; the maximum war-time price was £66; the price today is £56 10s., nearly 300 per cent, above the pre-war quotation. And still there is the cry for protection! The pre-war quotation for dogspikes was £15 16s.; the.maximum war-time price was £40; today, dogspikes cost £38 10s.",62
365,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The same argument might be applied to wheat, the price of which is three times what it used to be.",62
366,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"We are not asking for the protection of wheat. We are dealing with an industry which controls nearly eveiy manufacturing activity in this country. If a manufacturer were tn indent from the Old Country, say, a 200-ton line of various steel products, there would probably be more than 100 items in that indent. The Broken Hill Company will not accept such orders except under conditions providing that the firm shall be given six months or twelve months before it can put in the machinery to make many of the minor lines which are not frequently ordered in the Australian trade. As for other lines, the Australian firm will not undertake to supply them at all. I quote the following from Hardware and Machinery of 4th April last:The Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. have advised the trade that no new contracts will be accepted during the next six months, and that buyers wanting to effect forward contracts during that period should look to oversea sources. Further advice of the position of the company in regard to forward contracts is promised in May or June. C.i.f.e - quotations for Belgian mild steel are freely made at from £13 5s. to £15 per ton, with sales at £15 10s. for immediate shipment. That state of affairs was due to the strike. The Australian enterprise could' not supply orders. I have, heard recently that, in, connection with the Morwell electrification scheme, in which there is required an enormous quantity of angle iron, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company could not quote for St. Indents have had to be, or must be, sent to the Old Country for these lines; Has any evidence been advanced to show that the Broken Hill Proprietary fish- Company need protection ? I hold in my hand a statement setting forth the amount .of capital which has been put into that company, and indicating its net profits. For the past three years these have amounted to about £600,000 per annum. The Broken Hill Proprietary mine has been closed for a considerable time, so that all the indications are that the company has been doing remarkably well at Newcastle. It has had a very fair start, and I am glad of its prosperity, because one naturally wants to see flourishing industries in Australia. It may be argued that it does not matter much if wo add a Icouple of pounds a ton on items, for example, such as steel bars; but I point out that they go into every blacksmith's shop in the land, and are used by almost every Australian manufacturer. Before a manufactured product reaches its ultimate purchaser there are various additional profits to be added; and it is the - man on the land, who wants to fence a holding with wire netting to keep out vermin, from his crop, who to bear the brunt of it all. The cost wire netting has gone up by about 300 per cent. All these burdens inevitably tell on the man who is struggling to build up the primary industries of Australia. Unless there is a possibility of tralia's iron and steel interests being jured or, ruined, where is the call f o high protection? If there were some actual menace, prompt action could be taken. There has been a good deal talk about dumping, but it should-not forgotten that there has been a huge mand all over the world. enormous destruction during the war period, and iron and steel is wanted on tioned every hand. There can be very little if £7,000,000. any dumping in Australia for years to come, therefore. I invite those honourable members who have devoted themselves to this point today to listen to an imporing tant quotation which I am about to make, and which reveals how' easily the ComRichard monwealth Parliament could overcome similar difficulties. Under Article V the Japanese Customs Tariff Law, there is them. the following provisionWhen important industries in Japan are them all. threatenedtoythe importation of unreasonably cheap articles, or the sale of imported articles at unreasonably low prices, the Government may, under the regulations provided by perial Ordinance, specify such articles, submitting the matter to investigation Unreasonably Cheap Sale Investigation Committee, and impose upon them during a certain fixed period of time duties not in amount their proper prices, in addition to the duties provided in. the, annexed'Tariff. Then there is a following section specifysupply local requirements. ing how that can be done. The scheme is . simple and effective. If it were proposed to grant a bounty to the iron and steel industry again, the false. Minister would be under an obligation to furnish estimates informing the general public of what was involved. worked out certain figures showing what the rates of duties under the present schedule would mean. These estimates are taken on the basis of importations made in 1913. If we had to import the same quantity now as came in , free of duty, in that year, the imposition would amount to £68,000. In respect of ingots, blooms, and slabs-takin g the same basis of comparison-the duty which we would have to pay today would be £27,700. On bars, bar-rods, angle-tee bars, and so on, the amount of duty which we would has be called upon to furnish today, if we of were to import the same quantity as in 1913, would be £391,000. On plate and sheet iron, upon which we paid £19,000 in. duty in 1913, and on which duties are suspended, we would have to pay £216,000 Ausmore. On those few items which I have in - indicated, the total amount which we r . would have to pay would be £704,000. If we add such lines as rails and tubes, and other items of iron and steel required in of Australia*-supposin g that all these were be manufactured here-the extra amount dewhich the people would have to pay would There was be more than £2,500,000.

383,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Well , that is what the extra duty. one hears in the lobbies. Mr RICHARD FOSTER.:-That will not strengthen the honourable member's case. It is useless making such statements, the honourable member should realise it .",64

If this high duty is imposed, it will f all only on one section; of the community. It is all very well for the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) to appeal forhigh duties-; but if they are imposed, they will not have the slightest effect upon his constituents. It is those hard and overtaxed workers in the r u r a l areas, who are opening.up new country, and who are developing it to the best of their ability, who will have to pay the impost. If r u r a l production is unprofitable, there will be no room for the Broken Hill Steel Works, or any such industry.

396,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.40] - I desire at this stage to deal with only .two - points raised by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), one of which was that, because the invoices to which he 'referred were expressed in terms Sng, that that was .sufficient proof that the - exchange position between the country from which the goods were invoiced and Australia had nothing to do with the question. ; Mr GREGORY. - And the price that was paid for the article.",65
397,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I am afraid I cannot follow She honourable member. The position, of course, is that the sterling price at which the invoice is drawn out is ihe 'conversion of the price in the currency of the country into sterling, and nothing more. It has nothing whatever to do with the relative value of the .goods as expressed in sterling here and in the country of origin. I shall endeavour to illustrate that from some figures I have - before me. My .authority is the United States Monthly Labour Mevi&w, dated Jraly, 19.20, which quotes the Bureau of Labour and Statistics of the United States of America - chance",65
398,Mr ELECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Where did the Minister get that? The Library cannot supply it ,65
399,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Perhaps we obtain a lot of information that does not reach the Library. I have before me the rates of wages in March, the number of employees, the average daily' earnings, and the various classes working in the iron and steel works in Oppeln and Silesia. In July, 1913, the average, daily wage the labourer in the steel works in - Geritem, many was .2.10 marks; but the average increase the duty? daily wage of the labourer in the steel works in Germany today is 12 on. marks. When we convert the daily wage of the German today at the current rate of exchange as between the sterling equivalent and the mark, we find that his wage is a little over l i d . When these wages are expressed in marks in the value of the product itself-as they have to be eventually when they sell the product-it costs many more marks; but s when we bring the mark back into the sterling current rate, we get a lower wage, and one infinitely below that paid here for the same - class of work. When we convert the 12 marks, which are paid in Germany today, as against the Australian Tate, which is 14s. Sd., the German is being paid only l i d . Mr Considine;-What is the exchange of .sterJ- rate of the sovereign today?",65
400,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The computations^ have given are at the Tate of '24'3 marks to the £1 sterling, When we convert cost of the product in marks into sterling for invoice purposes, there is still the vast difference in the - exchange between the two countries. It is true that we are not trading with Germany. We are trading with Belgium; but we get an extreme instance as between Germany and ourselves. Nevertheless, the same principle applies between Belgium and Australia, and that is why Belgian iron and steel is being quoted at a lower price than the British product. That is why, within the last week or two, England has taken action to give her Minister controlling the Customs Department the power to deal with this exchange .position. America is doing the same, and We must follow suit if our industries are to be given a reasonable to live. I say that the fact that these invoices are quoted in sterling does not in the least alter the fact that the exchange position gives to continental countries an undue advantage, and they are at the present time quoting prices lower than British prices, and lower than - our people can compete with.",65
401,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"In view of the statement made by the Minister, will he not of postpone the further consideration of this and see whether he cannot agree to",65
402,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,No ; I want to get,65

404,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"The amendment of 1920, was £42. the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) only affects imports from Great London. Britain. It will not affect imports from Belgium or Germany.",66
405,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I think that the duties I have proposed should be agreed to. ' . I am dealing with the the honourable member for Dampier, and not with his proposed amendment. I want to say a word or two concerning his statement that, in the interests primary producers, we should not protect these industries. I cannot follow honourable member in that statement. If that date? there is one class in this community which, more than another, suffered during the war from the exploitation firms abroad through the tremendous prices they were charged for the goods they required, it was the primary proprice ducers. No class in this community has been exploited by importers and, in their turn, by the people in whose goods dealt, as the primary producers have been. There is no other class either that has, by the establishment of these industheir tries in Australia, received more relief than have the primary producers. I will give just one instance in support of this statement. Every one knows how price of wire went up during the waT. Every one knows that until this industry was started here on a big scale at Newestablished, castle the price of wire was up in the clouds. What happened? The works at paid. Newcastle were put up under war conditions. Their overhead charges were relatively 400 per cent, greater than those than that now under discussion. of companies that had been supplying Australia with these goods before. But when the Newcastle works got goingand I speak now of April, 1920-the y fixed the price of wire from their works at £24 10s. per ton.",66
406,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,What was the price before the war?,66
407,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I am speaking of world. what happened during the war. I say that in April, 1920, the price of wire f.o.b. Newcastle was £24 10s. per ton.",66
408,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I paid £31 10s. per ton it in Melbourne six weeks ago.,66
409,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I can tell the honorto able member what the price was f.o.b. Newcastle, but I cannot tell him how tries was added to that price by others. The f.o.b. price in England in April,",66
410,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,That was f.o.b.,66
411,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Yes, London or Liverpool.",66
412,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Was not the price in one case for black wire, and in the other, case argument of for galvanized wire?",66
413,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No ; I am quoting prices for the same class of wire. The May price was £24 10s. f.o.b. Newcastle, of the and £43 10s. f.o.b. England.",66
414,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,Can the honourable the gentleman give the American price at,66
415,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"No ; I have not the of American prices before me. The June price was £24 10s. f.o.b. Newcastle, and £44 10s. f.o.b. England. The September was £24 10s. f.o.b. Newcastle, and £41 10s. f.o.b. England, and so it goes on. The importers were not able to pass their they price on. They had made contracts spread over a considerable period, and were getting deliveries of wire to keep trade, and they were obliged to sell every ton of wire they imported at a loss against the Newcastle wire. I , therefore, repeat that the primary producer, at ali the events, has reaped a very considerable benefit from the establishment of this industry in Australia. If it had not been he would have been called upon to pay infinitely more than he has",66
416,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"East Sydney) [9.54] - No item in the Tariff is of greater importance The way in which it is dealt with must have an effect upon every industry in Australia. I wish to justify the vote I intend to give on this item. I am sorry that, apparently, the Government have not realized the motive which has actuated the supporters of the amendment. A change, has taken place in the economic condition of the Since this Tariff was framed, in March of last year, many changes have taken place. To-day, in manufactures, Australia has in America a competitor for that she never, had before. The American Government and people have determined become large exporters of goods to other parts of the world. Our infant indusare not in a position to compete with American industries that have been long established, and are able to produce at a much lower rate than we can in Australia. There is a great movement in the world at the present time for the reduction of wages, and, despite the advice of the daily press, I say that we must, at all events, maintain a high standard .of living in Australia. That is the only way in which we can insure fitting conditions for human beings in a civilized community. We must pay attention to the movement going on on the other 3ide bf the world for the reduction of wages, and of the standard of living. bear that in mind, we shall understand the motive by which the supporters of the amendment are actuated. On this item I take advantage of an opportunity of which I did not avail myself in speaking on the Tariff as a whole, to point - out that if it is intended that the dutied imposed in this case shall be of any benefit to the people of Australia, they must be such as will prohibit the importation of. iron and steel from any other portion of the world. I remind honourable members that shipping companies running our large ocean liners quote reduced rates of freight for steel rails, machinery, and other heavy cargo that can be shipped as stiffening cargo for their' vessels. This must give importers qf these' goods a considerable advantage,' which can only be met by the imposition of' heavy duties upon them. I agree with honourable members who contend that the steel and iron. industry is a key industry. I have foi-. lowed occupations iii life o.ther than that .of a' member of Parliament, and I am able to inform honourable members that in the' building trade today iron apd steel plays a part that was never thought of twenty years ago: Iron and steel structures are today amongst the largest items in the requirement for large' buildings. The honourable, member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has a habit of repeating state-.' nients. He has referred to a statement made by Mr Delprat, but ignores the fact that' it was made some years ago. When Mr Delprat was giving evidence before the Public Accounts Committee in connection with the 'shipping inquiry, he stated jfihat the Broken Hill Proprietary. Company desired a protective duty on - steel, believing that Tariff Protection was [358] infinitely superior to the bounty system. The honourable member for Dampier has asserted' again and again that an endeavour is being made to build up a monopoly in connection with this industry. I recognise that there is a possibility of a monopoly being created, but should that happen, the united wisdom of the National Parliament should be able to devise the machinery necessary to cope with it. If we must handle the product bf a monopoly, it is better that that monopoly should be in our own country, where we can deal with it, rather than in some If we other part of the world, where we can exercise no control over it. A Labour Government would not allow a monopoly to hold sway in this country for any length of time. The honourable member for Dampier and other honourable members of the Country party have referred to wire netting. Wire netting is shipped by measurement, and not by weight, and in order that it may be put into the smallest possible space, it is dumped or pressed to such an extent that the zinc used in galvanizing it is chipped off, and the netting is thus seriously damaged. Locally-made wire netting is worth considerably more than that which is imported.",66
417,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I call attention to the want of a quorum. [Quorum formed.'],67
418,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I hope the. Australian public willtake this lesson to heart, and purchase locally-made wire netting, since it is more lasting than the imported article. The Minister- (Mr Greene) in determining the duties to be imposed under this item, no doubt acted upon information supplied by officers of his Department. He seems, however, to have overlooked the fact that more than twelve months-have elapsed since the Tariff schedule was, submitted, and that since then the conditions of labour in America and all European countries have materially altered. There seems to be a tendency, not - only in America, butthroughout' Europe, to lower the workers' standard of living. That will mean an interference with the distribution of the wealth of the. people, and a .very serious position is likely to be created. , We should do nothing to hamper, our secondary industries. Our primary industries were urged to produce more and yet more, with the result that we have an-abundance of wool, much of which, we cannot sell. Our farmers are likely also to have trouble in getting rid of their wheat, so that we must look to our secondary industries to keep up the standard of living in Australia.",67
419,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"And yet the honourable member desires to increase"" these duties, and so to increase the cost of implements and machinery used by the primary producers.",68
420,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"It is far better that.our primary producers should pay for a shovel made in Australia Is. or Is. 6d. more than is asked for the imported article. ' The money spent in the manufacture of the Australian-made article remains in the country. It is distributed among our own people, and is helping to create a local market for the products of ourprimary producers. Our object should be, if possible, to shut out importations. When our imports are declining, Australia is making progress, but when they are increasing, I recognise that the country is being subjected to a strain which, having regard to our war debt, it cannot bear. Our object should be to reduce our imports aud to increase our exports. Australia will suffer if she continues to import on the present large scale. We are told that the reason for the increase in imports is that delivery is now being made under many contracts entered into during the ""ar; but the fact that we are importing so largely clearly shows that our Tariff is not sufficiently protective. It ought not to be necessary for us to import iron and steel; we have here the raw material to produce the finest steel and iron. Experts told the Oommittee of Public Accounts that the locally-made plate and angle iron used in the ships that we constructed in Australia was better than any that could be imported. That is the opinion of experts, and not merely of members of the party to which I belong. These experts were brought from overseas in the war period to assist in establishing the shipbuilding industry here, and that was the conclusion at which they arrived in regard to the merits of our iron and steel. There is no justification for the idea the imposition of the additional duties necessarily means an increase in prices; but, even if it did, and it was necessary in order to maintain wages and our present standard of living, it would have my - support. I can remember the day when we .were told by gentlemen with Free Trade proclivities that cheap labour was the salvation of the country; indeed, they would almost have led us to believe,that we must .sink to the standards of China and Japan. This, however, I am convinced, Australians are ""not prepared to concede. When I reached manhood, and could think for myself, I ' saw the fallacy of ideas of the kind, and I earnestly urge on the Government to remember that this industry is necessary to our defence and our commercial prosperity. We are an island continent, and, sooner or later, as Australia develops and population increases, our coastal shipping service will be of „some magnitude. And when I realise how essential this industry is to us, I feel that I must do something to make the importation of iron and steel impossible. _ If we had to import the raw materials for the industry, I might take a different view; but we know that Australia abounds in all that is necessary for the production of the finest iron and steel in the world. The experts to whom I have referred have no doubt as to the quality of our iron and steel, and they have expressed the further opinion that Australian workmanship cannot be excelled, while production is cheaper here than in England or America. With all these facts $ before me, I should be a traitor and a renegade if I did not urge the Government to reconsider their attitude in regard to this item. There would be no more wrong .in the Government acting on that suggestion than there would be in the Free Traders of the House submitting themselves to au intellectual readjustment before voting on the question before us. The Government ought to try to bring their supporters together in view of the importance of this industry. It grieved me very, much to hear it suggested to-night by an honourable member that the smaller States were being asked to pay for the advancement of the State from which I come. That is a deplorable that spirit to be exhibited on such an occasion; it is a spirit which was not found in New South Wales when the majority of the people there voted for a united Australia, so that the rest of the country might share in her prosperity. We on this side of the House always display a national spirit in dealing with public questions, and I hope that, we shall hear no further references of the land to which I refer. If one State of Australia is making' progress, that must tend to the progress.of every other State; and so, if ii State is not doing so well as others, position can be improved by the display of th^ proper spirit. There is no doubt that the iron and steel industry is the key to all. the other industries, whether printon ing, building, engineering, or ship construction. Much of the opposition to the amendment comes from the representatives of the primary' producers; but I remind those gentlemen that if the secondary industries are not able to tain a high standard of living, primary producers will suffer to a greater extent than they now imagine. I am given to understand that the amendment, if agreed to, might affect other items in the schedule; but I presume the Government, are able to safeguard themselves in this respect. I should not be speaking at this length if I did not feel that this is the most important question that can come before us in this Tariff discussion. The employment of labour involved is something enormous. Messrs. Hoskins Brothers, at Lithgow, are one of the largest payers of freight that the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales have. Every day they run a train made up of forty trucks. Then they.have transport from Mudgee, and, further, there is the sending of their finished materials to Sydney and elsewhere. M - CHABLTON - I draw attention to r the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.]",68
421,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"Again , at Newcastle we have the works of the Broken Hill Company. These works not only give an immense amount of employment locally, but keep going an iron mine in South Australia, and a vessel which trades regularly between that State and Newcastle. The ramifications of this industry are paralyzing, and its benefits are widespread. Round about Newcastle there are no empty houses for miles, and rents have gone up enormously. Shopkeepers, clergymen, hotel keepers, newspaper proprietors and many others owe theiT incomes to the trade which it causes. What we desire is that Parliament shall meet the circumstances of the day, and keep an eye on the future. This is the duty of statesmen. We need to take a long vision. The amendment before the Comthe mittee is much more important than were the proposals of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), many of which were as useless as a mustard plaster a wooden leg for the cure of a cold. I was told by a doctor the other day that I might expect to live for another thirty years, and I guarantee that thirty years hence the people main- of Australia who meet me will tell me what a great work I did in advocating the increase of these duties. Those who vote for the amendment will not be sorry for doing so, and those who vote against it will regret that they did not take the advice of the honourable member for East Sydney. Some of my friends who live in country districts have not had so good an opportunity as I have had to travel and broaden their minds. I should like them to avail themselves of the benefits of my experience, and take my words to heart. If they do, they will accept the amendment in a broad national spirit. I was brought up in my early days to believe that Eree Trade was a godsend, but I was converted at the age of seventeen or eighteen. When I came out to New Zealand and Australia, and saw men walking about the streets with nothing to do, while locomotives and other manufactured articles were being landed on the wharfs, I thought "" I will do something for this country by starting the idea that it ought to produce what it needs for its own requirements."" It is remarkable how this Tariff has gone through up to the present. Twenty years ago, in our State Parliaments, such a thing would never have been thought possible. It only goes to show the great change that has taken place in Australian sentiment. I am inclined to think that a great deal of this is due to the system of public school education. Of course, in those days, when Australia was divided into petty States, the people had a very limited idea of national life, but when the Commonwealth was inaugurated the people stepped on to the broad path of nationhood, the Australian spirit and sentiment began to grow, and we accepted our responsibilities as a nation. Among those responsibilities is the employment of our own 'people and the utilization in the best interests qf ""the people of our raw materials.",69
422,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I call attention to the state of the Committee. formed.],70
423,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If any item can be quoted to show the real intention of a Tariff, it is this one. I shall always endeavour to go even as far as prohibition in dealing with the importation of articles produced by industries which are in the same position as the iron industry. Not oneof those who have opposed the amendment has endeavoured to show that the industry is not essential to Australian progress. It is pure imagination to say that an increase of £1 per ton in the duty would increase the price of the iron by £1 per ton.",70
424,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"If you had to write your cheque for £50 or.£60 extra for a. reaper and binder, you would find that it was not a difference of £1.",70
425,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"In New Zealand, under Eree Trade, the reaper and binder is dearer than in Australia. If the primary producer has to pay 10 per cent, more for his. reaper and binder which is produced in Australia, he has the satisfaction of knowing.that the money he has spent will be circulated in Australia, with the almost certain result of enabling those who require the commodities he produces to pay for them at decent wages. We must do something to keep our industries at a high standard, so far as wages are concerned. If we do not, the primary producer will get no returns, and his land and stock will go down in value.",70
426,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,It has gone down in value.,70
427,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"-The honourable member should support the amendment, because with the changes which have taken place in other parts of the world, and the possibility of a lower standard of industrial conditions to which I hope Australians will never submit, there is a-great danger to our local industry.",70
428,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,I call attention to the state of the House. formed.],70
429,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSURANCE,"I do not think that the Minister has considered this question as' seriously as ,he,should do. I do not know of any item in the Tariff that affects so many people as does the one we are now considering. The people are expecting a great deal of assistance from this Tariff. A large reyenue from Customs duties is no evidence of the prosperity of a country. [Quorum' On the contrary, a Tariff which reduces importation to a minimum is the one that makes the country progress. We cannot pay our way if importations continue on' the present large scale. One of our greatest troubles is that we are receiving too much revenue from Customs duties, and are thereby extracting from the people in the humbler walks of life a greater amount of taxation than they should be required to pay. Most of the articles from which Customs revenue is derived are necessaries, and, therefore, every individual in the community contributes to this form of taxation. I do not wish to further detain the Comout mittee, but I know that when my friends read my remarks this evening, they will congratulate me upon my statesman-like view of the Tariff in its relation to the great iron and steel industry. I have no personal interest, commercially or politically, in this industry. I hope that the energies of Australians will be devoted to something more than tilling the ground, drawing water, or humping wood. No country has done well which has not a high standard of wages, or which has not provided ample employment for its people in industries. No greater duty or responsibility rests on a National Parliament than to provide that employment for the people of the country. It is a pleasure to honourable members when, at the conclusion of their'duties, they pass among their constituents to realise that, as a result of what they have done here, the people are fully engaged in producing wealth for the community at large.

431,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.32] - It is my melancholy duty to in timate to the House that Mr James Page, one of our most respected and best beloved members, died this morning. The news comes like a bolt from the blue, and gave me the greatest possible sense of shock when it was told me. Happenings like this cause wonder as to what life may have in store for us. To see a man stricken down at the height of his power aud in the plenitude of robust health gives us pause, and makes us realise how slender, after all, is our hold upon life and its opportunities. Edmund Bur-kej speaking in the House of Commons on an occasion like that on which we are met here this morning, in language far better than that in which I can clothe my thoughts, said of a deceased member The worthy gentleman who has been snatched from us at the moment of the election and in the middle of a contest, while his desires were as warm and his hopes as eager as ours, has fittingly told us what shadows we are and what shadows we pursue. There can be but one sentiment in this chamber today, that of unfeigned sorrow  without a single enemy. At the height of our most bitter - controversies we always felt a deep respect for the man who is no longer with us. I am not sure that I did not like him best in his moments of excitement. He was' a man who loved his country intensely, and loved his fellow-men, serving them with every atom of .his strength and with the whole devotion of his mind. There are few finer characters than that of J i m Page. [359] In one sense we can scarcely be sorry for him. He lived a full , well-rounded, useful life, serving his country in almost every possible sphere of activity. As a citizen he built up for himself a character for good repute, and won material success; but never for a moment did he forget M-. those less fortunate than himself. He served his country not only in the paths of peace, but also upon the battle-field. We all know something - of his career as a member of this House. It is that by which he is remembered best. I was a comrade of his for twenty years, and I do not remember a time when I had not the greatest respect, esteem, and good-will for him ; I am sure every other honourable member felt in the same way towards him. All we can do this morning is to bow our heads in the presence of this mystery, and bow our wills to a higher will , hoping, as I believe most profoundly that, although he has passed to ""where beyond these voices there is peace,"" he still lives on, to do useful work in some other and better sphere.' I move.That this House records its sincere regret at the death of the honourable member for Maranoa, the Hon. James Page, who was a member of this House since the inauguration of the Parliament; and expresses its appreciation of the zeal with' which he devoted himself to his public duties, and its profound sympathy with his bereaved family in their great sorrow.",71
432,Mr RYAN,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"West Sydney) [11.38] - I rise to second the motion of the Acting. Prime Minister, and to endorse his remarks about our deceased friend and comrade. It falls to my lo t to express the profound regret, not only of his own colleagues, the members of the Commonwealth Labour party, but of all the State Labour parties and of the whole Labour movement throughout Australia. He was a close personal friend of mine for many years, and I mourn his loss as' that of a very dear comrade, .who stood by me in many a hard-fought fight. We all know  Labour from its earliest days, and took a large part in blazing the track which led to its success in many spheres. As the Acting Prime Minister has said, he held th© respect not only of his supporters but also of his opponents, because he was a fair fighter, and always played the game. It is but a few hours since he was with us, bright, cheerful, and full of fight. Yesterday afternoon, when an adjournment motion was spoken of, he interjected, "" I will give you an adjournment tomorrow."" He has given it to us, Mr. Deputy Speaker! Such happenings as this should incline us to: think more kindly and generously of one another in political life - The suddenmess of his death makes us realise what f r a i l creatures we are; it should certainly make Us feel humble when we are shown how, truly, in the midst of life we are in death. Words fail to adequately express my feelings on this occasion, and I content myself with extending my sympathy to his son and other relatives in their bereavement.",71
433,Mr GREGORY,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Dampier) [11.40] It is with the deepest regret that I rise to support the motion moved by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook). Although I have not been many years in this House, I have been here long enough to greatly appreciate the qualities of our departed friend. I think I am speaking not only for every member of the Country party, but for every honourable member of the House, when I say we admired his wonderful spirits, jovial nature, and yet earnest devotion to the principles he espoused. As the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has said, the late member, though a great fighter, was always a fair one. The news we have received this morning is tragic and astounding. Mr. Page was here with us yesterday full of life and vigour, and today we know that he is no more. I must content myself with, in a somewhat feeble manner, endorsing the remarks of those who have preceded me, in the hope that our words may bring some comfort to those whom our deceased friend has left behind.",72
434,Mr CONSIDINE,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Barrier) [11.43] Aa the only representative in this House of the Industrial Labour party, I desire to co-operate in extending our sympathy to the friends and relatives of our late comrade. My acquaintance with him was not of very long standing; but, regarding him as both friend and colleague, I cannot adequately express my sorrow at the loss we have sustained. I join with the representatives of the various parties here in extending our sympathy to the late member's relatives and friends, and in expressing .the great loss occasioned by his tragic death.",72
435,Mr BAMFORD,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Herbert) [11.45] - I entered this House at the same time as the late, member did, as a member of the same party, and from the same Sta'te, and the House will bear with me while I say a few words in reference to his tragic death. The late member and myself have not always followed the same political lines, but I am pleased to say that the friendship between us was never disturbed on that account. We remained the best of friends, and, indeed, it would have been difficult for any man to quarrel with James Page. As I know from experience, he was a man ever ready to extend help where it was needed. In my mind's eye, I see him sitting opposite as he did yesterday, ful l of life and vigour; no one could for a.moment have anticipated that the hand.of the grim reaper was so shortly to be placed upon him. To say that I specially regret his death is but to very inadequately express my feelings; and I can only, as one who knew the deceased gentleman intimately, give my support to the motion submitted by the Acting Prime Minister. We cannot but feel somewhat pleased that we did not resolve on an all-night sitting yesterday, for otherwise we might, for the second time, have had a tragedy within the walls of this chamber. ' My regret is deep and sincere at the death of ' a man for whom I had the greatest possible respect, and between whom and myself there was a friendship  recently suffered a great bereavement in the loss of a sister, to whom he was greatly attached, and I think that that occurrence may, perhaps, have had its share in precipitating the sad occurrence of last night.",72
436,Mr CHARLTON,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Hunter) [11.47] May I be permitted to endorse the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. From the time. I entered, this House, I  close friend; and I remember the good advice and valuable assistance he. was ever ready to give me. I always admired  ever differences of opinion there may be from time to time in connection with the performance of pur duties, no one was quicker to forget and forgive than our late friend. He was full of the milk of human kindness, always generous in his endeavours to assist others; indeed, it seems to me that he lived to better the lot of all with, whom he came in contact.  both State and Commonwealth. He worked in the interests of the community; and whatever our political feelings may be, we respect a man who has the courage of his opinions, and is prepared to stand by them, irrespective of consequences.. I do not think we could have a man of finer  other public representatives, I have in my time met many men whom I admire, but I can say, without the slightest hesitation, that no man stands higher in my estimation than did the late James Page. As a friend, I shall certainly miss him while I - remain here, and I think he will be missed by all honourable members. I remember how full of life and fight he was last night, when an all-night sitting was anticipated. I am glad that an all-night sitting did not occur; and I venture to express the hope that we shall, as far as possible, dispense with such tings as very trying to the health. As I have said, our deceased friend last evening was full of fight, and said to me, "" Charlton, I will be with you until tomorrow; I will see you through as far as this fight is concerned,"" plainly showing that at that time, so far as he knew, his health was all that might be desired, and that he was anxious to continue here and do his duty in this Chamber. Then to get the startling news this morning that he had been found dead in his bed was a blow to every one of us, a shock which none of us expected to .receive. I realise the great loss that his death will be to our movement, and how difficult it is to replace a man of his calibre. I extend my sincerest sympathy to his relatives and friends in the great bereavement which they have sustained.",72
437,Mr JOWETT,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Grampians) [11.52] I trust the House will bear with me I say a few words in tribute to the memory of one of my oldest friends. The late honourable member was a friend of mine for more than thirty years, and it was terrible shock to me this morning to hear from the Acting Prime Minister that he was dead. It is impossible even now for me to realise that it is true. I can only regard it as a mysterious visitation pf beneficent Deity, when I remember that was sitting alongside him last night about I I o'clock, he being full of health, spirits, hope, and brightness. The news this twenty [359]-2 morning is one of the most .dreadful calamities to me, as it must '.be to every member of the House, and I venture to say to the whole of the people of Australia. When I first met our good friend he was then,. I think, a shearer, and I was a struggling squatter in the far NorthWest of Queensland. In those days 1 had pushed sheep out beyond what were then considered the bounds of civilization, and it was a favour to get shearers to come and shear sheep< so far out. The late honourable member and myself were always friends from the boginning. 1 can remember the first great shearing strike taking place just thirty years ago, and the second shearers' strike in 1894. This much I will say, that, whatever side men fought on in .that struggle, they fought as men and as gentlemen When I mention that the late  sit- shearers, and that Senator Fairbairn was one of the three leaders of the squattersthe "" Triumvirate "" as they were calledin those days, honourable members will realise the truth of what I say when I apply the words of the good old Book"" There were giants in those days."" That struggle was fought out without the slightest bitterness .on either side, and possibly that circumstance was largely due to the presence of such men  first Federal election, at which Mr. Page was a candidate. Although he was opposed by a well-known squatter, I was one of those who supported him even in those early days. After that election, inspired by whom I do not know, some articles antagonistic to him were published in the local paper, and I am glad to think that I wrote, to the Western Champion at Barcaldine and told my friends there that in my opinion while Mr James Page was, amongst all the members of the House, the best supporter of the whole of the people who lived in the western parts of Queensland. I could a say much more about my old friendship with him. For sixteen years, during the life of this Parliament before I had the honour of being returned, whenever I desired to come to this Chamber, the only the man to whom I ever sent my card was our I late' lamented friend. I have always looked upon him as my greatest friend, and as the best representative for the last years that the people, who live far back, away from the benefits, the amenities, and delights of city civilization, ever had in this House. I desire to join in this tribute to the memory of one of iny oldest friends, and one' of the bravest aud most loyal men that the Empire has ever known.",73
438,Mr BLAKELEY,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Darling) [11.56] - I wish to add my tribute to the memory of my mate, Jim Page. Open-hearted and big, physically and mentally, reminiscent of the western plains which he loved so well, there was never a man down-andout in. the west of Queensland who sought his assistance in vain. . No matter whose the quarrel, no matter whose the fight, Jim Page could always be found on the side of the man on the lowest rung of the ladder. He pioneered the fights of the Australian Workers Union in Western Queensland; he pioneered the fights of the Australian Labour party; and he was known and loved, particularly out there, but also generally throughout the length and breadth of the land. He was one of the big men of Australia, and one whom we could ill afford to lose. was cheery of disposition, and intensely loved a practical joke. He was the life of our party, and he loved to come into the room and get three or four of us to join him in singing one of the many songs for which he is responsible. It was only last night that he began to sing one of. them as he sat on the front seat on this side, but when you, Mr Deputy Speaker, looked at him, he at once desisted. There was no fun in which he would not join. He was like a big school boy coming into our room-alway s good tempered, and we can ill afford to lose him. The Australian Workers Union, the Australian Labour party, and the nation generally will find it, indeed, hard to replace Jim Page.",74
439,Mr FOWLEE,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Perth) [11.58] - May I , as one of the few remaining original members of this Chamber, be allowed also to add my word of tribute to the memory of the late honourable member for Maranoa? He has been through all these years a very intimate personal friend of mine, and I feel his loss most deeply. To me he was always the beau ideal of those who have come from the Old Land to help to build up the fortunes of Australia. He started at the very bottom, and worked himself up, by sheer force of character and the admirahave tion of those with whom he came in contact, into the high and honourable position in which death found him. He always lived a strenuous life, and the manner of his death is probably the one which he would have desired. There have been mauy who have already entered this Chamber and have left it for one reason or another. Many more will yet come, but I feel sure there will never enter within its walls a finer type of man than Jim Page.",74
440,Mr WATKINS,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E,"Newcastle) [121] As one who, perhaps, knew our late friend more intimately than many other honourable members, I should like to. add my tribute in support of the motion. I think the best side of his character was the' fact that while he forgot the unpleasant things done to him, he never forgot those who did him a kindness. It may be said of him that he was a person brimful of humanity. He always stood out for a fair deal. He had many fights, but no enemies. For mauy years, our departed He comrade discharged the onerous duties of the office of Whip of our party. How arduous and exacting those duties frequently are none can better testify than one who, like myself, has undertaken them. He applied «himself to their discharge with the utmost zeal and efficiency, and with the same warm-hearted enthusiasm he devoted to every aim of the great cause he loved so faithfully and served so well. God rest his soul'",74
441,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEAT H OF THE HONORABL E," Before putting the motion I should like to add n few words as a tribute of sorrow on my own behalf and on behalf of the staff of this Parliament at the great loss we have sustained in the death of the honourable member for Maranoa. I had known him ever since he became a member of this House. I had been associated with him politically in many ways and had always found him, as has been said by honourable members today, a man of most generous impulses, and with a big heart. It is only two days since he came to me in this chamber, and with tears in his voice offered me his sincerest sympathy in the bereavement, which' I have recently suffered. My heart went out to him more than ever then, as it had on other occasions when he tendered me his sympathy in former bsreavements. I say, in all sincerity, that no one, deplores his lose more than I do, and I hope that his relatives may. be given the strength to bear the great load of sorrow which the Almighty has placed upon them. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOK) agreed toThat Mr Deputy Speaker be requested to transmit to the relatives the foregoing resolution and » oopy of toe speeches - delivered thereon. House adjourned at 12.3 p.m.",74
