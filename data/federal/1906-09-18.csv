1,Mr KELLY,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"In the absence of the Attorney-General, I ask the Prime Minister if the Government will lay upon the table the judgment of the High Court in the case of Baume versus the Commonwealth, which has such an important bearing upon the administration of the Customs Act and the Tariff?",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"Assumin g it to be available, I shall ask mv honourable and learned colleague to lay the judgment upon the table, though it is usual in these cases to accept the law reports. ADELAIDE CUSTOMS FRAUDS.",13
3,Mr BATCHELOR,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"As the Board of Inquiry, which has investigated the Customs irregularities at Adelaide finds that, although the revenue has been defrauded of some scores of thousands of pounds, no one is to blame, I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he is taking steps to, protect the revenue in future ?",13
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"I had nothing to do with the appointment of the Board, which was done either by the Comptroller General or by the Public Service Commissioner. Every step is being taken to protect the revenue, but, as the case is sub judice, it would be unwise for me to say anything further ' about it now. I hope that the honourable member will allow the matter to rest until further developments take plaoe.",13
5,Mr BATCHELOR,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"I do not ask for information in regard to anv matter which may be sub judice, but as the Board of Inquiry has found that no one connected with the Department is to blame, I wish to know if the Minister intends to take steps which,, if anything of the kind occurs in the future, will cause some one to be held responsible. It should not be possible for the revenue to be defrauded of immense sums without) anv officer, being held blamable.",13
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"The honourable member's question is a delicate one. I had today a long interview with the Crown Solicitor, from whom I obtained all the particulars in his possession. No stone is being left unturned ih ascertaining the responsibility of all connected with the case; but it would be unwise for me to say now what I know in regard to the matter.",13
7,Mr BATCHELOR,BAV ME VERSUS THE,I do not wish the Minister to disclose any information which ought to be withheld at this stage. What I ask is that in future officers of the Department shall be held responsible forirregularities.,13
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"On e matter is so mixed up with another that I cannot say, until further developments have taken place, what will be done. The Board has made a report in regard to certain officers, and if they are found to be at fault, action will be taken. Every step which it is possible to take for the protection - of the at once. revenue is now being taken.",13
9,Mr FRAZER,BAV ME VERSUS THE,The officers ought to be shifted about from State to State periodically. AUSTRALIAN INDEBTEDNESS.,14
10,Mr KELLY,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"I wish to know from Treasurer if the statement appearing this morning's Age that the total indebtedtime ? ness of Australia abroad amounts to £236,680,000 is correct?",14
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"The total incolleague's debtedness of Australia is ,£236,680,739, filled. of which £201,983,386 was borrowed in London, and £34,697,353 in Australia. AUSTRALIAN IMPORTATIONS.",14
12,Mr KELLY,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"I wish to know from the noticeMinister of Trade and Customs whether it is a fact, as stated in this morning's Age, that the imports into Australia are valued at £60,000,000, of which £23,000,000 worth come from Great Britain and £37,000,000 worth from other countries?",14
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BAV ME VERSUS THE,This is a plaas follows: card sort of question.,14
14,Mr KELLY,BAV ME VERSUS THE,No . The Minister has duties made a similar statement.,14
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"What I said him was that our imports from all sources, exquirements. clusive of bullion, are valued at about oaths £37,000,000, of which British imports rewealth present a value of about £23,000,000.",14
16,Mr KELLY,BAV ME VERSUS THE,Then the Age publishes wrong figures in both the instances to which I have referred. HI GH COURT BENCH.,14
17,Mr FISHER,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if there are good reasons why additional appointments should not be made to the High Court at onoe. The statement of the Chief Justice showed the appointment of additional Justices to be urgent, and as the Act empowering their appointment has been passed, it is most desirable, for reasons which need not be mentioned here, that action should not be postponed.",14
18,Mr DEAKIN,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"There are good reasons why the appointments should not be deferred ; but honourable members will agree that they are among the most responsible which a Government could be called upon to make. The subject will be taken into consideration immediately,' though I do not - promise that the appointments will be made PROROGATION.  press that the Treasurer intends to leave Melbourne next week. Will the Prime Minister give the representatives. of Westthe ern Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania in an opportunity tp get away at the same",14
19,Mr DEAKIN,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"Owing to the slow progress made last week, my right honourable intention is unlikely to be fulPOLICE AND DEFENCE.",14
20,Sir JOHN QUICK,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, ufon Whether there is any law preventing mounted troopers and other members of the Police Force from joining the Light Horse Regiment or other branches of the Defence Force?",14
21,Mr EWING,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's question is Not that the Minister is aware of, but the of a member of the Police Force are of such a nature that it would be impossible for to devote sufficient time to military reAs members of both the Police and Defence Forces have to subscribe to prescribed on enlistment under State and CommonActs respectively, disciplinary difficulties might very easily arise. PROMOTION, POSTMASTERGENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.",14
22,Mr HUGHES,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Is promotion granted to officers of the General Division, Postmaster-General's Department, consequent on vacancies occurring on the staff in that division? 2. Is similar promotion granted to postmasters and telegraphists? v 3. Do the clerks, General Post Office, Sydney, receive promotion in like mannei also. If not, what is the reason for such promotion not being granted .them ? 4. What is the amount saved on salaries in connection with the clerical staff, General .Post Office, Sydney, since transfer to the Commonwealth ? 5. ITow many clerks, General Post Office, Sydney, are now in the 6th subdivision of the 5th class? 6. Does the Public Service Commissioner propose to take any action by which the congestion which exists therein may be relieved?",14
23,Mr GROOM,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"The Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following replies: 1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Yes. 4. There has been no saving. The increased cost amounts to £3,309. 5. There are sixty-five clerks now in the 6th subdivision of the fifth class. 6. The apparent congestion is the result of the general advancement of junior officers to the maximum of their class, which was higher than it was under the State. Promotion can only be given on the recognised principles, namely, when a vacancy in the higher class occurs, or where the value of the work and the merit of the officer justify advancement. LETTER-CARRIERS' SALARIES'.",15
24,Sir JOHN QUICK,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it true that the senior letter-carriers in Victoria were, for four years prior to the reclassification scheme propounded by the Public Service Commissioner, in receipt of £150 per year, secured to them by State law, Act No. 1721, and that by such scheme their salaries have been reduced to £138? 2. Is it true that junior letter-carriers in toria were, by the same law, entitled to salaries rising by increments from £ 9 0 to £132 per year; that two increments were granted, lpringing such salaries up to Commonwealth Government has refused to grant Hie third increment to bring the salaries up to £132? 3. Is it considered just or reasonable that the rights and emoluments of transferred public servants, secured to them by State law, should be taken from them by Commonwealth law ? 4. W i ll the .Postmaster-General submit to the Public Service Commissioner, for reconsideration, the question whether the grade system should be allowed to prejudice existing rights and interests, and whether the increment system up to a maximum of £150 would not be preferable?",15
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"The Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information in nexion with questions 1, i , and 3:1. Yes. Under section 19 of the Victorian Public Service Act, No. 1721, some of the senior letter-carriers in Victoria were raised, just prior to Federation, to £150 per annum. .£138 per annum was fixed under the classification as fair remuneration for their work, against which Ihey made an unsuccessful appeal to the High Court. 2. No. The majority of the officers referred to became letter-carriers under a regulation providing a minimum of £72 and a maximum of £108 per annum. This, however, a few days before Federation, was superseded by a regulation providing for discretionary increments up to £132, and the latter was replaced by the Commonwealth regulations, under which they are eligible to eventually advance to £138 per annum. 3. Yes. as it has been held by the High Court that Act 1721 conferred no permanent right, the State provision being merely a temporary one, pending the Commonwealth legislating itself for its public servants. The reply to the last question is4. There is no objection, but it may be stated that this question has already been thoroughly considered by the Public Service Commissioner, and in his report presented to Parliament on the 31st October last, he estimates that to abolish the grade system would involve the Commonwealth in an increased expenditure of £75,000 per annum.

SYDNEY.",15
26,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BAV ME VERSUS THE,"On the 12 th September the honourable and learned conmember for West Sydney asked the following questions:r. Is it to be assumed from the replies given on 24th ultimo, to the questions asked by him (Mr Hughes) concerning the number of clerks, General Post Office, Sydney, that the present number of clerks there-228-represent s an increase of 34 clerks above the number employed therein at the date of transfer to the Commonwealth ? 2. Is this increase exclusive of the 23 clerical positions abolished at that office? 3. How many surplus officers is it estimated will result from the proposed amalgamation of branches V 4. Is it not a fact that the chief officers of the General Post Office, Sydney, stated that no superfluity of officers could result therefrom? 5. Will he explain why., notwithstanding the increased clerical staff, as intimated, it is still necessary for the clerks at the General Post Office, Sydney, to be worked after the official day has closed ? 6. What amount of payment, if any, has been made to the clerical staff for any extra time worked by them since ist January this year? 7. In view of the representations made by the Acting-Deputy Postmaster-General and the heads of branches, General Post Office, Sydney, concerning the overworking of the clerks, does he intend to provide any further relief for these officers besides that which is expected to be received in consequence of the amalgamation of certain branches? The answers are as follow:'-1. The number of clerks now employed is fourteen less than at the date of transfer to the Commonwealth. The number at the latter date having been inadventently stated at 194, instead of 242. 2. Twenty-three clerical positions have been abolished', but Ipther positions have, in the meantime, been created, leaving 228 clerks now employed. 3. It is difficult to say at present, but it is thought that about ten officers will be surplus when the amalgamation is effected. 4. Certain officers expressed such an opinion, but, as already stated, the Public Service Commissioner, after an examination by his inspector of the work of the General Post Office, Sydney, intimated that so soon as the proposed amalgamation of branches is given effect to some of the present positions will become unnecessary, and there will be a superfluity of officers. It is proposed to abolish certain necessary work, and also to simplify the transaction of business in various directions, and thus afford relief to all concerned. 5. It is necessary at times for officers to remain on duty beyond the regulation hours of attendance to cope with the work, and to perform special or urgent work which will not admit of delay, but this condition of things is not peculiar to the General Post Office, Sydney. 6. Seventy-three pounds for ""tea money."" 7. The amalgamation of branches is in progress, and will be completed shortly, and, it being anticipated that the clerical staff will then be in excess of requirements, it is not considered necessary to appoint any additional clerks to the branches concerned. NA (SPECIAL DUTIES) BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from n t h September, vide page 4365): Clause 2Section eighty-seven of the Constitution is altered- t (a) by inserting after the word "" Excise"" the words "" (other than special duties of Customs and of Excise)""; (b) by inserting after the word ""balance"" the words "" of the revenue from those duties (other than special duties)""; (c) by adding at the end of the section the following paragraph :"" A special duty of Customs or of Excise is a Customs or Excise duty upon goods of a description rfot liable to Customs or Excise duty on the first day of January One thousand nine hundred and seven, and imposed expressly for specific purposes."" Upon which Mr Frazer had moved by way of amendment That the words "" 'Excise,' the words '(other than special duties of Customs and of Excise),' "" paragraph a, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" 'Expenditure,' the words 'other than expenditure for a national scheme of old-age pensions.'""",15
27,Mr DEAKI N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [2.47] - Honourable members will see that under our proposal it is intended to alter section 87 of the Constitution by placing special duties of Customs and Excise beyond the restriction to one-fourth to which all revenue derived from Customs and Excise duties is now subject. Under the proposal, of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, however, the raising of special duties of Customs and Excise is put on one un- side, and the Commonwealth Government will be entitled to charge against the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue now returned to the States, the whole cost of a national system of old-age pensions. Under the Government proposal, any future Parliament could provide any portion of the monev required for old-age pensions by imposing ""special duties. The amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would render the imposition of special duties unnecessary, because the Commonwealth' would be able to deduct the money required from the amount now returnable to the States. As I have already stated, I hold that as, when the Constitution was framed, an understanding was arrived at that for at least ten years three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue should be returned to the States, we ought not to adopt the course proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie without the consent of everv State. I explained at some length that the proposed change could be made if his amendment were accepted by a majority of the States, instead of by all the States.",16
28,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Lang) [2.50] - I take it that the object of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is to avoid giving the Government a roving commission, which would enable them to levy special duties for any purpose that they pleased. If old-age pensions are to be provided for out of Customs and Excise revenue, without committing myself to support the amendment in its present form, I think that the proposal of the lionorable member is preferable. I have a very strong objection to the imposition of extra taxation through the Customs House. Honourable members may say that this is due to my free-trade proclivities, and, of course, that may be very largely the case.",17
29,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is not a in*e-trader, but a revenue tariffist.",17
30,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . I am not a revenue tariffist, but a straight-out free trader. I am opposed to piling up burdens of taxation upon the poorer sections of the community. It is well understood that no large amount of revenue can be derived from Customs duties without taxing, the necessaries of life, and it follows, as a natural consequence, that the, poorer sections of the community have to bear the greater part of the burden. It has been suggested that special duties] should be levied upon tea and kerosene to provide the funds necessary for old-age pensions. Any such imposts would impose a specially heavy burden upon settlers in the back blocks, such as miners, farmers, shearers, and others, and upon the poorer dwellers in cities. Moreover, if such duties are imposed, we shall be practically calling upon, those who will most need the benefit of old-age pensions to' make the necessary provision out of their own pockets. This would be a paltry and contemptible proceeding on our part. I trust that the Committee will resist any proposal that will have the effect of imposing greater burdens upon the poorer classes.",17
31,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"""Barrier) [2.55] - I shall support the amendment. The operation of the Braddoni section would not be interfered with, except in regard to the provision that might have to be made for old age pensions, and the amendment is therefore preferable to the original proposal. As I have recently pointed out, we are at present collecting £ 2 5s. per head of the population in Customs and Excise duties, and this is the highest amount contributed in that form in anv civilized country in the [164] world. If we were to impose special Customs duties for the purpose of raising another ,£1,500,000 to enable us to provide for old-age pensions, we should add 7s. 6d. per head to the taxation through the Customs, and thus bring the total up to £ 2 12s. 6d. per head. I remember that when the Commonwealth Constitution B i ll » was before the people, Mr J. H . Gordon, of South, Australia-no w Judge Gordonwho was a member of the Convention, addressed a large meeting in Adelaide, which was attended by both Conservatives and Democrats. Mr Gordon was arguing very strongly in favour of the Bill - Turning first to the Democrats, he asked: "" What fault can be found with the Bill ? Is it not democratic enough, seeing that every man and woman will be entitled to a vote?"" Then, turning to the Conservatives, he said: "" Is it not conservative enough, seeing that all the revenue required by the Commonwealth will be derived from Customs duties, and the working classes will therefore pay the whole of the taxation?"" That was quite honest. I do not think that even the Prime Minister would deny that the revenue derived from the Customs House comes, principally from the workers of Australia. If we, as a Parliament, are not prepared to impose direct taxation, it will be a good thing for us to utilize a portion of the present Customs and Excise revenue, and thus reduce the amount returnable to the States. Then the States may find it necessary to f all back upon direct taxation. If we deprived them of a certain part of the revenue which is raised by indirect taxation, I suppose they would have to resort to direct taxation to make good the amount.",17
32,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Leave that to them.,17
33,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Prime Minister has argued that at the presenif) time it would be unfair to propose an amendment of the Braddon section of the Constitution, because if the matter were referred to the electors, it is quite possible that two of the States might declare against the proposed amendment, whereas the remaining four States and a majority of the people might pronounce themselves in favour of it. If the States hacl federated upon the understanding that the Braddon section was to continue in operation for ten years, and if this Parliament had violated that understanding, I admit that there would be some force in his contention. But it is beyond the power of the Parliament to do that. Any amendment of the Constitution can be effected only with' the consent of the electors themselves, and in order to safeguard the Constitution, not only is an affirmative vote of a majority of the people required, but an affirmative vote of a majority of the States. If a majority of the people of Australia and a majority of the States supported any proposed amendment of the Constitution, it is only reasonable to assume that a large number of the electors in the other two States would also declare themselves in favour of it. I have ai vivid recollection of the time when the draft Constitution was about to be submitted to the electOK-. of New South Wales for their approval. Upon that occasion Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Wise, and other strong advocates nf its acceptance, pointed out that (he Constitution itself prescribed the means by which its amendment could be secured, if the people deemed the adoption of that course desirable. I believe that a large number of electors in that State voted for the Constitution because they recognised that it was within the power of the people themselves to amend it if they so desired. When the right honourable member for East Sydney returned to Sydney from the Conference of Premiers at Melbourne, he pointed out some of its defects, and declared that its greatest blemish was the Braddon blot. He urged that, so long as that section was retained in the Constitution, there would be a great temptation to the Commonwealth Treasurer to raise 'money by means of direct taxation, because, by so doing, he would be. able to retain the whole of the funds thus derived for Commonwealth purposes. In speaking of the Braddon section, he saidIt is a very serious matter which I am putling to you. I want to call j'our attention to the amendment made by Sir Edward Braddon at the last moment almost in the history of the Convention. Throughout the Convention I have had to fight day after day to prevent anything being put in the Constitution which dictated the financial policy of the Commonwealth. The right honourable member then proceeded to show that he had relieved the working classes in New South Wales of a great deal of taxation, and had placed it upon the shoulders of the landed proprietors. In those days we frequently used to hear him affirm that taxation through the Customs was a burden upon the people. We do not hear much of that sort of talk from him now. He seems to be afraid to Mr Thomas. advocate anything in the nature of direct taxation.",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that he is more afraid than is the Prime Minister?,18
35,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not speaking of the Prime Minister.,18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is not fair enough to include the Prime Minister in his statement.,18
37,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At the meeting to which I refer the right honourable member for East Sydney statedAnd I may tell you that if this Federation comes I shall fight in the Federation precisely the same fight as I have fought in this country (Loud and continued cheering and applause). In other words, he stated that it was his intention to support the imposition of direct taxation.",18
38,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting?,18
39,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m the report of a speech delivered by the right honourable member for East Sydney, which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. He went on to sayAs in this country I fought that we should not take all our taxes from the masses, but take a share-no t an extravagant share-fro m the wealth and income of the country, so shall I fight in the Federation. I have not seen him doing that since he entered this Parliament. The right honourable member continuedI give these Treasurers notice, and those who speak with them, that if they come into this Federation with me, and those who side with me, so far as I am concerned, they must come into it on this footing : that they must look out for themselves. If they are in a mess they must get themselves out of their own mess. In the Federation there should be as fair and equitable a 'division of the national taxes - as, if I may be allowed to say it, we have here. In view of those statements, I think we are quite justified in asking that all the taxation for our national requirements shall not necessarily be raised through the Customs. I may add that if the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie be defeated, I am almost persuaded to vote against the proposal of the Prime Minister. I feel that a Federal system of old-age pensions must be established without delay. In the next Parliament no Government ought to be allowed to live- I do not care what Government it is-whic h is not prepared to deal with that question. If the Government proposal and the amendment alike 'be defeated we shall have no option but to f all back upon direct taxation.",18
40,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member mean to say that the Government cannot finance an old-age pensions scheme now ?,19
41,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not want to see either the Government proposal or the amendment carried. The funds with which to pay old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth ought to be raised by means of direct taxation.,19
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How can the honmind, orable member say that, in view of the cision of his party concerning a progressive land tax ? We could not obtain sufficient revenue with which to pav old-age penSouth sions under the Labour Party's proposal to levy a progressive land tax. Mr THOMAS. - I would not hesitate to make the tax in question a little bit stiffer.",19
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the honourable that member could not do that in view of the decision which has already been arrived,19
44,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As the honourable ber was once, a member of the caucus he knows exactly the position.",19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I confess that I not understand how the monev could raised under the proposal of the Labour Party to levy a progressive land tax. I do not wish to trick the honourable member. I have merely asked him a simple question.,19
46,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are advocating imposition of a land tax,19
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"W it h an exemption up to -£5,000. The honourable member's party says that that tax will yield very little revenue.",19
48,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am dealing with the question of direct taxation. The Commonbe wealth Parliament has power to raise revetoria nue by means of an income tax. Surely that is direct taxation.,19
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do I understand the honourable member to suggest the imposition of a tax in addition to that which is advocated by his party for the purpose of bursting up large estates?,19
50,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that we need to discuss that matter at the present moment. I am prepared to support any Government which will provide the necessary funds to pay old-age pensions by means of direct taxation. To my mind, there is nothing unfair in the proposal that taxation derived from land values should be applied to that purpose. The people of [164]- 2 the community have created those values. If it were not for their energies we should have no land values worth speaking of. I strongly object to raising more revenue through the Customs. I am in favour of direct taxation, and, as the amendment of the honourable fnember for Kalgoorlie will afford us the opportunity of providing the necessary money for the payment of old age pensions without the imposition of extra Customs taxation, I shall support it.",19
51,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Dalley) [3.14] - To my the amendment of the honourable demember for Kalgoorlie is preferable to the proposal of the Prime Minister. Within the past. few days the Treasurer of New Wales has announced a surplus for the financial year which has just closed of £ 8 4 6 , 0 0 0 . In other words, the people have been taxed to that amount in excess of the sum required for the ordinary purposes of government. At the present time State is annually paying £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 by way of old-age pensions. If the proposal at. of the Prime Minister be carried, the memTreasurer of New South Wales will be relieved of the necessity of paying old-age pensions, and consequently he will have do the enormous surplus of £1,500,000 . In be my opinion, we ought not to allow the people of New South Wales to be taxed to that extent in excess of the requirements of the State. The other day I suggested to the Prime Minister that there was no the reason why, without any amendment of the Constitution, funds could not be provided with which to defray the cost of a national scheme of old-age pensions. The honourable and learned gentleman inquired how it could be done, and I replied that I thought that an arrangement could made with New South Wales and Victo hand over to the Federation the amount they are now paying in respect of old-age pensions, with a view to its being devoted to a Commonwealth system.",19
52,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member imagine there is the faintest prospect of their agreeing to such a proposal ?,19
53,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If they were shown that it would be to the interests of their respective taxpayers, I think they would agree to it .",19
54,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is not the slightest prospect of their even looking at such a proposal.,19
55,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then it would seem that they are prepared to agree to the placing of unnecessary burdens upon the taxpayer. I agree with the honourable member for Barrier, that it would not be reasonable for this purpose to impose duties on tea and kerosene. Such taxes would f all most heavily upon the poorer classes. cannot tolerate the idea of ear-marking revenue derived from Customs duties for any specific purpose. As against the Prime Minister's proposal, we have that put forward by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, that the amount necessary to finance this scheme be deducted from the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue now returnable to the States. If that course were adopted the result would be very much the same as would be achieved under the scheme I suggest. The Treasurers of Victoria and New South Wales would be compelled to submit to such a deduction from the revenue returnable to them. When two of the States are alreadv subscribing something like £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum for the purpose of old-age pensions, it seems to be very much like "" whipping the devil round the stump "" to propose for the purposes of a Federal scheme to impose additional taxation to the extent of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 upon the people. I see no insurmountable difficulty in the way of the adoption of my proposal. I am certain that the smaller States would have no objection to it . Why should the two larger States, which already have old-age pension systems in operation, be further taxed because'of a sentimental regard for the position of the smaller ones ? I am not in favour of the scheme submitted by the Government, nor am I enamoured 'of that put forward by the honourable member for K a lgoorlie ; but I should select the latter as the lesser of two evils. I trust, however, that those accustomed to deal with financial questions will yet evolve a less objectionable scheme.",19
56,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [3.20]. - We are in effect asked by the Government to submit to the electors of Australia the question- "" Shall we anticipate by three years the alteration in our financial system which was contemplated when the Constitution was framed,"" and which I venture to say no one thought would be continued after the ten years period fixed by the Braddon section had elapsed. The only question which the electors will have to consider' in this regard is whether the provisions of that section should cease next year, or three years later on. I am aware that the question of old-age pensions has been so mixed up with that relating to the Braddon section that we cannot very well consider the one apart from the other. The Government, in fact, tell us that their I chief object in proposing this amendment of the Constitution is to enable them to submit to the next Parliament a scheme for the payment of old-age pensions.",20
57,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",20
58,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that no Government which failed to bring down some such proposal in the next Parliament ought to live. Such a scheme has been promised the old men and women of Australia from the inception of Federation, and its postponement from year to year has caused' bitter disappointment.",20
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should not forget that two-thirds of the old men and old women of Australia are already able to obtain such pensions.,20
60,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was about to say that, but that New South! Wales and Victoria have been able to finance independent schemes of the kind, the disappointment would be keener, and the protests against our delay certainly much stronger than they are. I am .afraid that the fact that those two States have been able ""to finance their own schemes-and it was onlyFederation that made it possible for New South Wales to establish such a systemhas led to the postponement of their application to the remaining States. The smaller States have had to wait longer than they otherwise would have done.",20
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Old-ag e pensions were established in New South Wales prior to Federation.,20
62,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But every one knows that the system was established there in anticipation of a big Federal revenue.,20
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,20
64,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-1 beg the honourable member's pardon. I remember distinctly that, at the time the New South Wales Parliament agreed to an old age pension scheme, the feeling was that as the result of uniform Customs taxation, that State would secure a much larger revenue than she was then collecting.",20
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can assure the honourable member that he is quite wrong. The scheme was passed on its merits.,20
66,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it not a fact that New South Wales is now receiving Customs and Excise revenue to the extent of about £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in of what she collected prior to Federation, and that while she is paying old-age pensions out of the additional revenue so received, she is still able to show a surplus? I repeat that I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that no Ministry which fails to bring in a Federal scheme ought to be allowed to remain in office. next Government will be confronted with the difficulty which presents itself to the existing Administration, and which others have had to face-the difficulty of finding the necessary funds without raising three times as much as is really required for the purpose. Our financial readjustments have caused much friction, and some of the States Treasurers have availed themselves of every opportunity to criticise the Federal Treasurer and the Federal Parliament. It is time that we had a scheme by which we could make each Treasurer independent of the other. The Question as to the amount to be returned to the several States of course involves another consideration. I lean very strongly to the proposal that we should agree to the payment of a fixed sum for a certain number of years, and so enable each State Treasurer' to know exactly what his position is, while leaving ourselves free to raise whatever further sums we need for Federal purposes. confess that, although I am as much averse as is any one to the imposition of additional Customs duties, I can see no other means of securing a Federal old-age pension scheme. In the abstract, I am with those who have advocated direct taxation. I suppose that most of us in the abstract prefer direct to indirect taxationi. but when we have said that we have said all we can on that phase of the subject. The bulk of the people cannot be induced to recognise how much better it would be to bear direct taxation, and so to be called upon to pay less than they have to do under a scheme of indirect taxation. It is useless to point out to the average elector that £ 1 paid at the present moment will satisfy the demands of the Government so far as he is concerned for, say, another twelve months, but that if he refuses to make that payment he may be taxed indirectly to the extent of 30s. in the course of the year. Whilst he will a.gree that direct taxation is the cheapest in the long run, he will at the same time finger his sovereign, ,and say, "" Let me keep it, and you may take what you want from me by mean,s of excess Customs duties."" The great mass of the people prefer indirect taxation; and I think it would require many years to educate them up to the point of paying by direct, as opposed to indirect, taxation; anything like the sum we shall require for this or any other purpose. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie proposes something The so radical that I am impelled to think that he hardly realizes what his proposition amounts to.",20
67,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is very genlerous.,21
68,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I fear that the honourable member allowed himself to be influenced by the fact that just now two or three of the States are showing a large surplus.,21
69,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wester n Australia is paying about £ 4 per head by way of Customs taxation, and I think that is quite enough.",21
70,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree to that extent with the honourable member, and I am glad that the amount of Customs taxation per head in Western Australia is gradually being reduced. I am afraid, however, that the honourable member has been induced to make his proposal by the fact that the two largest States which have I independent old-age pension schemes have what is to them an enormous surplus. He thinks rightlv enough, from his point of view that States which have so much public money to spare ought not to be asked to raise, by means of indirect taxation, a further sum for a Federal old-age pensions scheme. I wish to ask him to look for a moment at the position of the State of which he is a representative, and to consider what would be the effect of his proposal upon it. As the result of the operation of the sliding scale, the revenue collected from Customs and Excise duties in that State has been reduced during the last four or five years by something like £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and the Treasurer of Western' Australia is today struggling with an enormous deficit. The Government are just now fighting hard to impose direct taxation; but I shall be very much surprised if the Upper House allows them to do so. The proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would mean that Western Australia would have to pay, I think. £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year out of the amount received from Customs and Excise duties.",21
71,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Accordin g to the Government Statist of Tasmania, the contribution of Western Australia would be £85,000 a year.",22
72,Mr CARPENTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the case is worse than I thought. It would mean disaster to the old-age pensions movement if the people of Western Australia were asked to give up so much revenue, and those who supported the present proposal would have the State Government, the State press, and the majority of the people of the State against them. It is because I believe in old-age pensions, and wish to see them established, that I object to this proposal, which would put back their establishment for at least three years - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has not shown that consideration for the State Treasurer which should be shown. At the present time there are hundreds of men out of work in the Kalgoorlie district alone, and the Treasurer of Western Austalia says that the reason why public works are almost at a standstill is that, because of the operation of the sliding scale upon the Customs revenue, there is not enough money to do more than he is doing. Although I can see many objections ""to the proposal of the Government to raise additional taxation, I think that the only way to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pension scheme, which the people have declared for at two or three elections, is to raise monev by means of additional duties. I prefer to fake that course rather than say to the electors, of Western Australia, "" To provide for old-age pensions you must give up £85,000 of your share of the Commonwealth revenue."" I hope, therefore, that the Committee will not accept the amendment, but will adopt the proposal of the Government.",22
73,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bendigo) [3.36] I thoroughly approve of the proposal for the establishment of a national system of old-age pensions, and shall assist the Government in every way to take all the steps necessary to facilitate its preparation and adoption. In my opinion, the means suggested by them are the best under the circumstances, and my views coincide with those of the honourable member for Fremantle as to the unwisdom of adopting the amendment. Section 87 of the Constitution was once known as the "" Braddon Blot."" believe that it received that name in Svdney during the anti-Bill campaign. wards it became known as the Braddon section, a more respectable name; and it now deserves the title of the Braddon guarantee, as it .is generally regarded as one of the guarantees of the Constitution against Federal extravagance, and for securing the return to the States of a well defined and ascertained proportion of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. I think that it was a wise thing to insert this provision in the Constitution, and that it should be allowed to remain in unimpaired operation for the ten-year period assigned to it.",22
74,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We desire to ask the people whether they are prepared to alter that period.,22
75,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt provision is made in the Constitution for the amendment of this as well as of other sections; but how would representatives of New South Wales view a proposal to amend section 125, which says that the Federal Capital shall be in that State? Section 87 is as much a part of the Federal compact as is section 125, and, whilst the majority of the people voting in the majority of the States may have the legal and constitutional right to amend these and similar provisions, I should be sorry if Parliament were disposed to sanction any act of Federal repudiation.",22
76,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable and learned member supports the proposal of the Government, he is supporting action such as he condemns. It is only a question of degree.",22
77,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Premiers of the large as well as of the small States have, I understand, agreed to a scheme such as is proposed by the Government for the setting aside of the revenue from special duties-whethe r upon tea or kerosene is not material now-for the purpose of providing a fund for the payment of national old age pensions. The adoption of this scheme leaves the Braddon section unimpaired,, and, consequently, does not allow any violation of the sacred conditions of the Federal compact. Those who favour the establishment of an old-age pension system would be wise to pause before pressing the amendment to a division, because its adoption is likely to defeat the end they have in view. If the amendment were agreed to, the proposal which would have to be placed I before the people would meet with the strenuous opposition of the Governments of Afterthe States, and probably the most influential members of the States Legislatures.",22

80,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not tell the people that the money required for Federal old age pensions will be obtained by direct taxation ?,23
81,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt the people would say, "" You may devise what scheme you please to provide revenue for a. Commonwealth old-age pension fund so long as you do not break the Federal compact."" Any attempt to violate the conditions under which the States federated will recoil upon those who make it. I shall support every legal and constitutional effort to secure a uniform system of old-age pensions; but I cannot allow this important cause to be linked with a proposal which would create enmity and opposition in everv quarter of Australia, even amongst those who are in favour of old-age pensions, whose bounden duty it is, nevertheless, to protect the revenues of the States.",23
82,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the position of  i Sir JOHN QUICK - I think that a majority of the States will be opposed to the amendment, and I am surprised that it has been moved by the representative of a Western Australian division, 'that Stfate being concerned to an even greater degree than either Victoria or New South Wales. The Victorian Government are in f avour of nationalizing old-age pensions, provided that provision is made for them by imposing special duties upon tea and kerosene.

84,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The amendment does not bind the Government to impose duties upon tea or kerosene. Champagne is already taxed very heavily, and, probably, if the duty were increased, it would prohibit importation, and deprive us of the revenue we now receive. The proposal to further tax champagne might be very popular, but we could not, by adopting it , secure the revenue necessary to provide for old-age pensions. I welcome the proposal of the Government, and I shall give it my hearty support.",23
85,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney) [3.47] I was very much astonished to hear the honourable and learned member for Bendigo advance the arguments he did in favour of the Government proposal. Apparently, he is one of those who suppose that the instrument under which we are federated should not be altered under any circumstances. Yet, apparently, he is in favour of amending it in a certain way. According to him, we must not lay our iconoclastic hands upon the Constitution in one direction, but we may do as we please in another. We may pile upon the shoulders of the hapless people as many additional burdens as we like, but the moment we endeavour to curtail the privileges of the States as such, we are told that we shall run counter to the wishes of the members of the States Parliaments. These gentlemen must not be affected; but the unfortunate people, who may be bulldozed by articles in the press or hypnotized by speeches delivered by persons gifted with the power of oratory, may be imposed upon to am unlimited extent. The honourable and learned mcnber for Bendigo supports the Government proposal, which is to amend sejction 87, and yet claims that that section of the Constitution should be allowed to remain in operation for the full period of ten years. Probably at the end of that time he 'will come down with a proposal that it should be extended for another ten years. We have not had from members of the Opposition any clear indication of what ""they propose to do. It is proposed to alter the Constitution to enable the Government to obtain an increased amount of revenue by imposing additional duties, without raising four times as much revenue as they require. But the .Constitution already vests in the Commonwealth sufficient power to obtainall the revenue required. How of t the sight of means to do ill deeds Makes ill deeds done ! The Treasurer, whose whole career has been one bubble of extravagance, and who is about as easy under financial restraint as a bull would be in a Collinsstreet afternoon tea room, asks us to give him more money. I would as soon place in the hands of a lunatic a Winchester repeating rifle as give to the right honourable gentleman any more money than I could possibly help. He is asking for more money on the specious pretence that he is going to provide for old-age pensions. There is no guarantee, as far as this Bill is concerned that the money will be devoted to that end. Our position may be similar to that of the man on a race-course who is approached by another, and is induced to pay him over £ 1 upon the promise that if something happens he will be paid back his money and something in addition. But upon his afterwards searching for the man who has his money, he is unable to find him, and his money is gone for ever. How can we tell what will happen ? War might break out, or there might be rumours of war, and no sane person believes that the Treasurer would hesitate for one moment as to the purpose to which he should devote any money at his disposal if old-age pensions weighed with him on the one hand and the bubble reputation which war would bring influenced him on the other. The right honourable gentleman has swum on to glory on the top of the Coolgardie waterworks scheme. This was lifted by the godsout of the pit of Hadesby a chance, the right honourable gentleman was lifted with it . Now he has induced the Government to embark In a hare-brained scheme, and to pull down the Constitution to which we and so many others attached our names in the belief that it would prove sufficient for all our purposes. should have thought that honourable members of the Opposition would have been anxious to descend, like the cohorts of old, upon this proposal. fBut we find them sitting still, or, at any rate, not saying very much.",23
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable and learned member was not here when we discussed the proposal upon a formeroccasion.,24
87,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is very likely. I am doing my best now. I shall not vote in favour of any scheme for the imposition of fresh taxation unless I can see that some definite good will result from it. If I , as a free-trader, were told that £ 5 ° > ° > wanted by way of bounty for the encouragement of a languishing industry, I should be prepared to consider the matter as a business proposition. Even if it were proposed to afford assistance to the industry by imposing Customs duties. I mieht be disposed to lend a favoring ear. This, however, is no such scheme, because if an industry were to be supported we should have to look forward to receiving less, rather than more, revenue. This is nothing more nor less than a device to make the poor unfortunate public pay more for what they eat and drink and wear. I believe that in such matters as this direct taxation is the best check upon extravagance. We have heard a great deal about the extravagance of the Commonwealth Government, but what is to be said with regard to the financial management of some of the States Governments. I remember that one of the chief complaints made against the See Government, in New. South Wales, was that it lavishly spent enormous sums of money which were placed in its hands as the result of the increased revenue returned to New South Wales under the Commonwealth Tariff. When a Government has a large surplus it must get rid of it somehow. Deputations come from here, there, and everywhere, and submit all sorts of schemes, arid Ministers must be adamant to resist their appeals. In view of the fact that we know exactly how much will be required for the payment of old-age pensions, I propose that the money should be obtained by means of direct faxation. It does not follow that a direct tax must be a tax upon land. Under the German pension system, the funds are provided in the 'majority of cases by a tax upon receipts - a stamp tax. I am . astonished that it should have been reserved for the honorI able member for Fremantle to point out the disadvantages of direct taxation. I do not claimi that direct taxation is more attractive than indirect taxation. In many respects it is not. As a matter of fact, one of the main claims of indirect taxation to preferment is that it is evasive, and, to some extent, dishonest. It is a specious pick-your-pocket kind of taxation. When a man is told that at the end of the year he will have to pay for his water at the rate of 8d. or is. per gallon he is careful as to the quantity he uses. When you know what you have to pay you know exactly how far you can go, and direct taxation is one of the best possible checks n(w as upon extravagance either by the Federal or States Governments, or by municipal bodies. Direct taxation cannot go on and on indefinitely in the same way that indirect taxation may be imposed. The present isituation affords an effective illustration of this point. Every day in this House the Government brings forth a fresh proposail for taxation. A little while ago we decided to grant bounties, last week we had before us proposals to increase the duties under the reciprocal trade arrangements with New Zealand and Great Britain, and now another proposal for additional taxation is before us. Presumably only the narrow margin between the present time and the date of the general elections prevents a further crop of taxation proposals from being brought before us. I shall be prepared to support the imposition of further indirect taxation only when it can be clearly shown that a good object cannot be achieved by any other means. position has not been established in the present case. We ought, in my opinion, to resort to direct taxation,' to which members of the Opposition are largely pledged, but which they do not seem very much disposed to support. It is in the last degree important that some limit should be fixed to Customs taxation. If we impose direct taxation, we shall be extremely careful, as to what we are about. There are plenty of means by which we can with safety to the community, and without injustice to the States, and without laying our fingers upon the Constitution, provide the funds necessary for the. payment of old-age pensions. Although I am willing to give the Government every credit for desiring to make provision for old-age pensions, I am afraid tihat I shall have to vote against their proposal. I am looking to the Opposition fo bring forward some tangible alternative to the Government scheme. I shall look to my friends to put forward an alternative scheme, or to explain how the funds with which to pay old-age pensions are to be provided.",24

I favour direct in preference to indirect taxation upon every occasion. At the same time, I do not shut my eyes to the fact that I have to choose one of three courses.

99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think not.,26
100,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Constitution powers this Parliament to deal with the matter, and the power confers the obligation.",26
101,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The language used in. the Constitution in reference to the transfer of the debts is exactly similar to that employed in respect of the question of old age pensions. The Constitution states that we "" m a y "" deal with those matters. Although it is put in that form, I have always understood that the Commonwealth is to discharge all those duties as soon as it can conveniently do so. The Government feel that they are entitled to raise this question at the present juncture, because they realise that unless some settlement is arrived at with the States respecting our financial relations with them, we shall not have an opportunity to amend the I re- Constitution in the direction that they propose for another three years. That is a I do' so difficulty that I scarcely see my way to overcome. If we had had an opportunity I regret of conferring with the representatives of the States in respect of our financial relations with them at an earlier stage, I think it might have been possible to arrive at an arrangement which would have rendered the introduction of this Bill unnecessary. To that extent there is justification for theaction of the Government in bringing it forward at this stage of the session. I regret, however, that any temporary expedient to meet an urgent claim should lessen the momentum behind the movement to put our finances in order. In my view, the position would be met-assumin g that it is absolutely necessary to pass this Bill - if the Government inserted in it a clause which would prevent it being brought into operation until the end of next year, thus allowing an opportunity during the interval to put our finances straight. We could To my mind, the measure opens the door to a most mischievous systemi of public finance. A system of ear-marking certain duties for certain purposes is one which must result in great inconvenience, and will be mischievous in many ways. In speaking upon the Budget, f alluded to some of these. For instance, honourable members talk of imposing a duty upon tea and kerosene for the purpose of raising funds with which to pay old-age pensions. But, if this Bill be passed, and the proposed amendment of the Constitution be sanctioned by the electors, a furious speculation will immediately set in in respect of the articles which are likely to be taxed. emThe result will be that, for twelve or - eighteen months, or perhaps for two years, very little revenue will be derived from the taxation of those articles.",26

103,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that it would be very difficult to do so. I do not know ment. that £1,500,000 is required for the purpose of paying old-age pensions. Of course, a great deal depends upon the sysous ? tem that we adopt.

105,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Possibly, when we silently. come to deal with the question, we may discover some better means of raising the necessary funds with which to pay these pensions. But, assuming that £1,500,000 annually is required for that purpose, hold that it will be difficult to raise amount through the Customs. What will happen? If there be a deficiency, methods of taxation will have to be desection, vised. If , on the other hand, a larger amount is raised than we require, the dency will be to increase the amount the pensions, in order to absorb it. Convarious sequently, when a period of reaction experienced, we shall once more find selves short of funds. To my mind, the plan of ear-marking duties for specific purposes is a mischievous one.

They would not have to sufof fer, and the States now expending in other directions what they derive is from the Commonwealth, would have to ourprovide out of their ordinary revenue a large sum for this purpose. In that way the position would be equalized. At the same time, I think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie must recognise that his scheme is impracticable. It would serve to embitter the strife in connection with partithis matter, and would probably lead to It the proposed amendment of the Constituthe tion being negatived. While I feel that the Government have a justification for their proposal, I should like to have from them an assurance that every effort will be made the next few months to secure the on settlement of the larger financial questions in relation to the Braddon section.",27
112,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",27
113,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like the Prime Minister to give us some sort of guarantee that if the Constitution be amended as proposed, advantage will not be taken of it for a reasonable time, but that an opporwill be first afforded for the settleof the larger financial question relata ing to the operation of the Braddon section.",27
114,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member really think that the adoption of our proposal would impede the settlement of that question? I do not think that it would.,28
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-If the larger question were settled, the necessity for this amendment of the Constitution would be obviated.",28
116,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta. We know that there is an irresistible tendency on the part of politiciansto follow the line of least resistance. If provision be made in this way for the payment of old-age pensions, the desire to secure a settlement of the larger financial question will not be as strong as it is today.",28
117,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that the desire for a settlement of the larger question would be reduced. There are many other motives for desiring its settlement.,28
118,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I agree with the honourable and learned gentleman that there are other motives.,28
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But if the payment of old-age pensions were contingent upon the settlement of the main question, it would be a great incentive to the solving of the financial problem.",28
120,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainly . If we could provide that advantage should not be taken of the proposed amendment of the Constitution if , within a period to be namedsay, twelve months or eighteen months hence- a settlement were arrived at in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States,"" I think that it would be well to do so. I do not know whether we could embody .such a condition in the Bill.",28
121,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We could not make any such promise. It is a matter which would rest with the next Parliament.,28
122,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We might tie the hands of the next Parliament. If the people decided that the proposed amendment of the Constitution should not be availed of until the expiration of twelve or eighteen months, so as to enable provision to be made in another way for the payment of old-age pensions, the hands of the next Parliament would be bound.",28
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Prime Minister has already .said that if the proposed amendment of the Constitution be agreed to, he will regard it as a mandate from the people that old-age pensions should be provided for oni these lines. Constitution [REPRESENTATIVES.] Alteration",28
124,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the people adopt our proposal.,28
125,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The only difference between the Prime Minister and myself is that whilst he desires this amendment of the Constitution as a mean^ of overcoming a difficulty I , on the other hand, whilst admitting the difficulty of his position, object to the difficulty being overcome in that way. I do not knjow whether the suggestion I have made could be embodied in the Bill . If we could still further impress upon the States in this way the necessity for a settlement of the financial problem, I should have no objection to the Bill . If my proposal were adopted it would mean that the amendment of the Constitution would remain a dead letter for twelve or eighteen months, .and that if by the end of that time the financial problem were not settled, advantage could be taken of it I know that the Prime Minister cannot bind the next Parliament by anything he may say, but if he could give us an assurance that effect would not immediately be given to the amendment of the Constitution-that it would be kept back in some way-w e might be able to secure the object that I have in view.",28
126,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think that it could be kept hack. As has been pointed out, the prospect of disposinjg of this, and a number of other questions of much importance, such as is afforded by the complete settlement of the financial issue is, to my mind, one of the greatest subjects that will be operating in. politics in the next Parliament. The Braddon section expires at the end of 1910, so that we are bound to face the situation then.",28
127,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable and learned gentleman knows my view on the general question.,28
128,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And am in sympathy with it.,28
129,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that on the lines I have suggested we could overcome all these difficulties, and place our finances once and for all in such a position that the Braddon section would either be superseded or become inoperative. If that were done, special legislation of this kind would be unnecessary. I rose merely because I desired to explain mv position. I regret that the Bill is necessary, biit admit at the same time that the Government have justification for its introduction.",28
130,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Boothby) [4.22J The honourable member for Mernda has urged that the passing of this Bill will probably delay a re-adjustment of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth.,28
131,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that it will.,29
132,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m the point of view put by the honourable member that, if we removed one of the difficulties",29
133,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y temporarily.,29
134,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we removed only temporarily one of the difficulties in relation to the financial question with which the States are confronted, we should at the same time remove one of the incentives to pressing forward the complete adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. At the same time, I think that the honourable member will admit that if we had to wait until the necessary change in those relations had been effected, we should indefinitely postpone the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions.",29
135,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should like to provide that there shall not be a delay of more than a year.,29
136,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I question very much whether we could, in the space of a year, settle all the questions now in dispute in relation to the financial problem.",29
137,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If they were not settled within twelve months the Bill would become operative.,29
138,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I confess that I do not like the honourable member's suggestion. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney spoke very strongly in favour of the imposition of direct taxation to provide for old-age pensions. There is much to be said in favour of such a proposal, and I am not at all sure that if I thought there was a possibility of carrying it out I should not vote for it in preference to any other method that could be proposed for raising the necessary funds. But no such proposal is before us. Neither the Bill , as introduced by the Government, nor as proposed to be amended by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, would involve direct taxation on. the part of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Fremantle showed what would be the effect on Western Australia of the amendment.",29
139,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He expressed his view of what its effect would be.,29
140,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think that any one will deny that South Australia is placed in an even more difficult position. It would have to provide about £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum for old-age pensions.",29
141,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the Tasmanian calculation is £ 1 3 6 , 0 0 0 per annum.",29
142,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth would return to the Treasurer of South Australia £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum less than it is now doing. That would be a serious reduction.",29
143,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be from the point of view of a few of the landlords of South Australia.,29
144,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member knows very well that South Australia imposes more direct taxation than does any other State.,29
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No . Tasmania beats South Australia by about 6d. per head of the population.,29
146,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Australia has far more direct taxation than has New South Wales. She imposes a heavy income tax, stamp duties, a receipt tax, ah absentee tax, a progressive land tax, and also an all-round land tax-the only one of its kind in the Commonwealth.",29
147,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who pay the Customs duties ?,29
148,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We know very well that Customs taxation falls more heavily upon those having laree families.,29
149,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And under this Bill the position of such people would be worse than it is.,29
150,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The amendment moved by the honourable member proposes that we shall provide for old-age pensions out of the proportion of Customs and Excise revenue that we now return to the States. It certainly does not mean that the Commonwealth itself shall finance thesvstem. If we are going to pay old-agepensions, it is our duty to provide thenecessary funds. If we think it right that direct taxation should be imposed for that purpose, it is our duty to impose it , and not, as proposed by the honourable .member for Kalgoorlie, to throw upon the States the task of providing the requisite funds. Another point is that, if the Bill be amended as proposed, and is rejected by the people, old-age pensions will be delayed for a considerable time. The people have to deal with this question. We have to ask the people of South Australia, for instance, whether they are prepared, as proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, to forego something like £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum-late r on the cost to them wilt be £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum-o the revenue they now derive from the monwealth, whilst, on the other hand, continue to spend as much as upon our defence system and upon postal reforms.",29
151,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member seriously advance such a contention?,30
152,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I certainly do. bacco industry ? My objection to the amendment is that it will obviate the necessity on the part Commonwealth tb ^provide the necessary funds. We may spend nearly £1,000,000 per annum on defence",30
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We should be able, under the amendment, to expend the whole of our one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue, and, at the same time, to provide for old-age pensions out of the three-fourths now returned to the States.",30
154,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We could not go beyond our one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue. The honourable member said we could spend as much as we pleased.,30
155,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We could continue to spend what we pleased. The Treasurer could come down next year with another proposal to increase our expenditure by £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. We can take over more Departments, and provide, as we do in regard to Departments already taken over, no better, though a more costly, serhonorable vice than that provided by the States. attach to the Commonwealth old-age penpensions sions scheme the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will mean its rejecthe tion in South Australia.",30
156,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think so badly of the democracy of South Australia.,30
157,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When one wishes the people to adopt a proposal, he does not load it with unpopular conditions ; that is what is being done in this case. I should not be afraid to advocate the position of direct taxation to provide an old-age pensions fund if I thought that course desirable.",30
158,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable memtion ber in favour of the Government protion posal ?,30
159,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is certainly letter than that of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. If we defeat it , we have to impose, direct taxation to provide the monev necessary for an ol'd-age pensions fund.",30
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not necessarily.,30
161,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That seems to me f the alternative, though, of course, some Comsavings might be made. I should like to we know if the honourable member can sugwe please gest another scheme.",30
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that some other course could be taken.,30
163,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not provide the necessary money by nationalizing the to,30
164,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The proposal of of the the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is bound to be defeated, because the politicians of the States and the newspapers will be against it . In South Australia the majority of the members of both Houses, although in favour of old-age pensions, would oppose the reduction of the amount returnable to the State by the Commonwealth. I know that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to establish a Commonwealthold-age pensions fund.",30
165,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes ; but I do not desire that those who have the biggest families shall pay the most.,30
166,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's proposal will not achieve what he has in view. If we have to wait for a Commonwealth old-age pensions system until his proposal is carried into effect, we shall have to wait for a very long time.",30
167,Mr KNOX,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) [4.35] - If any member desires to defeat the esTo tablishment of a Commonwealth old-age system, the best thing he can do is to support the amendment. I concur in view that the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will be resisted by the members of the States Legislatures, who will be sure to object to the diminution of their receipts under the Braddon section. In my opinion, we might very properly wait until there can be a but proper adjustment and settlement of the whole financial position before dealing with imthis matter. There is no extreme urgencyin the first place, because old-age pensions are already provided by the States of New South Wales and Victoria, whose populanumbers three-fourths of the populaof the Commonwealth; and, in the second place, because the Parliaments of the other States could provide old-age pensions for those whom they represent if the shall public wished them to do so. But I am anxious that, at the proper time, and in the proper way, a broad and well-defined scheme shall be adopted for the payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth. The question is not .to be lightly dealt with, its consideration being complicated by the fact that the conditions of the States differ widely. While we are all in favour of the principle of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, we must give a great deal of attention to the details of any scheme propounded for its establishment. I agree with the honourable member for Mernda that we may be forced to accept the proposal .of the Government as the best put forward; but I think that some provision should be made as to the date on which the Bill shall take effect. It is manifest that the ""Governments of the States are awakening to the need for dealing unitedly with the financial position of the States and of the Commonwealth. It is clear, from letters which I received last week front two of the State Premiers to whom I had submitted my views on the subject, that they are determined that it shall be deaJt with. But the great questions involved in the consideration of the financial position cannot properly be dealt with in any piecemeal fashion. I think that the Governments of the States will resent the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to reduce their share of the Customs and Excise revenue. They may take it as a_threat on the part of the Commonwealth to the effect that, if they do not provide old-age pensions for their people, we shall take the matter into our hands, and provide for therm out of the revenue returnable to them. I do not hold the view that all the powers conferred upon the Commonwealth by the thirty-nine articles of section 51 of the Constitution are to be put into operation at once, and to be construed so as to make them as far-reaching as possible, and in fa,vour of the Commonwealth as against the States. We shall do best if we co-operate with the States in regard to all matters such as this. We hear about the extravagance of the States, but there may also be extravagance in Commonwealth administration. In any case, the people of Australia have to bear the burden of unwise expenditure. may be compelled to vote for the Bill as it stands. I think that sufficient advantage has not been taken of the power of conferring with the States in this matter. I shall certainly vote against' the amendment; because we have no right to coerce the States; and I regret, for the reasons I have stated, that, without any request from the States, or any expression of desire on the part of the people, we are now unnecessarily moving in this matter. I agree that, if the present opportunity is not taken, it may not be convenient to refer the question to the electors for another three years, but I think that nothing would be lost by even so long ai delay as that, and that the consideration of the subject might well be deferred until the financial position of the States and the Commonwealth can be effectively considered and dealt with. I hold myself free to vote against the Bill.",30
168,Mr SOLMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Laanecoorie) [4.45] - It seems to me that the honourable member for Boothby has furnished the strongest argument against the adoption of the amendment. It needs only a cursory examination to show that it would result in an evasion o. responsibility by the Commonwealth. <: We should place upon the States the necessity of finding the money required for the payment of old-age pensions. The amendment provides not only that the necessary money shall be deducted from the present Customs revenue, but that it shall be the first charge upon such revenue.",31
169,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is under a misapprehension. The amendment is proposed to be inserted after the word expenditure,"" and not after the word ""-Excise.""",31
170,Mr SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The amended amendment placed in my hands by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie certainly puts an altered complexion on the matter. Now it appears that it is proposed that the .whole amount necessary to provide for old age pensions shall be taken out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue that is now returnable to the States. If that course were adopted, the Commonwealth would not be called upon to pay its share of the expense. If the Constitution were altered in the direction proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, it would be a very serious matter for the States, and more particularly for the smaller States. According to the figures furnished by the Prime Minister, Tasmania, would have to While I contribute an additional £ 6 0 . 0 0 0 ; Western Australia, £ 8 5 , 0 0 0 ; South Australia, £ 1 3 6 , 0 0 0 ; and Queensland, £ 1 8 6 , 0 0 0 . I do not think that the Treasurers of those States could view such a contingency with equanimity. I am glad to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong with regard to the improved feeling which now exists between the States and the Commonwealth Governments. A great change for the better has taken place, and we are all very glad that the friction which existed for a considerable time, and for which there was no necessity, is, under the exercise of mutual consideration, gradually disappearing. Such a proposal as that now before us would not, however, be calculated to make the position any better, because the States Treasurers would be at their wits' end to make good the deficiency brought about in their revenue. A measure of rhis kind should not be used as a weapon with which to strike a blow at the States. One honourable member has stated plainly that he hoped the effect of carrying the amendment would be to force the States to resort to direct taxation. It is not our duty to interfere in anv way with the management of States affairs. That is one of tnt reasons why I have always opposed the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth. I am averse to our resorting to direct taxation, except under the stress of some great national emergency.",31
171,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Eve n to provide for an old-age pensions scheme?,32
172,Mr SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A very good system of old-age pensions was provided for when I was a member of the Victorian Legislature.,32
173,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Victorian pension at the present time is merely a pauper dole.,32
174,Mr SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not prepared to defend the reduction that has been made in the amount of the pension since the time of which I speak. But I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not opposed to old-age pensions, nor to direct taxation under certain conditions. In Victoria, age pensions were, in the first instance, provided for by direct taxation. I think that under present circumstances, the only way in which we can provide for a national scheme of old-age pensions is by adopting the Government proposal.",32
175,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is the whole £1.500,000 to be raised by imposing addito tional duties?",32
176,Mr SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All the funds required would be raised from Customs and Excise. The States which now provide for old-age pensions would not be entirely relieved of their responsibility, and would, therefore, be called upon to give us something.",32
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But could we raise £1,500,000 by imposing special duties?",32
178,Mr SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I presume that tihe to Government will at the proper time bring down adequate ^-oposals. We are now dealing merely with the question of amending the Constitution in order to empower the Government to make the necessary proposals. The method of raising the necessary funds will have to be decided by those wlho are responsible.,32
179,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is after consulting the electors.,32
180,Mr SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . I trust that the Committee will not agree to the amendment, because I believe that it will have the effect of indefinitely postponing the adoption of a national scheme of old-age pensions. I think tihat we all desire to see some equitable and uniform system established, and I believe that that result could best be brought about by passing the Bill in its present form.",32
181,Mr CULFIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Brisbane) [4.55] - The B511 before us is a short and simple measure, but I wish that it had been presented in is different form. I should like to be in a position to support the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but, in view of the fact that three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue is practically ear-marked for the use of the States, and is really their property, I do not see how we could very well make an inroad on it in the manner suggested. The States have legitimate uses to which to devote their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, and we should not be justified in withholding it from them except we apply it towards the payment of interest on the States' debts that may be taken over oldby us. I am very sorry that the measure dealing with the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth was not considered before this Bill , because it seems to me that if that matter had been first dealt witfh the amendment now proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would not have been submitted. It would not be fair to the States to call upon them make good the whole of the deficiency that would be created if old-age pensions were provided for out of the present Customs and Excise revenue. I see no reason why the necessary funds should not be raised by means of direct taxation. I shall vote for the Bill, because I regard if as an earnest of the desire of the Government to how provide for old-age pensions, but I cannot refrain from expressing the hope that the next Parliament will have the courage provide the necessary funds, if it has to be done by levying direct taxation..",32
182,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,North Sydney) [4-58] - The Government proposal seems to me to be defective in several respects.,33
183,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Can the honourable member suggest a better?,33
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not my place to do so. I am always quite willing to give the Government the benefit of any suggestions that occur to me, but, unfortunately, they do not often accept them. In connection with a previous debate I - pointed put that the Government were neglecting the opportunity presented to them to deal with this matter much more effectively than by treating it in an isolated manner. I suggested that provision for the payment of old-age pensions should be made in connection with the settlement of the grave financial questions which must, within a very short time, engage our attention.",33
185,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How long would that take ? ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - If the proposals were reasonable, it should not take long.",33
186,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are seven parties to anv such agreement.,33
187,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It must be remembered that to some extent tihose parties will have to give their assent to the Government proposal.,33
188,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,W it h in the next three vears.,33
189,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Governments of the larger States oppose the Ministerial proposal, I fear that the majority of the electors necessary to secure an alteration of the Constitution will not be forthcoming. Another objection which I entertain to this Bill is that it indicates the intention of the Ministrv to Taise by means of additional Customs duties .at least £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. They are already committed to a policy of increased protection which must result in a reduction in the amount derived from the Customs. Consequently, I am compelled to conclude tlhat they will not be able to raise the funds with which to pay old-age pensions from that source, and they will be compelled to resort to direct taxation. So dissatisfied am I with that position that I would rather support the amendment of the ihonorable member for Kalgoorlie than the Government proposal. The Government policy of increasing the protective character of the Tariff will compel them to resort to direct taxation for the purpose of raising the £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 required to pay old-age pensions, whereas the amendment will at the most, compel the States Governments to adopt that form of taxation. Personally I would rather leave direct taxation to the States, especially in view of the fact that we already raise a great deal more revenue than we require for our own purposes. Bur I do not think tihat either the Government proposal or the amendment really touches the root of the question. I would further point out"" that if the States Ministries are not satisfied with the proposal of the Government they can go a long wav towards defeating the proposed amendment of the Constitution at the polls. If in two of the States in which old-age pensions are at present being paid, the Governments oppose the proposal of the Commonwealth Government, they can do a very great deal to prevent a majority of the electors throughout the Commonwealth voting in favour of it.",33
190,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does not that argument apply with greater force to the amendment? Would not the States Governments oppose that even more strenuously ?,33
191,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They would oppose it quite as strenuously. I am not in favour either of the Government proposal or of the amendment, but from my stand-point the amendment is preferable, inasmuch as it leaves to the States * Governments the resort to direct taxation, where that is necessary, for the purpose of raising the funds with which to pay old-age pensions. I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a few figures which seem to indicate"" that if the bookkeeping' provisions of tihe Constitution had been tackled seriously, it would have - greatly facilitated the settlement of the question of old-age pensions. If - and I put the figures as an example only-instea d of proposing to return to the States £ 6 , 9 4 9 , 000 during the current financial year, it had been proposed to return to tfhem only their actual, three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, the Commonwealth would have had an additional sum of £ 3 1 1 , 0 0 0 available for its own purposes to go towards the initiation of a national system of old-age pensions? The effect would be, as compared with the Treasurer's proposed distribution for 1906-7, that New South Wales would lose £403,000. and Victoria £ 9 4 , 0 0 0, whereas Queensland would gain £ 7 6 , 0 0 0.",33
192,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the bookkeeping system were abolished?,34
193,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am speaking of what would happen under a - per capita distribution of expenditure in lieu of the existing bookkeeping system. Under a per capita distribution, instead of £6,949,000 being returned to the States, the amount returnable to them for 1906-7 would be £6,638,000, which is their exact three-fourths of the estimated revenue. The effect of that would be that New South Wales would lose £403,000, and Victoria £94,000, whereas Queensland would gain £76,000, South Australia £80,000, and Tasmania £53JOOO, whilst Western Australia, with a special allowance of £338,000, would lose £23,000.",34
194,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wester n Australia would then occupy the position of the poor relation.,34
195,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No more than she has under the operation of her special Tariff. We should be merely saying to her "" We will not continue the troublesome bookkeeping system and your special Tariff, but we will make you an allowance for your higher revenue per head in a lump sum."" If , in connection with that arrangement, an old age pension system were adopted, it would mean that whilst the Treasurer of New South ""Wales would lose £403,000 in one direction, he would be relieved of the ob' ligation to pay £508,000, which is now absorbed by old-age pensions. As a matter of bookkeeping, therefore, he would gain about £114,000. Similaily, whilst the Victorian Treasurer would lose £94,000, he would be relieved of the payment of £208,000. Thus, there is an opportunity presented to secure what is very desirable, namely, the adoption of the per capita system, with advantage to those States whose finances are at present strained, and with no injury to the finances of the Treasurers of New South Wales and Victoria. This is the best opportunity that we shall ever have to secure the adoption of that system of distributing, expenditure, the abandonment of the bookkeeping system, and the initiation of a Federal system of old-age pensions.",34
196,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is there any reason to suppose that the States Governments would accept that proposal?,34
197,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The great fear of the States is that if the Braddon section be not continued, the whole of their revenue may disappear.",34
198,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no danger of that.,34
199,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no danger that the whole of it will disappear, but there is a risk that a considerable portion of it may do so. If an arrangement were made in respect of the Braddon section of the Constitution, and if the States were guaranteed the payment of interest upon their debts to the full amount of £6,638,000 annually, I believe that they would agree to the plan which I have outlined.",34
200,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was not the mood of the States Premiers at the last Conference.,34
201,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then they will oppose the Government proposal, and if the New South Wales and Victorian Governments do that, great difficulty will be experienced in carrying it.",34
202,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The claim made by them was that, if ai fixed sum were agreed upon, a sufficient amount would not be returned 1 to them) in respect of any future increases of revenue. They desired that we should return for all time three-fourths of the revenue of Customs and Excise.",34
203,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There would probably be an increase of revenue; but, as against that, we would incur increased expenditure in respect of new Departments taken over by the Commonwealth, whilst the increasing population would make increased demands upon our expenditure. Then, again, there would be the gradual conversion of the debts over and above those on which interest would be at once guaranteed, and the transfer to the Commonwealth"", of the liability in respect of the interest on it, and on the debt to be gradually assumed for the transferred properties. In this way, I think that perfect security would be given to the States in respect of any increased revenue that the Commonwealth might derive. The Commonwealth itself might in bad years find it very difficult to make its revenue meet its expenditure. I fail to see why the States should reject a complete scheme, in view of the fact that the Braddon section will soon expire. I cannot conceive that they - would not be prepared to give a complete scheme fair consideration, more especially as it might enable them to overcome their difficulties in regard to the demand in their own States for old-age pensions. I am inclined to think that they would adopt it.",34
204,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I wish I could agree with the honourable member.,35
205,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They have not been tested. As regards the transferred properties, I previously proposed that the debt in respect of those properties should be converted as it fell due at the rate of £1,000,000per annum. would involve an additional payment for interest to the extent of £35,006 per ani i urn.",35
206,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That specific proposal was not made to the Premiers at the Sydney Conference, but they appeared to close the door against all such propositions.",35
207,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Several not important proposals were not considered to be continued in perpetuity. during the negotiations at the Sydney ference. Then we have to remember the pressure now being brought to bear on Governments of the States in which oldtherefore age pensions are not paid for the institumeans of settling the difficulty. tion of the system. The Governments say they favour old-age pensions, but) they cannot see how it would be possible them to provide for them. Turning to financial aspect of their provision by Commonwealth, if , instead of the Treasecure surer's proposal, three-fourths of the toms and Excise revenue were returned this year to the States on a per capita distribureasonable tion, an additional sum of £311,000 would remain at the disposal of the Commontions wealth. Then, again, by means of reducvery tions in the Estimates, and also as the sult of unexpended votes, a further sum £300,000 could be secured. rejection of the proposal to adopt penny postage we should save another £209,000, making a total of £820,000 for a year. That would mean that only £680,000 would have to be provided by new duties - and I do not suggest that they should be ear-marked- to provide for a Federal system of old-age pensions.",35
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And we might properly ask the States fo join with us considering the best means of raising amount.,35
209,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They would keep considering.,35
210,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The hondustries orable member must not forget that operation of the Braddon section will expire.,35
211,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Fou r years hence.,35
212,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite so. view There are other questions which the would be glad to have settled.,35
213,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The majority of the States' Premiers are in favour of the extension of the Braddon section in F e r _ petuity.,35
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am aware of that, but I think that what they really desire is to obtain security in respect That of their finances.",35
215,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of them demand that the Braddon section shall be continued in perpetuity.,35
216,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But this, ' is one of those questions on which our views have to be modified when we proceed to talk business. The States Premiers could reasonably expect the Braddon section Every ConState Treasurer knows very well that from the stand-point of the Commonwealth, that the would be quite impossible, and they must be ready to arrive at some other Their anxiety is perfectly natural. If any honourable member of this House were Treasurer for of a State, and dependent upon another the Government for a large proportion of his the revenue, he would be very anxious to be in respect of that revenue. We can Cusmake no complaint regarding such anxiety; but if the States' Treasurers refuse all offers-especiall y an offer covering the determination of many of the queswhich must be settled- I shall be much surprised. I feel sure that they rewould not be so unreasonable as to refuse of to fairly consider an offer involving the By the settlement of many matters which must be dealt with, and which would also dispose of their difficulties in regard to old-age pensions, and secure to them a sufficient return for the F yment of interest on their a debt. The position of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth would be very different from what it is if he had to raise for old age pensions only £680,000 instead of very £1,500,000 by means of Customs duties. in It is quite impossible for us to ear-mark that a number of duties sufficient to raise £1,500,000 per annum, and at the same on time to maintain the free-list necessary to meet the requirements of our inand our people. If , in adthe dition to that difficulty, we are to soon have the increased protection foreshadowed by the Ministry, a dangerous financial position will be looming up. For these reasons, I am extremely sorry that a broader of these financial considerations has States not been taken. The settlement of some of them would assist the settlement of others. A - per capita distribution in lieu of the bookkeeping system would assist largely to remove the difficulty in regard to old-age pensions. The figures I have quoted as to the position of the hardpressed States show that old-age pensions .and a per capita distribution are' complementary to each other.",35
217,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is allowing for a special arrangement in the case of Western: Australia?,36
218,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am.' Undoubtedly, the population of Western Australia will, as years go by, approach nearer and nearer to the. level of that of the other States, and I propose that for fen or fifteen years we should make her a special and gradually decreasing allowance.",36
219,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Did the honourable .member, in making his calculation as to the total of £ 8 2 0 , 0 0 0 , allow for that special grant?",36
220,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I took the larger payment.,36
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Any reduction would be in our favour ,36
222,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would.,36
223,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But did the member take into account that special allowance in respect of succeeding years, in which there will be fresh) Federal services to provide for?",36
224,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The total of -£820,000 is the amount that would be available in the one year. Under a per capita system such as I propose, Western Australia would hare in that year £ 3 3 8 , 0 0 0 returned to her as a special allowance in substitution of the local Tariff.",36
225,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did the honourable member fix on that amount?,36
226,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because it would practically raise her revenue up to that which she now receives.,36
227,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There would be no hope of the larger States agreeing to the honourable member's proposal.,36
228,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would they object to that which would be better from the stand-point of their Treasurers?,36
229,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The true Federal spirit would then arise.,36
230,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Usuall y the accusation against those States is that they demand too much; but the honourable member for Wide Bay is now suggesting that they would refuse to accept something that would improve their position.,36
231,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member showed the taxpayers a means of saving 2d. by an expenditure of 4d., they would be on his side.",36
232,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At any rate, my proposal would relieve the Treasurers of New South Wales and Victoria of very large payments in respect of old-age pensions. Why should they object to such an arrangement?",36
233,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will admit that, provided the States agreed to his scheme, a considerable sum would still have to be raised by the Commonwealth.",36
234,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already pointed out that if the £<;i 1,000 over and above the three-fourths now returnable to them were retained, and certain savings were effected, the Commonwealth would have to raise only £680,000.",36
235,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that the two larger States would agree to his proposal ?,36
236,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In what way would they be worse off?,36
237,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They would still have to honourable pay their share of the £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",36
238,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In addition to continuing to pay the amount which they are now paying.,36
239,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's remarks show how wrong are the ideas in regard to this matter, if it is thought we can increase expenditure without increasing the charges on the people. How can the Commonweailth incur an extra expenditure of £750,000-whic h will have to be incurred, allowing for the expenditure in New South Wales and Victoriawithout raising £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 more revenue? It cannot do it. That amount of extra revenue must be raised, and to raise it the people must pay more taxation. But why should the Treasurer of a State which is now paying £508,000 in old-age pensions object to a proposal on the part of the Commonwealth to take £ 4 0 8 , 0 0 0 from the Customs and Excise now returnable, and meet all liabilities in connection with old-age pensions. If old-age pensions be provided throughout the Commonwealth, the citizens of the States will have to pay their proportion of any increase of taxation thereby rendered necessary.",36
240,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why do the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria object to handing over to the Commonwealth the money which they now pay in old-age pensions, allowing the Commonwealth to take all responsibility in the matter?",36
241,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If they handed over that money to the Commonwealth, they would still have to pay their share of the cost of providing old-age pensions for the people of the other States.",37
242,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not necessarily.,37
243,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unless States the other States handed over equivalent amounts. I ami sorry that neither of the proposals before the Committeefindsfavour with me. We might have gone further and have done better. I still hope that, if the Government obtain authority from Parliathe ment to ear-mark revenue, they will enspend the money. deavour to make a wiser settlement than has yet been put forward. My examinathat. tion of the figures leads me to think that this is one of the most favourable opportubers nities which they are likely to have for effecting that purpose. Mr 'FISHER (Wide Bay) [5-35]--The honourable member for North Sydney has propounded a very elaborate scheme dealnot ing with the improvements which could be effected in Federal finance by a rearrangelishment ment of the bookkeeping system.",37
244,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,B y a combination of arrangements.,37
245,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member, as is usual with him.', dealt with the matter in very plain and definite language, and have no fault to find with his scheme; but the provision of a Commonwealth old-age pension system is urgent, and must be fected without delay.",37
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is it more urgent now than it has been at any time during the last five or six years?,37
247,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The removal of an inThe justice is always urgent, and injustice now being suffered by the old people in the various States which do not old-age pensions.",37
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who is responsible for that injustice?,37
249,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member, for it. myself, and other members of the Parliament, who, although we have obtained the votes of the people on the plea that we in favour of a Commonwealth old-age sion system, have done nothing to establish it.",37
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y one-third of the people of the Commonwealth are withposed out an old-age pensions system.,37
251,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the whole trouble. If New South Wales and Victoria, had not provided old-age pensions for their people prior to Federation, the Commonwealth would have established a national scheme before this.",37
252,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The financial system under the Braddon section would have been the same.,37
253,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurers of the declare that never was the community more prosperous, nor the value of production for individuals so high. But when Parliament is asked to provide old age pensions we are met with the objection 1 that there is a constitutional difficulty in way, and that we cannot afford to",37
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No one has said,37
255,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some honourable memput every barrier in the way of the adoption of an old-age pensions scheme, which amounts to the same thing.",37
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member practically contends that whoever is ready to vote for any scheme proposed must necessarily be opposed to the estabof a Commonwealth old-age pensions system.,37
257,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . The reflection which I have cast falls upon all members alike. The position is that the intelligence of this Parliament has not yet been able I to evolve a scheme which will allow justice to be done. If , after receiving a mandate from the people, we cannot do this, efwe should not retain our positions. One of our first duties after providing for the administration of justice is to establish a pension fund for the aged people who have helped to build up this great country. States federated, knowing that twois thirds of the people of the Commonwealth possessed old-age pension schemes/ while provide the other third did not.",37
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Federal Parliament did not create the anomaly, and therefore should not be held responsible",37
259,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Maitland manifesto stated that a matter of political urgency are was the establishment of a Commonwealth pensystem of old-age pensions, and evensimilar manifesto since issued has repeated that declaration.. No candidate will be returned at the next election who is opto the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system.",37
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not opposed to it.,38
261,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have reached the stage when we must ,get beyond what I was going to characterize as the mere hypocritical expression of our adhesion to the principle; we must provide a practical means of giving Commonwealth old-age pensions. The Government in power must put forward a scheme for the payment of old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth, and take full responsibility for it. It is only in this wav that the matter will be satisfactorily dealt with. If a. number of big - financial corporations were in the predicament of the old people in some of the States, the reform necessary to remedy their grievance would have been passed long since. Parliament should not continue session after session to do nothing in this matter. But while the injustice being suffered by big corporations would be voiced in every newspaper, and spoken of from every platform, the old people of the Commonwealth can only whisper in their homes, or remain silent while nothing is being done. The Government have now come forward with a scheme which, although it is not such as I quite approve of, should not be subjected to a microscopical examination. There must be a difference of opinion as to what is the best thing to do. Whether the Government scheme is the better with or without the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is a question upon which the people mav well be asked to give their opinion. What is proposed is a direct appeal to the people. The electors will be asked whether they are in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, and, if they are, they will vote for the proposed alteration of the Constitution.",38
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No scheme has been submitted.,38
263,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the proposed alteration of the Constitution were sanctioned, the Government would propose the of special duties to obtain the revenue necessary to provide Federal old-age pensions.",38
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If they can.,38
265,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No Government is incapable of doine so should remain in office.,38
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My position is that the amount necessary cannot be raised tend through the Customs.,38
267,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a matter of opinion, not a matter of policy. If the necessary money is not obtained by special duties, more money will have to be obtained by other means. But justice must be done to the aged poor of Australia. There is something in the statement of the Prime Minister that, when the Constitution Bill was before the people of Australia, it was understood that the Braddon section would continue in operation for about ten years, and that it was upon this understanding that the States Parliaments agreed to the Constitution ; but the objection that it will not be necessary to obtain the consent of all the States in order to effect an amendment of the Constitution is, after all, largely of a sentimental character. If it were proposed to make some change in the Constitution without consulting the people, the position would be entirely different. Although we passed the Constitution only a few years ago, it is very much like the grasp of a dead hand. New people have grown up and new ideas-mor e enlightened ones, I hope-no w prevail. The object of the amendment is merely to remove an injustice, and to assist those who cannot help themselves. It is not proposed to give one State an advantage over another. The amendment seems to me to present the only way in which we can do justice to those who are least able to help themselves, and I dare say that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would be prepared to put his amendment to the test of the approval of all the States, instead of only a majority of them. If that course were adopted, we should ascertain the true feeling of the people with regard tp the payment of old age pensions. The proposal need be defeated in only one of the larger States in order to bring about its rejection, because it would be a very difficult matter to secure the support of the majority of the neoole in the smaller States if one of the larger States were opposed to the scheme.",38
268,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thar , would depend upon raising the largeness of the majority.",38
269,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not likely that the majority of the people in the more populous States would vote in favour of increasing direct taxation whilst the Treasurers had which large surpluses in hand.,38
270,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Althoug h it might seem that the amendment would operate against the interests of Queensland, I into vote for it, because I think that, if the proposal is viewed in its proper light, it will meet with the, acceptance of the people. I know that the States' Treasurers have had great difficulties to contend with in the past, but we must not forget that we are entering upon a period of prosperity. The States' revenues are increasing, and, I trust, will continue to do so. The payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth would relieve every State to a certain extent of direct financial responsibilities, and would inevitably have the effect of increasing industry, and thereby adding to the prosperity of the community. It is a singular thing that those States which have provided for old-age pensions are the most prosperous.",38
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that the honourable member could establish the connection between the two circumstances.,39
272,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not say that the prosperity has been directly due to the provision made for old-age pensions, but I could show plainly how general prosperity is contributed to when the State makes provision for the proper treatment of the aged and infirm poor. The responsibility of providing for those who cannot help themselves f all in a large degree upon our s very best citizens. It is not borne equally by all those who might reasonably be called upon to bear a share of the cost, but the whole burden falls upon the shoulders of those whose energies and enterprise should, in the interestg of the whole community, be free from any restraining influence. Under such conditions the community, as well as individuals, suffers. That is the reason why it should be one of our principal objects to see that the most deserving and valuable members of the community are not unduly burdened. A . scheme of old-age pensions would adi'ust matters equitably, and would throw some share of the burden of maintaining the aged poor and infirm upon those who, at present, do not discharge their legal and moral responsibilities. The States which, according to the Treasurer's statement, claim to be the most prosperous, have, so far, failed to provide for old-age pensions. The Treasurers who claim that their States contribute more revenue per head of the-population than do others protest that they cannot afford to provide for old-age pensions. There must be something radically wrong in such a condition of affairs. It is most regrettable to think that we cannot look with any prospect of success to anv f u r ther negotiation between the States and the Commonwealth with a view to arriving at a settlement of this much vexed question. We are told that every effort has been made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurers of the States, and that no satisfactory result has been arrived at. I understood the Prime Minister to say that the Premier and Treasurer of Queensland had no objection to the imposition of special duties with a view to provide for old-age pensions, but I have heard it rumoured recently that he is not prepared to consent to even that course being adopted.",39
273,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that Mr. Kidston objects to the proposed amendment of the Constitution, because it is not proposed to limit the powers of the Commonwealth to providing for old-age pensions only. He argues that the authority to levy special duties might be used for other purposes. He also thinks that any amendment of this kind would involve some risk of further interference with the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue returnable to the States.",39
274,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certain risks have to be taken in getting in or out of bed, but we cannot very well avoid incurring them. It is singular that trouble always arises in regard to any proposal for an old-age pension scheme. Although it may be said that the whole of the States in which no provision is now made for the payment of old age pensions are agreeable to the Government proposal, no steps have been faken to induce such States to agree to contribute out of their present revenue the amount necessary to meet the expenditure in connection with the proposed scheme.",39
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hav e not the States Premiers, as well as the Federal Parliament, some responsibility to the people?",39
276,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not complaining of what the States Premiers have done, but I am setting forth the facts so that the people may know exactly where they are. The same people who elect representatives to the States Parliaments also send representatives to this Parliament, and I wish them to understand that what we are aiming at, and what the States Governments also are aiming at, will involve the same amount of taxation whatever the way in which the question may be settled. It should be the obiect of the Government of every State in which no old-age pensions are provided for to bring about the adoption of a Federal scheme as soon as possible. Queensland would suffer no injustice if she were called upon to provide out of her revenue for the payment of pensions to her deserving citizens. She cannot boast that she is a prosperous State if she denies her ability to provide for old-age pensions. Far too much, confusionhas existed with regard to the conflict of interests between the States and the Commonwealth. There is no conflict. The interests of the States and the Commonwealth are the same, and the sooner this is recognised the better. One would imagine from the way that some honourable members speak, that one State was living upon another. If we were believe half that' which we hear, we could come to no other conclusion than that every State was labouring under some disadvantage. But that cannot possibly be the case. I hope that we shall endeavour to dismiss all petty considerations from our discussion of matters of this kind. as I should like to support the Government proposal, I feel compelled to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, which I regard as more likely to prove acceptable. I admit that from the stand-point of some of the smaller States the amendment of the Constitution in the direction proposed by the honourable member would involve an encroachment upon the States revenues, but the proposed scheme cannot be carried out unless the people of Australia approve of it. If the electors decide against the amendment of the Constiution in the way proposed. I shall certainly do my best to induce the Government to adopt an old age pension .scheme, and call upon the Treasurer to find the means of carrying it into effect. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (Barker) shall [v58] - As a sincere friend of old-age pensions, I feel that I must support the Government proposal, and oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Kal goorlie. If that amendment were carried the effect would be to make the old-age pensions scheme extremely unpopular in South Australia, and place the State Treasurer in a most embarrassing position. The case of South Australia has been very well presented by the honourable member for Boothbv, and I need not enlarge upon his remarks. We have now a fairly drastic income tax, a local land tax. a State land tax. as well as a progressive land tax; and I do not see how the State Treasurer could raise the money to make i?ood the deficiency that would be created if the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie were carried into effect. As a member of the Old-age Pensions Commission, I tried to induce that body to recommend that the necessary funds should be provided by the Commonwealth. I was unsuccessful, and I am glad to have this opportunity to vote for the Government proposal, and thus it may be to give effect to mv original suggestion.",39
277,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hindmarsh) [6.0]. - I am sorry that I cannot support the proposal of the Government, which, I adto mit, is a practicable one so far as it relates to the raising of revenue with which to pay old-age pensions. My position is that I do not desire to see the people who are poor as the result of having been obliged to contribute so largely through the Customs compelled to find the money with Much which to pay these pensions. I admit that many of the recipients of old-age pensions are probably poor through improvidence, but the more improvident they have been, the more they have contributed through the Customs. Although I am a protectionist, I do not propose to add to their burdens.",40
278,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The argument of the other side is that, if all the people of Australia became teetotallers, the States Treasurers would be ruined.",40
279,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . I am sorry that I cannot support the amendment, inasmuch as it would throw upon the States the responsibility of providing the necessary funds with which to pay old-age pensions, and consequently they would say, "" Seeing that we are to provide the money, we will undertake the payment of the pensionb ourselves."" The intention of the present Government is that special duties be levied only for the purpose of paving old-age pensions. But Governments come and go.",40
280,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This Government remains.,40
281,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"D u r in g the short period that I have occupied a seat in this House, Governments have come and gone. What has happened before may happen again. Honourable members must recognise that the whole trouble experienced in connection with the initiation c f a national scheme of old-age pensions r,ori""<rs from the fear of additional land taxation. I admit that in South Australia, as compared with other States, land taxation is fairly heavy.",40
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In South Australia the direct taxation proposed amounts to 23s. ad. per head.,40
283,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nevertheless , I believe that that State can bear increased land taxation. I would point out that there are other States in which no land tax is operative. Personally, I think it would be a good thing if we had a uniform land tax throughout the Commonwealth. Then if we initiated a progressive income tax, without making the gradations particularly high, we should be in a position to remit some of the indirect taxation which is today levied upon the poorer classes of the community. Honourable members know that so soon as a labourer who is in receipt of perhaps 35s. per week has an extra mouth to feed he almost invariably has extra taxation thrust upon him. If - we are to impose additional taxation, it is time that we compelled the wealthy classes to contribute a little more to the revenue. I understand from the speech of the Prime Minister that, if honourable members do not support this proposal, it means shelving the question of old-age pensions for a time.",41
284,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think so. The honourable member will have to devise some other means of providing the necessary funds.,41
285,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is'not a difficult task.,41
286,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not difficult to gest plans, but enormous difficulties would be experienced in giving effect to them.",41

290,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Prime Minister must recollect that there is a Legislative Council in that State. Everybody in South Australia knows what that means. In that State I venture to say the Government will find it difficult to give effect to their wish to increase the progressive land tax. In Victoria, where land values are higher than in anv other part of the Commonwealth, there is no land tax. similar position obtains in Queensland.",41
291,Mr WILKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do not make a mistake.,41
292,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is a land tax for municipal purposes operative there.,41
293,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the Queensland Government are proposing another.,41
294,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But they have little hope of carrying it. I would point out to the honourable member for Moreton that in South Australia we have a progressive land tax, in addition to a land tax for municipal purposes. If we are in earnest in this matter of providing old-age pensions we should see that those who have kept the people poor should contribute more largely towards the scheme. Personally, I should be glad if a .fourth referendum were proposed, and if the opinion of the electors were taken upon a proposal to nationalize the tobacco industry. A Royal Commission has already reported that its nationalization would result in a very large revenue to the Commonwealth. It has been proved that the industry is controlled by a monopoly.",41
295,Mr WILKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the sugar refinery too.,41
296,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . There are plentv of sources from which money may be raised if the Government desire to pay old-age pensions. In South Australia we have increased the taxation upon the absentee land-holder, and if we resort to direct taxation I am quite sure that that State will be immediately enabled to remit sugsome of the taxation which is imposed at the present time, because additional revenue will be derived from the other States.",41
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then this is a proposal to ask the other States, by means of direct taxation, to foot the bill for old-age pensions in South Australia?",41
298,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government propose to prevent direct taxation by the Commonwealth as long as possible. I am 0 sure that the honourable member admits that we have no right to take additional money from the pockets of the poor through the But the Customs. I am beginning to think that there is very little sincerity in this House in respect of providing old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth. Already about three-fourths of those entitled to pensions are in receipt of them. Consequently we have only to find the money with which to meet the claims of the remaining one-fourth. A Mr. JOSEPH COOK - More than that, surelv. I thought it was about a third.",41
299,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I recollect looking into the matter some time ago, and if my memory be accurate we have to provide pensions for about one-fourth of those who are entitled to them throughout the Commonwealth. It is our duty to raise the necessary revenue without giving effect to amendment of the honourable member Kalgoorlie, which is bad in principle, and which ignores our responsibility to provide funds with which to pay for any scheme and New South Wales. that we may inaugurate. I disagree with the Government proposal, because I do not same degree. think that we should insist upon taking more money out of the pockets of the poorer sections of the community.",41

According to some - statisticians, if an valorem duty were imposed, it would be necessary to tax tea to the extent of about 150 per cent, in order to raise anything like an adequate sum for this purpose.",42

311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable would find that, with the estabrelishment of old-age pensions, that expenditure would not be largely reduced. That not is the experience of New South Wales.",42
312,Mr WILKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Experienc e teaches, but one would naturally expect a reduction of such expenses to follow the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions. There must be some reason for the maintenance of the same expenditure as before on outdoor relief in New South Wales.",43
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I say that practically the expenditure has not been reduced.,43
314,Mr WILKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that, in estimating the cost of poor relief in the various States, the upkeep of benevolent institutions, as well as the expenditure on old-age pensions, should be taken into consideration. The burden which the establishment of this system would place upon the people would not be so great as a cursory examination of the scheme leads one to suppose. Under a Federal system a considerable amount of the expenditure now incurred on poor relief in the States would merely be transferred to another heading, and its allocation would be more readily ascertained. The people would then know exactly what was being done with theii money. I fail to see how we should be able, under the Government proposal, to obtain the sum necessary to finance this system. In the end, we should have either to resort to direct taxation, or, as the orable member for North Sydney said, force the States to do so. I hold that we should take upon our own shoulders the responsibility for our own expenditure. If we are going to institute a system of old age pensions, and take credit for it, we should also take upon ourselves whatever odium may attach to the imposition of the increased taxation rendered necessary by it. We ought not to ask the States to do that which we do not care to undertake for ourselves. I do not attach much import.ance to the outcry raised in opposition to a tax on land values. Many people do not recognise the distinction between such a tax and a tax on land. We have in view the taxation of land values which have been largely created by the people whom we are now proposing to assist. Manv of them, in times gone by, have borne the heat and burden of the dav. and much of the increased values of land to-dav are the result of the strenuous lives they have led in developing the resources of Australia. That being so, I do not think we ask too much when we call upon the owners of that land to contribute something towards the maintenance of these old people. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would involve our trenching too largely upon the revenue which the States hiave a right to expect. In these circumstances, it seems to methat I have to choose the lesser of two evils.",43
315,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why accept either?,43
316,Mr WILKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no other alternative, unless I vote for the rejection of the whole proposal, and that I am not prepared to do. I would remind the honourable and learned member that, even if the amendment of the Constitution be agreed tp by the people, the scheme by which the Government propose to raise the necessary funds for old-age pensions will have to be submitted to the next Parliament, and. that honourable members will then have an opportunity to criticise it.",43
317,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If honourable members do not approve of it, they may then reject the scheme.",43
318,Mr WILKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. I have to choose between the lesser of two evils, and I , therefore, propose to vote for the Government proposal.",43

325,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that the States should not be compelled to impose such taxation?,43
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have no right to coerce the States in a matter of this kind. While the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would inevitably compel the States to impose direct taxation, the proposal of the Government would inevitably compel the Commonwealth to do so. We cannot blink the position. The two alternatives are the direct taxation of the States and the direct taxation of the Commonwealth. I believe that a Comharm monwealth system of old-age pensions can be obtained without following either course. I am tired of hearing honourable members suggest that those who oppose the Governa ment proposal are antagonistic to a Comhim monwealth old-age pensions scheme. That reflection cannot apply to me. I have ways seen the necessity for making the payment of old-age pensions a Commonfor wealth matter, in justice to those who now without that privilege; but I have to learn that there is not a better way of effecting our object than that proposed the Prime Minister. I do not believe that any honourable member is against the estabthey lishment of a Commonwealth old-age penof sions scheme. I certainly am not, and the actions of my political life prove the of my statement. I supported the adoption of an old-age pensions system in New South Wales, not in anticipation of the revenue required for it being derived from member suggest? a Federal impost, but on its merits.

334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be honourable member's leader? so: but the .sfcheme wasr passed on its merits, without reference to Federal tion. The operation of the Act may have been deferred until revenue was received from the Commonwealth; but the fact that such revenue would be received was not used as an argument in favour of the adopthe tion of the scheme. The honourable memhood ber for Wide Bay has declared that no could be done to the States by throwing upon them the responsibility of providing funds for a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme, because the country is in most flourishing condition. I agree with that the country is flourishing; but I do not regard that as a reason for throwing althis responsibility on the States. I look upon it rather as providing an occasion the re-arrangement of the financial are position such as will never occur again. If this period of rolling prosperity is allowed to pass before the financial problems by which are now vexing us and taxing our ingenuity and resources. are dealt with, will become more acute and less easy solution.

362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I suppose that the honourable member had in his mind a Federal income tax as well as a land tax* It is very easy to talk about Federal direct taxation, but the matter is not so simple when we take into consideration the present condition of affairs in the States. As the honourable member for Boothby pointed out, direct taxation is alreadv imposed In South Australia to the amount of 23s. od. per head of the population, whilst in Tasmania 23s. 4d. per head is raised in tihe same way. If the people of New S'outh Wales were taxed to the same extent as are those of Tasmania the Treasury would be enriched to the extent of nearly £2,000,000 per annum, and Victoria upon a similar basis would have her revenue increased by £ 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0.",46

370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In Tasmania, and, I believe, also in South Australia.",46
371,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that there was merely an alteration in the form of taxation in Tasmania. An ability tax was grafted on to the income tax.,46
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That had the effect of doubling the income tax.,46
373,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In Tasmania the people are not paying so much through the Customs as they formerly did, and therefore they have the money in their pockets.",46

It has been stated, that there is no - direct taxation in Queensland, but, as a matter of fact, the direct levies upon the people there represent 17s. 3d. per head.",46

384,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I understood him to say .that of all Constitutions.,47
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He said that of our Constitution. The Age today describes it as nothing but a clumsy compromise,47
386,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what the honourable member himself called it .,47
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I venture to say that our Constitution ought not to be amended until we cannot achieve the ordinary legislative objects which we have to pursue under it by any other means. Now the question arises, "" Is it necessary to alter the Constitution in order to give effect to that article in it which empowers us to legislate in respect of old-age pensions?"" I do not think that it is. The only reason urged by the Prime Minister against the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was that it would violate the 87th section of the Constitution, which he declared was part of the original bond. Does he suggest that his own proposal will not modify that section?",47
388,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not in fact.,47
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is quite true that the Prime Minister does not propose technically to trench upon the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is at present returned to the States, but he does propose to undermine the source from which that revenue is derived. It has been impressed upon us time, and again by our statisticians that our Customs duties average themselves over any material period with almost unerring accuracy. tempt to raise another £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 through the Customs for the purpose of paying old age pensions must necessarily - according to all statistical and economic lawdeteriorate the sources from which that revenue is derived. Whilst the Prime Minister is proposing only alteration as will permit of a different allocation of the revenue raised through the Customs, he is in reality undermining the sources of that revenue, and therefore vitally interfering with the 87th section of the Constitution. If he desires to do that, he might as well call the States Premiers together and frankly inform them of his intentions. I claim that there' is no necessity either to ear-mark Customs duties or to impose further Customs taxation to anygreat extent. Under the amendment submitted, the Government may sail merrily along and expend the whole of their one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. During the present year the Treasurer proposes fo expend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than was expended last year. Then they will be at liberty to take an additional £1,500,00 0 out of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which would otherwise be returnable to the States. The inevitable result of the adoption of the amendment must be to drive the States to direct taxation, and to such an extent that it would be a very serious impost upon them. Let honourable members clearly understand that it would mean compelling the States to impose an additional land tax of 2d. in the £ 1 without any exemption whatever.",47
390,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then it is a better proposal than I thought it was.,47
391,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not compel them to do anything like that. . Mr JDSEPH COOK - It would.,47
392,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would mean nothing in New South Wales, to begin with. There the State Government is already paving over £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually in old-age pensions. They receive that monev from us under the present arrangement, but under the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, we should defray the cost of old-age pensions in that State.",47
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is right to that extent. But all the necessitous States would require to make the provision which I have indicated.,47
394,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They would not require to levy a tax of 2d. in the £ 1 .,47
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . They To atwould need to impose a land tax of 2d. in the £ . 1 , without exemption, to find the necessary funds with which to finance this scheme. On the other hand, if the proposal of the Government be agreed to, it cannot be financed by the Commonwealth without resort to direct taxation. The imsuch ' an position of a duty upon tea and kerosene will yield only about £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. We shall thus require to raise an .additional £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Therefore, seems to me that both the Government proexpend posal and the amendment will involve in land taxation, the former through the medium of the Commonwealth, and the £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 . latter through the medium of the States. Otherwise we should be compelled to raise £10,500,00 0 annually through the Custion of penny postage. toms. We cannot do that.

399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It does. I do not see what advantage will accrue to people if we adopt penny postage and immediately levy additional Customs duties to the extent of £^1,500,000 annually. That does not represent sane financing. Then the Treasurer proposes to spend £ 5 2 5 , this year more than was expended last year. Will] anybody tell me that we not get along with a less expenditure than that? I venture to sav that if the right honourable member for Balaclava occupied the position of Treasurer we should not find an increase of £525,00 0 sterling over the expenditure of last' year. If we had man who was desirous of cutting down our expenditure, he would be able to get through the year with an increase of not much more than £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 upon the expenditure year.",48

402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We cannot get from these facts. I maintain that if we husband our resources and utilize to full our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, we can finance a Federal system of old-age pensions without trenching to any great extent upon the revenues returnable to the States. I admit, howthat we require about £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 more have to put that scheme into operation. As that, as I have already pointed out, the revenue for the current year has been to under-estimated. The season is particularly good, and the revenue, therefore, will also be expansive. I think any one may argue, from the promising wool clip alone, that the revenue this year will be very much better than the Treasurer has foreseacasted. And, therefore, I sav that we might fairly ask the Premiers of the States reto consult with the Commonwealth authorities as to the best method of raising the £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 that we require. That would be more reasonable than is the proposal of the Government to raise an additional sum of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and to gorge the big States with an in the creased surplus of _£500.ooo. It would be better to adopt our proposal than to accept the amendment which would drive the States to direct taxation. If we consulted the Premiers of the States, they 0 0 0 might well sav to us. "" Take the kerosene or tea duties if you wish it. Let them be canmoderate, and we will agree to your retaining, until the expiration of the Braddon section, the whole of the revenue so derived."" If that arrangement were properly put before them, I think that the States Premiers would incur a very severe a responsibility if they declined to consider it. They sav now, as they said at the Sydney Conference, that if we impose special duties they will agree to our retaining the of last whole of the revenue derived from them. That is a very easy way of avoiding responsibility, so far as they are concerned. But, in the matter of old-age pensions, imposition of this taxation. - the Premiers of the States bave an equal responsibility with us. They have relations with the same taxpayers as we have. They than that which I suggest. have just as much power, and, therefore, just as much responsibility, as we have regard to the imposition of direct taxaI tion. Their powers in that respect are in the slightest degree. concurrent with our own, and, therefore, they may not escape their responsibility more than we may do. That is a fact that ought to be brought home to them when bad as deficits for the States. any sane scheme of moderate dimensions - obviating the need for the further imposican tion of extreme taxation is put' before That is my proposal, and I say that it A better one than is the Government promethods. posal 10 impose further taxation.

If he looks at the statistics the past few years, he will find that the amount to be surrendered by the larger States is increasing, and will increase as their manufacturing importance extends. There never was a time when these finanuntil cial changes could be made so well as they could today, when our seasons are good and our revenues buoyant. But honourable members are seeking: in this, as in many other matters, to follow the line of least money right and left. resistance.

We readily remedy a deficit; but we canthem. not always bring down our expenditure is when it has been inflated by extravagant A revenue strictly conditioned latby our wants and proportioned to them is as much as any Government should at any obtime be intrusted with. But what does the Ministerial proposal mean ? It means, for t , instance, increasing the surplus of New South Wales, which this year amounts from £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 to £2,000,000. That could obviated by the plan I have just sugThe"" absurdity of it all is that concurrently with this proposal the Goof vernment and their supporters are taking every step possible to destroy revenue.

The to harvester duties will also destroy revenue.",49

408,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But as the honourable member voted for them, he is equally responsible with the rest of the House for",49
409,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for should bear his share of the cross.,49
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no share to bear. I repeat that no Government having responsibility for the financing of these proposals ought to surrender one penny their just obligations in that respect have been met. .But, concurrently with this proposition for raising further duties, the Government is busily engaged in destroying revenue, and, as it were, is giving away They are going to remit £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in respect of platpenny postage and high protective duties for the purpose of keeping out imports, and, therefore, for destroying revenue, are posed. They are restricting the possibility of raising revenue at the same time they are pleading that more revenue is needed to carry out the functions of the Commonwealth. That is an anomaly which we ought to make short work. The Government proposal is an easy way of viding for a scheme which will secure to them the greatest popularity on the one hand, while enabling them on the other to carry out their protective policy, and the same time to compel the people of tralia to bear additional Customs taxation. The Prime Minister has asked half-a-dozen times during the course of this debate how long it would take . the States deal with the full financial problems of the Constitution. I do not think that it would take very long. to see why the matter could not have been disposed of at the Premiers' Conference during the recess. At that Conference the Prime Minister made some indefinite speeches and proposals, and practically left the Premiers to shape their own course. They eventually did so by passing on the responsibility to the Federal Government. Ar the Hobart Conference, when the then Prime Minister, the right honourable memning ber for East Sydney, the Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Gippsland, the Treasurer, the right orable member for Balaclava, and the Minas ister of Home Affairs, the honourable memobviated ber for North Sydney, came face to face with the Premiers of the States what was the result ? As the outcome of their standduties up fight, three of the States agreed to allow old-age pensions to be financed by the monwealth Government. It was only when they were confronted by the present Prime Minister with his rolling periods, his ing fancies, and his beautiful word picfinanced ture painting-whe n he spoke to them "" liquid lines mellifluously bland ""-tha they took their own course, and unaniwill mously decided that the Commonwealth on must take the full responsibility age pensions. IThey then decided that we must not interfere with them. There portion of the community. was a complete change of front on their part. And why should ""there not have been ? Instead of proceeding to London as seriously. soon as last session closed, the Treasurer ought to have gone to the various States and discussed these financial proposals with the States Treasurers. He have given them information beforehand Mr Tosefh Cook. proas to what he proposed. The scheme now propounded by the Treasurer was not be that fore the Sydney Conference. This is a part of the financial proposals which has been framed irrespective of the Premiers of of the States, and of which they knew nothing. The least Ministers could have prodone when framing these fresh proposals was to have consulted the Premiers so that they might have been brought face to face with their responsibilities in regard to a at definite scheme. The whole matter might Austhen have been amicably and fairly arranged. As it is, the States' Premiers are going to meet on their own initiative, and I think, as the Argus put it this morning, to that they have fair ground for complaint against the Federal Ministry in that they have not been consulted in respect to the I fail first definite scheme submitted. I presume, however, that it is useless to further discuss this matter, I am afraid it is now too late in the day to change many votes; but so far as I am concerned, I cannot give my consent to such a proposal as this, which aims at financing the whole scheme of old-age pensions by means of additional Customs imposts. The necessity for such imposts could be avoided by a little planand contriving; by keeping our expenditure within economical limits; by maintaining our existing sources of Cushontoms revenue instead of surrendering them we are constantly doing. It could be by maintaining at their present rate the charges for services rendered. If there is to be an ear-marking of special for the purposes of old-age pensions, I doubt if. the proposal of the GoComvernment is the best one. l f we are to have a special tax for a special purpose, why can we not finance the larger part of flowthis proposal in some such way as we the accident claims in New South in Wales?

411,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Bland) [8.34] - I do not intend to detain the Committee verylong.,51
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member need not apologize. This is one of the most important proposals that this Parliament has been asked to discuss. - Mr WATSON - I do not know that there is anything upon which I ought to speak at length, because I have alreadyaddressed myself to the question to some extent. My object in rising is to reply to one or two of the remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta. His attitude in regard to the proposed amendment of the Constitution is extraordinary. Of late he seems to have been inoculated with the idea promulgated by the 'Argus and other similar journals that the Constitution is so sacred that hands must not be laid on it lightly. But a few years ago he and I , in common with, others, were denouncing it as a most ineffective instrument. He now sneers at the statement which he says has appeared in the Age, that the Constitution may be described as a "" clumsy instrument,"" although it is not long since fie applied much stronger terms in its condemnation. A short time ago he held that the Constitution was bad, and that one of its worse features was the provision which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to amend. The existence of that provision was the head and front of the objection - whi:h the right honourable member for East Sydney. the honourable member for Parramatta. and others of us tcok to the draft Constitution, when its acceptance or rejection was before the oeople of New South Wales.",51
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My present attitude is not antagonistic to my former attitude; both are irrelevant to the question be,51
414,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member may in time get back to his former attibut there is a great difference bepaid tween it and his present attitude. He formerly regarded the Constitution as an instrument which should not be accepted but, by the people of New South Wales, as Now he which considers it so sacred that we must not even suggest its alteration by the use of the machinery provided for that purpose.",51
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is beating a bogey. I did not say in - that. What I said was that I do not bein altering the Constitution unless we can achieve our objects in no other way.,51
416,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I admit that the honourable member has not said in so many words what I have attributed to him.,51
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have not implied it.,51
418,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If any other inference is to be drawn from his speech this evening, and that of a few days ago, I cannot perceive it .",51
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is unable to make fair inferences where I am concerned.,51
420,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I may be prejudiced; but I ask those who desire to judge my words to read the utterances of the honourable member now and a short time ago. Then, again, although he now finds no phrase too strong to hurl <at those who advocate direct taxation, he a little while ago objected to any other but direct taxation. I do not blame him for objecting to the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth Parliament, if he pledged himself to his constituents to oppose it ; but when difficulty arises he, like other honourable members, is free to seek for fresh authority fromi those who sent him here. As to his statement that the Labour Party have no concrete scheme to put forward for the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme, my answer is that in this respect our position is the same as that of the Opposition: we are not in a position of responsibility, and are therefore not compelled to put forward a detailed scheme for raising revenue. Does the honourable member contend that those on his side are agreed as to the method by which Commonwealth old-age pensions should be provided for? Can he say ""that they are even agreed as the desirability of Commonwealth old-age pensions? I think that quite a number of those associated with him are against the taking of any steps by the Commonwealth for the establishment of a Commonwealth ceed by £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . old-age pensions fund.",51
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My remarks made in reply to an honourable member who sum upon our coastal defences. was taunting the Opposition.,52
422,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member pointed out that there is a difference opinion amongst members of the Labour Party as to how a Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions can be financed, and it is sufficient to retort that there is no agreei ment amongst the Opposition, either as to the desirability of establishing a Commonfences, wealth old-age pensions fund or as to the any economy in that direction. means of doing so.",52
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member give us his scheme?,52
424,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,52
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has not one.,52
426,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"- I have a number ot ideas in my mind, but, under present conditions, I am not compelled to disclose what I should do. If the people of Australia wish me to promulgate a scheme,. I shall do so; but at present I am under no compulsion. The Labour Party are prepared, given the opportunity, to provide Commonwealthi old-age pensions, and to find the means of doing so without breaking any pledges. Mr ' JOSEPH COOK - Thei r programme includes more than this.",52
427,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we .have tunity, effect will be given to our programme ; but I do not wish to stray from the question before the Chair. I do not think that the honourable member's, proposition will bear examination. He suggests that we might economize, and speaks of the addition of £ 5 2 5 , 0 0 0 to our Estimates of Expenditure. I think that the Treasurer has been unjust to himself. His estimate of the expenditure of this year exceeds that of last year by only £ 4 1 7 , 0 Last year, as in previous years, it was found to be impossible to spend the actual amount appropriated. There will always be a considerable saving, and we need not expect that our expenditure will reach the full amount of the appropriation. When we go through the Estimates, we begin to realise that it is difficult to cut out any large sr.m. except it be, perhaps, in connection with the military expenditure. There, to I . think, is some' room for objection: Some four years ago, an understanding was arrived at that the expenditure on the military side should be cut down to a certain amount, which it is now proposed to exAs against that possible saving, however, there is the fact that were we should spend a large additional Unless we do so, we cannot be said to have adequately provided' for the proper deof fence of Australia. We should take some action in the directibni of providing a mosquito fleet for the defence of our ports. If we make a saving upon the military side, t will be necessary for us to spend as large a sum, if not even more, upon coastal deand, therefore, we cannot look for When we analyze the figures representing the increases in the Departments, it is difficult to put a finger upon any one item and saythat it should be cut down.",52
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am sure that the honourable member could justify every item just as a millionaire would justify his expenditure as moderate.,52
429,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do notfor a moment say that I could justify all the expenditure. The honourable member is endeavouring to beg the question. He has stated that the Estimates could be cut down by hundreds of thousands of pounds, and he ought to be able to point to the items upon which large savings could be made ",52
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does not the honourable member see that his challenge is an the oppor- absolutely absurd one?,52
431,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member had no right to assert that immense savings could be made upon the Estimates without having some data to submit to honourable members. Since the Budget statement was made, I have looked through the Estimates with a view to ascertaining whether it would be possible to make any savings: In the absence of the official information which the Treasurer has at his 0 0 . disposal, and looking at the matter as an outsider, it is very difficult to put one's finger upon any vote and say that it should be cut down. It is proposed to spend £ 5 5 , 0 0 0 upon the general elections-that cannot be interfered with. The increased vote for works and buildings in the Home Affairs Department is full y accounted for, as is also the proposed increased expenditure of £ 3 2 , 0 0 0 in the Department of External Affairs. Then, in the Department of the Postmaster-General, provision is made for increased expenditure to the amount of £ 6 8 , 0 0 0 , which includes, appropriations for items that will bring in revenue, and which cannot be cut down with any regard for efficiency. £ 1 0 5 , 0 0 0 proposed to be appropriated for works and buildings includes the vote for the construction of the telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne. None of the items to which I have referred could very well be interfered with, and it certainly would be difficult to cut them down materially. The amount appropriated for the sugar bonus is naturally' a largely increased one, owing to the legislation passed for increasing the Excise and raising the amount of the bounties to a corresponding degree. The increase this year will amount to about £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 . These items show how difficult it is to cut down expenditure to anything like the degree indicated by the honourable member for Parramatta. It seems to me that he left out of his calculations all new expenditure. Surely he must admit that the Commonwealth will, at an early date, have to take over a number of functions which it has not yet been able to assume. If we are to have an effective Australian administration in regard to a number of Departments, we shall have a number of new items figuring upon the debit side of our account before very long. For example, we cannot allow the Northern Territory to remain stagnant, destitute of population, and a burden upon one of the smallest States in the Union.",52
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In fact, when the honourable members comes to think of it, he could spend easily £10,000,000.",53
433,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a flippant sneer that is not worthy of the honourable member's position in this Chamber.,53
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The member's light and airy way of talking deserves nothing better. He merely skips over a thing, and says that it is settled.",53
435,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not say that these matters are settled,' but I am submitting certain considerations to honourable members, so that they may remember that we shall have to incur certain expenditure, whether we like it or not. I do not think that even the honourable, member for Parramatta will deny that at present the Northern Territory constitutes not only a reproach, but a menace, to Australia, and that when we take it over and attempt to do something with it, .we shall have to incur additional expenditure, for which we cannot expect to obtain any appreciable return' for a considerable time. In fact, I do not think that we should look for an immediate return. There are a number of matters to The which-eve n though the honourable member for Parramatta may pay them no attention-this Parliament will require to give its consideration,""and regarding which the people will demand that something shall be done in the very' near future. I have indicated thai: we cannot expect to effect economies upon such a scale as to enable us to make any provision for old-age pensions. The honourable member for Parramatta suggests that we should call another Premiers' Conference.",53
436,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But in the first place, the honourable member's great objection was that after special duties had been levied, we should require to find ,£800,000 or £900,000. He immediately afterwards went into a careful calculation to show that we had that amount available without looking far for it.",53
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is another exaggeration. I said that there would be a little over £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",53
438,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I took down the figures as they were spoken by the honourable member-£300,000 , £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and. £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in all, £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",53
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-That would not leave £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 to be found.",53
440,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So fa r as I can see, the honourable member could not expect to effect any material saving by practising economy. Although I quite agree with him as to the unwisdom of introducing the penny postage system, I contend that his suggestion that we should endeavour to induce the States Premiers to consent to some scheme of old-age pensions-som e method honourable by which we' could find the balance of the money required-is , in view of the experience which we have already passed through, absolutely fatuous. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - What about the honourable member's proposal ?",53
441,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already indicated my position. The honourable member should have had sufficient experience to convince him that we .could - expect noassistance from the States Premiers. He seemed to be quite jubilant at the fact that the Reid-MCLean' Government, after sending a contingent of Ministers representing half 'their strength to Hobart, had succeeded in convincing three States Premiers that the Commonwealth should take up this matter of old-age pensions, and impose special duties.",53
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No such thing.,54

447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable pudence. member is misrepresenting me.,54

451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable ence. member is quite wrong; that is not the point.,54
452,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Perhaps the honourable member will take an opportunity later on to explain just what"" his point was. He occupied some time in expressing his regret that the Prime Minister had not taken all his forces with him to the Conference in Sydney, and the .inference to be drawn was difficulties to be guarded against. that, had he done so, he might have been as successful as was the right honourable member for East Sydney. 'and have secured the consent of three of the States Premiers.",54

454,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So far as my goorlie, reading goes of the proceedings of the support the Government proposal. various Premiers' Conferences, there nothing to hope from them in this adopt connection. I do not say that some of the States Premiers are not anxious that the Federation should provide old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth. But there is nothing to indicate that there is any possibility of securing anything approaching unanimity on the part pf the gentlemen occupying these distinguished positions. we are not justified in wastspeing any further time in that direction. The honourable member for Parramatta approved the idea expressed in an article which was published in today's Argus, that the Premiers of the States have a right to complain because l they have not been further consulted in reference to this proposal. To my mind that complaint represents the height of imWhy should they be consulted further, after having been consulted at conference after conference without the Commonwealth making one step forward?",54

463,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Upon two occasions when acting as Treasurer the right honourable member for Balaclava put before the Premiers a complete financial scheme^ and outlined in the clearest possible way the In view of these circumstances, it would be idle for us to waste further time in calling another Conference, which could only result in a further indefinite postponement of proposal. I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Kalbut, should it be defeated, I shall It is seems to me that whatever means we may to raise the revenue with which to pay old-age pensions, we shall require to have our resources upon the Customs side supplemented, either by retaining some portion of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue at present returnable to the States, or by increased taxation. Personally, I prefer that it should be taken out of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise, revenue, but rather than permit Australia to remain without old age pensions, I am prepared to allow the proposal of the Government to bs submitted to the people should the amendment be rejected.",54
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y wav of personal explanation, I should like to say that, throughout his speech, the honourable member for Bland has endeavoured lay hold of points which I did not make at all. I am loth to believe that his action in this connection was other than unintentional. Let me mention two points by way of illustration. I did not say that at the Hobart Conference three of the States had agreed to the scheme which the right honourable member for East Sydney submitted to them. What I said was that Victoria. - New South Wales, and Western Australia agreed to permit the Commonwealth to deduct the amount necessary for the payment qf old-age pensions from the sum that was returnable to them.",55
465,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that the Premiers agreed to do that.,55
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What I did say in respect of the Treasurer was that, instead of going to London to consult the Imperial authorities in regard to taking over the States debts, he should have visited the Treasurers of the States, and discussed with them the whole of his financial proposalsnot this particular proposal. - things are entirely distinct.",55
467,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Werriwa) [9.6] - When the honourable member for Bland rose to continue the discussion he almost apologized for his action. Personally I think that this Bill, involving as it does, an amendment of the Constitution, ought to be subjected to a very full discussion. There are many difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth initiating an old-age pensions scheme. It seems to me that the administration of a system of old-age pensions by the States would be more economical than would be. its administration by the Commonwealth. We must recollect, too, that at the present time two-thirds of those persons in Australia who are entitled to old-age pensions are in receipt of them.",55
468,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But are there not many who have lived in both New South Wales and Victoria for forty and fifty years, and who cannot secure a pension ?",55
469,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. They have not been resident in either State sufficiently long to entitle them to the pension. The Commonwealth might well have provided the .small amount necessary to pay the claims of such persons from the general surplus that we have at the present time without asking us to adopt the extraordinary course of amending the Constitution. How is it proposed to raise the money with which to pay old-age pensions? We are to told that certain duties will be ear-marked. That is all very well if we are to place the funds thus raised in the hands of trustees, and if Parliament is no longer to exercise supervision over them. But the moment we view it in any other light the proposal to ear-mark certain sums becomes ridiculous. All our revenue ought to be ear-marked in that it ought to be raised only for useful purposes. But to prescribe that one pound shall be collected for a certain purpose, and another pound for a different purpose is, to my mind, the acme of folly. I would further point out that if we ear-mark duties in the way that is suggested, they must continue to be ear-marked until the Constitution is again amended. The ""Government must have been in a very childish mood when they put forward this proposal. If any special duties be ear-marked, and the revenue from them be not absorbed, it cannot be used for any. other purpose. Then I ask, "" How is it proposed to raise the necessary funds with which to pay old-age pensions?"" Bv further taxation of the The two mass of the people. Admittedly the only two articles which would produce any considerable revenue are tea ?.wd kerosene. These would {yield approximately £ 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. By adopting the Government proposal, we shall increase the taxation of Victoria and New South Wales, which have already made provision for the payment of old-age pensions. In other words, we shall be absolutely taxing the larger States of Australia for the purpose of inflicting a fine upon the smaller States. We shall be punishing those who have done what we conceive to be their duty. There seems to be no general opposition to the pioposal to establish a national scheme of old-age pensions.  House are in favour of it. There are about five Conservatives in the House, all representatives of Victoria, opposed to age pensions.",55
470,Mr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Victori a has the best old age pension scheme in Australia.,56
471,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not going to discuss the advisableness of establishing an old-age pensions scheme, but if honourable members wish to study the question I would recommend them to read the report of the Poor Law Commission which sat in England in the thirties. If they go fully into that report they will learn how such a measure as the Elizabethan poor law, which was intended absolutely for the relief of the poof and destitute, was so diverted in the course of years from its original purpose that the best friends of the workers recommended its absolute abolition. That report shows how evil is often inextricably mixed with what appear to be good schemes for the benefit of the people. I am discussing this question from the point of view that we all desire a Federal system of old-age pensions. From that point of view alone I urge that it would be fatuous, as the Government propose, to penalize the two larger States, be- course cause they have already adopted independent systems. Such a scheme could only be conceived at the fag-end of a session when honourable members are so fatigued as to be incapable of reasoning soundly.",56
472,Mr FRAZEK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable and learned member should speak"" for himself.",56
473,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that at the fag-end' of a session I am not so capable as I am at other times of thoroughly studying every Bill brought forward. I am able to prophesy the effect of measures that have not been thoroughly considered. One has only to look at any of the measures we have passed during the last two or three years to discover the conflicting principles running through them. I regretted to hear the honourable member for Bland speak so lightly of the alteration of the Constitution. I can conceive of nothing more calculated to bring the Constitution into contempt than to ask honourable members to assent to amendments, the effects of which have not been thoroughly considered. I trust that no such proposal will be accepted by the people unless it is clearly shown that it has been well considered. When it is found that the Constitution can be readily altered, the whole fabric which has been built up with so much care may be shattered. If we teach oldthe people to disregard the Constitution Ave teach them to disregard the very law that binds the States together. The day has not yet arrived when it can be said that the Federal control is no longer considered irksome, and if we tell the people that the Constitution can be easily altered they will desire to go further. It is useless, however, at this stage of the session to address the Committee on constitutional questions. Honourable members are not prepared to consider what mav be the effect lo-morrow of legislation passed today, let alone to consider what may be its effect years hence. Upon the ground that the Bill involves an alteration of the Constitution. I should be prepared to vote against it. Do honourable members mean to suggest that the Parliament is unable to provide by other means any sum that may be necessary for this purpose? Is not the power of the Government sufficient?",56
474,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not.,56
475,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows that it is. We have two schemes before us, and we have to consider what should be followed.",56
476,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What are we to do?,56
477,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We ought not to be prepared at present to propose an alteration of the Constitution as a means of overcoming a difficulty which may be surmounted in a hundred and one other ways.,56
478,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable and learned member make a suggestion or move an amendment?,56
479,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government would not at present accept an amendment from the Opposition. I dare say that if I were in their place I should not be prepared to accept amendments moved by honourable members occupying irresponsible positions.,56
480,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How would the honourable and learned member raise the necessary revenue?,56
481,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It could be raised either by Customs or direct taxation, or, if necessary, by a combination of the two.",56
482,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What is the best method ? ,",56
483,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not one of them cart be said to be a good method. I do not believe in increasing taxation. More than half the amount required is already being raised in the two larger States, where old age pensions are being paid. We are now told that we ought to adopt a scheme to raise £1,500,00 0 for a Federal system, two-thirds of which taxation would be borne by the people of Victoria and New South Wales.",56
484,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable member prepared to increase^ the Customs taxation ?,57
485,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,57
486,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then he is in favour of direct taxation.,57
487,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am in favour of no additional taxation unless it is necessary.,57
488,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the honourable and learned member is not in favour of old age pensions?,57
489,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unles s we could make an arrangement with the States by which it would be necessary to raise only a minor amount, I would not force upon the smaller States a policy which they have not seen fit to adopt. The Labour Party has been in power in Queensland for some time.  men in the present coalition - Government, and, as a matter of fact, they are mere ""shandygaffers."" Mr ' CONROY - But the bulk of .the supporters of the coalition Ministry are members of the Labour Party. They are in favour of old-age pensions, but plead that there is great difficulty in the way of establishing such a system. That being so, it is only fair that we should let them alone until they have devised some way of overcoming that difficulty.",57
490,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-They expect us to do that.,57
491,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sure that they do not. I am satisfied that this scheme will be. unwieldy and cumbersome. Under it two-thirds of the people of Australia, who already provide for old-age pensions, are to be further taxed in order that the remaining third of the population, who have made no provision for them, shall enjoy the benefit of the system.",57
492,Mr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why is not made in the remaining one-third ?,57
493,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because their Legislatures, although in some cases dominated by members of the Labour Party, do not feel that they can bring into operation a practical scheme.  to do, and we shall do it in spite of the Opposition.",57
494,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Can the honourable member for Werriwa evolve, a practical scheme ?",57
495,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall not be called upon to do so until I sit on the Treasury benches, with the support of honourable members. It is proposed to penalize two-thirds of the population of Australia because they have made provision for the payment of old-age pensions. It would, have been better for them, under such circumstances, had no such provision been made.",57
496,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What proposal would the honourable and learned member support in preference to that of the Government?,57
497,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The proposal of the Government is so bad that it cannot be remedied. It is proposed that the revenue from certain duties should be ear-marked, save the word. If that arrangement were adopted, and the revenue exceeded the payments in pensions, we could not use the balance for any other purpose. The Legislatures of South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania, are mow capable of managing the internal affairs o those States than we are. What right ha'.e we to thrust upon them our opinions ? Honourable members seem to have lost sight of the Federal idea. The States federated to secure one Administration in regard to matters of common interest. It was not thought that the Commonwealth Parliament would endeavour to make the States Parliaments do what they did not wish to do, or would try to force legislation upon the States against the will of their people.",57
498,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable and learned member is in favour of direct taxation, but is afraid to say so, and other members of the Opposition are in the same position.",57
499,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have always contended that in Australia the difference between direct and indirect taxation is greater than it should be. In England 49 per cent, of the revenue is obtained by direct taxation and 51 pet cent, by indirect taxation, and while in a voung country like this it provision would not be wise or politic to adopt the same ratio, I think that the difference is at present too great. The indirect taxation which is now levied is unjust, falling too largely upon the poor.  that the honourable and learned member is wrong.",57
500,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney-General is a clever advocate who is accustomed to' bamboozlei others. He does not mind how much is taken from the pockets of the people, so long as hecan make them believe that they are not suffering. orable and learned member for West Sydney and other honourable members were sincere, they would endeavour - to alter the ratio of direct and indirect taxation. I think that we should raise 35 per cent, of our revenue from direct taxation, and 65 per cent, from indirect; but at present we raise barely 20 per cent, from direct, and 80 per cent, from indirect taxation. In New South Wales prior to Federation the ratio of direct to indirect taxation was as 29 to 71. . My remarks on the subject of taxation, however, must always be taken as qualified by the statement that the less taxation imposed upon it-he people the better for them. Members like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would have us believe that it does.not matter how much taxation is imposed, so long as it is called protection. It is a ridiculous thing that members should support or oppose a proposal because of the name given to it. or because of the Minister by whom it is brought forward. But when I asked an honourable member whether he thought that if the Treasurer introduced a measure whereby £500,000 could be obtained it would be passed, he said "" No."" Later on, when, after having diverted his mind by other conversation, I said, "" If the Minister of Trade and Customs introduces a measure which will yield £500,000 by the imposition of protective dutiies will he carry it , "" the reply was ""Yes."" I need hardly say that the brain which is so feaifully and wonderfully fashioned that it gives different answers' to the one question belongs to a member of the protectionist party.",57
501,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do protective duties give revenue ?,58
502,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not if by protection is meant prohibition; but, just as free trade does not mean the abolition-of Customs houses, so protection does not mean absolute prohibition. Can any one contend that necessity has arisen for the alteration of the Constitution in the manner proposed? Seeing that £700,000 is already expended in the payment of old age pensions, and that only another £700,000 need be provided, can it be shown that special taxation must be imposed to provide the money? If special taxation were needed, it should be imposed on those who can best afford to bear it.",58
503,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Upon whom would the If the honhonorable member impose it?,58
504,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not on the poorest in the land. The wealthy should contribute more than >he poor.,58
505,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What form of - direct taxation would the honourable and learned member propose?,58
506,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would combine direct witih indirect taxation. Direct taxation covers chiefly the taxation of land and incomes, and the imposition of stamp duties.",58
507,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What form of land taxation would the honourable member suggest?,58
508,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"An equitable tax, so that no one should escape paying his share.",58
509,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What would the honourable and learned member call, an equitable tax ?",58
510,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows what my opinion is-that taxation is a bad thing, and the less we haveof it the better. When it is necessary, direct and indirect taxation should be combined; but I refer him to any elementary primer for information on the subject at large. It is an outrage upon the sound principles of constitutional government to ask us at the fag end of the last session of a Parliament, when we are sitting from ten in the morning till twelve at night, to consider a proposed alteration of the Constitution. That in itself is a sufficient reason for opposing the proposal of the. Government. No justification has been urged for the course proposed. The ear-marking of certain funds is one of the worse schemes that could be devised. One'good result that would follow the adoption of the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is that it would prevent the raising of money until a scheme hacl been formulated. The Government would not resort to such taxation if they knew that the money raised would not be available for purposes other than that specified. Very little consideration! has been given to the probable effect of the proposal upon the smaller States, and I am astounded that the Government should have had the audacitv to propose this alteration of the Constitution. The Constitution should be amended only when matters of vital importance are affected, and only after the fullest possible attention has been drawn to them. Does any one suppose for a moment that, if the present proposal be agreed to, the public will have an opportunity to make themselves acquainted with the question regarding which they will be called upon to vote? Every one knows that the public mind is alreadyagitated by a dozen other questions, and that the present proposal is being slipped through, as it were, in the dark. If we agree to the measure now before us, we shall be acting in a. manner unworthy of men who aspire to be called politicians. If honourable members had any claim to the title of statesmen, they would know that progress and prosperity are not brought about by continual changes. fixed Government, though not a good one, may be - better than one that is always being changed. Settlement and continuity in the policy of the country are necessary to progress and prosperity, and changes in the Constitution should not be made until full time has been given for consideration, or unless the interests of the people as a whole are at stake. If the Constitution is amended in the manner proposed, the alteration will be used as a precedent for other changes, which we may expect to have placed before us in rapid succession. There might have been some reason for proposing to submit to the electors the question of electing quinquennial instead of triennial Parliaments. The Government might have claimed that it was better, and more in consonance with the principles of governmerit, tihat honourable members should be able to study for a longer period the questions demanding their attention in the wider political field opened up to them in the Federal Parliament. In this Parliament the first year is spent by an honourable member in obtaining knowledge as to the manner in which parliamentary work should be carried out. The second year is really the only period during which he is in a pro|3er frame of mind to devote himself to the consideration of the questions which come before him. During the third year he is so much occupied in making speeches to .his constituents, with a view to securing his return at the forthcoming elections, that it is impossible for him to give full and fair consideration to the' measures submitted to the House. In view, further, of the risk now incurred of repeated reversals of policy, the Government might very well have asked the elec8 tors to consider the desirability of electing the House for five years, instead of three. If , however, they had brought forward such a proposal, I should still have urged that a change of the Constitution should not be lightly contemplated. ' In fact, we should not seek to amend the Constitution unless we find it impossible to arrive at any other solution of the difficulty which confronts us. If , by repeated alterations of the Constitution, we weaken the belief of the great masses of the people in its stability, we shall prepare the way for more dangerous innovations, which may ultimately lead to the breaking-up of the Federation.",58
511,Mr FRAZ ER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kalgoorlie) [9.52] - I A have listened very patiently to the debate, and it appears to me that no insuperable objections have been raised to my amendment. Up to the present time this Parliament has utterly failed to carry out the promises made to the electors at the last elections. In Western Autralia, at all events, no candidate urged that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to institute a scheme of old-age pensions. Difficulties were raised only after honourable members had secured their return. I had the honour of being a member of the Old-age Pensions Commission, which entered upon its work upon the Understanding that the establishment of a Federal old-age pensions scheme was approved of by nine-tenths of the member's of this Chamber. It was not regarded by members as the duty of the Commission to consider whether it was desirable to establish such a scheme, but the attention of the members was devoted solely to devising the best means by which provision should be made for giving effect to the wishes of the people as expressed by honourable members. The time has arrived when the Government should face the responsibility of providing for old-age pensions. Ministers have urged that in order to give effect to the will of the people, it is necessary to amend the Constitution. I have always held the view, however, that we have had the means at our disposal without resorting to any such step. By a judicious manipulation of our funds, and by retaining the surplus of the Commonwealth share of revenue which has been paid back to the States, we might have been able to lav the foundation of an old-age pension scheme. This Parliament, however"", seems to desire to take over from the States almost every other 88 Constitution responsibility except that of providing for old-age pensions. We have incurred a liability in connection with the payment of bounties to the extent of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and to the extent to which certain duties recently imposed become protective, they will involve a loss of further revenue. there is the proposal to lose between £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £300,00 0 by establishing penny postage. In these and other directions, we have thrown away revenue which would have provided us with at least a portion of the funds required to establish an old-age pensions system. The balance required could have been raised by imposing direct taxation. The point raised by the Prime Minister as to our constitutional obligations to the States has been effectively disposed of/. As I stated on a former occasion, no one part of the Federal compact is more sacred than another, and no provision should be amended without the fullest consideration. I believe that if we decide by an absolute majority to remit to the people the question whether old-age pensions shall be provided for out of the Customs and Excise revenue, an' affirmative answer will be given. Under the Government proposal, special duties are to be placed upon articles now admitted free into the Commonwealth,, and it will be impossible to raise the funds required without imposing duties upon tea and kerosene. If taxes were levied upon these articles, they would impose a heavy burden upon the poorer classes of the community who live in cities and who cannot afford to pay for electric light or gas, and also upon farmers ancl other residents in the country districts whom the Government profess to be very anxious to assist. Apart from the question as to the sections of the community upon whom the greater part of the burden would f all , I do not think it is desirable to levy special duties in order to provide for old-age pensions. The Commission unanimously condemned resort to any such means.",59
512,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The present Government has flouted all the reports presented by Commissions which it has appointed.,60
513,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that is very material to the point at issue. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the Old-Age Pensions Commission unanimously reported against the imposition of specific taxation for the purpose of raising funds with which to defray the cost of a national [REPRESENTATIVES.] Alteration scheme. Under the Government proposal such items in the Tariff as narcotics, silks, & c , upon which it might be deemed de-' sirable to levy extra taxation, would be specifically excluded from additional taxation. I do not think that it is any part of Then our duty to provide large surpluses for the States Treasurers. I ask honourable members whether the surpluses at present available in the different States are being distributed in the best possible manner ? Personally, I regard large surpluses as a great evil. We all recognise that they are allocated by the States Treasurers in a most objectionable fashion, and that if constituencies are not actually bought with them, particular care is exercised to see that the interests of the electorates which return Government supporters are not neglected.",60
514,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They get as close to buying the constituencies as possible.,60
515,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the States were to utilize the surpluses which they derive as the result of bountiful seasons to relieving the deficits which are accumulated during lean years, a great many of my objections to the Government proposals would be removed. But the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carruthers, who anticipates having a surplus of £1,400,000 next year, is already making provision for a considerable decrease in the apology for a land tax which is operative in that State, despite the fact that a large section of its people are being crushed by land monopolists. Under these circumstances, I can see no possible justification for adding to the surpluses of the States Treasurers. At the present time, the inhabitants of Western Australia have to pay £ 4 per head in indirect taxation, chiefly upon articles of general consumption.",60
516,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The amount is £ 3 14s. per head.,60
517,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I may tell the Treasurer that it has reached about £ 6 per head. Consequently, a man with a family of four is at present required to contribute £ 2 0 annuallv. So far, no land tax has been imposed in Western Australia. The whole idea of its Government has been to collect Customs duties upon the that foodstuffs required by the people. But having been compelled by the force of public opinion to take some action, its members are now adopting just that fragment of a, land tax which will enable them to save their political skins.. The Prime Minister stated that under the Government proposal Western Australia would be called upon to contribute £ 8 5 , 0 0 0 annually towards old age pensions.",60
518,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the calculation of --he Tasmanian Statist.,61
519,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have in my possession some figures which throw a very peculiar light upon the way in which duties upon tea and kerosene would operate from the stand-point of Western Australia'. I find that in 1903 the Commonwealth imported 24,716,000 lbs. of tea and 15,000,000 gallons of kerosene. Probably honourable members will be surprised to learn that a duty of 5d. per lb. upon tea and of a like sum per gallon upon kerosene would realise only half the amount that would be required for the payment of old-age pensions. duty would - represent an ad valorem rate of 77 per cent, and 74 per cent, respectively. I think that is a pretty stiff tax. It would require a duty of about iod. per gallon upon kerosene, and of 9d. per lb. upon tea to provide for a national system of old-age pensions, providing the imports remain the same. That appears to me to constitute such an enormous tax that no Government would be prepared to father it. Unfortunately, the taxation of these commodities will f all only upon the poorer section of the community. In 1904 West-, em Australia imported 2,150,000 lbs. of tea and 1,470,000 gallons of kerosene. Upon the assumption that a duty of 5d. per lb. were levied upon tea, and an equal amount per gallon upon kerosene, she would be called upon to contribute £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 annually. But, inasmuch as the rate I have mentioned would only be sufficient to meet half the amount necessary to pay old-age pensions, Western Australia would have to pay on that basis £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. According to the Government Statist/ there .are only 4>3°° persons in Western Australia who are eligible by years for old-age pensions. Applying to that State the proportion that obtains in the other States of those necessitous persons, only about 1,677 persons there would be the recipients of pensions. A great number of these have only been resident in Western Australia during the past few years. To pay them upon the New South Wales basis would cost Western Australia £ 4 0 , 0 0 0. Under the proposal of the Prime Minister, therefore, we should be taking from Western Australia £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually in specific duties for the purpose of meeting a liability of £ 4 0 , 0 0 0. Such a proposal is too outrageous for this Parliament to consider. Western Australia has shown her patriotism by accepting the sugar bounty, the sugar duties, and the duties on boots, as well as by extending consideration'to various manufactures chiefly carried on in other States, but she is not prepared to contribute £100,000 per annum to pay the old-age pensions in other States. I therefore say that the honourable member for Fremantle, when making his criticism, had not gone beneath the surface of the Government proposal. The scheme suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney is, to my mind, one that would not secure the support of a majority in any_ deliberative assembly.",61
520,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not at present pracThat tical politics.,61
521,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is so. It is said that if my amendment be adopted it will meet with hostility from some of the States' Treasurers.,61
522,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Fro m all ; not from some.,61
523,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable and learned gentleman says that it will meet with hostility from all the States' Treasurers, he weakens the argument advanced, by him. I hold that it is a more feasible scheme than that proposed by the Government. About two-thirds of the people of Australia reside in Victoria and New South Wales, where old-age pensions schemes are in operation, and where the people, by means of indirect taxation, have been required to raise more than is necessary to carry on the government of the country. Does the Prime Minister think that the people of New South Wales, where, notwithstanding that provision is made for an old-age pensions scheme, a surplus of nearly £1,500,000 is this financial year anticipated, would consent to additional Customs taxation, adding enormously to their present surplus?",61
524,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It rests with them to relieve themselves of that taxation.,61
525,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is in the highest degree improbable that the people of either of the States which have made provision for old-age pensions, and have a large' surplus, will vote for a proposal which means the imposition of additional Customs taxation upon commodities used chiefly by the poorer sections of the community. It is said that the remaining States will not be prepared to accept any reduction of their Customs revenue. Western Australia must under any proposal suffer some loss of revenue, and I am satisfied that the vast majority of the electors of Kalgoorlie will vote to lighten the burden of taxation on foodstuffs. They are prepared to direct taxation into other channels which are designed to carry all that is necessary for the government of the country. In these circumstances, I appeal confidently to the Committee to accept my amendment. We are not responsible for the views of any State Treasurer. We have to place on the shoulders which can carry it most equitably the taxation necessary for the government of Australia. To impose a tax on foodstuffs, as suggested by the Government, would be most undesirable.",61
526,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would not the honourable member's .amendment make Tasmania's position a very difficult one?,62
527,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would probably impose upon the Parliament of that State the obligation to so direct its taxation as to break up the large estates there. If that were done, the people would not be huddled together in the chief cities whilst one-half of the island is held by about three landlords. I cannot appreciate the argument that my proposal would press heavily ""upon the people of the States",62
528,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that Tasmania would have entered the Federation if the return of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States had not been promised?,62
529,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no justifica tion for the statements we frequently hear that Federation would not have been accomplished but for the insertion of this or that provision in the Constitution. Sentiment had much to do with the accomplishment of Federation.,62
530,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was that the position in Western Australia?,62
531,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was; but I regret that in the Federal Parliament the true Federal sentiment has not always been expressed, where Western Australian interests were concerned. I do not think that one part of the Constitution is more sacred than another, nor do I think that any of the States would be seriously injured if the amendment were adopted. I admit, of course, that it would mean that the States would be forced to allow the Commonwealth to retain money which they could distribute in various ways,'but the underlying value of my amendment is that it would compel the taxation necessary for this desirable object to be diverted into channels along which it should run if we are to have a truly just system.",62
532,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bass) [10.20] - 1 should not have spoken to this question but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in regard to the position of Tasmania and Western Australia. I am in favour of old-age pensions, and have never hesitated to express my be. lief that a federal system should be established. Whilst I do not consider that we should lightly agree to any alteration of the Constitution, I think that we ought to be prepared to accept an amendment of it when it is necessary to enable a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions to be established. I certainly think that it is our duty to take this question into serious consideration, and to bring the scheme into operation as speedily as possible. We have been told that the introduction of these proposals at the fag-end of the session prevents our giving proper consideration to them. As a matter of fact, the question has been discussed at almost every political gathering since the inauguration of Federation, and since the Hobart Conference we have had ample opportunity to consider it in all its details. I know that there are many difficulties in the way, and I would point out that Tasmania, owing to losses sustained as the result of Federation, has been compelled to resort to various means of raising the revenue necessary for the administration of her Govern: ment. It has been stated during the debate that the money not so raised remains really in the pockets of the people- That is not the case. Since the establishment of Inter-State free-trade Tasmania has largely imported from New South Wales and Victoria instead of from foreign countries, with the result that she has suffered a considerable loss of revenue. With the exception of a few articles she has not been able to obtain what she required cheaper from the mainland than she could .previously obtain ;them from other countries. Taken as a whole, the position of the Treasurer of Tasmania has been one of great difficulty, since he has lost half of the revenue that was collected under the State Tariff. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has clearly pointed out what would be the position of Western Australia if special duties were imposed for this purpose on tea and kerosene. As a matter of fact, the Government have not indicated what items they propose to submit to special taxation, and until they do I shall not assume that their intention is to imDOse duties on tea or kerosene. It remains for them to bring forward their proposals in the next Parliament, and I am sure that when they do honourable members will be prepared to give fair consideration to the complaint that a proposed duty would operate unfairly on the people of anv State. At the present time the only question before"" us is whether the Constitution shall be so amended as to enable the Government to impose special duties for a special purpose. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie told us that if the 'Government proposal were adopted Western Australia would be taxed nearly four times as much as would be necessary to enable her to establish a State system of old-age pensions. I would remind him that when the Works Estimates were before us a few days ago he did not object to a proposal to expend £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 in that State, when as a matter of fact it was entitled to an expenditure of only £ 7 0 , 0 0 0. Thomas, J. It is only fair that both sides of the question should be put before the Committee. I do not propose to further occupy the attention of honourable members, because I know that it is the general desire that we should now. proceed to a division. As the only representative of Tasmania present, however, I felt it was my duty to show that the Treasurer of that State could not agree to any reduction from the revenue now received by him under the Braddon section. Two years after Federation four different schemes of taxation, designed to make ends meet, were submitted to the State Parliament.",62
533,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did they not rethat value the Van Diemen Company's lands?,63
534,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That question is not now under consideration. I shall support the Government if they bring forward progiven posals for obtaining additional taxation tion to pay old-age pensions, so long as with him. no injustice is done to any State individually. It has been said that the and the people in the country will suffer vernment ? most if additional taxation is imposed; but the question before us at the present time is not the imposition of taxation, we must consider everv proposal on its merits when it comes before us.

535,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kalgoorlie) [10.36] Do I understand that the Prime Minister contemplates proposing in the next Parliament, if the collection of special duties be sanctioned by the people, the imposition of duties on tea and kerosene only? If that is so, the public should be informed, so the electors may have an opportunity to say whether they endorse that proposition. The honourable member for Bass says that it will be sufficient to have that question answered when the people have their assent to the proposed alteraof the Constitution. I do not agree",63
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not? Canpoor not the honourable member trust the Go,63
537,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have my own responsibilities. The honourable member, although and he made a speech whose p'oints he asked' the honourable member for Bland to distinguish-and they were as numerous as the spines of a porcupine-wa s not very clear as to what his attitude on this matter would be.

542,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [10.40] - It seems to me that before asking the electors to approve of a change in the Constitution, we have a right to know what steps will fess be taken under the increased powers given to the Government to obtain revenue. The Prime Minister has spoken as if the sary revenue could be raised by imposing duties upon a great number of articles. we know very well that that is not the case. The honourable member for KalI goorlie asked a very direct question",64
543,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And he obtained as rect an answer as could be given.,64
544,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that we have a right to know what are the intentions Government.,64
545,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The House has no right to know the policy which the Government will announce to the electors.,64
546,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barrier) [10.42] - Per sonally, I regret that the amendment was not carried. Under present conditions, feel disposed to vote for the Government proposal, because I do not care to place any obstacle in the way of referring the whole question to the people, and leaving them to decide it for themselves. My vote as acitizen will be given against the vernment proposal, and I shall use all.the influence I .have to defeat the proposed amendment of the Constitution.",64
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [10.43] - As I believe that the resources we already have within the limits of constitutional - powers and functions aswith signed 'to us are sufficient, I shall not assist in remitting to the people question of the amendment of the Constitusalaries tion. There is no necessity for any such step, and I shall vote against the Bill .",64
548,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Werriwa) [10.44] - I could not give my assent to any alteration to of the Constitution unless I believed that there was urgent necessity for the change. Above all things, I could not approve of any proposal that, if carried into effect, would involve the imposition of further taxation upon the masses of the people by means of duties upon tea and kerosene. If any further taxation is to be imposed, we should preserve the proper proportion between that directly and indirectly levied upon the people.",64
549,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hindmarsh) [10.45] - I cannot vote for the Government because I am not satisfied that the revenue required could not be raised in another way. I think that it is time that. we adopted a new method of ' raising revenue in order to provide for schemes such as that now in contemplation. I conthat it is a difficult matter to raise sufficient money, but all means should be exhausted before Ave place further burdens necesupon the people we wish to relieve.",64
550,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wide Bay) .[10.47] - I But would point out to honourable members that this is not a proposal to impose taxation. t is intended to confer upon the Government power to raise the funds necessary to diprovide for the payment of old-age pensions.,64
551,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is the first step towards of the increased taxation.,64
552,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already .expressed my views very strongly with regard to direct taxation, and I need not dilate upon that point. First of all, we are called upon to provide the funds necessary for the payment of old-age pensions. As I was previously pointed out, the persons whom we are seeking to benefit cannot raise a cry before the doors of Parliament. All that they can do is to rely upon the promises of politicians, and tliese have been broken time and again. We all say that Gowe are in favour of old-age pensions.",64
553,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And no one pretends that it is constantly impossible to provide for them.,64
554,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . We are paying high salaries to our officials, and are prothe viding hundreds of thousands of pounds which to assist strangled industries. We do not hear difficulties suggested the when proposals are made to increase by some hundreds of pounds. But when a big question of this kind is under consideration, every constitutional point is taken, largely because those who were eligible for pensions in the two largest States of the Union have already been provided for. I say that this proposal is the most important one that has yet claimed the attention of Parliament, and that we should seek ample powers to enable us to legislate in respect of it during the first session of the next Parliament.  to put the honourable member for Hindmarsh right in regard to this matter. We are accustomed to hear him boast of his labour proclivities, and of his desire to uphold the platform upon which he was elected. I wish to draw his attention to one particular plank in that platform which he has evidently forgotten, namely, the referendum. This Bill provides for a direct appeal to the people upon the question of old-age pensions. honourable member votes against it he will be voting against the referendum, which is one of the main planks in the Labour platform.",64
555,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall vote against it.  bei will have to answer to his organization for having violated his pledges, and I will see that it calls him to account. used the question of old-age pensions as a placard quite long enough. In a previous session dust was thrown into the eyes of the electors by the appointment of an Old-Age Pensions Commission. It was a perfect farce to appoint such a body, seeing that seventy out of seventy-five members of this House are in favour of the payment of old-age pensions. The only five members who are opposed to the Commonwealth initiating a national scheme are Conservatives representing. Victoria. One of my planks at the last elections was old age pensions. I desired to secure the payment of pensions to those who had borne the heat and burden of the day in western Queensland.",65
556,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why have not the Queensland Government provided them  idea. The referendum is one of the main planks of the Labour platform, and I tend to vote for the Bill upon that ground alone.",65
557,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Werriwa) [10.56] would point out to the honourable member [,66] for Maranoa that a referendum is always taken upon matters of general policy, and not upon matters of detail. The Bill under consideration relates to a subject in respect of which two-thirds of the people of Australia have already pronounced their opinions. If the honourable member chooses to declare himself in favour of it, he is at liberty to do so. 'But he must not imagine that the Bill provides for the taking of a referendum upon the subject of old age pensions. It merely provides for submitting to the people a proposed amendment of the Constitution, which involves the question of whether this Parliament shall be empowered to levy special duties and to appropriate the revenue therefrom for the purpose of paying old-age pensions to those persons who are eligible to receive them, but who have not vet been provided for.  If the enough; let us have something practical.",65
558,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are a dozen ways in which the necessary funds can be raised. If we arrived at an arrangement with New South Wales and Victoria, we should not require to raise more than an additional £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £600,000 to enable us to pay old-age pensions throughout the remainder of the States.",65
559,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Only about oneWe have fourth of the persons who are entitled to old-age pensions are not already in receipt of them.,65
560,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then this Bill is a piece of wild electioneering, and does not represent a policy which .has been framed with a view to serious consideration. For these reasons, I have no hesitation in opposing the Government proposal. I hope that honourable members will recognise that according to the statement made by the Prime Minister he is today looking chiefly to two duties to provide the necessary revenue.",65
561,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did not sav that he was.,65
562,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I accept the honourable member's assurance, but he would find himself in an awkward position if he as : serted later on that the Prime Minister had ? made no such statement, and the honourable and learned gentleman were able to show that he had. I take it that the honourable inand learned gentleman has foreshadowed the additional items which he thinks must be subjected to taxation for this purpose. II do not feel called upon to support any proposal which would require me later on to vote for duties on tea and kerosene to niake provision for one-third-o r if the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh be correct-one-fourt h of the citizens of Australia for whom old-age pensions have not yet been provided. Such a tax would be borne chiefly by those who have already provided for old-age pensions. We ought to be able to devise a scheme which will not fal l on the people of those States.",65
563,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Boothby) [11.3] I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that we ought to exhaust all other possibilities of raising the revenue required for this purpose before we resort to special taxation. Every one will agree to that proposition, but it is admitted that in addition to any savings we might effect, we should still have to raise £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 to make up the sum required for this purpose.",66
564,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That the recommendation of the Old-age Pensions Commission.,66
565,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. seems to me that unless we accept the only possible means open to us-and this seems to be the only means-of raising that additional sum, we shall render it impossible to establish old-age pensions for at least another three years'. In these circumstances, I think it is our bounden duty, if we are earnest in the desire to secure the passing of an old-age pension scheme, to vote'for the Government proposal.",66
566,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government scheme will involve the raising of an additional £1,200,000 or £1,500,000.",66
567,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows that if we had to raise thatadditional sum we could not do so by means of additional Customs taxation. We should be "" cribbed, cabined, and confined,"" and those who were anxious to see the adoption of an old-age pensions scheme,' would go on as heretofore-puttin g off the evil day, when such taxation should be imposed. I believe that we ought to carry out our promise to the electors to secure the establishment as early as possible of a system of old-age pensions, and that the proposal of the Government affords the only reasonable means of doing so.",66
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [rr.5] - The honourable member for Boothby asserts that the method proposed by ""the Government is the only one by which an old-age pensions system could be established. If I thought that it was, I should vote with the Ministry on this occasion. As a matter of fact, I do not believe that we should take a step that will involve raising by additional taxation the whole - of the money required to finance an old-age pensions scheme. We have it on official authority that only one-fourth of the people are not receiving pensions. Three-fourths of the people are being paid old-age pensions by the several States, and surelv the finding of the remaining fourth-, without any addition to our Constitutional powers, does not involve any supreme problem of statesmanship.",66
569,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [11.7]-- I do not propose to check 'the honourable member's calculations, although I believe they are mistaken. I will also assume that the honourable member is correct in his assertion that there is within our reach a practical means of prois on viding old-age pensions without resorting to that suggested by the Government. What I wish to emphasize is that by adopting the It Government proposal we shall not part with any other. Whatever means there are of providing for old-age pensions by financial re-arrangements, which to my mind are extremely improbable, all: of them would remain open to us as well. If such a rearrangement could be accomplished-and mv' present opinion is that! it could not- I would infinitely prefer it to the proposal now before us. Nothing bars the way except the want of unanimity among the States. Our proposition is put forward'as an alternative, as the one certain means to enable this question to be settled by the next Parliament if we are fortunate enough to obtain the assent of the electors to it. I hope that the honourable member for Barrier, in the light of these facts, will reconsider the opinion he has uttered to-night. If the people assent to the Bill, they will give us a power to exercise if all other means fail. We shall still possess any other means now open to us to make a re-adjustment of our financial responsibilities to enable old-age pensions to be provided. If such a re-adjustment can be made, we shall at the same time settle several other great problems and do a splendid work that we all desire to accomplish. But we desire to have this power in reserve in order that if other ambitions are foiled we shall not have to postpone for another four years the granting of old-age pensions.",66
570,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hindmarsh) [11.8}. - Tw o or three other means, open to us to raise the necessary funds ought to be exhausted before we touch the Customs duties.",67
571,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That will be for the re-r presentatives of the people to decide.,67
572,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We still have a portion of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue ir. hand, although 1 admit that it is diminishing. I was from the first a member of the Labour Party in South Australia,' and although that party was a protectionist one, it had as one of the planks of its platform a provision that no duty should be imposed on tea, coffee, cocoa, kerosene, or other articles which could not be grown or manufactured in the State. That plank remained in their platform until 1901, but if the Prime Minister's proposal be carried, we shalh raise the bulk of the sum necessary for ' old-age pensions by means of duties on two of the articles mentioned. I quite agree that if the Parliament is given power to say that tihe necessary funds shall be raised in that way, we shall keep back the imposition of direct taxation. I know of no section of the House outside the Labour Party which is prepared to impose a national land tax. I therefore think that the Government should first make an effort to obtain the necessary funds for that purpose from other sources, and that no difficulty would be experienced in making good, by means of Customs duties, any slight deficiency. .
