The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is an urgent need to ensure that the living dard of pensioners will not decline, as indeed, the present level of cash benefits in real terms requires upward adjustment beyond indexation related to the movement of the Consumer Price Index.

Raise all pensions and benefits to at least 30 per cent the Average Weekly Earnings. 3.

Taxation To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proportion of pensionable people within our . Pensions community is increasing at a significant rate. The number of people over 65 years old will rise from approximately 8.5 per cent of the population as it was in 1970 to over 10 per cent by 1990 and about 16 per cent by the year 2020. That technological change is accelerating the trend stan- towards earlier retirement from the workforce. That the above factors make incentives for self-provision in retirement years a matter of great urgency if future generations of Australians are to be spared the crippling taxation which would be necessary to fund such provisions from social welfare. That Australia is in urgent need of locally raised investment capital for national development and that life inof surance and superannuation funds are imponant mobilisers of such capital. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Government will forthwith take the steps necessary to: (a) Remove contributions paid by the taxpayer to superannuation funds from the rebate system and make them a separate deduction from assessable income. (b) Allow as such deduction amounts necessary to provide the individual with a reasonable retirement benefit as defined from time totimeby the Commissioner of Taxation.

Your petitioners therefore pray: That the National Women's Advisory Council be abolished to ensure that Australian women have equal opportunity with Australian men of having issues of concern to them considered, debated and voted on by their Parliamentary representatives without intervention and interference by an unrepresentative ""Advisory Council''.

Your petitioners note that because Western Australia has a dual roll system, some people may find themselves enrolled at a Federal level but not at a State level. Your petitioners funher note that the Federal Government committed itself to equal voting rights for Aborigines at State and Federal level following an urgency motion in Federal Parliament in 1979. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Federal Government will use the powers granted it by the 1967 referendum to ensure that Aboriginal voters are not disadvantaged in Western Australia.

Taxation To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That contributions to Health Insurance Funds should be tax deductible as it is inequitable for some members of the community to be able to claim taxation relief for health care costs, whereas other taxpayers are denied the right to claim relief for the expenditure of income in the provision of insurance against sinular costs. It is contended that it is imperative for incentive to be given by way of taxation deductibility to encourage membership of Health Insurance Funds on a long term basis or both they and the Public Health Sector will become subject to abuses which could seriously affect their ability to provide an economic and efficient service to the community. as members of the Queensland Teachers' Union Health therefore seek early action by the Government to restore income tax deductions for contributions by taxpayers to citizens of Australia health insurance funds. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, ACT School's Authority by Mr Jull. Petition received.

The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That a grave threat to the life of refugees from the various States of lndo-China arises from the policies of the Government of Vietnam. That, as a result of these policies, many thousands of refugees are fleeing their homes and risking starvation and drowning. Because of the failure of the rich nations of the world to provide more than token assistance, the resources of the nations of first refuge, especially Malaysia and Thailand, are being stretched beyond reasonable limits. As a wealthy nation within the region most affected, Australia is able to play a major part in the rescue as well as resettlement of these refugees. It should be possible for Australia to: - establis h and maintain on the Australian mainland basic transit camps for the housing and processing of 200,000 refugees each year; - mobilis e the Defence Force to search for, rescue and transport to Australia thoserefugeeswho have been able to leave the lndo-China States; - accep t the offer of those resettle some thousands of refugees in Australia. The adoption of such a humane policy would have a marked effect on Australia's standing within the region. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Shipton. Petition received.

We urge you to implement thisrequestthrough your Minister for Social Security.

We now urge you to act in another area of discrimination to handicapped persons byIncreasing the $20.00 per week income allowed in a sheltered workshop to $40.00 per week, before that income begins to reduce pension benefits; and then tie the $40.00 per week level with C.P.I./pension adjustments in the future. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you act in this area of discrimination to handicapped persons by increasing the $20.00 per week income allowed in a sheltered workshop to $40.00 per week, before that income begins to reduce pension benefits; and then tie the $40.00 per week level with C.P.I./pension adjustments in the future. pray that there be no extenAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Shipton. Petition received. Liquefied Petroleum Gas Refugees To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we object to locally produced Low Pressure Gas being placed at world parity prices which is causing the cost of L.P.G. to be an item inflated out of all proportion and an unfair cost burden to all users in rural areas. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the policy of locally produced L.P.G. being placed at world parity prices be abolished. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Short. Petition received. Olympic Games To the Right Honourable Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled.

Citizen Military Forces: Long Service and Good The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) On 14th February, 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the Officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval MUitary and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and meritorious voluntary service in the Citizen forces: (2) The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition the Citizen forces in that it recognises the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services: (3) This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of their spate time outside their normal full dme civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia: (4) The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognized by the present Government as a valuable-and cost-effective-componen t of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whUst the Government is actually supporting recruiting for continued this deprivation which as foresaid has depressed the morale of the Citizen Forces: (5) Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray Your Honourable House take appropriate sume the award of the several distinctive and historic Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Citizens Military Force (Army Reserve) and Citizens Air Force.

17,Mr HAYDEN,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer to certain rather puzzling aspects of the way in which the Fortescue oil field was classified as a new oil field and of unanswered questions on this matter raised by the honourable members for Hawker and Werriwa in this Parhament. Is the Prime Minister aware that, on the basis of documents pubUcly released by the Government, the only evidence upon which the declaration of Fortescue as a new oU field was made was on the data suppUed by the Esso-BHP company, which is scarcely a disinterested party in the matter? Is it a fact that, according to the Government's documents, the only independent data used provided by the Bureau of Mineral Re-, sources is inconsistent with the evidence and claims submitted by Esso? Further, is he aware that a leading Austrahan geologist, Mr Colin Laing, has pubUcly declared that on the evidence avaUable Fortescue is indisputably part ofan old oUfield?Does the declaration of Fortescue as a new oU field mean that under his Government's policies Esso-BHP will net an extra $ 1,000m in 1985 alone, above what it would have received had Fortescue been declared an old oU field? Therefore, I ask: WUl the Prime Minister immediately review this extraordinary and apparently scandalous situation whereby the GovernmentMONICA",23
18,Mr SPEAKER,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,Order! The honourable member wtil cease using words of that nature. He is entitled to ask for information but not to categorise the preface to his question hi that form.,23
19,Mr HAYDEN,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,Will the Prime Minister immediately review this situation whereby the Government has provided for a $1 billion bonanza for Esso-BHP at the expense of the Australian people by ignoring independent evidence and accepting advice provided only by the companies?,23
20,Mr ANTHONY,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"The question of making a a determination of whether a field is a new one is a very significant question, particularly if the field has any relationship to what are classified as old fields. The question of Fortescue, therefore, was a very important one and one that needed to be examined thoroughly. The Government used the full resources of the Bureau of Mineral Resources to assist it in making a determination as to whether it was a separate field. The advice that has been given to the Government is that it was classified as a completely separate development. I know the Australian Labor Party would, of course, like to make as much capital as possible out of these things to try to discredit the Government.",23

25,Mr SPEAKER,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,There was a reflection upon the Deputy Prime Minister.,23
26,Mr HAYDEN ,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"It was a reflection on the party and I do not believe I should have to withdraw. You have held, Mr Speaker, on many occasions in this House, as have your predecessors, that while on the one hand a reflection directed to a person in this House has to be drawn, that does not apply to a collective group, an entity. You have certainly applied that principle to this side of the House. I referred to his party.",23

44,Mr ANTHONY,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,It is quite obvious that the Labor Party feels very guilty about its own energy pohcies and the lack of exploration and development that took place during its period in office. Development in Bass Strait came to a halt under the Labor Government.,24

48,Mr SPEAKER,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,My ruling is this: The words used by the right honourable gentleman were not unparliamentary. The words used were to the effect that the Labor Party must feel guilty about its lack of exploration. I do not find in that any imputation of dishonesty or anything of the kind.,24
49,Mr ANTHONY,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"Everybod y in this country knows that one of the greatest legacies of the Labor Party was its complete and utter failure to give any stimulus to oil exploration and development in this country. Since we came to office we have seen progress taking place, particularly in Bass Strait, where the reserves have been upgraded as a result of further exploration. We are getting more oil from Bass Strait as a result of sensible, practical policies being implemented. TEXTILE INDUSTRY: PRICING NA",24

Mr Speaker, if it is compatible for the Prime Minister to receive questions-that is, fixed questions or pre-arranged questions-and to deliver homilies to the Australian Olympic Federation, for which body he is not responsible, surely on the same basis he can accept and respond to a question concerning his mentor and patron, Rupert Murdoch Of the Daily Telegraph.",24

Have State governments given sufficient support to the Scheme? Is the level of intake adequate to meet anticipated demand from major industrial developments currently proceeding and from those proposed in the next decade?,25

Since the introWales. duction of the CRAFT program at the beginning of 1977 apprenticeship intakes have been sistendy over 41,000 in each of the subsequent years, compared with approximately 36,000 the years prior to the introduction of the CRAFT program. That is an increase of 14 per cent. Since 1977 about $74m has been provided by the Commonwealth in financial assistance to emfurther ployers. So it can be seen very clearly that since the introduction of the CRAFT program, along with other economic factors that have been involved, the CRAFT program has supported an increase in the number of apprentices taken on each year. That is, of course, very important at this when we are facing a tremendous demand for ing qualified tradesmen for the massive project dewas: velopment that will get under way in the 1980s. Nevertheless, the Metal Trades Industry Associing ation of Australia has estimated that a further drinks? 3,000 tradesmen above normal requirements will be needed to cope with the demand from that kind of development. The 3,000 will not able to be provided during that period from the normal intakes of qualifying apprentices in alcohol Australia. That makes it abundantly clear that service. industry, unions and the Commonwealth need to embark upon special programs, to use special ways, to see that the apprenticeship needs of Austraha are satisfied. The honourable gentleman, I am sure, will interested in the position in New South Wales. worth Since the introduction of the CRAFT program in 1977, apprenticeship intakes in New South Wales have increased from an average of around 12,000 in the years prior to 1977 to an average of over 16,000. That is an increase of over 33 per cent. I am sure the honourable member for Sydney, who was seeking to interject, will be very interested to know of that increase. My great regret is that recently the New South Wales Premier sought to attack the Commonwealth for failing to take initiatives. But I think thefiguresI have mentioned and the financial support that has been given through the CRAFT program show that the Premier was quite wrong in his attack. I conclude on this note: It was much to my regret and much to the regret of my predecessor, the Minister for Industrial Relations, that from time of his first approach to the New South apWales Government in 1978 it took two years for Government to respond positively at the beof this year to the overtures made by the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance emin meeting the needs of industry in New South It was not until early 1980, when I initiated further discussions through my officers, conthat the New South Wales Government responded. I hope that now the New South in Wales Government will respond positively to these initiatives. I have every reason to believe that Mr Wran did not know what he was talking about when he made his speech. Had he made inquiries through his departments, he would have found out the truth of the matter. NA NA",25
59,Dr KLUGMAN,AIRCRAFT,"I remind the Minister for Transport of a question which I asked in this time House on 29 April and which referred to drinkon aircraft. The very last part of my question Will he at least stop airlines from encouraging the drinkof alcohol on aircraft by eliminating free and cheap The Minister's answer appeared in the Hansard of 14 May. The Minister, in talking about Ausbe tralian internal airlines, stated, inter alia: Also, neither airline permits passengers to consume in flight other than that purchased from the bar I draw the Minister's attention to a full page advertisement by Trans-Australia Airlines in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald-whic h obviously is filling up space because of the be journalists' strike-headed 'Can you drink $40 of drinks in two hours?' It states, inter alia: What this means is that if you're a businessman and choose to fly first class Sydney/Melbourne return with the other airline, for the sake of those free drinks are actually costing you $44.30. The advertisement concludes: Even then, we still recommend youflyTAA. Because, in addition to our 25 per cent price reduction, we're now offering free drinks infirstclass as well . . . Can the Minister see any inconsistency between this advertisement by TAA and his answer that people have to purchase their drinks when flying on Australian internal airlines?",25

61,Mr SPEAKER,AIRCRAFT,It drew attention to a considerable amount of advertising that appeared in the newspaper.,26

64,Mr HUNT,AIRCRAFT,"No, I cannot drink $40 worth of grog in two hours and I do not think that the honourable member for Prospect can either. There are two schools of thought about drinking on aircraft. There are those who do not believe in the consumption of alcohol at any price and there are those who like to have a drink on an aircraft. I hope that I would not be sufficiently narrow-minded to introduce in this country a system that would stop the serving of alcohol on aircraft.",26

70,Mr FISHER,WHEAT SALES TO SOVIET UNION,"I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether he heard a story on this mornAustralia ing's Australian Broadcasting Commission news in regard to sales of Australian wheat to the Soviet Union. If so, is the story correct? the free drinks they offer, then",26
71,Mr NIXON,WHEAT SALES TO SOVIET UNION,"The story, as presented by the ABC, can be described only as a beat-up and a sheer and blatant deception-n o more and no less. I go further in respect of the story itself: The reporter who apparently placed the story sought clarification from my office and was given it, but the ABC failed to use it. Furthermore, I gave an interview for AM that clarified the story again; but, for some unaccountable reason that is beyond my wisdom or knowledge, that story did not run either. The reaUty is that the ABC knows full well that this is a very important quesuon. I would have thought that it would be more than ordinarily careful in establishing the facts. So that there will be no misunderstanding, let me re-establish for the information of honourable members, who I know are desperately interested in this question, what the facts are. It was public knowledge that I met grain exporting representatives after they had had a meeting in Canberra on 9 May. As a result of that meeting I undertook to go to the Government and seek clarification on whether exporters who normally enter into forward contracts at this time of the year for the next crop could do so now as an interim measure in respect of a proportion of that crop. The Government decided that, as the meeting of grain exporting nations was to be held in Brussels between 19 and 21 May and as the Australian delegation subsequently would have to report back to the Government, which would then have to consider its position, as an interim measure those exporters who traditionally contract at this time of the year could contract for up to 25 per cent of their total open-destination shipments in 1979-80 prior to the Government's finally determining its position in regard to the next year's crop. AU of the amount up to 25 per cent contracted at thistimeis to be counted against total sales to the Soviet Union. Exporters individually must provide evidence to the Government that normally they enter into such forward contracts at thistimeof the year. In other words, up to 25 per cent of an exporting body's total shipments to Russia in the 1979-80 financial year can be contracted for now, if that exporting body can provide evidence that this is the traditional time for entering mto such forward contracts. This is totally consistent with the Government's policy on grain sales to the Soviet Union. Along with other Western nations, as part of our measured response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, has given an undertaking not to make up any of the shortfall of 17 million tonnes of grain that the United States has withheld from the Soviet market. That is the undertaking that we gave to the United States and it remains the undertaking. We have never said that we would not allow normal sales to continue. The ABC news this morning referred to the Federal Government's approval for wheat sales, not grain sales, to the Soviet Union. Mr Armitage-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister has been making this present statement for some considerable time. He has now turned over to the next page of his notes. can see from here that he has at least another full page to read. I ask that he be required to make statement at the end of Question Time.",26
72,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT SALES TO SOVIET UNION,There is no point of order. regard the issue that has been raised as a sigsignificantly nificant one. The question has been asked and must be answered. I ask the Minister to draw answer to a conclusion as soon as possible.,27
73,Mr NIXON,WHEAT SALES TO SOVIET UNION,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The that ABC news this morning referred to the Federal Government's approval for wheat sales, not grain sales, to the Soviet Union. The fact of the matter is that this interim measure does not apply at all to wheat; it apphes only to coarse grains such as barley, sorghum and oats. The ABC reported that growers had been given the: . . . green light to sell the equivalent of 25 per last year's bumper harvest to the Soviet Union over the 12 months. That report is totally and completely incorrect. The fact is that that figure relates to of last year's coarse grain sales contracted to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I repeat that the reality is that the story is a total misrepresentation of the facts. NA",27
74,Mr WILLIS,ECONOMIC GROWTH,"I address my question to the Treasurer. It concerns a statement by counsel the Government in the current national wage case in which he stated: Net exports could make a negative contribution to product growth in 1980-81. He also stated: In these circumstances the growth in the Australian omy in 1980-81 will be more dependent on domestic sources of expansion than it has been in the current year. Is the Treasurer aware that the annualised rate growth of the domestic sector of the economythat is, gross domestic product minus exportsfor the first half of 1979-80 was only 0.7 per In view of this extremely low growth of the domfrom estic sector and the Government's anticipation negative growth in the export sector next year, the Treasurer alarmed by the apparent prospect of there being little or no growth in the Australian economy in 1980-81?",27
75,Mr HOWARD,ECONOMIC GROWTH,"I am grateful to the honourable member for Gellibrand for drawing my attention to that section of the Commonwealth's submission. I will look at the context in which those remarks were made. I say to the honourable member for GelUbrand that all of the evidence avaUable to me and to the Government at indicates that exports are experiencing a very significant Uft during the current year. In I fact, exports were something like 38 per cent greater in the first eight months of this year than a in the corresponding period last year. The fact that our export sector has grown in such a reI markable fashion has enabled us to reduce very the volume of overseas borrowings. That reminds me that earlier this year the his honourable member spoke in debates on matters of pubUc importance, as did his leader, saying this country was getting itself further and further into international debt by having to borrow large amounts of money overseas to supplement our current account deficit. The truth is that, because of the expansion of our export performance and because of the improved perceptions of overseas investors about the strength of the Australian economy, this Government will cent of borrow less than $500m on external account this next year, as against a total of $ 1,600m borrowed last year. The honourable member should not come into the House and try to imply that the external 25 per cent sector of our economy is weak. NA",27
76,Mr GRAHAM,SOVIET UNION,"My question, which I address to the Prime Minister, is related to the question answered this morning by the Minister for Primary Industry. Is there any inconsistency between the Government's policy on grain sales to for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Government's views on Australian participation in the Moscow Olympic Games?",27
77,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SOVIET UNION,"The Minister for Primary Industry has made it perfectly plain that the Government's position in relation to wheat econand grain sales has not altered from the original statement on this matter. Indeed, in the intervening months there have been a number of of occasions on which sales to the Soviet Union have been disaUowed because we regarded them as unusual and as sales that would have in fact cent? been picking up some of the shortfall arising the United States decision, and, of course, of we undertook not to do that. As my colleague has is pointed out, the suggestions in the media this moming, and from the Australian Broadcasting Commission in particular, that there is an open slather for wheat sales to the total and complete misrepresentation of the facts of the situation. What had been done in the first place does not relate to wheat whatsoever. In lation to wheat, our approach will be entirely consistent with our commitments earlier year. So far as coarse grains are concerned, my league has made it quite plain that the negomade, tiation that may be undertaken would relate only to 25 per cent of the sales that were made last year, and the exporters might well have expected that they would have been given permission to negotiate a much higher proportion than that. the Government has in fact taken a very hard position in allowing them to negotiate for only per cent of the sales that were made year. That is a very hard and tough position indeed, which is consistent with our overall position. It does not represent any change in the Government's view and is totally consistent with earlier statements. What we have said right from the outset in recalling lation to the Olympic Games has been judged the basis of what would bring the abhorrence the free world home to the Soviet Government and people more clearly and more firmly than anything else. Our views on that are well known. They have now been shown to have support not only in the United States of America and Canada but also in West Germany. In particular, throughout this period, Herr Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister, has been very outwtil be kept? spoken among European leaders. The House might be interested to know that Herr Genscher lived for a number of his early post-war years-up to 1953 or 1954-in East Germany and therefore has some personal experience of the Soviet system and of Soviet activities. The Soviets are digging in in Afghanistan. They are acting as though their position in country is not negotiable in any sense. They upgrading military capacities in Afghanistan, with clear strategic impUcations. This is a time when the free world needs to demonstrate that has a determined view on this matter, that it important to get a message through to the Soviet Union that further aggressions will meet the firmest possible resistance from the United States and those who support the United States and western Europe. Therefore, the Australian port for a boycott of the Olympic Games is, in view of the Government, an important matter going far beyond sport and going far beyond its effect on athletes, which we understand only too well. It is something which will have impUcations for the future of this nation and for all people in Soviet Union, is a this nation. Over recent times my colleague the Minister for Home Affairs has been keeping closely in retouch with the Olympic executive. We are advising the Olympic executive that the Minister for this Home Affairs and the Mmister for Foreign Affairs will hold themselves avaUable to talk colwith the executive before the final decision is if that should be the wish of the executive. If there is a need for any further clarification of Government views or attitudes or the position that has been adopted by other countries or other sporting bodies, the Ministers are available for So consultation with the executive. The Government plainly hopes that the view that it has taken 25 wtil be supported. We regard it as a matter of during last high national interest. NA",27
78,Mr HURFORD,PETROL RETAILING INDUSTRY,"The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs knows that for years small businessmen operating petrol outlets have been for legislation to protect their interests on from the predatory practices of major oil of companies. When wtil the Government at last introduce legislation to protect franchises for the petrol reselling industry and legislation relating to the other parts of the so-called Fife package? Can the Minister indicate whether the promises made by the Prime Minister at the last election, and the commitment made by the Minister's predecessor to make the legislation retrospective,",28
79,Mr GARLAND,PETROL RETAILING INDUSTRY,"I have had drawn to my attention remarks which the honourable member has made on radio programs and on other occasions and which, with respect, have not quite accurately illustrated the so-called commitments to which he has just referred. What I have said in this House on more than one that occasion, and I repeat it today, is that the are Government regards the position of the petrol dealers-the honourable member knows the definition of that term-ver y seriously. Some it months ago we asked the Trade Practices Comis mission to carry out an inquiry so that the Government could have in front of it a number of facts. There has been a great deal of conflicting information in this area. I am advised that that report wtil be ready in about a week. The supGovernment wtil examine that report, to see the what information is contained in it, before it makes a decision. We have already exposed a draft Bill regarding the franchise area. It was one of the three points mentioned by my predecessor. That exposed Bill, of course, has prompted a great number of representations, some of a technical kind and a number dealing with principles. The honourable member referred to the other elements. Other options are available to the Government, such as looking at the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. All those matters are before the Government. Mr Humphreys-You have been looking at it for a long time.",28
80,Mr GARLAND,PETROL RETAILING INDUSTRY,"That is true. The reason is that it is a very complicated situation and that different pohcies are pursued by oil companies and by dealers in different regions of Australia. We want to get the legislation right, so that it will have the effect which I think most members of this House want to see. The Government will be looking at the results of the Commission's report, I hope within a fortnight of receiving it, which will be in about three weeks time. I hope that it will make a decision based upon those elements and upon the statements which the Prime Minister and my predecessor really made, not those which many people are saying they made. Therefore, I expect that the Government will come to a conclusion about the matter quite soon. NA",29

85,Mr HUNT,COMPARISON BETWEEN PROPOSED AND,"Apparently the NRMA undertook some research to try to ascertain what the final result would be regarding the categories of local roads, rural arterial roads, and urban arterial roads. Quite clearly, the Commonwealth Government has increased the allocation to national roads and highways by 18.4 per cent; to rural arterial roads, by 11.1 per cent; and to urban arterial roads, by 11.1 per cent. It has increased the allocation to local roads-loca l government roads throughout Austraha-by 11.1 percent. Under the road safety program which the Commonwealth Government has funded for six years, a total of $74 million has been spent on road safety measures to overcome some of the backlog in that area. That progam has been suspended and the funds that were spent in the past this category have been transferred for spending on national roads in recognition of our conFedcern to increase expenditure on important road links serving industries in Western Australia, Queensland and elsewhere. It is quite futile for any organisation to say that in 1980-81 increase of 2 per cent will be made in relation to urban arterial roads. The NRMA has also made the suggestion that there will be a 4 per allocation to rural arterial roads. That is not correct.

The answer given stated that a government house had been sold to the I Honourable Sir Robert Cotton. It has smce been found that the answer was incorrect. That answer has hi fact been corrected in the other place. I wish to state that the information was provided by the Department of the Capital Territory. The error arose from confusion over Sir Robert's name and a person with a simUar name. I simply wish to correct that error and at the same time publicly apologise to Sir Robert for the embarrassment that may have occurred as a result of that answer and from subsequent pubUcity based on it in the Australian newspaper on 5 March 1980 which suggested that he had made big profits on house deals. It was alleged that he had acquired a house from the Government and sold it at a profit of over $20,000. APPOINTMENT OF SPEAKER: NA NA",32
113,Mr SPEAKER,SYSTEM,"I formaUy announce to the House the result of the ballot conducted by the Clerk last week on the question: Do you support the proposal that an all-party committee of the House should be established to report whether the Westminster convention concerning the Speaker could be adopted, the method of doing so, and when the system should commence? Eighty ballot papers were returned by the closing time of 6 p.m. on Thursday last. Of those 80 ballot papers 47 members voted in favour of the proposition, 32 voted against and there was one informal vote. A number of papers were received after the close of the baUot but were not included. Pursuant to that vote I will set up a Speaker's committee consisting of members of both sides of the House to report on the matter. Today I will write to the three party Whips asking for the nomination of members.

This generalisation which has been made must be wrong. It is well understood that you, Mr Speaker have 'but the eyes to see and the ears to hear what the House doth command'. Therefore if the House does not choose the person who thinks he is going to be Speaker but selects another member to take the chair, that is the prerogative of the House. That prerogative cannot be overruled and must never be overruled. There is no prescriptiverightfor a Speaker to remain in the chair.

122,Mr HAYDEN,SYSTEM,"I have not finished. I welcome this, if it is achievable, because of the difficulties of the present system which I acknowledge. I acknowledge your efforts in this respect, Mr Speaker, and your efforts in many other respects associated with the procedures of this institution and your endeavours to achieve some sort of reform. If these are to be terms of reference I presume there will be an opportunity for me to move an amendment. I started to say to you that I had communicated to you, pointing out that we see a far greater need to have a comprehensive review of this Parliament-ho w it functions, the facilities which back it up and so on. There is a crying need for reform of procedures in this House. I have to say, having participated on both sides of the House, that Question Time comes more within the description of a game and has rules more akin to warfare than to the development of legislation or a proper search into matters dealt with by the Parliament. We need a committee system to replace this debating technique. I am giving you an insight, Mr Speaker, into a few of the vast range of concerns which I beheve should be attended to by this Pariiament if it really wants to drag the Parliament as an effective institution into the last part of the twentieth century in preparation for the next century.",33

Any attitude that the honourable the gentleman may have concerning reform of the procedures of this House is a matter which he be needs to discuss with the Leader of the House or about which, alternatively, he can move a motion in this House. It is necessary periodically at any institution to see whether it is responding fully to contemporary needs. I would welcome such an examination of the procedures the House although I emphasise that I would see that exercise as different from that exercise now in hand. The matter now in hand is an expression by the members of the Parliament, as be members of the Parliament not as members of pohtical parties. I think an examination on a procedural basis would require co-operation on a political basis.

127,Mr SPEAKER,SYSTEM,"All members were entitled to record their votes. My information, as conveyed to me by the Leader of the Opposition, was that members of the Austrahan Labor Party opted not to vote, although I believe some small number in fact did vote before the decision not to vote was taken in the Labor Party Caucus. Accordingly, those who did not vote decided to do so for a reason which I am not privy to, although it comes out in a letter to me by the Leader of the Opposition referred to in the remarks he made today. Apparently members of the Australian Labor Party collectively believed that there was a need for greater reform than that which I proposed. I dealt with that this morning as it was raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Eighty people voted. As the honourable gentleman knows a clear majority of 47 voted in favour of the proposition of a committee and 32 voted against the proposal.

NA COMMISSIONS 1981 Ministerial Statement",34
128,Mr FIFE ,GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATION,"Farrer-Minister for Education) - by leave-The purpose of this statement is to announce levels of funding for the programs of the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Eduincreased. cation Commission for the calendar year 1981. These programs will be a major part of the Government's support for education in the tained States and the Northern Territory and together will amount to expenditure of $2,141.8m in 1981, compared with $2,136.6m in 1980 in conare stant estimated December 1979 prices. I remind honourable members of the funding role of the Commonwealth through the commissions' programs. The Commonwealth has full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education, but exercises a 'topping up' role in the funding of schools and technical and further education in the States and the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth is currently providing about 25 per cent of total expenditure on technical and further education and about 12 per cent of expenditure on government schools. The States have increased thenexpenditure on education in accordance with their own priorities. The Commonwealth exercises a major financial responsibility for nongovernment schools and is currently providing about 60 per cent of total recurrent support from governments. Whilst all State governments provide recurrent support for non-government schools, the Commonwealth is the sole source of public assistance with capital grants. The total funding of education must be seen as a joint effort of the Commonwealth and the States, in addition to resources contributed from the private sector. Public expenditure on education is expected to grow to $6.5 billion in 1979-80, an increase of more than 6 per cent in real terms since 1976-77. The rapid growth in enrolments across the to whole education sector, which made such a heavy demand on resources in the 1960s and early 1970s, has now eased. Student numbers overall are tending to stabilise, but there are still increases in some sectors. School enrolments declined for the first time in 1979 and are proto continue to decline until the late 1980s. Within the overall trend for schools, there was a decline in government school numbers last year, whilst in non-government schools there was a small rise. Enrolments in universities and colleges of advanced education have largely stabilised. In the technical and further education sector there has been some growth in enrolments. All recurrent programs will be maintained at no less than their present levels and some have been In the schools sector additional funds are to be directed to areas of need. Expenditure in technical and further education wtil be mainat the priority level established in 1980. In summary, the following funds will be provided in 1981 in comparison with 1980. These figures expressed in estimated December 1979 price levels. Estimated December 1979 price levels Universities and Colleges of Advanced Educauon Technical and Further Education Schools These funds will continue to be adjusted for movements in costs in accordance with the existeducation ing cost supplementation arrangements. estimated Honourable members should also note that, as result of the Transition from School Program, announced on 22 November 1979, some $ 11 m is available for projects in the technical and further education sector in 1980. Depending on State contributions, significant funding will continue to be provided by the Commonwealth for technical .and further education in 1981 under this program. Tertiary Education Recurrent funds for universities and colleges of advanced education for 1981 have previously been determined by the Government as part of the fixed triennial arrangements which we reintroduced in 1979-81. Recurrent funds have been maintained at a constant level for the triennium thereby enabling institutions to sustain existing levels of intake. Capital and equipment funds all sectors of tertiary education are provided an annual basis. The guidelines include recurrent support for technical and further education 1981. Since 1981 is the final year of the present triennium, the Government has decided to conStates sider the provision of funds for technical and further education on a triennial basis in the text of the 1982-84 report of the Tertiary Eduwill cation Commission. Because of a reduced comthis area. mitment to ongoing works, the total funds available in 1981 for capital and equipment in universities and colleges of advanced education will be lower than in 1980. However the allocation will make it possible for funds to be proevaluative vided for a number of new projects. In the guidelines last year pressed its concern that the Tertiary Education Commission should continue to monitor carefully the use and allocation of resources. In cooperation with the States, the Commission has already taken initiatives in teacher education. The Government will continue to look to the Commission to provide ongoing advice on the relationship of manpower supply to areas which are critical for education planning. I turn now to the details of the guidelines for the Tertiary Education Commission for 1981. 1980 1981 $m $m Tertiary Education Commission Guidelines The total funds allocated for tertiary education 1,297.6 1,279.9 151.6 153.3 include provision for the Australian National 687.4 708.6 University, the Canberra College of Advanced Education, the Australian Maritime College, ap2,136.6 2,141.8 proved non-government teachers colleges and technical and further education in the States and the Northern Territory. All figures for tertiary in this statement are expressed in December 1979 price levels; the cost a supplementation arrangements to apply for 1981 to Work will be the same as for 1980. Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education For 1981, the Government has allocated $82.7m as the total level of funds for capital grants and equipment grants. From this amount, the Government intends that the Commission should meet commitments to on-going capital projects and also make provision for a number of new projects of the highest priority. Technical and Further Education Funds amounting to $61.8m will be provided for general and specific purpose recurrent programs in 1981. A total capital program of for $91.5m will be funded by the Commonwealth in on 1981, including $ 17.9m for the third year of the supplementary $50m grant. In co-operation with for the States, the Commission is asked to recommend the distribution of resources among the and the Northern Territory, having regard to their degrees of need and on the understandconing that the States and the Northern Territory at least maintain fully their own efforts in Tertiary Education A provision of $0.4m has also been made for studies in all tertiary areas in 1981. The Government will provide the following base level of funds for tertiary education for 1981 as the Government excompared with 1980: NA PROGRAMS 1980-81 (Est.

For the year 1981 the Commission is asked to make detailed recommendations on the allocations of capital grants and equipment grants between universities and colleges of advanced education and for technical and further education in the States and the Northern Territory. The Commission is asked to submit its report by 31 July 1980 to permit time for consideration of its recommendations and passage of the necessary legislation during the Budget sittings of the Parhament. For schools in the States and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth will provide an additional $21.2m, or 3.1 per cent, in real terms in 1981. The Government has decided to provide the same real levels of general recurrent grants and capital grants for government schools in the States and the Northern Territory as in 1980. The Commonwealth will thus be continuing to maintain its level of support for the staffing and other recurrent resources already achieved by government school systems. It will be recalled that government schools in all States were expected to have reached by the end of 1979 the recurrent resource use targets affirmed by the Schools Commission, and that government school enrolments are now declining overall. For non-government schools in 1981 the Government according to the pohcy of previous years, will supplement 1980 grants in order to maintain the percentage hnk between recurrent grants for non-government schools and government school costs. For non-government schools in level 6, the most needy category, the Commonwealth will also raise its subsidies by a further one percentage point in 1981 to 35 per cent of average government schools standard costs at primary level and to 33 per cent at sec1980 1981 ondary level, representing an estimated ad100.4 82.7 ditional $11 per primary pupil and $18 per secondary pupil. The new levels of subsidies are estimated at $384 per primary pupil and $577 per secondary pupil, in estimated December 43.3 45.0 1979 prices. Estimated average government 16.8 16.8 schools standard costs in 1981, in constant prices, 91.5 91.5 are $ 1,098 per primary pupil and $ 1,748 per secondary pupil. Honourable members will recall 151.6 153.5 that non-government schools in level 6 continue to operate with resources some 30 per cent below 0.4 0.4 the average resources of government schools. . . 1,257.3 1,259.0 The estimated total additional cost of these 191.9 174.2 measures is $ 16.2m. As with government schools, the general capital program for non-government schools in 1981 will be maintained at the existing level in real terms. However, to enhance the forward planning capacity of non-government school authorities which are continuing to be faced with demands for new schools and expanded facilities, the Government will introduce new arrangements in 1981 to raise the permitted levels of forward commitment into the second and third years to 90 per cent per annum of the level in the base year. The year 1981 will be the third year of the Galbally committee program for increased fundSCHOOLS ing of migrant and multi-cultural education. Funds for the Galbally program in 1981 will be doubled, representing an increase of $5m on the 1980 level of the program administered by the Schools Commission. Within this program, an additional $3.4m will be allocated for the teaching of EngUsh language in government and nongovernment schools with a further $ 1.6m for the support of activities specifically related to education for a multi-cultural society. These increases wiU permit some further restructuring to overcome disparities in the existing distribution among systems of the English language section of the program and will provide support for the range of activities referred to in the report of the Galbally committee. Schools Commission Guidelines The Government will provide grants totalling $708.6m as the base level of the programs of the Schools Commission in the States and the Northern Territory in 1981. This program comprising $ 132.9m capital and $575.7m recurrent, represents an increase of 3.1 per cent in real terms on the total base level program for 1980. As in the past, the precise level of grants may be varied in accordance with the actual level of enrolments in non-government schools. All figures for schools in this statement are expressed in estimated December 1979 price levels; the cost supplementation arrangements to apply for 19.81 will be the same as for 1980. Government Schools Programs The Government will provide $369.7m in total for government school programs in 1981. The combined amount provided for the general recurrent and capital programs of $311.3m is the same, in real terms, as the 1980 level. During consultations with the Schools Commission, the States will be able to request transfers of marginal amounts between these programs. The base Commission is asked to make recommendations about the distribution of general recurrent and with 1980. capital grants among the States and for the Northern Territory. The allocations for disadvantaged schools and special education will be at the same real levels as in 1980. There will be a net increase of $2.3m as additional Galbally funding in the migrant education program. Non-Government Programs The Commonwealth will provide $312.1m as the base level of programs for non-government schools in 1981, including $l.lm additional Galbally funding for migrant education, and will continue the provisions for disadvantaged schools, emergency assistance and special education in non-government schools at the same real levels as in 1980. The funds provide for (a) maintenance of the linkage between recurrent grants to all non-government schools and standard government school running costs; (b) additional assistance for those schools in greatest need: Those in level 6. They will be enabled to reach a Commonwealth subsidy of 35 per cent of government schools costs at primary level and 33 per cent at secondary level; and .(c) maintenance in 1981 of the current 1980 percentage levels of grants in levels 1 to 5 schools. The Government will amend the existing advance approvals scheme to enable nongovernment school authorities to receive advance approvals of building projects to a value, in real terms, of 90 per cent of the capital program for a year in respect of the following two years. Joint Programs Within this area, the Government will provide an increased allocation of $ 1.6m in 1981 for multicultural education. Funding for other joint programs will be maintained at existing levels. The Commission is asked to submit its report by 31 July 1980 to permit time for consideration of its recommendations and passage of the necessary legislation during the Budget sittings of the Parhament.

129,Mr FIFE,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"I present the following paper Guidelines for Education Commissions 1981 - Ministeria l Statement, 22 May 1980. Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",37
130,Dr CASS ,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"Maribyrnong) (12.2)-Overall, the statement that has been made by the Minister for Education ( Mr Fife) on behalf of the Government demonstrates once again the Government's lack of real concern for education; its policy of downgrading education instead of using it as an instrument for the betterment of the Australian population and society generally. I believe the statement is designed to give effect to the Government's pohcy of elitism without stirring up more opposition than is necessary. It is a sort of lick and a promise of paint on the surface. Even before these proposals have been implemented it will begin to peel and to expose the genuinely run down nature of the education system in many areas. In regard to the tertiary area, I have not been able to find any obvious initiatives which one might have expected to arise from the Williams report. As honourable members will recall, that Committee was set up in 1976 and its report was received in 1978 with enormous fanfare. One would have thought that if any of the proposals or ideas that arose from that report had been accepted or implemented, the Government would have trumpeted that fact, but there has been a deathly silence in that regard. The report seems destined for a quiet burial and to rank with the Vernon report of 1965 as one of the great dustgatherers of our time. Apropos of making comments on reports, I ask the Minister whether the Government intends to act on the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Nurse Education and Training? Is the Minister aware that if a decision on those recommendations is not made within the next month the Tertiary Education Commission will find it difficult, probably impossible, to make any grants for the next triennium based thereon. One hopes that the Minister will make a statement on the matter before that period expires. If not, the TEC probably will not be able to do anything about the report. Again, no mention has been made of the place of the proposed Defence Force Academy in all of this. Presumably it will cease to be a defence item in the same way as the Austrahan Maritime College is no longer considered a transport item. In fact, in his statement the Minister mentions the Australian Maritime College but not the Defence Force Academy, which presumably will be a college of the University of New South Wales. What is to be the source of its funding over the triennium? The Tertiary Education Commission has complained over a period of the squeeze on research funds. It looks as if that is to continue. much for the Government's concern for science and technology, for medical research measures that might help to contain the rapidly increasing cost of health care in this country. The Minister's statement mentions neither area. One feels some doubt and anxiety about the proposal to spend $400,000 on 'evaluative studies'. After all, did not the Williams inquiry make an evaluation of what was going on? Does not the TEC regularly evaluate what is going on? Are we to have still one more policeman approach to the whole education area? Will these funds be used to supervise the TEC studies or to conduct evaluative studies separate from those that are conducted by the Commission? One can suggest only that this proposal will raise the level of paranoia amongst academics, which is already pretty high as a result of this Government's policies. The guidelines ought to explain in more detail the Government's attitude in all of these areas. The Australian Labor Party, when in government, will certainly increase specific funding for research in universities. I do not think that any longer it can be just buried in general funding. We must make a particular effort in that area if this country is to maintain its position in a society that is rapidly becoming increasingly complex and in which the way out will be more and more technological innovation which, in turn, must spring from research and development in universities. The Government makes much of technical and further education, but in real terms grants nowhere enough funding for that purpose. We all know that for many years that particular sector has been rundown. Despite the effort that was initiated by the Labor Government, the backlog has still not been overcome. There is need for enormous funding for the replacement of quite hopeless buildings and facilities, yet in real terms capital grants have been frozen. Turning to the schools themselves, I say that once again the Government is hiding the real needs in the oversimplified statement that there is a decline in enrolments, that growth is levelling off. But the Schools Commission has pointed out that there is an enormous deficit in meeting capital needs. That deficit is becoming not less but greater. The requirement is not to freeze funding but to increase it. This arises for a variety of reasons. Let me provide an example. The population is moving around. In some areas it is ageing and in others it is becoming younger. I refer to growth areas such as Gosford-Wyong in New South Wales and the Gold Coast of Queensland. So These areas cannot provide for the needs of children without an enormous increase in capital expenditure. More schools are needed. One cannot simply shift kids to where the schools are. New schools must be built, yet in this constrained atmosphere there is to be totally inadequate funding for such purposes. I shall refer later, in speaking of the general education area, to other reasons why funding should be increased. Let me just touch on the problem of the disadpercent vantaged schools program, which has been stationary. In his statement, the Minister said: The allocations for disadvantaged schools and special education will be at the same real levels as in 1980. There has been no movement in that area for four years now, but the Schools Commission reschools peatedly has pointed to the need for increased effort. In the country areas program we have the same sort of problem. Those schools are, in sence, disadvantaged in exactly the same way. We need to increase the effort, not just maintain it. Let me elaborate that point by quoting from document entitled 'Education and the Country basis, Dweller', one of the Needs in Education series produced by Senator Button, the Labor Party's spokesman on education. It reads: It is essential to the quality of Australian life-fo omic, social, and national reasons-that we have strong, orous country communities. Governments must encourage famiUes to remain with and, indeed, move to provincial, rural and outback communities. A minimum condition, if this aim is to be achieved, must be to ensure that country communities have access to services in areas of health, communication, transport, community and welfare services and education equal to that avaUable to the city dweller. . . . The Schools Commission Repon for the 1976-78 Triennium published in June 1975 specifically examined the special needs of country chUdren. The document stated further: . . . where possible, educational opportunities should be brought to students, rather than that children and parents should be subsidised to live away from home. If we move them from the country to the city, the chances are that they will not ever want to go back. Of course, many of them cannot afford to take advantage of the opportunity to move to the city. In 1976 the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts published its report on its inquiry into the education of isolated children. It stated that better co-ordination between Federal and State governments in the education of isolated children is necessary particularly in the areas of transport facilities and so on. It made a very strong argument for increased support in this area by the Government. It has all been ignored in this statement. In fact, the shortfall between Government spending and the Comall mission's recommendations will be of the order of$8mbytheendof 1981. Let us revert to the link between subsidies to non-government schools and the costs of maintaining government schools. We are to have what seems to me to be the annual argument on this very vexed question. The Minister made the following comment in his speech: Honourable members will recall that non-government schools in level 6 continue to operate withresourcessome 30 below the average resources of government schools. That is precisely the case. Of course that need was ignored by the Liberal Government for many years. In the period leading up to the time when the Labor Party came to power, funds were made available for non-government but the bulk of those funds-to hazard a guess, more than 90 per cent-wen t to the rich schools and not to the poor schools. It was only esthe advent of the Labor Government and the establishment of the inquiry into education needs and the subsequent Karmel report, which a proposed the distribution of funds on a needs which led to a significant increase in funding for these sorts of schools. The need is still there-the Government admits it-ye t there is to be no substantial increase in the funding for these schools. There is to be some increase- I r econmust acknowledge that the Government has viggranted a minor increase-for level 6 schoolsMr Fife-Significant .",38
131,Dr CASS,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"Well , it is not significant in terms of need. Of course, the Government continues to increase funding for the richer schools. The whole position remains lopsided. The fact is, sadly, that this Government will maintain the elitist nature of the better schools not only in the government sector but also in the non-government sector particularly. That will be done largely at the expense of the disadvantaged schools in the State sector and the non-government sector. That situation can be but deplored. The Government has gone quiet on its professed aim of ensuring that all non-government schools receive at least 20 per cent of the sort of support that has been given to government schools. One can understand that because we are in difficult times, but one would have thought that the Government would have made a little more effort in the area of disadvantaged schools, particularly in the nongovernment sector in view of the Government's admission of the deficiencies in that area. One can approach the problems of disadvantaged schools and disadvantaged pupils in a more general sense from the point of view that the children in the disadvantaged areas such as the western regions of the major cities of Sydney and Melbourne-n o doubt there are other such areas but I do not want to list them all-hav e in addition to the problems I have mentioned the added problem of the ethnic mix. There is a high proportion of children from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds in schools in those areas. It adds to the problems of the already disadvantaged schools. There is little or no real effort to cope with this problem. I agree that some funding is given for multicultural education but it will be nowhere near enough. What is needed is, in large measure, more teachers. To overcome the problems of those children there needs to be more face to face contact between teachers and pupils. We now have the problem, seemingly, of an excess of teachers. Teachers are unable to get jobs. In real terms, particularly in disadvantaged schools, there is a severe shortage of teachers but because of the funding limitations the State systems are unable to employ more teachers. Nothing which is contained in the proposals put up by the Government at this stage will alleviate that problem. In fact, it will only worse. One would think that nothing was happening in society generally throughout the world. I was going to say in Western society, but it applies all parts of the world, including the Eastern countries. No notice is being taken of the nificant change in direction which education must take if we are to cater for the increasing technological nature of this society. The Governcomments ment has virtually ignored the fact that in many cases completely new facilities will need to be statement. provided. For instance, with the funding that is to be provided, I wonder how many poor schools will be able to buy computers in order to start job of educating children for the computerapproach oriented society. We know that some of the betschools. ter off schools, the rich schools, have them cause they have been able to afford them. No mention is made of that matter in the Minister's statement. The children in the State school systo tem and the children in the poorer section of the private school system will be kept back. They will not be exposed to these new directions in education of which we must inevitably take note if our children are to be able successfully to bridge the gap between school and work.",39
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,Dr Jenkins)- dren. Order! The honourable member's time has discipline expired.,40
133,Mr CARLTON ,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"Mackellar) (12.16)- I must say that, in listening to the response of the honourable memberforMaribyrnong (Dr Cass) to the statement of the Minister for Education ( Mr Fife), one had a certain feeling of deja vu, if we were back in the great period of Mr long Whitlam, the former Prime Mmister, when it was assumed that all decisions were made in Canberra, that all funding came from Canberra, and that all initiatives came from Canberra. Certainly, the honourable member gave no indication in his speech of the real role of the Commonwealth in education funding, particularly in relation to schools. I remind the House that the Commonwealth, although it has a full financial responsibUity for universities and colleges of advanced education, exercises only a topping-up role in the funding of schools and technical and further education institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth currently provides about 25 per cent of the total expenditure on technical and further education and about 12 per cent- I repeat 12 per cent-of the expenditure on government schools. The Commonwealth accepts a larger responsibility for nonget government schools. It provides some 60 per cent of the total recurrent support. The Commonwealth is the sole source of pubhc assistance for non-government schools by way of capital grants, leaving aside some interest subsidy from to some of the States. The basic priorities for nongovernment schools are set in the States by the sigState education departments and also by those who administer those schools. It is within that context that I think we have to scale down the made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong in his response to the Minister's I wish to concentrate on a few fundamental the facts about the philosophy of the Government's to education, particularly in relation to The Government is firmly committed to be the principle of choice in education. In other words, it believes that there should be a capacity for parents-admittedl y at some additional costs the parents-to choose to send their children to schools other than government schools. In fact, I would like to see this principle extended, if it were possible, in the States-it happens in some places but it certainly does not happen in Victoria or New South Wales-in relation to government schools so that parents were able to make a choice as to which school they send their chilI believe that there would be an additional on the government systems in providing adequate education school by school if parents were able to move their children away from one school to another if they felt that the education at a particular school was not up to scratch. Some of the over-centralised and overas bureaucratised State administrations take far too to correct wrong situations in schools. For example, if it becomes clear that a bad headmaster had been appointed to a school, that the person appointed in all good faith turned out be ineffective, it is extremely difficult change in a government school within any reasonable time and the parents and children in that area suffer substantially. If the parents are able within that situation to move their children to a non-government school, that is splendid. It would be better if they had the additional choice to move their children to another government school. The honourable member for Maribyrnong attacked the Government on the grounds that it had an elitist view of education and that it was Armitage. J.

Leave not granted. 31 Mr CHAPMAN-The statement on education 70 made by the Minister today demonstrates this Government's continuing concern for and com39 mitment to this very important sphere of Federal Government responsibility.

Of course we need to remember that thesefiguresapply in Klugman. R. E. MCLeay, Leo constant 1979 prices. That demonstrates a real increase in funding on the part of the present Government-par t of its continuing commitment to education in the four and a half years that it has been in office. We have heard a lot from West, S.J. Willis. R. various people about cuts in education over that period. But in no year have those alleged cuts been in evidence, because in every year that this NA Government has been in office the maintenance of effort in terms of funding has been quite evident.

146,Mr UREN ,EXPENDITURE PLANS,"Reid) (12.46)- I move: That this House recognises that wherever possible the Commonwealth Government should take into account the needs, aspirations and priorities of individual regions when formulating its nationwide expenditure plans. The House accepts the principle of regionalism for these reasons: (1) State and Commonwealth Governments cannot plan and co-ordinate assistance to local government basis of more than 900 local government authorities throughout Australia; (2) many programs of State and Commonwealth Governments are now deUvered on a regional basis; (3) strong regional identities have emerged throughout Australia; for example, the Western Sectors of Sydney and Melbourne, the Iron Triangle of South Australia, the Tamar Region of Tasmania, the Moreton and Gladstone regions of Queensland and the Illawarra and Hunter regions of NSW; (4) national conferences of local government bodies have expressed support for regionalism, and (5) State Governments have moved increasingly to define uniform regional boundaries and to remove the anomalies that now exist. There is a more urgent need now than possibly ever before in Australia's history for a comprehensive national policy for co-operative regionalism. There is not only a greater need for co-ordination of policies between the Federal, State and local levels of government but also there is a growing demand by people for increased involvement in the decision making that affects their daily lives. The Austrahan economy is now undergoing a major structural upheaval. We are now faced with the social consequences of massive capital investment decisions that are frequently made in overseas corporate boardrooms without concern for the effects on the Australian economy and without concern for the effects on the Australian people. We need a co-ordinated national policy to guarantee security to the Australian peoplesecurity ofincome, employment, housing, health and self-reliance. The diverse labor-intensive manufacturing base on which Australia's pattern of population distribution was shaped in the last part of the previous century and in the first half of this century is now being eroded. The industry strategy of import replacement promoted by the Australian Labor Party under Chifley and continued by the Country Party under MCEwen, by which many Australian manufacturing industries grew up, is now being replaced. We are now entering a new phase-no t determined by the Austrahan people and not in our interests-of capital and energy intensive production for export. We are now seeing major rationalisation-no t only in manufacturing industry in the face of increasing imports, but also in service industries through the impact of new technologies. The changes in all of these sectors is leading to a reduced supply of jobs, especially in smaller country towns and regional centres. We have already seen over 300 Austrahan firms move all or part of their operon the ations overseas. We have seen hundreds of manufacturingfirmsgo bankrupt, including over 150 textile estabhshment closures since 1973. We have seen the termination of many country rail services and the closure of some country telephone exchanges. As a result, there has been a major dislocation of the rural population as jobs have been lost in country towns. The course of industrial development that is being rapidly pursued in Australia as we jeop ardise our manufacturing base in order to promote mining and mineral processing industries is bringing about immense economic and social problems in many regions of Australia. We are seeing a rapid expansion of a few centres that are poorly serviced and an agonising decline in many country towns and centres. The March 1979 report of the study group on structural adjustment known as the Crawford report devoted a chapter to regional policies. The study group argued for policies to deal with regional adjustment problems. It stated: The major thrust of such policy should be one of foresee problems in order to mitigate or avoid them. The study group also said: This is difficult in Australia because of data deficiencies and the current lack of an overall regional policy framework. It concluded by saying: Location specific adjustment measures (for example, incentives to the growth of region, support for declining activity in a particular should be implemented within the framework of a long-term regional policy rather than as ad hoc responses to lems of particular firms. The study group suggested the need to examine a range of measures for helping regions cope with change and the development of on-going policies providing activity. It saw a need for co-ordinated monitoring and analysis of the impact of national economic change in States, cities and regions. The study group advocated improved policy co-ordination between the three levels of government. It stated: There is no standing machinery for coordinating Commonwealth and State policies (for example, industry, manpower, regional and housing policies) relevant to adjustment problems at the level of States, cities or regions. It concluded: Effective co-ordination of Commonwealth and State policies and programs relevant to adjustment problems is essential if location-specific adjustment measures are viable economic development at the regional level. In general, the direction for industrial restructurects, ing advocated by the study group is divisive and dangerous for Australia. The study group was growth aware of the immense social impact of this restructuring: A few regions would expand but most regions would decline; a few people would get high paid gomg? jobs but most would end up with low paid jobs-o r no jobs at all; some people access to cultural amenities but others would be deprived of basic necessities. While the study group's proposed industrial strategy is disturbing, its proposed regional strategy is encouraging and enlightened. It represents a major rebuke to the strategy of neglect of this Government which reduced funding and decentralisation assistance 1 for growth centres from $71m in 1975-76 to $37m in 1979-80. That represents a reduction of 63 per cent in real terms. In 1979-80 total spending on urban and regional development is less than one-fifth of the amount that was made available in the last year of the Labor Administration in 1975-76. On 18 October 1979 I sought information from the then Minister for National Development about the use of the $ 10.4m expenditure for decentralisation assistance by this Government. The Minister informed me that the State Government authorities received 16 per cent of trying to these funds; local government bodies received 18 per cent; privatefirmsreceived 66 per cent; private sector capital projects received 66 per cent; and 30 per cent of the funds was allocated to the publicly funded provision of physical infrastructure for private companies. Only 4 per cent of the funds was provided for community facilities. Of this total of $ 10.4m, less than half a million dolnew opportunities in a particular town) lars was spent on providing for the needs of the people in the regions.

Not only is the amount of funding insufficient but also the priorities are wrong. For example, $780,000 was allocated to assist industrial development in $ Percent Gladstone which has a population of over 20,000 1,923,352 18 people. Anybody who goes there will see that the 1,675,301 16 social conditions of the people in that city are ap6,873,197 66 palling. Current industrial developments in Gladstone include Comalco's aluminium smelter 10,471,850 100 and a cement clinker plant.

Selected In many ways Gladstone is the Australian resource equivalent of the manufacturing export size processing zones of Asia. Although Austraha will not act as a free trade enclave in the same way as the Philippines and many other countries, developments in Gladstone suggest that what the workers gain in money wages they lose through possess the social, economic and the poverty of social wage provisions. Housing is scarce, expensive and company controlled. That is an extremely sad situation. Schools are crowded; health and welfare services are inadequate; pubhc transport and recreation facilities are poor; environmental pollution is alarming, especiaUy as the power station, the alumina refinery and the aluminium smelter are located upwind of the residential area. The aluminium industry is associated with high levels of salinity in water, toxic fluoride emissions, alumina dust, caustic spray and the dumping of red mud. Gladstone is one of the so-called glamour growth regions under this Government. The problems facing the people of Bendigo, Ballarat, and the Latrobe Valley, as examples of declining centres in the country areas of Victoria, equally are disturbing. With expanding exports of primary aluminium, imports of manufacturers increase, and the textile, clothing, footwear, furniture and electrical appUance industries, and others, decline. The major export of country towns is unemployed youth. This Government increasingly must understand that that is the sad social problem involved. For instance, in 1974 Ballarat had around 230 manufacturing establishments. Many have closed now and others have reduced their product range and have introduced new technological equipment. These rationalisations have meant a reduced supply of jobs in the Ballarat region, especially for women of whom a large proportion were employed in the production of textiles, textUe goods and food and drink. The problems facing centres like Ballarat cannot be solved by any one level of government acting alone. Within an overall regional poUcy framework, a co-operative response is required by Federal, State and local governments. This concept of regionaUsm was developed by the Labor Party between 1969 and 1972 and was developed most strongly within the Department of Urban and Regional Development under the previous Federal Labor Government. In May 1978 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation produced a report entitled 'The Commonwealth Government and the Urban Environment'. The report states, in part: A positive Commonwealth Government policy on regional issues is essential, if for no other reason than to maintain a Une of commumcauon for the discussion of the impact that Commonwealth Government decisions the local area. The report of that Standing Committee ence continues: A prime objective should be to ensure there ping or divergence of acdon. It asserts that co-operation between local councils or voluntary co-operative regionalism is 'a useful tool to promote efficiency and economy in public administration'. It states that in order to foster innovation and sound planning what is required is 'responsible decentralised government, retaining local democracy and accountability rather than remote, centralised decision making'. That report was made two years ago by a Government committee with a majority of Government members, yet the Government has not acted on it.",44
148,Deus ex machina,ESTIMATES COMMITTEE B,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,46
149,Mr UREN,ESTIMATES COMMITTEE B,"Before the suspension of the sitting, I was referring to my motion in regard to regionalism and regional expenditure plans. I quoted from the report of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Conservation which supports the arguments for the need for planning of regionaUsm. The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth Government expUcitly recognise the advantages inherent in area based co-ordination and take positive steps, in conjunction with the States and local government, to develop further the concept of voluntary co-operative regional arrangements based on local government. That report, as I stated earlier, was presented two years ago and yet this Parliament has not discussed it. This Government has done nothing to act on those recommendations. The report of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment was presented a year ago and there is no sign that this Government intends to act on its regional policy recommendations. Let me now turn to the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party recognises local government as an equal partner in the government of Australia. The Labor Party recognises the problems faced by people in both the expanding and the declining regions. The Labor Party is committed to a pohcy of intergovernmental co-operation, including regionahsm. It was our experience, when in government, that strong regional identities emerged throughout Australia in such diverse areas as the western regions of Sydney and Melbourne, the iron triangle of South Australia, the Tamar region of Tasmania, the Moreton and establish and Gladstone regions of Queensland and the have on Illawarra and Hunter regions of New South Wales. These are just some examples of the regions that are now developing. It was our experithat State and local governments of varying poltiical persuasion supported our commitment to the growth centres of Bathurst-Orange, is no overlapAlbury-Wodonga and Macarthur. It was our experience that, when people saw that governments were prepared to take an active interest in helping them to meet their regional needs, they became more involved in the process of decision-making about their regions. New ideas emerged from the people of those regions responsive to the needs of those regions and appropriate to the human and physical resources of those regions. Those concepts are still there. The needs and the resources are there. Those regions have a great potential to develop viable, productive and service enterprises. We cannot afford to let them decay. If the community facilities are improved and planned and if health, education, welfare and recreational services are provided, the needs of the people can be met. Employment can be generated and investment is more likely to locate in those regions. Where private firms are reluctant to decentralise their operations there is an opportunity for Federal and State governments and regional organisations of local councils to establish enterprises in those regions. The Labor Party considers that it is essential that the program of support for regional organisthese ations of local government councils is negative. implemented in order to allow them to develop effective responses to common problems. The growth of selected regional centres, such as Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and which Macarthur, which is on the outskirts of Sydney, should be encouraged by the decentralisation appropriate sections of State and Federal government administration, by the expansion social and physical infrastructure and by the vision of incentives for investment in industry. Those selected regions where the standards community service provisions are below what is acceptable in other regions should be given guarantee of financial support for a given period. Local government bodies should be given finanand cial encouragement to develop generating enterprises in selected regions, to expand public transport services, to improve environmental protection, and to provide for better exchange of information. These are urgent local priorities. They essential national priorities. A Labor governsmall. ment will be committed to these social priorities. The sad situauon which exists is that the Governare ment, which has a very large support from the National Country Party, says that it is in support of decentralisation and regionahsm and against the overcentralisation of cities such as Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Penh. It is about time this Government acted regional politicies as put forward by the Australian Labor Party. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Millar)-Is the motion seconded?",46
150,Mr HOWE ,ESTIMATES COMMITTEE B,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,47
151,Mr WILSON ,ESTIMATES COMMITTEE B,"Sturt) (2.21)- I rise to oppose the motion in the form moved by the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren). He described this motion as one on regionalism. The speech which we have heard here today is one that the honourable member has made time and time again. It is a speech which is confused in its thinking. In some respects it does identify the problems that arise in a dynamic and developing economy. All economies change from time to time. That change takes place on occasions quickly and at other times more slowly. Change goes on all the time. That change occurs because wefindmajor energy resources in remote places. We develop those resources and people move to those regional centres and establish new towns and settlements. The reasons for the existence of cities and towns change. The rate of growth of centres slows and on occasions becomes In his speech the honourable member made out that there was one way and one way only in these problems could be resolved. He indicated that we should develop a policy of of regionalism. He did not define what he meant by regionalism. In Austraha today we have a system of of government which is regionally based. We prohave six States and the Northern Territory, which are in themselves major regions. It is true of that their boundaries were defined some time ago and, in some respects, due to the accident of a history. Nevertheless, the people Uving within the boundaries of those regions proudly support wish to see the continuance of the region or employmentState in which they Uve. In addition, we have a third sphere of governa ment known as local government. Local government is a form of regional government. In some areas the territory of these governments is large. are In other areas local governments' areas are The honourable member for Reid is advocating that the States and local governments unable to make the decisions needed by the communities within their boundaries and that the decisions should all be centralised upon Canberra. The Leader of the Government in which the honourable member was a Minister said in a well publicised speech that in Australia there on should be fewer local governments and no States. He advocated a system of government in Australia based upon administrative regions. We on this side of the House believe that the power and sovereignty-the capacity to legislate, power and authority, the capacity to determine priorities and define policies-shoul d be distributed among three spheres of government. We on this side of the House acknowledge that local government, having started as the creature of State governments-as indeed the Northern Territory started as the creature of this Parliament-is maturing from an administrative arm of State governments into an autonomous sovereign sphere of government. The Government wants to see that continued. It beheves the 'regions' that are governed by local government can be strengthened and that the capacity of local government alone or in concert with local government in adjoining areas can be strengthened by the Government's federalism pohcy. The Government has done a number of things to strengthen local government and it will do more. For example, it has given local government the opportunity to participate in the discussions of the Advisory Council for InterGovernment Relations which is now looking into the question of what relationships should exist between the spheres of government. Why is this important? It is important because we have identified that the sorts of problems to which the honourable member for Reid drew our attention do exist. The Government does not believe these probinto lems will best be solved in the interests of the people in local government areas or in States centralising the decision-making process in berra. The Government wants to decentralise decision-making process. It wants to strengthen that decentralised decision-making process so that it is more sensitive to the needs of munities. The Government has given an imhas mense charge to the Advisory Council on Interpact Government Relations. The Government has given it the task of advising what relationship should exist between the three spheres of ment in this country. Of course, in looking into that matter, it must necessarily examine the lationships that should exist between adjoining local government areas where in circumstances, for one purpose or another, a larger area is more appropriate area for which strategies policies should be developed. The Government does not believe the sort of regionalism on advocated by the honourable member for Reid when he was a Minister in the Labor Governhad ment should be imposed upon local government. Certainly, local government should be made alert to the interrelationship of its decisions with the decisions of adjoining local government bodies. Equally, all local government bodies should be made sensitive to the impact of the decision of the State and Commonwealth governments upon the people Uving in their areas, as State and Commonwealth governments should be made alert to the needs and influence of thendecisions in the areas governed by States and local governments. This Government has given local government a share of income tax, has broadened its revenue base and has made certain that a sigmficant proportion of that revenue is distributed hi accordance with equalisation principles. The problems of a town Uke Gladstone can be overcome through the effective equalisation of local government bodies in the distribution of local governments share of personal income tax. The Government has shown its concern in other ways. Time does not permit me to enlarge upon them because this debate shortly will be drawn to a conclusion. The Government has recognised the need for better data and statistics. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is developing local government information gathering processes so that decisions can be taken on the basis of known facts rather than on the basis of guesses. Likewise, this Government changed the legislation dealing with the Industries Assistance Commission to require that Commission to bring account the locational impacts of any recommendation which it made. This is in stark conby trast to the actions of the Labor Government of Canwhich the honourable member for Reid was a the member. The Labor Government destroyed the industries of country towns. It destroyed the textile industry by across-the-board tariff reductions comof 25 per cent. Furthermore, the Government shown in other areas its sensitivity to the imof developments in the urban area. It was under a Liberal National Country Party Government that the House ofRepresentatives Standing governCommittee on Environment and Conservation conducted an inquiry into the impact of governrement decisions of the urban environment. Its report was entitled: 'The Commonwealth Government and the Urban Environment'. For the a honourable member for Reid to suggest that that and inquiry has made no impact is to misread the situation. It is quite clear to honourable members this side of the House that that thoughtful, sensitive, concerned and perceptive report has a very real impact on all spheres of government. It has made aU spheres of government and all departments within government a little more sensitive to the regional impUcations of the decisions that they take. Honourable members on this side of the House want to ensure that Australia develops in a way that its towns and settlements canMONICA",47

154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member for Reid may make a personal explanation on that basis.,49
155,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member for Sturt ( Mr WUson) misrepresented me on two counts. Firstly, he said that as Minister for Urban and Regional Development I tried to centralise all power in Canberra. Secondly, he said that I wanted to amalgamate local government authorities into larger bodies and that I would impose that view on local government. In relation to his comment that I tried to centralise power in Canberra I should like to say that basically the philosophy which I always advocated was contrary to that. I said that I was in favour decentralisation because I was against centralism. I represent people Uving in the outer fringes of Sydney. I have seen what overcentraUsation can do in major capital cities. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at the end of my speech I reminded you, as a member of the National Country Party, of that situation. In relation to second point raised by the honourable member for Sturt about the amalgamation of local government authorities I should Uke to say that the role I played as the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the role played by my Department at all times was to persuade local governments to make their own decisions. In fact, the Labor Government introduced one program that encouragedMONICA",49

157,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,One of the Labor Government's programs was to aUocate money to local authorities. The local government authorities wanted to come together as voluntary bodies to create regionalism. That is the Australian Labor Party's policy now. It was its policy then and it is still its policy. Mr Bourchier- I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Reid claimed to have been misrepresented and was given the opportunity to point out briefly where he was misrepresented. He should not make a statement on the matter.,49

159,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,EXPENDITURE,"Lilley)-On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure I present the report of the Committee entitled: 'Alternative delivery systems for Commonwealth public works', together with a transcript of proceedings and certain documents authorised forpubhcation. Ordered that the report be printed.",49
160,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,EXPENDITURE,"Ltiley)-by leave-This report results from the request from the Pariiamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works that the Standing Committee on Expenditure examine the use of project management as an alternative method of delivering major capital of works of the Commonwealth. The Committee was guided by the terms of this request. This is the second request the Expenditure Committee has received from another pariiamentary committee. The first request was from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and related to the the Northern Territory forestry program. When we add to these requests suggestions that fall within the Committee's terms of reference made in reports of other parhamentary committeesfor example, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare entitled 'Through a Glass, Darkly', and a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Advance to the Minister for Finance-on e can see a ray of hope of healthy co-operation that is emerging between the various committees of the Parliament. I thank all these committees, and, in particular, I thank the chairmen of these committees for this important innovation. The subject matter of this report and inquiry has been very technical. This has meant an additional effort on the part of the sub-committee members-the deputy chairman the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), the honourable member for Henty ( Mr Aldred) and I as chairman-to understand the issues. It did appear, however, that most witnesses were challenging the efficacy of the traditional system to deliver public works in an economical and efficient way. Various alternatives were suggested by witnesses. Technical complexities were compounded by the lack of clarity in the information given to us, but after examining most of the evidence as to what are the appropriate matters for inquiry, we agreed that the questions that should be addressed are, firstly, whether a greater proportion of pubhc works should be delivered by systems other than the traditional system; and if the answer is in the affirmative, secondly, the implications for the role of the Department of Housing and Construction. Once we stated our purpose in this way we realised we were on familiar ground. One of the major interests of the Committee is program evaluation in which we attempt to assess the success of a program in meeting its objectives and examining whether there are different ways-that is program alternatives-of meeting those objectives, particularly ones which lower costs. Obviously, the starting point is the statement of the objectives of the Commonwealth works program. Initially, we constructed those objectives from the April 1979 submission of the Department of Housing and Construction. We further realised that only governments can set objectives for themselves. Accordingly, we corresponded with the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Groom) who gave us the objectives. We then proceeded to assess the extent to which the various delivery systems meet these objectives. The delivery systems chosen were the traditional system, design-construct, construction management, project management and selective tendering, which is a minor variation to the traditional system. Four conclusions were reached on the issues. Firstly, the choice of a particular delivery system for a particular project has to be made in the context of the circumstances of that project and is, hence, a matter of judgment for the administrators. Secondly, the choice of a particular ery system for a particular project should continue to reside with the organisation that has prime carriage for the co-ordination of the planning, design and construction of public works. Thirdly, it is not practical to formulate guidelines for the selection of a particular delivery system. Fourthly, since a government department or agency is responsible to government and the Parhament for the efficient administration of public works, that department or agency should always have overriding authority over project management companies and others on those works. Those conclusions can be said to be negative ones in that they do not make a contribution to increasing efficiency or improving accountability to the Parhament. To expect reports always to contain such contributions is to equate scrutiny with criticism. This is a view the Committee does not hold. However, the inquiry did throw up matters in relation to efficiency and to accountability. Concerning accountability, the Committee has recommended, firstiy, that the Department of Housing and Construction either include in its annual reports or supply to the Parliament Standing Committee on Public Works for inclusion in that Committee's general reports the following information on each completed major capital work: The tender price, costs of rise and fall contract clauses, design alterations and other costs specified and the delivery system or systems used for each project. Secondly, it was recommended that the Department of Housing and Construction expedite the preparation of design and supervision costs for major public works and publish these costs in its annual reports. This information should assist both departments and organisations located in the private sector to challenge the ways in which the Department of Housing and Construction is administering government programs. Without this information we feel that the questioning will continue to be based on assertions rather than wellthought out arguments. Finally, in an attempt to improve the efficient administration of construction programs, the Committee's third recommendation was that the Department of Housing and Construction assess the advantages and disadvantages of contractual project management and use this delivery system when circumstances permit its use. In a nutshell this is what the report represents. I make it quite clear that a wide-ranging inquiry into the administrative efficiency of the Department of Housing and Construction was not delivcontemplated at any stage. Some of the areas witnesses wanted examined are more appropriately dealt with in such an inquiry. We were guided always by the precise terms of the requests from the Public Works Committee. The information the Committee has asked for should enable it and other bodies to assess much better whether there is a case and a cause for such a wide-ranging inquiry. NA",49
161,Mr KATTER ,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"Kennedy)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Road Safety, I present the report of the Committee on alcohol, drugs and road safety, together with the transcript of evidence and extracts from the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",51
162,Mr KATTER,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"by leave-First of all, I would like to thank the secretariat staff and my Committee members. We were really put to the test on this occasion because, at the critical moment when we were about to produce this report, we lost the services of Frank Hinkley, who was then the Secretary to the Committee. His place was taken by Bill Mutton, who did a splendid job which was far beyond what one would have expected under the circumstances. He stepped in without having heard the evidence and without having been associated with the hearings. He was ably assisted by Kristin Ballard. I pay particular tribute to those two people and, in addition, to David South and Dr Joe Santamaria. Undoubtedly, members of the public at times say to themselves: 'How can a group of politicians be expert on road safety and in the critical involvement of that subject?' On all occasions while I have been on this Committee we have had the advantage of having not only consultants who were nationally equipped, but also consultants with an international reputation. They assisted the Committee in a very decisive manner. This report was produced as part of a general investigation into human behaviour as it appUes to road safety. The first term of reference which we have dealt with concerns alcohol and drugs. Driving under the influence of alcohol is the most important single factor contributing to serious road crashes; the statistics are horrifying. In 1979,3,506 people were kUled in road crashes in Australia. At least one-third of all adults killed-that is about 1,000 people in 1979would have had a significant concentration of alcohol in their blood. Furthermore, many of those unaffected by alcohol would have been kUled in crashes involving a driver who was affected by alcohol. Research suggests that alcohol is a factor in 50 per cent of crashes involving a fatality. In 1977 over 91,600 people were injured in more than 67,500 reported road crashes in Australia. In some 34 per cent of all road crashes resulting in personal injury at least one driver, rider or pedestrian would have had a significant blood alcohol content. Finally, this dismal record of statistics tells us that a survey in Adelaide has SAFETY shown that overall 8.4 per cent of drivers surveyed had been drinking; 2.5 per cent of drivers had a blood alcohol content exceeding 0.05 grams per hundred mtililitres and 1.6 per cent had a content exceeding 0.08 milUlitres. In the period from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, 28.9 per cent had been drinking; 16.1 per cent had a blood alcohol content exceeding 0.05 grams per hundred mtililitres and 11.7 per cent had a content exceeding 0.08 milUlitres. That might sound a rather dry statistical record. One cannot dramatise them or bring them out in colour-excep t that the colour might be blood red. One cannot make the statistics something that would appeal to the nation. We want them to terrify the nation. No one who is familiar with the problem of drink driving doubts that it is a road safety and community health problem of truly major proportions. The drink driving problem is one of great complexity. Drinking and driving are integral parts of most people's way of life. Many social pressures tend to support, even encourage, drink driving. On the other hand, the opposing forces do not have a strong influence on a significant proportion of the community. Leaving my formal report for a moment, I just mention that there is a very grave responsibility on those who are handling the advertising and the glamorising of beer more particularly, but alcohol generally. Penalties for drink driving are already quite severe, yet the law is frequently and consistently disobeyed. Drink driving is still not seen by many as a criminal act. The motorist who breaks a drink driving law but who is not involved in a serious crash resulting in injury is not seen as an antisocial criminal but as a basically law-abiding citizen. These permissive attitudes to drink driving are a fundamental impediment to other measures aimed at minimising the drink driving problem. Modifying such attitudes must be seen as a high priority, long term objective. Governments have become increasingly aware in the last decade of the significance of alcohol as a contributing factor in road crashes. Efforts have been made to combat it, for example through the use of the breathalyser and the imposition of severe penalties. Despite such efforts the problem remains critically serious. The Committee 's major recommendation is that random breath testing be introduced in all States and Territories. I can imagine the reaction from people who ask: 'What about our sacred right, the right of the individual?' What about the right of the individual who goes out in his car with his wife to have an afternoon drive? Some hood or hooligan full of grog comes along in a car which possibly should not be on the road and wipes out the lives of those two people, and probably the lives of a couple of kids thrown in for good measure. Late in 1978 the effectiveness of random breath testing was subjected to an evaluation in Victoria- a very important operation, may say-and my deputy chairman, the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones), who has done such a splendid job on the Committee will have something more to say about that. Durthat ing the evaluation period, testing was carried in short, intense bursts accompanied by widelatter spread publicity. This use of random breath ing was found to be most effective in reducing alcohol related road crashes. Although it has not yet been established that other methods of using random breath testing are effective, we munity. concluded that its potential value was such that all States and Territories should introduce it. peat that, without delay-becaus e every hour life is being wiped out in this nation-al l States and Territories should introduce random breath testing. The purpose of random breath raise each potential drink driver's estimation of the likelihood of his being detected. It is that raising such estimations is an important terminant of the effectiveness of penalties. important though it is, this is just one facet of drink driving problem. A variety of measures are required to deal with the many other facets. example, there is a need for effective rehabiliBradfield), tation programs for people with drinking problems. Greater efforts need to be made in schools and in the mass media to attempt to munity attitudes toward drink driving. Research needs to be undertaken on how the drinking environment might be changed to reduce the incidence of drink driving. The physical road environment needs to be improved to make it for more forgiving of impaired driving performance. More effort needs to go into the development mechanical devices for vehicles to prevent drink driving from occurring. I deviate again for a ment to draw the attention of honourable members to a device that was shown recently on Nationwide. One breathes into the device- a little box. If one has over the allowed blood alcohol content one cannot start the motor of one's car- a simple device, but an effective one. I ask the Department of Transport to look closely at that device. I think it is practical and will help tremendously. There is a need to evaluate carefully those counter measures which have been adopted already. The magnitude of the problem created by drivers affected by drugs other than alcohol and by drugs in combination with alcohol is not yet known. We were not able to get a great deal of clear and decisive evidence. Indeed, little is known of the effects of many drugs on driving skills. It is clear, however, that even some comI monly prescribed drugs, especially when used with alcohol, can have seriously adverse effects on driving skills. Whilst it seems clear that the problem of drink driving is much greater than of driving under the influence of drugs, the out Committee believes that measures to counter the problem are needed and that lack of testknowledge is a basic impediment. The Committee has identified several areas in which reseach is required. The use of alcohol and drugs presents a variety of problems for the comThere are limits to the extent to which driving under the influence of alcohol and other I redrugs can be dealt with in isolation from the a more general problem of abuse of these substances. There appears to be a ground swell of community concern about the abuse of alcohol and other drugs. The Committee's inquiry, I believe, clearly demonstrated that this concern is testing is to well justified. In conclusion, I thank again the deputy chairclear man of the Committee, the honourable member defor Newcastle, for always being present to assist But when I was not about. I also thank the other the members of the Committee. I do not want to pick out individuals, but in particular I wish to thank For the honourable member for Barton ( Mr the honourable member for Barker EmptyHere lin ( Mr Good luck) and the honourable member modify comfor Griffith ( Mr Humphreys).",51
163,Dr KLUGMAN ,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,You are picking out individuals.,52
164,Mr KATTER,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"I am picking out all the individuals. The Committee worked extremely hard one reason. I repeat that we lost the services of our secretary who was the reservoir of inforof mation. Quite suddenly, he was not there. Again I commend the secretary and his assistant, Mrs moBallard, for doing a splendid job. I am very concerned that the Government might at some future time feel that we are duplicating the work which has been done in some of the States. It would be a sad and serious situation if this Standing Committee on Road Safety were no longer vigilant, in examining closely and with a great sense of responsibility the greatest killer this country will ever know; that is, the killer or the roads. The numbers are increasing day by day. There are 10 road deaths per day now. I will leave the House to make its own conclusions in that regard.",52
165,Mr CHARLES JONES ,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"Newcastle)-by leave-In speaking to the report presented by the Standing Committee on Road Safety on alcohol, drugs and road safety I take up the point raised by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter), at the conclusion of his speech. He raised the questions of whether the Federal Parliament should have a committee to investigate road safety, whether there should be an office of road safety and whether there should be a standards authoritywhateverfieldof operation there might be. In my opinion there cannot be too many committees working on this subject stirring up public opinion, government support andfinanceto improve our road system, the behaviour of people who drive the vehicles on those roads and the hicles they travel in. We have seen in the last decade and a half quite a substantial change in the public attitude to road safety. Twenty years ago when certain people started talking about the car manufactackle turer being required to improve the standard and safety of the vehicles he was building, such as the installation of seat belts, and about the for breathalyser testing-the call is now for ranare dom breathalyser testing-ther e were always those in the community who referred to them ratbags and treated them as such. But I am pleased to say that the people who had the interest and courage to become involved in road safety at that time have been directly instrumenthe tal in bringing about quite a substantial rereferring duction in the number of road deaths munity. Whether in Australia, the United States of America, Europe or elsewhere, there has been a need for people to become involved and against interested in the problem, to try to do something about it. We cannot get away from the fact. advise people, if they are not prepared to read the whole of the report- a course which I recabout ommend strongly-at least to read its major findings and recommendations. That will give them something to think about, something on say which to act. I come back to the clear and concise fact in 1979 3,506 people were killed on the roads. that number, 1,800, or more than half, died the result of the consumption of alcohol by some person: Either the driver or a pedestrian was properly under the influence. When it is suggested that a driver should be prosecuted and sent to prison because he has been involved in a crash while under the influence, there is a great cry about civil liberties. Similarly, when the law was changed to require the wearing of a seat belt, there was talk of taking away people's civil liberties. The same can be said of the use of the breathalyser or of random testing. As long as I have the right to vote in this Parliament I will continue to vote for the taking away of those civil liberties. A driver who is under the influence of alcohol is certainly not in control ofhis vehicle. If such people want to kill themselves that is their prerogative, but it is not their prerogative to kill other, innocent people, whether they be drivers of vehicles or pedestrians. The community must harden to acceptance of the point of view that the consumption of alcohol in the community presents a social problem. Quite apart from the road safety aspect, it is a ve- major social problem in industry and commerce. It is not always the little fellow on the bottom of the ladder who has the problem. It is also found among the people on the top rung, at the administrative level. Indeed, the problem at that level is one of major consequence. The community must this social problem. People must be prepared for the Government to fund a full investiby gation of the problem and to do as much as possneed ible to help people who have the problem. We told that there are as many as a quarter of a million alcoholics in the community. That is a as heck of a big percentage of our population of some \4 A million. Therefore, the whole question ] has to be tackled as a major social problem. I have mentioned that in one year it contributed to death of some 1,800 people. I intend to keep to that fact because it is important that in the comwe keep hammering the point. Labor supporters engaged in demonstrations the Vietnam War in which, in the period from 1964 to 1971, 494 Australian servicemen I were killed. There was a great pubhc outcry about it, but there has been no public outcry the fact that 1,800 people were killed last year alone as a result of the consumption of alcohol. We have in the community people who that it is a breach of their civil liberties if, when they are driving, a policeman pulls them up and says: 'Breathe into this; take this test'. that The Committee has made a very strong recOf ommendation in favour of random testing and as State governments being urged to amend their traffic Acts to that end. Unless random testing is policed it will not be effective. That will mean that the publicans, the club secretaries and the club committees will squeal like hell because they will find that the random breath testing crew is just up the road, that as the drunks come out they will be tested. There is only one way deal with such drivers. Until the community prepared to face that fact we will continue each year to kill 1,800 people on the roads as a conseand quence of alcohol consumption.",53
166,Mr LES MCMAHON ,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,You are lucky you do drink.,54
167,Mr CHARLES JONES,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"I do not, and I do people not want some mug to kill me either.

It was discovered nights a decrease of between 65 per cent and 70 per cent in fatalities occurred. That was for the simple reason that people went out that night knowing that if they exceeded the 0.05 per cent blood alcohol level which is permissible in Vicheve toria there would be a distinct possibility that they would be pulled up and have to submit breathalyser test. The result was that they either did not drink or stayed at home and drank. That is their prerogative. Alternatively, out they used public transport. All that the Committee is saying is this: If you want to drink that your right but you should not hicle if you do. That is the whole point that the Committee is making. The Committee has recommended that the Government carry out a series of investigations. do not propose to take up the time of the House by reading the recommendations but certain points have been brought out positively in them. The Committee accepts as fact that the consumption of alcohol is a major social problem that must be tackled by government on the basis intensive investigation and study best way of overcoming it. I am discussing the consumption of alcohol from the road aspect only. I am not referring to the other major social problems that flow from it, those that involve the family and so on. That is a separate aspect with which others may deal. I do not altogether agree with that part of Committee's report which states that, for about 25 per cent of drivers who have been prosecuted for consuming in excess of the permissible amount of alcohol, increased penalties would have no effect at all. There is a fair amount of dence which shows that they are alcoholics, result people who have a drinking problem and who will continue to drink irrespective of the penalty. I do not accept the suggestion that they will tinue to do so irrespective of the penalty. lieve if they are hit hard enough they will seek alternative methods of transportation-pubh c some other form. I return to the point that people to must be shown that they cannot kill their fellow is men in the process of going out and enjoying themselves. I hope that the State parliaments, the Federal Minister within whose responsibility traffic control in the Australian Capital Territory falls, will have the courage to initiate not compulsory random breathalyser testing and that it will be rigidly enforced on the basis of being told that if they drink and drive they will have a better than even money chance Victorian Governof being caught.",54

171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"Order! The safety honourable member is seeking leave? EmptyHere Leave granted. EmptyHere the few comments on this extremely important report The Chairman of the Committee outlined the problems. To put them in very clear terms, on average in Austraha nearly 10 people a day are killed on the roads. That means that on average evievery 2\h hours someone in Australia dies as the of a road accident. This report, which is the result of a long and intensive inquiry, gathers together an enormous amount of material. The coninquiry was initiated on 29 May 1978. We I bereceived 139 submissions and 133 witnesses were heard. I have no doubt at all that the report or will be an enormously useful starting point for researchers and others who are involved with road safety. I make two points. One of the results of all the caught. evidence that was put to the Committee was that the Committee was not convinced that further increases in penalties for drink driving would be effective in the long term in overcoming the problem. Penalties vary from State to State but generally they are quite severe. The problem remains that most people believe that they have a good chance while driving under the influence of getting to their destinations and of not being stopped by the police. Generally, people's prospects of being picked up for drink driving are low. Therefore, perhaps increasing the penalties is not the answer. Perhaps increasing people's behef that they may be caught for drink driving if they are driving under the influence is the answer. This has led the Committee to the view that random breath testing, used in specific road safety campaigns, could be a useful tool in reducing the number of deaths and injuries on our roads. The other point I make as a result of the inquiry is that I was extremely impressed with some of the rehabilitation programs which are undertaken in some States. For example, it is not uncommon in Victoria for a magistrate to order a person who is convicted of a drink driving offence to undertake a course of lectures prior to his licence being reinstated. Such courses involve the attendance of doctors, policemen and others, who lecture the people involved. I am quite sure that many people do not understand the effect that alcohol can have on them physically in causing the destruction or breakdown of parts of their body and the effect that it has on their control their vehicles. Drink driving is an extremely serious problem in Australia. It is my hope that this report will contribute positively to public awareness of the problems that are involved and will assist in overcoming some of the carnage on our roads.",54
172,Mr MORRIS ,STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD,"Shortland)-by leave-I join with the honourable members who preceded me in this debate in their comments relating to the tabling of this very important report. The issue of the impact of drink driving upon our community extends beyond party political lines. It has clearly had the support across the board of the Standing Committee on Road Safety. As the Chairman of the Committee mentioned, the only socially acceptable killers in this country are drinking drivers. That situation arises very much from the facts that,firstly,a social behaviour has been established in relation to alcohol over many decades and, secondly, as the honourable EmptyHere me mentioned, there is little chance of being Some of the recommendations of the Committee aim to increase the chance of detection. Once people come to recognise that their chances of being caught are much greater, we are likely to have some movement towards a change in community attitudes to drinking and driving. I think the ingestion of alcohol before driving is a factor in the aggressiveness of some motor vehicle drivers. So many people seem to drive their cars in the way in which they would wear a gun if they were back in the days of the wild west. That kind of road behaviour has a serious impact upon other drivers and particularly upon the drivers of two-wheeled vehicles-moto r cyclists and cyclists. I believe that the lack of concern and the arrogance of some drivers in most cases follows the ingestion of alcohol. There has to be a change of social attitudes to this combination of drinking and driving. The report outlines the enormous toll that alcohol takes on motor vehicle drivers, passengers and pedestrians. The most disastrous impact of all is the impact upon young people. I stress that in 80 per cent of single vehicle fatal crashes involving drivers under 25 years of age, alcohol is a major contributing factor. The combination of the consumption of alcohol and driving is a community problem. We must all join together in developing a solution to it. It is criminal, in my view, that young people gain legal access to alcohol and to motor vehicles at almost the same time. It is estimated that the driving impairment of a 17-year-old person is 10timesgreater than of that of a 30-year-old person following a given consumption of alcohol. Yet enormous peer pressures are placed upon young people to join in the consumption of alcohol or to develop the practised habit of consuming alcohol. They are made to feel that they are less than men, less than adults, unless they are able to cope with a quantity of alcohol. To encourage young people to drink and then allow them to drive is to invite them to play Russian roulette with their lives and with the lives of other, innocent road users. I make mention particularly of the role of leading sporting personalities in the promotion of the sale of alcohol, particularly on television. In this area of promotion the pitch of the message of the advertisement is aimed at the younger age groups in the community. The younger people are made to feel that they are less than successful, that they cannot be successful or competitive in sport, that they cannot achieve, unless they are able to swig a can of beer as we see so often on the television commercials. I would like to see some of the other leading sportsmen and sportswomen of our nation joining in an opposite campaign to neutralise the disastrous effect of the promotion of alcohol. Sir Donald Bradman, in his younger days and tute at the peak of his career, used to say quite openly that he did not drink alcohol, that he was a teeParUament. totaller. Surely there are some sportsmen like Sir Donald Bradman around today who can follow his lead in promoting a deterrent to the consumption of alcohol. I do not know whether these leading sporting personalities are paid their appearances. I do not know what considerhonourable ation they receive or what their motivation can only appeal to them to have a look at the figures of the fatalities and injuries of young people who drive motor vehicles following the consumption of alcohol. I ask them: Are they doing the right thing for those young people for all of the other young people of Australia whom they encourage to drink by ance in commercials. Added to that, I believe that in all pubhc places where liquor is sold, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs, there should an equal promotion and availability of a range non-alcoholic drinks and low alcohol content drinks so that a choice is available. We find in so many cases at present that only alcohol is available. I conclude with one of the Committee's ommendations. It reads: consideration be given to reducing the excise imposed on low alcohol beer (defined as containing not more cent of alcohol by weight). I think it is a worthy recommendation. As a member of the Committee I support it, but it not an answer in itself, although it appears to having some favourable effect upon the problem. It is one of the tools which are available to us. support the remarks of the honourable who preceded me about the recommendations of the Committee. I ask the community to come together, putting politics aside, in facing up this most difficult and disastrous problem.

181,Mr HUNT ,NOES,"Gwydir-Minister for Transport) (3.35)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second Ume. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Shipping Registration Bill is an important step forward in the development of Australia's status as an independent nation. One of the attributes of national sovereignty is the right of a country to determine the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships. In international law ships have the nationality of the country whose flag they are entitled to fly and it is customary, at least for the larger ships, to require them to be registered in order to secure the right toflythe national flag. The present law governing the registration of ships in Australia, was enacted by the Parhament at Westminister 86 years ago and is contained in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Originally that law applied throughout the British Empire and it proceeded on the basis that a ship was a British ship if it was owned by a British subject or corporation in any part of the Empire. The Act required all British ships to be registered except certain small ships of less than 15 tons carrying capacity. Registration could be effected at any British port of registry throughout the Empire and this entailed the entry of particulars of the ship and of its owners and mortgagees in the register at the port. The registrar at the port was required to transmit returns at regular intervals to the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen at Cardiff and in that way a complete record of all British ships was built up. However this procedure has been abandoned in recent years. From the commencement of the Statute of Westminister 1931 the various member countries of the British Commonwealth were free to repeal the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and to establish their own shipping registers. However, under an agreement negotiated at the same time in 1931 the laws of each country were required to adopt a common status of 'British ship' and to follow closely the provisions of Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. That agreement, the British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping Agreement 1931, was rescinded by all member countries by mutual agreement in 1978. Australia is the only major independent member of the Commonwealth, other than Britain itself, to have continued to operate under the Merchant Shipping Act system and the stage has now been reached where it is essential that we legislate to put an end to this anachronism. The Commonwealth countries have recently agreed on common principles for the future operation of their own shipping registers and in accordance with those prinSecond Reading ciples Britain itself is expected to legislate to confine the Merchant Shipping Act system in Britain, to ships more than 50 per cent owned by residents of Britain or companies based in Britain. It is understood that the adoption by Australia of its own national system will simplify the task that the British authorities are undertaking in the United Kingdom. The principles underlying the present Bill have been the subject of extensive discussion with the States and their views have been taken into account in the framing of the legislation. However, several States have sought an opportunity to examine the Bill itself and there has been widespread interest in the subject since the proposed legislation was announced in January. The Government considers, therefore, that it would be desirable on a subject as important and complex as this to allow the Bill to lie on the table over the winter recess with a view to its passage in the next sittings. I turn now to a description of the main features of the Bill. The first thing it does is repeal Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 insofar as it is part of the law of Australia, thus terminating Australia's reliance on the British legislation and clearing the way for the adoption of an appropriate Australian system. The next provisions spell out the ships that are eligible for Australian registration, either on a compulsory or on a voluntary basis. The main elements are: Defence Force ships are excluded; registration is compulsory only for Australian-owned commercial ships of 12 metres or more in length, other than Government ships, fishing vessels and pleasure craft; Australian-owned ships for which registration is not compulsory may be registered on a voluntary basis; also ships under 12 metres in length that are operated by Australian citizens or residents may be registered; registration is also permitted in the case of foreign-owned ships that are demise chartered to Australian interests. The procedures for registration, including the evidence of ownership required, the division of property in the ship into 64 shares, issuing of registration certificates and of provisional certificates and the naming and marking of the ship have been made broadly comparable with the British system to ensure that the changeover from that system to the Australian system can be effected with a minimum of inconvenience for shipowners. The same can be said of the provisions of Part III of the Bill which deal with transfers and transmission of title and the registration and priority of mortgages. The proposal to adopt the Australian national flag as the proper national colours for Austrahan ships has aroused considerable interest if not controversy in some quarters although it was made some four years ago by Commissioner Malcolm Summers in the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Maritime Industry. Because of the interest in this subject. I propose to deal with it at some length. The present position with regard to merchant ships and other civilian craft, including fishing vessels and pleasure yachts, is covered bination of British and Australian laws. The effect of these is that for merchant ships registered in Australia and covered by the Commonpresent wealth Navigation Act 1912 the British Red Ensign defaced by the stars shown on the Aus1958, tralian national flag is declared to be the proper colours by section 406 of that Act. For ships not covered by the Navigation Act, section 73 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and British Admirate alty warrants issued under that section prescribe the flag. There is a general warrant dated November 1938 which declares the British Red Ensign Ensign defaced by the badge of the CommonEnsign wealth to be the proper colours for ships and boats belonging to British subjects Australia. That flag, although described in different words, is the same as the flag prescribed by the Navigation Act for Australian merchant on ships. It was subsequently described in greater detail in the Flags Act 1953 which declares that shall be known as the Australian Red Ensign. In addition to the general warrant of 1938 the tish Admiralty has issued individual warrants certain members of some 16 yacht clubs in tinued Australia authorising them to wear the British Blue Ensign, either undefaced or in a defaced form. The British Blue Ensign is similar to Australian national flag but without the stars. Approximately 400 Australian yacht owners have been accorded the privilege of using the British Blue Ensign in place of the Australian Red Ensign. In proposing that the Australian national flag should be the proper national colours for Ausowner tralian ships the Government has taken into account a number of considerations. The first is that at the present time Australians do not have the right toflythe Australian national flag at sea. Honourable members will recall the statement by the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr John MCLeay) on 10 May last year on the extension of the free issue of the nationalflagwhen he said: The National Flag is our symbol of national unity. As such, the Government is concerned to encourage the flying of the National Flag as widely as possible. The proper and dignified use of the National Flag can only encourage national consciousness. Those are words of wisdom from the Minister for Administrative Services. The Government considers that the philosophy underlying that statement should be a universal one and it should apply at sea as much as it does on land. In coming to that conclusion the Government has noted that the vast majority of other countries, including many Commonwealth countries, have also adopted their national flag as the ensign for by a commerchant ships and other vessels. There are other reasons for terminating the usage of the Red and Blue Ensigns. Under the Geneva Convention on the High Seas to which Australia is a party, ships have the nationahty of the country whose flag they are entitled to fly. It follows that if Australia is to confer its nationality on ships it cannot perpetuthe practice of permitting a flag other than a flag of Australian nationality to be used as 25 national colours on Austrahan ships. The Blue is a flag of British nationality and the Red is ambiguous because, as I have mentioned, it is authorised under both British and resident in Australian law. The international principles apply particularly the high seas and there is less difficulty in permitting a departure from the Convention's prinit ciples in the Australian territorial sea and internal waters. In deference to the concern exBripressed by the yacht owners who presently have to Blue Ensign privileges the Bill permits the conuse of that flag in Australian waters for a period of two years from the commencing date of the proposed new system. I should mention that the the commencing date will occur not on royal assent but some time later, possibly up to 12 months after royal assent, depending on how long it takes to complete the necessary administrative procedures and subordinate legislation. It should also be noted that the Btil does not make it compulsory for Australian pleasure craft owners to register in Australia so that a yacht who wishes to retain the use of the British Blue Ensign wtil have the option of transferring the registration of his yacht to a British port of registry outside Australia. So far as the Australian Red Ensign is convision cerned, the Bill envisages that on the commencelaws ment date it will be replaced by the national flag. In this connection there will be complementary amendments of the Flags Act 1953 and of the Navigation Act 1912. The Flags Amendment Bill is being introduced now and the Navigation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which is still being drafted will be introduced in the sittings. Perhaps those people who have an ment interest in flags and protocol could, during period this Bill will lie on the table, let the Government have the benefit of their views on gagees this subject. I have no doubt that they will spond and their views will be considered. The Bill also preserves the use of the flag of a State Territory in Austrahan waters and contains progressively visions in respect of flag rights for unregistered Australian ships. The provisions of Parts IV and V of the Bill set House. out the broad administrative arrangements for the estabhshment and operation of the Australian Register of Ships. In this area there are some significant departures from the present system. The proposed Austrahan system is basically a centralised system in that there will be only one time. register. The Bill provides that the Register and copies of the Register or of such part or parts of the Register as the Minister directs such places as the Minister directs. It also provides that there shall be at such places in Australia as the Minister determines, an AusThis trahan shipping registration office and such number of branch registration offices as the ister determines. This is a flexible arrangement and it enables a certain amount of decentralisposes ation. However, it does not suffer from the vantage of the present system in Australia under which there is a separate register at ports of registry and the complete record of all ships registered in Australia is not available any one place. One consequence of that change that there will be no ports of registry as such the practice of marking the ship's on the stern need not be continued. However, because of the importance of the port of registry concept for legal and other purposes, the Bill makes provision for the adoption of a home port for each ship and the regulations will spell this out in greater detail including the practice of continuing to mark the port on the ship's stern. Part VI of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions including power to remove unqualified ships from the Register, the proof offences and the preservation of State relating to the licensing of small, craft for Australian identification purposes. Finally, the Bill contains transitional provisions that have been framed in such a way as to minimise any inconvenience to the owners and mortgagees of ships registered in Australia under next the Merchant Shipping Act. On the commencedate the existing registers will be deemed to the form part of the Australian Register and no further action will be required of owners or mortin order to effect the transition to the AusretraUan Register. The Australian Register will of course make use of modern procedures, equipor ment and documentation and ships will be protransferred over to the new documentation after the commencement date.

183,Mr JOHN MCLEAY ,NOES,"Boothby-Minister for Administrative Services) (3.52)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for monwealth authorities to comply with the Government's policy of giving preference to whilst Australian-made goods in Commonwealth prolation curement. The Bill will override certain visions of legislation governing some statutory authorities which at present inhibit the ability those authorities to carry out the Australian preference policy, and will provide procedures whereby adherence to the pohcy will be facilitated. This Government has taken the view that proPurchases ducers of Australian goods and related services and their employees should receive a measure preference when bidding for contracts to be arauthorities ranged by Commonwealth departments and authorities. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm chases Fraser) announced a policy of giving preference to Australian-made goods in September 1976. This policy was based on the traditional proach of giving selective assistance in special circumstances. Over the succeeding year, however, it became clear that the pohcy was not sufficiently effective. Accordingly, in October 1977, the Government decided to adopt a more positive preference policy, and this was anthat nounced by the Prime Minister in his election policy speech in 1977. In accordance with this policy government departments and authorities were instructed to: (a) give preference in Commonwealth procurement to goods of Australian origin or of relatively greater Australian content unless there were substantial reasons to the contrary; and (b) to draw up tender specifications so as not to exclude Australian supplies suitable or reasonably adaptable to their needs. Whereas, in the past, there had to be special grounds for giving preference to Australian made goods, departments and authorities are now required to provide substantial reasons if they wish to do otherwise than purchase Australian-made goods or goods of relatively greater Australian content. The policy motivates companies bidding for Commonwealth contracts to examine carefully the possibility of increasing the use of materials and components from Australian sources, thus creating aflow-oneffect. Second Reading Since the introduction of the policy, however, it has become apparent that there is some unevenness in compliance by the various Commonwealth authorities. The enabling legislation of some authorities has the effect that purchasing must be on the basis of best value for money. In Comsome cases legislation provides for ministerial decision in respect of major purchases only, in the majority of cases the enabhng legisof authorities does not provide for proGovernment direction on purchasing matters. These and other factors have resulted in some inof consistency in implementation of the GovernGovernment's ment's preference policy. I should point out that purchases by Commonwealth authorities represent a very significant proportion of total Commonwealth purchases. by departments of state are estimated to be in the region of $ 1,500m per annum of whereas purchases by the Commonwealth are estimated to be in the region of $3,300m per annum. It can be seen that purby authorities are more significant in total value than purchases by departments and are therefore of considerable importance in the conaptext of the preference policy. My Department has conducted a survey of the extent of compliance with the preference policy by authorities. The results of this survey show that, whilst the majority of authorities indicated they were complying fully with the Government's policy of preference to Australian-made goods, there was another group of authorities which found it necessary to qualify their responses. A further group indicated that they were unable to comply with the Government's pohcy. In view of all these factors, the Government decided to introduce overriding legislation to facilitate and ensure compliance by Commonwealth authorities with the preference policy, except where specific exemptions are granted. The Government recognises that there will be some special cases where authorities may need to for be exempted from the provisions of the legislation; for example, full compliance with the preference policy might, in some instances, jeopardise the commercial viability of a business undertaking. The Bill provides the necessary flexibility to cope with these special cases. In this regard, the Prime Minister has written to the Premiers of Victoria, New South Wales and South Austraha concerning the possible extension of the Government's preference policy to certain bodies jointly conducted by the Commonwealth and a State government or governments. There would be obvious advantages in a uniform approach to preference in government purchasing across Australia as a whole. The practice of individual States pursuing their own purchasing preference schemes for suppliers in their States can lead to a distortion of trade among the States. This may encourage a greater degree of industry fragmentation than would otherwise occur. This could mean that we are not achieving the optimum use of our resources throughout the Commonwealth as a whole. I now turn to the main features of the Bill. Bill covers all authorities established under Commonwealth law and under the law of the Australian Capital Territory. Authorities which are jointly conducted by the Commonwealth Government and another government or governments will, however, be removed from the scope of the legislation by regulation, except where, in the case of Commonwealth-State authorities, the partners agree to the preference policy being applied to the authority. I should mention that the coverage of the Bill does not extend to companies incorporated under State law. Qantas Airways Ltd and other Commonwealth-owned companies established under State law are, however, subject to direction by the Government as principal or sole shareholder through their respective Ministers. Unless specifically exempted such companies will, therefore, be subject to the same requirements as those set out in this Bill. The first of the operative clauses of the Bill, clause 4, recognises the possibility that the ing of specifications for a procurement in a narrow or restrictive way can render Australian made goods ineligible to meet a requirement. Clause 4 provides that specifications are not to be drawn up in such a way as to exclude suitable goods of Austrahan origin or higher Australian content from consideration. The Bill also contains, in clause 5, provisions requiring the invitation of tenders for significant purchases either publicly or from a list of registered tenderers. These requirements are based upon the finance regulations under the Audit Act which govern purchases by departments and authorities within the public account. They are designed to ensure that there is no undue restriction on the opportunity for firms to tender for the requirements of authorities. They include the normal exceptions to the general pubhc tender rule which apply under thefinanceregulations. The authority to approve exceptions, by a 'Certificate of Inexpediency' procedure, will be appropriately delegated to officers of authorities. I should mention that the system of open lists registered tenderers set out in clause 6 represents a departure from the tendering procedures which apply to departments. It is included in the Bill because the Government recognises that some authorities, especially business undertakings, may require a more flexible purchasing system than departments. The registered tenderer system will, however, involve regular advertisements by the authority concerned to meet the underlying principles of public tendering. I now move to the stage of tender evaluation The and contract award, the stage where preference is applied. It is a long-standing principle of Commonwealth purchasing that Australian producers should be entitled to the same protection against competition for imports in relation to Government purchases as they enjoy under the Customs tariff in relation to commercial transactions. Accordingly, in the case of Government purchases, departments and authorities are required to evaluate tenders on a duty paid basis whether or not any imported goods offered are to be exempt from duty as Commonwealth Government imports. The Bill provides the necessary procedures to give effect to this policy. Tenderers are also to be required to set out the Austrahan content of the goods tendered or, in the case of purchases of small value, information as to whether the goods are of Australian origin. Authorities will be required to follow the procedures already in general operation and which were described in my media release of 2 October 1979. These procedures have the effect that for draftpurchases under the value at which public tenders are required to be invited, a simple Australian-made preference may be appUed at point of purchase against products identified as imports. For purchases above the public tender threshold, or in smaller purchases where the Australian content method is used, but where the lowest suitable tender is less than $50,000, a general Australian-made preference factor will be applied resulting in a margin of preference related to the Australian content of the goods tendered. In the case of all purchases costing $50,000 or more where the highest AustraUancontent suitable tender is proposed to be passed over, or for lesser purchases with special features, cases are referred to the Minister for Administrative Services who decides the case or refers it for consideration by the Industry Policy Committee of Cabinet. The preference margin applied in the case of purchases which follow the Australian content of approach will be 20 per cent of the value of the Australian content of each tender, the resultant figure being subtracted from each tender price. In the case of smaller purchases, generally below the $5,000 pubhc tender threshold, a loading of 20 per cent is added to the duty paid prices of all offers identified as of imported origin. In both cases, the lowest suitable tender or quotation is then accepted. I propose to introduce an amendment to the Bill in the Budget session to incorporate these preference margins in the legislation. I should mention that the present preference arrangements, and this Bill, recognise the difficulty of arriving at precise measures of Australian content. Accordingly, differences in Austrahan content between tenders of less than 10 per cent are to be disregarded. To ensure that contracts are not awarded to tenderers submitting inaccurate or misleading estimates of local content, selective investigations of claimed Austrahan content levels are undertaken by investigators from the Department of Administrative Services. Lists of suppliers who provide consistent or substantial misstatements of Austrahan content are to be compiled and circulated to Commonwealth departments and authorities. Clause 15 of the Bill provides for the disclosure to interested persons such as unsuccessful tenderers of the level of Australian content of successful tenders. This enables unsuccessful tenderers to challenge any claims they consider doubtful. Also, to ensure that the level of content tendered is achieved, appropriate conditions are being developed to provide for enforcement of Australian content levels submitted by successful tenderers. Spot checks will also be carried out by departmental investigators, particularly in the case of period contracts to ensure that the Australian content, on the basis of which a contract was awarded, is achieved. As I indicated earher, the Bill also provides certain exemptions to be granted by the Minister for Administrative Services where it can be shown that the commercial viability of a government business undertaking or the ability of a Commonwealth authority to fulfil all of its functions, including any financial requirements, would be jeopardised by applying preference to some or all of its purchases. The clause of the Bill concerned, clause 16, is drafted in such a way as to permit exemption of a particular purchase by an authority, of purchases of a particular class of goods by an authority, or of all the purchases of an authority. These exemption provisions are designed to allow the necessary flexibility to deal with special cases whilst not detracting from the overall impact of the policy. Other provisions of the Bill enable the Governor General to make regulations prescribing various matters arising under the clauses, and enable the Minister for Administrative Services to seek such information as he may require concerning procurement by Commonwealth authorities to enable him to administer the legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Klugman) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1980 Bill presented by Mr Staley, and read a first time. Second Reading",61
184,Mr STALEY ,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Chisholm-Minister for Post and Telecommunications) (4.7)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, firstly, to implement pohcy decisions arising from the Government's consideration of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's Report entitled: 'Self-Regulation for Broadcasters?' and, secondly, to provide for the holding of general inquiries by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Honourable members will recall that I foreshadowed the introduction of this Bill in the House on 23 April this year when I explained the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1980. At that time, I mentioned that the Government believed that this was an area of government pohcy which required the widest possible public consultation. Accordingly, the Government's intention is that this Bill be allowed to lie on the table of the House during the coming winter recess. This is designed to provide honourable members and for other interested organisations and individuals an opportunity to study the precise form of the legislation and to make their views known to the Parliament. Therefore, at the same time as I introduce this Bill, I invite all honourable members to forward their comments to me over the coming weeks. I intend to provide copies of the Bill to mterested organisations and members of the public upon request, and I will welcome their comments. In view of the fact that ample opportunity is to be given for detailed scrutiny of the provisions of the Bill, I propose to confine my following remarks to its major features. The Bill provides for the deletion of existing program and advertising standards presently being administered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In their place it introduces a system of codes of broadcasting practice which will require licensees to televise programs designed and suitable for children under the age of 13 years which will establish requirements on broadcasters in the area of Australian content, and which establishes what amount of time will be allowed to be devoted to advertising and nonprogram material. It also relates to the kinds of classifications which are to cover television programs and what announcements broadcasters are to make about Tribunal inquiries. Outside the specific matters provided for in the Bill and subject to the other provisions of the principal Act, for example in relation to blasphemous, indecent or obscene programs, the regulation of programs will be a matter for licensees and their industry bodies. Honourable members will see that the Bill establishes detailed procedures for consultation with broadcasting industry bodies to develop codes. It empowers the Tribunal to approve codes or to determine codes if it is not able give its approval to codes submitted to it. It portant to note that in giving this approval, or its own determination, the Tribunal is required to have regard to representations made to it members of the public and evidence and subSlOm missions from the pubhc at inquiries held by Tribunal. In addition, the Bill provides for general bunal inquiries into any or all of the following matters: The adequacy of radio or television vices in Australia or in any part of Australia, cluding the nature and quality of programs; radio or television broadcasting codes to apply licensees; and the need for radio or television services in Australia or any part of Australia. heve that all who have taken a part in the administration of the broadcasting industry this country-broadcaster s and community orsiderations ganisations alike-hav e uniformly recognised the need for these general inquiries. Finally, I would like to remind the House the inquiry procedures of the Australian Broadthere casting Tribunal are at the moment subject consideration by the Administrative Review bunal. This is an important process and I am conpossibility fident that this review will lead to significant changes in these matters. I would encourage interested member of the Parliament lic to take advantage of this opportunity to comment on Tribunal inquiry procedures. I commend the Btil to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. NA NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",63
185,Mr GROOM ,AUSTRALIA FACILITIES,"Braddon-Minister for Housing and Construction) (4.13)- I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Rehabilitation of Radio Australia facilities, Cox Peninsula, N.T. The proposal is to restore the facilities damaged during Cyclone Tracy with a view to allowing resumption of full overseas transmission service by the end of 1982. This proposal comprises repairs to the access jetty and provision of a new wharf head; repair and structural upgrading of buildings including services and provision of limited cyclone-proof accommodation; repairs to overhead electrical power transmission lines, subto station and switch yards; repair and replacement is imof submarine power cables; and the replacement in of transmitting aerials, associated transmission lines and switching facilities. The estimated cost by of the proposal referred to the Committee was at September 1979 prices, being $6.7m for the radio technical equipment and $3.3m for the civil works component. In reporting favourably on the proposal, the TriPublic Works Committee has made five observations which deserve some comment. In recserommendation 4 the Committee is critical of the in fact that the Department of Defence was not the consulted when the question of a possible to alternative site at Humpty Doo was first con< sidered. I understand that this criticism arises I befrom evidence to the Committee that the Government directed departments to consider in alternative sites in May 1977. Subsequent conindicated major savings in time and capital costs in favour of the Cox Peninsula site and no significant savings in operational costs for other sites. The decision to proceed at Cox Peninthat sula was then taken on economic grounds and was no necessity, at that stage, to consult to the Department of Defence. It was not until TriAugust 1979 when reassessments indicated the of savings in operational costs for the Humpty Doo area that it was then considered any necessary to involve the Department ofDefence or the puband this was done promptly. The Committee also recommends that the Government give early consideration to the installation of a further transmitter at Carnarvon. Preliminary investigations suggest that this is a feasible proposition and it will be considered further. In its final recommendation the Committee indicated that the inland radio service should proceed without delay and that the transmitters should be incorporated into the Radio Australia facilities during the rehabilitation. vision of a high frequency inland radio service to the Northern Territory had been approved and planning for its installation was well advanced at the time of the cyclone in December 1974. Preliminary planning indicates that the most costeffective way of providing the inland service would be to co-locate it with the Radio Austraha facilities at Cox Peninsula. Further detailed propagation studies are being undertaken at present and the timing of the installation will be subject to a satisfactory outcome of these studies and of funding considerations. A further recommendation in the body of the report on which I wish to comment is contained in paragraph 51. It is that the Northern Territory Government be consulted during the design the new wharf head to ensure that it is adapted, at Northern Territory Government expense, for public use. Preliminary consultations to this have already been held with the Northern Terrilieved tory Government. Finally, the Committee notes Government. the possibihty that other sites might be more cost effective but believes the time considerations override such possible benefits and recommends construction of the works in the reference. The Government endorses this view and if the House agrees to support this motion, detailed planning can continue in accordance with the recommennew dations of the Public Works Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (ORD RIVER IRRIGATION) BILL 1980 Debate resumed from 1 May, on motion by unproductive. Mr Anthony: That the Bill be now read a second ume.",64
186,Mr KEATING ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA AGREEMENT,"Blaxland) (4.17)-The Wesfound. tern Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Bill is to enable the Commonwealth Government to provide additional funds to the Ord River project in Western Australia. This assistance is be in the form of a loan for expenditure on crop handling and processing faciUties. Although funds for this loan are avaUable under the agreement between the Commonwealth and agreed Western Australia, that agreement does not vide for expenditure for this purpose. Since joint Commonwealth-Western Australian Ord $10m. River Irrigation Area Review Committee recommended that some of the remaining funds should be used for crop facUities, that agreement is now being amended. The State Government has requested funds to contribute towards the cost of Proan additional 3,000-tonne capacity rice storage and associated facilities. The loan is to be serviced by thericeindustry by way of a levy on rice production. This, of course, is assuming that sufficientriceis produced. Given the history of the Ord there is no guarantee thatricewtil prove a more profitable crop than previous products. The Minister for Trade and Resources ( Mr Anthony) in his second reading speech pointed out that this additional storage capacity will be required to cope with the projected expansion in the rice industry following crop successes over the past few seasons. Although the Opposition is supporting this legislation, we have a great deal less optimism concerning the future of the Ord project than that demonstrated by both the of Commonwealth and Western Australian governments. We support limited funding for the project because a commitment has been made to the end farmers who settled in the area, farmers who be the promises of the Western Australian In the early days of the scheme the then State Minister, now Sir Charles Court, heralded the project as one of the great promises of the future. This is part of the cargo cult mentality which is still carried on by the Premier of Western Australia. Now it is not irrigation schemes, but mines, most of which never eventuated. Sir Charles Court made great projections about rice, sugar cane and oti seed crops, none of which have been achieved. The entire history of the Ord has been one of failure. One of Australia's better known agricultural economists once described it as a triumph of political expediency Second Reading over basic common sense. Close to $100m has been spent on the scheme but it still remains Despite recent limited successes with rice a profitable system of farming the Ord is still to be Its history can be traced back to the 1930s, when it was felt that something should be done to develop the Kimberley region. Tbis was well before there were any signs of the large to mining developments. Various research stations were established during the next 20 years and, after considerable pressure from Western 1968 Australia, the Commonwealth Government in 1957 to provide a grant of $5m. Since prothen large amounts of assistance have been the given. In 1958 this amount was increased to As originally envisaged, the project was to cost $29m and consist of four stages. Only two of these stages have been completed at a cost of nearly $100m. There have been some signs of success during the past 17 years since the project was officially started, but all of these have been very short lived. Of all the crops expected to be grown, cotton became the preferred crop. In 1966-67 farms in the region produced about 20 per cent of Australia's cotton crop; yields were high. It was soon realised that without the payment of the cotton bounty by the Commonwealth that production would have been far from profitable. High hopes were also held for the cattle industry. By the mid-1970s both industries had virtually been destroyed. Insect infestation virtually ruined the cotton crop and insecticide spraying of the cotton also put paid to the potential cattle industry. It has been a really happy story there. It was originally forecast by Sir Charles Court that 20,000 people would settle in the Ord region. How this man can be believed about anything is absolutely beyond me. Yet he is still being listened to by the nation as a seriousMr Hyde-Everyon e is entitled to one error.",65
187,Mr KEATING,WESTERN AUSTRALIA AGREEMENT,"As the honourable gentleman interjects, everyone is entitled to one error, this was a $ 100m error. But what a mess this is. Even when cotton was showing favourable signs, the maximum number of cotton producing farms was 31. That dropped to six with the cotmay ton failures. Now there are 19 farms with some expectations of the number increasing. Thefledgelingrice industry has some potenunreliable tial. The last wet season saw the greatest acreage under crop since the scheme started in 1963 but even with the recent increase inriceproduction the scheme will never reach those production levels originally projected. The Joint Commonwealth-Western Australian Review Committee under the chairmanship Sir Norman Young which completed at the end of 1978 considered the option that the Ord scheme should no longer be supported by government. He stated that this course 'had to seriously considered because of the controversy which has surrounded the Ord project since its inception, and the present low level of proCharles ductivity'. The Committee concluded: In terms of contribution to net increase in national the project has been of no benefit. Despite that conclusion the Committee recommended continued government support of a limited nature of five years. That recommendation was accepted by the Commonwealth GovernAfter ment. On the basis of the Young report there no real argument for continued large financial support by the Commonwealth. The report provides the perfect reasons for phasing out government support for the Ord quickly and spending the funds in more profitable areas. It is unlikely that a profitable use of the Ord will be found. Talk of a sugar cane and ethanol production is now in the wind. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd has recently completed a study for Western Australia on the feasibility of a sugar industry. Apparently the conclusion of this study was that sugar would be uneconomic unless the price received were greater than $350 a tonne. The current price is about only $325 a tonne. This makes it much more expensive to grow sugar in the Ord than in Queensland. When transport costs are included, ethanol production would also be uneconomic. Another proposal being looked at for the region is to use the main dam as a source of hydroelectricity. The quantity of water in this dam is about nine times that in Sydney Harbour. A feasibility study is currently being conducted by the Federal, Western Australian and Northern Territory governments. Under the proposed scheme, Western Australia would build a 60 megawatt station costing about $45 m and it but would cost a further $45m to build a 600area kilometre transmission line to Darwin. Local power demand would not be enough to warrant this project but with the demand of Darwin it prove viable. Darwin is certainly in need of new sources of power. The Federal Government is facing increasing subsidies for the city's power system. A condition of the Northern Territory achieving self-government was that Darwin power charges would be kept at the same level as those in northern Queensland. These subsidies could amount to $50m by the early 1980s. The construction of a hydro scheme could at least save this expense. In the long run, it may prove to be a profitable use of the largest of white elephant Australia has ever been its inquiry associated with. The irony of the Ord scheme is that there is a be very strong likelihood that commercial diamond deposits are under the main dam. That is indeed ironic for the most indefatigable of miners, Sir Court. It may be that the best reserves in the State are under the water itself. It may output eventuate that the dam should be drained in order to mine these deposits. MrHyde-Ha, ha!",66
188,Mr KEATING,WESTERN AUSTRALIA AGREEMENT,"On e cannot help but laugh. 20 years and the expenditure of $ 100m we is may end up where we were 20 years ago before the scheme began. This is all part of the imagination, involving the Third World battle and things like that, of Sir Charles Court. He talked about these things at the Australian Mining Industry Council meeting last Monday. He has never changed his tune. It is the same story, the same appeal-the cargo cult mentality of more mines, more projects, more development. Apparently the economics are just to be ignored. Whether one can sell the material, whether one can get it to market, whether one can get the right price, whether the ore bodies are of sufficient grade to be mined, whether the shape of the ore bodies can be handled by engineering are all beside the point. Everyone has to rush into develop because the great Sir Charles Court has deemed that this is the way in which Australia should be developed. The Ord River scheme stands to condemn him for that style of thinking in Australia. It should expose to most people the fact that this development for development's sake syndrome which Sir Charles Court and others are associated with does not bring employment or wealth to the cities of Australia, to the areas where people could really use these kinds of pubhc infrastructure and public resources. I believe that places very serious caveats on the unfettered development syndrome under which people like Sir Charles Court tend to operate. Of course Australia wants development; but it wants sensible, planned, coordinated and rational development by which the wealth accrues to the Australian people and hundreds of millions of dollars of public infrastructure are used for the great benefit of most Australians and not to satisfy the wild dreams of some recalcitrant State Premiers.",66
189,Mr COTTER ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA AGREEMENT,"Kalgoorlie) (4.29)-I wish to being, make a few comments on the Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Bill 1980. It pleases me to note that the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) had a very reasoned and reasonable approach to the subject, although I disagree on quite a few of the points he made. I had prepared a lot of background formation for this debate but apparently the honourable member for Blaxland used the same briefing material; so I will not go through that area. It just demonstrates that there can be a tain amount of bipartisanship in this Parliament grown. when it comes to great projects like the Ord River scheme. The Ord River scheme, ofcourse, as everyone would know, is in the northern part of my electorate. It is about 3,500 kilometres from Perth. My electorate itself is some 3,500 4,000 kilometres in length and some 2,500 to 3,000 kilometres wide. So I can easily fit into some of the big projects such as the Pilbara iron ore mines and the Ord River scheme. Whilst many problems have been attached to the Ord River scheme one of the main faults I could find with it was that it was developed before its time. I think that history will demonstrate that the Ord River scheme in the longer term will be a well worthwhile and highly successful operation. Over many years the farmers of the Ord River scheme have had an enormous number of problems unprecedented in farming and rural industries. They have had to cope with the massive growth of weeds and the massive growth and expansion of insect plagues in that northern area, mostly because never before anywhere in Australia has there been a tropical, permanently wet agricultural environment. The honourable member for Blaxland mentioned the failure of the cotton crops and other crops in that area which devasted the farmers concerned. These were definite failures. Whilst it is often said that the Government has put a lot of money into the area, individual farmers have also been prepared to stake many years of their lives and enormous quantities of their own personal money. It is not all a one-sided picture. There are 24 farmers presently on the Ord River, not 19 as the honourable member for Blaxland indicated earlier. There is a growing tendency for farmers to take up land on the Ord River. In fact, today more country in the Ord River area is under agriculture than ever before. That demonstrates that most of the problems which have beset the farmers in the past are in fact being solved. The future of the Ord River scheme, I believe, is very bright indeed. During the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland we heard the historical rundown of how the Ord River came into its size and the extent of the irrigable area. We also heard about the three stages of the scheme. So I will not go over all of that ground. There are some very interesting factors. For instance, at present 22,000 acres are under agriculture with 24 farms now productive. Many crops are being successfully grown. In the last 12 inmonths production was as follows: Sunflower, 4,000 tonnes; rice, 6,000 tonnes; sorghum, 2,000 tonnes; soya beans, 2,000 tonnes and mung beans, 150 tonnes. Other crops, particularly large cerareas of experimental crops, were successfully The Ord River today is playing a very important part as a research centre for tropical agriculture not only for Australia but also for near to member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. While on a visit last year to it several ASEAN countries I was privileged to see and note several Australian aid projects in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, for instance. Those countries are using techniques developed in the Ord River scheme. Some of the crops that are proving to be highly successful in the Ord River irrigation area are presently being promoted and grown in these countries and the necessary techniques are being taught to the local indigenous people. I took particular note, for instance, that the crops of mung beans now being grown in the aid projects in the ASEAN countries are a source of high protein food. They are being promoted as a large scale crop for use by large numbers of people. The basic research work on those crops was done on the Ord River. More recently we have seen the growth of sugar cane production on the Ord River. It has proven highly successful. As reported in the West Australian of 6 September 1979, the Department of Agriculture has stated that 20 hectares of sugar cane gave an average yield of 216 tonnes per hectare, with an average extractable sugar content of 13.03 per cent, equivalent to an average of 28.24 tonnes per hectare. The Australian yield is a Uttle more than 11 tonnes per hectare. Little wonder that cane growers in Queensland are interested hi growing their sugar quota on the Ord River. Obviously, if the yield per hectare can be almost doubled costs will be much lower. So there is great interest on the part of Queensland cane growers to move to the Ord River scheme and grow their sugar quota there. That is quite a new and growing aspect and one of the reasons why the Ord River may prove to be totally viable, but that will take some time. In addition to the growing of sugar in the area, there is the prospect of developing an ethanol plant for the production of transport fuels for north of Australia. Although the concept is in early stages, with the ever-increasing prices and oil products and the long haul to northern Australia, I have no doubt that at some time in the future a viable ethanol plant will be develin oped in the Ord River area. A feasibUity study is being undertaken conthe cerning the development of a hydro-electric scheme on the Ord River. It is to the credit of planners, and particularly the Premier of Westbut ern Australia, that they showed sufficient foresavings sight when the dam was being built to make proamounts vision for buUding into the wall a hydro-electric power station. If the feasibUity study proves that the project will be viable, a 60 megawatt power station will be installed in the wall. Power then be transmitted to Darwin. This would save enormous quantities of fuel oU which are being burnt in the northern part of Australia. Such a power station would have the capacity also to supply power to East Kimberley projects, especially the valuable projects associated with the Argyle diamond finds, the nickel, lead and zinc deposits around Halls Creek, as well as the sUver, lead and zinc deposits in the Northern Territory and just north of the Ord River dam itself. Very big ore bodies have been proven in that area. The difficulty in developing them in the extreme north of Australia is posed by the logistics and high cost involved. As is well known, the first major project to get off the ground in the area wtil help to trigger a whole series of mining developments. The infrastructure and service industries needed for a mining development would then be in a much better position to service a second, third or fourth project. I have little doubt that a viable diamond project will be developed at Argyle, which runs down into the headwaters of the Ord River dam. It has been described in the Press quite openly as the richest diamond find in the world, with an estimated value of $4,000 bUUon. I repeat, $4,000 billion, not $4,000m. That is a lot of money. The diamond earth has the highest grade that has been discovered anywhere in the world and the indications are that we could see a viable mining operation in that area very shortly. I pay tribute to the people of the Kimberleys, of Kununurra, for their determination to stay on when everything appeared to be against them, when no government appeared to have much interest in their welfare. Those people fought on against enormous odds. They pay the highest tax rate in Australia. They have a differential tax rate the which would operate as a penalty on any person. its It is something that, apart from other aspects, of oil needs to be rectified. Every item that is transported to Kununurra attracts a higher rate of tax than is levied anywhere else that I know of Australia. Even on a daily basis, those people pay a higher rate of tax than does anybody else. It is estimated that their cost of living, as well as cost of buUding and development, is about 2% times that of people in the southern parts of the the State. That is an enormous penalty to pay, people have been wtiling to pour their life into the area, to devote to it enormous of work as well. They have proven that, with determination and grit-and certainly some government assistance by way of subsidy and the Uke-the important aspects of tropical agriculcould tural research can be carried out. I am not for one moment suggesting that at this stage the Ord River project is viable. It is a long way from being so but the present Bill permits moneys to be loaned to the Western Austrahan Government for its development. It is estimated that a sum of $320,000 will be needed. I have before me a copy of a letter from Mr Andrew Mensaros, the Minister for Works and Water Resources in Western Australia, to Senator Carriek amending the State's original application for funds. Originally an application was made for funds to build a 3,000 tonne rice storage silo on the Ord River. The estimated cost escalated from $500,000 to $738,000 and eventually to about $1.3m, when the ancillary equipment is taken into account. The present proposal is to build a storage facility with a capacity of 1,200 tonnes, at a cost of about $320,000, plus an additional $30,000 to upgrade a transformer and switch gear. That is the amount that would be authorised under this Bill. I ask that the letter, in its entirety, be incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The letter read asfollowsDear Senator Carriek, On April 24 this year I wrote to you advising that sulting engineer had been instructed to proceed with the preparation of tender documents for the construction of a 3000 tonne silo at Kununurra. Tenders have now beenreceivedfor the site works and structural steel components of the silo. The lowest tender in each case has been considerably above the estimate and it has become apparent that the silo and associated facilities will cost considerably more than the estimated $738,000. The State Government has therefore decided not to proceed with construction of the 3000 tonne silo but instead to construct a further four 300 tonne silos. These smaller silos form part of the ultimate batch drying complex and as outlined in my previous letter, have been an option given close considerauon by the State. The 1200 tonnes of storage and associated conveyors are estimated to cost $320,000 and in addition, as for the 3000 tonne silo, $30,000 is required to upgrade the transformer and switchgear supplying the rice mill to cope with the increased load. This late change of plans is to beregrettedbut the tion in cost for the large silo left the State Government no option. Your formal approval for the construction of the 1200 tonnes of storage under the Western Australian Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Act 1968-80 is sought as a matter of urgency to allow this facility rice harvest in October-November 1980.

190,Mr COTTER,WESTERN AUSTRALIA AGREEMENT,"I thank the House. The loan to develop this grain handling facility will be repaid by a levy imposed on the growers. Thus in the longer term the growers themselves will repay it. It is unlike the type of assistance that has been provided to other primary industries, such as the wool growing, wheat growing and other industries in respect of which it has been necessary from time to time to provide government assistance. In respect of research, I wish to refer to the quite amazing defeat of the insect problem that was encountered on the Ord River during the period when cotton was grown there. Insects became such a problem that as many as 30 sprayings a season were necessary and even then the yields from crops were enormously reduced. Basically, the Heliothis caterpillar caused most of the problem. It was discovered that the use of chemicals had all sorts of deleterious effects not Minister's Office only on the environment itself but also on aniDumas House, mals that graze in the area and on its water fowl 2 Havelock Street, and bird life. Moreover, an enormous build-up West Perth Western Australia 6005 of chemicals in the soil occurred. It was apparent that that rate of application of chemicals could the connot continue and when the cotton industry fell into a hole a great deal of research was done on the control of insects. It was soon discovered that another native insect was a predator of the Heliothis. It was bred in millions and, upon being released, almost wiped out the Heliothis. There has now been the further development that if any of the insect populations get out of balance the ability exists to use viruses for their control. Those are quite exciting and far-reaching developments in the control of insects. They could have application not only in tropical agriculture but also elsewhere. If we develop a biological warfare situation in which an insect species gets out of balance, we will be able to use viruses-experimenta l plots have been used to prove the viability of this method-to bring the escala- insect population back into balance. The crops with that have been grown in the area have provided many employment prospects for people who presently live in the Ord River and Kimberley areas. to be completed in time for the The honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) said many derogatory things about the Yours sincerely Premier of Western Australia. For example, he NA Minister for Works said that he was a leader of a cargo cult and that and Water Resources he had not developed any worthwhile projects. I just remind the honourable member that it was mostly the vision of Sir Charles Court, the Premier of the day Sir David Brand, and others in the Western Australian Parliament which initiated the massive Pilbara iron ore developments and which initiated the development of other projects in the Kimberleys. Those people have been far sighted in that they are responsible for the velopment of many job creating activities in those areas. Whilst the honourable member for Blaxland criticised Sir Charles Court for encouraging more development, more projects and more railway lines, he did not say anything about the greater number of jobs that are created. He cannot get away from the fact that over 40,000 people are living in the Pilbara region of Western Austraha who were not Uving in that area a few short years ago. It is foohsh to say that mining developments do not create jobs. It is quite well demonstrated that whilst mining developments are not high employers of labour in the mines themselves, the spin-off and multipUer effects of those developments are quite dramatic. Many people depend on these mining industries one way or another, either directly or indirectly, for their employment. It is with this in mind that I have great concourse, fidence in the Kimberley area. Not only have confidence in the developments for the mining of the diamond, nickel, lead and zinc deposits, but also do I think the Ord River scheme itself will prove one day to be a very viable, worthwhile operation. If it saves the amount of provisions oil which we believe it will save when power is deUvered to the east Kimberley region and to Darwin-it is an enormous quanuty of powerthat will have a large beneficial effect on our foreign reserve earnings which will far outweigh the expenditure on the Ord River. In fact, I am given to understand that it could outweigh that expenditure in one year alone. The power possischemes bUity of the Ord River scheme is quite dramatic. It cannot be dismissed. I am confident that it will isscribed be one of the major developments in that area. In the few seconds that I have remaining, I enormous tribute to the people who have not given in. The people connected with the Ord River scheme and the people of Kununurra and Wyndham have been determined to see this scheme through. I know some of those very well indeed. I know that they have put the best part of their lives into the development of and research into the Ord River. They have spent enormous quantities of money-thei r own to money-in developing their farms and producing products which today are proving to be viable. believe that the Ord River scheme will one day be viable and will justify the far-sightedness of Sir Charles Court in this area.",69
191,Mr KERIN ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Werriwa) (4.49)-For much the same reasons as were given by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Cotter), the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. We recognise de- that the money could have been better spent but we are not opposing the Bill, for the sake of the people of the area. They have put their money into the area and they are the people who have shown the determination. There is a fair amount of consensus in this debate in terms of the people of Kununurra and the Ord River area. However, I take issue with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in that he misstated the case put by the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating). He said that the honourable member for Blaxland stated that mining projects did not create jobs. The Australian Labor Party has never said that. AU the honourable member for Blaxland was pointing out was Sir Charles Court's cargo cult mentaUty. Sir Charles seems to think that we should mine anything regardless of the circumstances. The whole point of the question is that it is harsh economics that determine whether various projects will be viable. Of it is harsh economics that have rendered do I the Ord River scheme such a disaster. I will not go through the machinery aspects of this Btil. We all know what they are. Of the funds very avaUable, a sum is now to be diverted for the of rice storage facUities. It is a great pity that the scheme has run into so much trouble, but it is not with hindsight that its critics have been triumphant. Mr Bruce Davidson and quite a few other economists have been debating a long time. This was as far back Australia the wisdom of irrigation throughout for as the early 1960s, if not the 1950s, when some of these were being looked at with a new vigour for thefirsttime. At best the project could be deas experimental- a $ 100m experiment. It indicative of its lack of success as an irrigation project that suggestions such as that to build a hydro-electric power station for another $90m, pay to drain Lake Argyle to mine for diamonds or, in the context of irrigation, to allow South East Asian migrants to farm the area, have been made. It is in the context that these comments have been made seriously that we can see the people lack of success of the scheme. There are few political points to be made by rubbishing the scheme totally but, if the blame is be sheeted home, it must be laid at the feet of Sir Charles Court, or Cargo Cult Court as he is I known. Sir Charles does not understand market economics. However, he certainly understands the pork barrel. In pursuing such a wildly rural socialist scheme he'has effectively wasted scores of millions of taxpayers' dollars with no gain to the national revenue. Quite apart from the agronomic problems, the scheme was doomed by the factor of transport costs which added to input costs and the costs of freight to market. Having spent the initial money, governments have been trying desperately to find some justification for it and have poured good money after bad. Once capital has been expended on the construction of a dam there is no turning back. Even if a project is an abject failure, the economist's dictum is the same as that of the understandof ing lover-let bygones by bygones. Many an interesting human relationship has been built on past experience and many an economic opportunity has been created by past expenditure. In economics, however, past mistakes are not validated by future successes. The present Government recognised the problems of the Ord River project and in 1977 it appointed a joint State-Commonwealth review committee to review the project and report on the future development of the area. That report was tabled in this Parliament on 27 February 1979. The Bill which is before the House flows directly from that report. We all know of the various industries that have collapsed over the years. The review committee basically had two options-to recommend that the scheme be no longer supported by the Government or to recommend that support be continued in some way. Thefirstoption was seriously considered because of the controversy which has surrounded the Ord project since its inception and because of its present low level of productivity. The Committee found that in terms of contribution to net increase in national output the project has been of no benefit at all. The review committee believed that a decision in effect to abandon the Ord project would not have been justified because,firstly,there was no basis for assuming that the adverse factors which had inhibited the development of the Ord project in the past, including in particular the cotton industry, would necessarily persist in the future; and, secondly, because further time was still needed in order to determine whether the combined results of research programs and commercial farming experience since the failure of the cotton industry were hkely to provide a basis for profitable agricultural activities in Ord region in the future. They are both basically status quofindingsand they must be subject to the greatest doubt. In my mind they tend to represent a political rather than an economic finding. Anyone who has looked at the report will know what the committee's recommendations are. I may as well read them into the Hansard record. Thefirstone reads: the Western Australian Government should consider an expansion of agricultural research in the ORIA. The second recommendation reads: the Commonwealth Government shouldreappraiseits commitment to agricultural and environmental research in the ORIA,recognising that by and large the research programs CSIRO do not have a directrelevanceto the immediate problems of the ORIA. The Committee also recommended: . . . that the West Australian Government should provide support for commercial farming on the ORIA for a specific period. I think last year it underwrote the safflower crop, but in the event no pubhc money was needed. The review committee really only pointed to the possibility ofriceand safflower production being commercially successful. It stated that the cultivation of the soya bean and the mung bean could be in prospect if technical and market arrangements could be overcome. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed to some of the research possibilities in that area. The review committee concluded that the cultivation of sugar, sugar cane and cassava for ethanol, kenaf for the production of pulp or paper and cotton are all highly suspect as viable activities. Even withrice,it is my understanding that the submission by the Western Australian Government to the review committee considered rice viable only if a subsidy were involved and if a very efficient rice mill were constructed; hence the Bill before us. The rice project still has to overcome the problems of birds and transport once it can get over the problem of insects. One thing the review committee was not asked to look at was the cost of getting out. If such a project were entertained-mayb e in five years time it will be-the cost would be considerable as Kununurra is now a minor administrative centre. The abandonment of irrigation works will entail much work to leave them in an environmentally the failure of safe condition. I guess at this time it may be more sensible to talk about drought than irrigation. If we can combine the two concepts, it is generaUy agreed now that it is far cheaper to avoid the effects of drought by storing grain than by irrigation. I the would Uke to spend the last of my few minutes talking about the whole ideas of the economics of irrigation because what has happened in the Ord, I think, is symptomatic of what will happen with respect to any major irrigation project in this country in the immediate future. We all understand the pressure by various people for irrigation projects, particularly if they are in a river valley and where a dam and irrigation solve some of their immediate problems and give them an edge on their fellow farmers. By and large, it is the public purse that has to come good in these sorts of areas. Very few, if any, of our public irrigation schemes, including the land settlements schemes established in the Murray-Darling basin after both world wars, have been regarded totally as an economic success. To many this seems incongruous. We have almost 1.5 m hectares under irrigation in Austraha. Almost two-thirds of it is used for lucerne and pasture production for our efficient and profitable livestock industries. Irrigation accounts for almost all of our cotton industry; about 93 per cent of our tobacco crop; more than 20 per cent of production in our efficient sugar industry; two-thirds of our vegetables and grapes; and half of the national fruit crop. Over 250,000 hectares of cereals are grown on irrigated land. Most of our community leaders are aware that irrigation, despite its trials and tribulations, has been an integral part of the development of rural Austraha. So there is a paradox. We are reaping the benefits of some of the pasture irrigation projects in the past, but they do not stand up to the economic tests of today. I guess we can point to the paradox even further by saying that much of the development in Australia has been based on failures and the lessons of those failures. So what is the key to this paradox? Many of the pioneering efforts of our predecessors, if required to pass these rigorous cost-benefit analyses to which modern irrigation proposals are subjected, would never have been undertaken. Yet, in many cases, those very pioneering efforts have paved the way to growth, development and, in some cases, prosperity. Some of Australia's foremost pohtical, scienrelevant tific and commercial people have concluded from this paradox that there is something fundaexpenditure mentally wrong with the way economists evaluto ate irrigation proposals. They say that economables ists have no vision and that their dollars and cents mentality is too narrow. If they had their way we would never buUd for the future. I benon-irrigated Ueve this view is not well founded. Unfortunately for the proponents of the expansion of irrigation in Australia, it is not well founded. The answer the paradox, of course, Ues in the concept of sunk capital. When, eventually, someone make money from production of something-w e yet know not what in the Ord River-in some irrigation area, many wtil claim that the faith was justified and that the economic pessimists were proven wrong. I believe those who stake that sort of claim wtil not be vindicated and will deceive only a few voters in the very short term. If uneconomic projects had not been undertaken, the funds would have been invested elsewhere or would have been spent by taxpayers on current consumption and would have indirectly generated further investment. The community would have benefited from the increased income yielded by the wiser investments. The economic opportunities opened by these investments would, a priori, have been at least equal to those opened up by the capital sunk into an uneconomic irrigation scheme. It is certainly true that large amounts of expenditure by governments are allocated to areas not subjected to the samerigorouscost-benefit analyses that irrigation proposals are. However, that is very much a second-best argument in favour of irrigation schemes. Thefirst-bestsolution is that similar economic tests should be appUed to expenditure by governments in other areas and, it is hoped, this is a trend that is gaining some momentum. It is a pity that some of these analyses are not put forward on proposals such as the Casey University or whatever that idea is now called. To assess the economic benefit of irrigation we have to look first of all at the key variables in agriculture, one of which is market prices for agricultural commodities and the relative costs of dry-land versus irrigation production and marketing. Here again, if we just talk about market prices, we need to add another qualificationthat is, that prices are determined not only by domestic and export demand but also by the exchange rate and the exchange rate itself is determined by other aspects of the economy. It is to ask whether changes in the key variables that determine the economics of public on irrigation may have been such as reverse earlier conclusions. These key variinclude the production of agricultural commodity relevant to the cost of dry-land versus irrigated. The relative costs of irrigated versus production are affected mainly by technical change. For practical purposes, the latter issue probably comes down to whether techto nological progress has been faster in water rentention and reticulation and irrigated production begins to or in dry-land farming. Developments in the technology of water retention and reticulation are well outside the field of an agricultural economist, but we need to point out that extensive agriculture seems to be becoming more and more economic relative to intensive production under irrigation. Large scale grain production has increased in profitability because much larger machinery has increased the efficiency of dry-land farming. Greatly improved timeliness in cultivation, sowing and harvesting has substantially improved the farmers' capacity to capitalise on limited supplies of soil moisture. The only other matter I would like to touch on is the question of the price of irrigation water. First of all if we look at the way the price of gation water is administered through all the complex of Commonwealth and State government departments with respect to the River Murray irrigation systems in the various States, we really do have a dog's breakfast and not something related to market economics as such. I think the whole question of economic organisation and administration of irrigation in Austraha is something that needs to be looked at one day. If I can use an analogy in terms of the way I beheve irrigation water should be priced, we can take the supposed rationale behind the Government's policy of charging consumers of liquid fuels the full economic cost of those fuels. The rationale for that has two fundamental premises: When fuel is cheap, consumers will waste it; when fuel is cheap producers will not search for undeveloped new fuels and new methods of using fuels. One can argue about whether that is the main motivation of the Government. I think the main motivation is revenue. That is the stated rationale and in economic terms there is some sense to it if the Government were being honest about its implementation. If we can apply that sort of reasoning, there are really two basic ways of rationing supplies and stimulating production of scarce resources a mixed enterprise economy like that of production. Australia's. One is to charge the correct econspect omic price, and this method involves decencept tralised decision making, fewer administrators, and the prospect of efficiency losses through itical patronage is low. If an early experience the fuel pricing policy is any indication, we to see that there is still an amount of political, not patronage, indecision because the GovernAustralia. ment is not following its pohcy through. The alternative method, if I can come back the subject of water, is the basic method of regulating production or regulating prices by means of a complex set of administrative procedures, regulations and rules of thumb by which production decisions and the needs of individual consumers are determined centrally. This method is administratively costly and, to my mind, its effectiveness is a matter for empirical investigation. Historically, price has played only a very minor role in determining the quantity of irrigation water retained or the allocation of water among competing uses in Australia. Prices have generally been set to cover only annual servicing charges, excluding the capital cost of structures. For example, in the initial study of the Bundaberg scheme, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in 1974 estimated the economic cost of water as $39.38 a millilitre. Charges in that irriyear ended up being $13 a millilitre. So we can point to many places where the price of irrigation water is not charged at an economic rate. I would say that in straightforward terms the price paid for most water used in irrigation in Australia is too low. If prices were increased, a number of improvements in the economic organisation of irrigation could be expected. First, high prices would result in reduced use of water by current users. This would free some water for use by existing irrigators on other parts of their land for other crop or livestock production or for application to new land. Secondly, a recognition of the true value of water would result in many irrigators increasing their use of other inputs, particularly fertiliser. This again would result in increased efficiency in irrigated agricultural production. Thirdly, new producers would be able to enter irrigated agricultural production, thus increasing the efficiency of production on some existing dry land holdings. Fourthly, strong incentives would be given for the reduction of water wasting. One could point to a few other benefits in a strictly economic sense. I do not think strict economics will prevail in this matter. It is subject to so much political bargaining and farmers have so in much at stake in their existing level and mode of That is the whole problem with reto the Ord River scheme. We have this conof sunk capital. The money has been put there. The farmers have put money in. Some of polthem have gone bust, some have stayed and of some are farming at less than the optimum level; seem but they are stuck there. That is the way many if farmers feel about irrigation throughout The basic problem of the Ord is not just the to economics of water and of irrigation. In fact we can produce large quantities of agricultural commodities without irrigation. The basic factors that have always prevailed against the success of the Ord scheme have been agronomic factors and the distance from supply centres and markets. The cost of getting inputs for agricultural production in that place, some 3,500 kilometres from Perth, has been overwhelming. That is why the project has not succeeded. To sum up, the Opposition does not oppose this move by the Government. It will involve only a small amount of money, considering what has been spent there. We do not oppose it for the sake of the people who are stuck there, the people who have put their own money in, and because of the determination with which they are trying to continue to make a living in that part of the world.

192,Mr HURFORD ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Adelaide) (5.11)-The Cus(b), (c) or(d) of sub-section toms Amendment Bill (No. 3) passed through the House ofRepresentatives a few days ago. We were told at the time that there had been full of secconsultation with all interested parties. Regrettably, that has proved not to be so. Those affected by the warehousing provisions of this Bill were not consulted. They have subsequently been in touch not only with me and some of my colleagues but also with the Government. I should explain that the Customs agents were given 10 months to consult with the Government and were given the draft Bill, but somehow the Austrahan Duty Free Operators Association was not brought into the arrangements for consultation, although it was grievously affected by provisions in the Bill. I do not wish to be misrepresented or misunderstood on this question. As I said earlier, the Association got in touch with me, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Garland) and others in recent days. I am glad to see the Minister now in the chamber so that he is able to put his interpretation on this matter. The complaints and charges of the Australian Duty Free Operators Association, which have been substantiated by many honourable members on both sides of the chamber, were that its civil rights had been trampled on. As has now been noted, from the Association's point of view there are some quite horrific requirements for the keeping of personal records and the divulging of personal information. The Government came up with some amendments in the Senate. Regrettably, they are so numerous and some of them are so small that they have not even been read to the Committee. If they were read, anybody listening would be very bored. They were moved in total in the way that the Minister, who is at the table, has just moved them. I assert on behalf of the Opposition that, from our study of this important subject, the amendments do not go far enough. We know that the Government has attempted to correct the original deficiencies, and for that I give it credit. In the short time the Opposition has had to examine these last minute amendments, it seems, I repeat, that they do not go far enough to safeguard the normal civil rights of people conducting warehouses. In the Senate last night the Opposition moved seven amendments, which some Government there senators supported. Whether they did so by their votes I am not sure because, as honourable members in this chamber know, we do have the advantage of being able to read the Senate Hansard, or House of Representatives Hansard, which covers the period of the sitting late last night and early this morning when seven amendments were moved. I have had verAdelaide bal information from one or two Government the senators to the effect that they support at least two or three of the Opposition's amendments. I did the right thing. I got in touch with the Ministhe ter and said how much I hoped he would accept at least two or three of the seven amendments. He explained to me that because it was the last sitting day in this session, he did not have take the amendments to the relevant committees of the Cabinet to pursue the matter in the that he would want to. Mr Garland-Than k you for that! I will remember that when I am speaking to you on the phone next.",74
193,Mr HURFORD,ANDREW MENSAROS,"I did not realise that that was confidential information. I apologise if it was. The Minister certainly should have said so if it was. I cannot understand why it would be confidential information. I am explaining why I readily accept the attitude which the Minister expressed to me prior to our coming into this chamber. That, indeed, is the only reason why I am not pressing the amendments right now. I do draw everyone's attention to the amendments which will appear in the Senate Hansard, when it is available. I will not take up the time of the House by repeating those amendments for the reasons which the Minister has given to me which I understood would be made public. I do hope nevertheless that the Minister will look at t the amendments moved in the Senate. Indeed, I will follow up, in writing to him, the details of those amendments. I hope he will take back to the Cabinet committees, to the Government parties, to this chamber and to the Senate at the earliest opportunity during the Budget session, more safeguards for the civil liberties of people who are affected by this legislation. Although one or two of the Government's amendments which have just been moved do clear up some points that were in conflict with or harsh on the people concerned, similar problems in other clauses of the Bill we believe have been overlooked. I will not go into the details now. I do have strong objections to the fact that we have to deal with this legislation at the last minute, on the last day of this session. However, is much in the Bill that makes it advisable for us to see it passed. I hope and trust that we will have another opportunity of clearing up the not yet outstanding matters very soon.",75
194,Mr GARLAND ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Curtin-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.18)- I find the rethose marks made by the honourable member for ( Mr Hurford) somewhat astonishing in circumstances. It is not the first time that he has made points like this in this chamber in a seemingly reasonable way. I want to point out to House how unreasonable his suggestions are. In the first place, this Bill contains a great number of amendments. In a technical sense it is complicated because of the necessity for the time to draftsman to make amendments over a number of issues in a way that will leave the legislation way complete. Often a simple amendment will require consequential amendments later on. The honourable member told us that he has not had enough time. This Bill was introduced in this chamber weeks ago. I provided the Opposition with officials who were experts in a number of areas so that it would be able to consider these matters. It is not true for the honourable member to say that no consultations were held. In my speech, I referred to the Customs agents' organisations. Certainly there were a number of consultations with them. It is true that another organisation- I think its name is the Duty Free Agents Association or a similar name-contacte d me, I think on 9 May, and put to me the proposition that there ought to be some amendments. A large number of amendments were made. In fact, the actual amendments we are dealing with from the Senate are based on matters which this organisation raised. The Opposition introduced into the Senate yesterday further amendments to those already introduced. These could have been considered by the Opposition a long time ago. They were based on matters which were drawn to the attention of many honourable members, on this side of the House as well as the Opposition. As I have said, these provisions have been sitting in the Bill for some weeks. Now the Opposition wants to go further. This proposal was drawn to my attention after lunch today.",75
195,Mr HURFORD ,ANDREW MENSAROS,B y me.,76
196,Mr GARLAND,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Well, it was actually menwith. tioned by somebody elsefirst,but certainly it raised by the honourable member around that time. To be more precise, it was drawn to attention around 2.30 p.m. Mr Chairman, as you know, amendments are not made lightly to Acts of Parliament. Therefore they cannot really made quickly. Anybody who has any experience matter. with drafting knows that amendments to legislation have to go through a process. They have to go through an examination by parliamentary draftsmen to ensure that what is being changed in one clause of a Bill does not affect other clauses. Since the Opposition is taking the tude that we are rushing this legislation, let point out that this matter has been discussed interested parties for quite some time. Members of the Opposition did not approach the Governtiations ment in the Senate and say: 'We think that there are deficiencies in these amendments and we want to make seven more amendments'. By not doing so the Opposition did not give us an opporment tunity to look at them last night. They were brought in at the last minute and the Opposition tried to move them all at once. At 3 o'clock this afternoon when I asked for a copy of those proposed amendments-the Senate Hansard has not been published yet- I found that I could not get a copy of them.",76
197,Mr HURFORD ,ANDREW MENSAROS,I would have given you a copy.,76
198,Mr GARLAND,ANDREW MENSAROS,"That may be so. One would think that anyone who genuinely wanted amendments made to a Bill would go to the Minister and say: ' I think these changes ought to be made at the earliest possible moment'. So I reject the suggestion that the Government has not been cooperative and not been endeavouring to do its best. I have the Government's authority to make changes to the Bill to try to meet a number of objections. To be confronted with this suggestion regarding a number of additional amendments proposed virtually at the last minute, I do not believe is fair or vahd. There has been sufficient time to consider this Bill. As I indicated to the honourable member earlier, I am prepared to look at these additional amendments and to have them examined. I am also prepared, if I come to the conclusion that the present provisions will lead to anything unfair- I am not convinced of that on the basis of the evidence that has been put to me so far-it may be possible and lawful for me to do something administratively. In the meantime, the Government proposes to proceed with this legislation. There are a number of other provisions and objectives in the Bill. I do reject the proposition that we have been in any/way difficult to deal On the contrary- I put this to the Opwas position because I think a number of those remarks made by the honourable member have my been unfair-the Government has shown a high degree of willingness in trying to meet the objections of organisations in the community and be comments of senators and members in this",76
199,Mr HURFORD ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Adelaide) (5.22)-The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Garland) has no grounds for rejecting anything. He was not in the chamber at the beginning of attimy remarks, so he did not know that I had put me the matter totally into context before he came by into the chamber. I explained that there had been 10 months-mor e than normal-of negowith the Customs agents' association. I gave the Government credit for that. I explained that even the Customs agents' association had received a copy of the Bill. I gave the Goveracredit for that. But I do not blame the Minister personally for the oversight. There was an oversight inasmuch as the Australian Duty Free Operators Association was not taken into consultations. Indeed, it did not approach the Opposition about the legislation until this Bill had received the pubUcity by being passed by this chamber. It is only since it has been passed by this chamber that these matters have been drawn to our attention. Jointly, we have come to the conclusion that there is harshness in the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 3) as it relates to people who run warehouses and their employees. Jointly we have come to our separate conclusions on that harshness. The Government has moved a number of amendments in the Senate. It was only in relation to those amendments which were moved yestermentioned day by the Government in the Senate that I that the Opposition had not had time to consider them properly; nor had the Opposition had ume to consider the extra representations which have been made by a number of other people. Repcannot resentations have been made not only by the Duty Free Operators Association but also by the important Storemen and Packers Union of Australia which represents hundreds and huninto dreds of people working in warehouses and who are affected by this legislation. It was in relation to that matter that I said there had not been to look at the Government's amendments and to compare them with what we considered would be adequate amendments to safeguard the civil liberties of those people running these warehouses and operating in them. I assert that aU of the amendments of the Opposition have great merit. After I heard of the fate of the Governthat ment's amendments in the Senate and, indeed, the rejection of the Opposition's amendments the Senate, at the first available opportunity offered to explain those amendments to the Minin ister. I understand he did not have the time-h a busy Minister-and I do not blame him for that. Mr Garland-Wha ttimewas that?",76
200,Mr HURFORD,ANDREW MENSAROS,I rang the Minister at 2.30 this afternoon. Mr Garland-What about all morning?,77
201,Mr HURFORD,ANDREW MENSAROS,"I gather that the Minister was busy with other matters this morning. One would only have to follow the proceedings in this chamber this morning to know that there were matters to be dealt with other than this legisgestions lation that now concerns us. I had hoped that least three of the seven amendments cepted. I have given reasons why I am not pursuing those three amendments. I suggest that the high and mighty attitude displayed by the Minister when making the remarks that we have just heard is not justified. In relation to these it is a pity that the Minister does not have more opportunity for taking decisions himself. It is that he did notfindtime, after I eventually got touch with him, to look at the merits of the Opposition's amendments. A number of Government senators and, I believe, a number of honourable members in this chamber would have supported these amendments had they had an opportunity to study them.",77
202,Mr GARLAND ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Curtin-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.27)-It is clear in my mind that the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) did not mention these consultations in his first speech in the way that he has them in his second speech. I listened said to the opening remarks of the honourable member even though I was not in the chamber. However, Hansard will record that matter one way or the other. The honourable member really expect me to take seriously the remark that the Opposition wanted these amendments accepted and that it has done all it can to achieve that end. These amendments were introduced the Senate late last night and there was no opportunity to consider them. The honourable member contacted me only at 2.30 p.m. today time when this Bill was expected to be debated at about 3.30 p.m. In other words, he gave me one hour within which to look at these amendments which he tells me now are very important. Anybody on the Government side who has been concerned with these matters will know that is just impractical. If I had been sent the amendments at 10 o'clock last night-surel y they in must have been drawn up by that time-ther e I would have been greater evidence of good faith relation to the matter. But that is not what e is happened. The amendments were brought in without notice and all the intervening time was wasted. It was said that I have a high and mighty attitude in this regard, but this Government has endeavoured to move amendments to meet representations made by the organisation concerned. Consultations took place on 9 May and continued until the following Monday. The Government was receptive to those consultations. The Labor Party, when in office, did no such thing. It gave not one hour, one week, one month, or one year of warning. The sorts of sugmade were never taken seriously when at honourable members opposite were on this side might be acof the House.",77

204,The CHAIRMAN,ANDREW MENSAROS,I ask the honourable member for Adelaide to resume his seat. I trust matters that both honourable gentlemen who have spoken recently will not be unmindful of the fact pity that the Chair extended considerable latitude to in them on the basis of relevance. I suggest that it might be counterbalancing if the matter were not pursued beyond this point. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Adoption of Report Motion (by Mr Garland) proposed: That thereportof the Committee be adopted.,77
205,Mr HURFORD ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Adelaide) (5.30)-I wish to speak briefly to the motion for the adoption the report. Everybody in this chamber, and other people interested in this matter, should know that the amendments that were moved Senate had to be redrawn before they could be brought into the House ofRepresentatives. If amendments that were in the Senate late last night or early this morning have to be debated soon in this chamber it causes enormous hardtions. ship for those people who have this responsiplaced bility. I hope that that will leave a different plexion on the matter in the mind of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Garland) and in the minds of others as to why it was very difficult to contact the Minister earlier on the matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. PARLIAMENT HOUSE: STAFF",78
206,Mr INNES ,ANDREW MENSAROS,"Melbourne)- I placed on the Notice Paper question No. 5390 which was directed to the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). It posed a series of questions relating the Parhamentary refreshment rooms and the staff cafeteria. I was prompted to ask these quesassociated tions because for quite some considerable timecourse, particularly during the time that Minister for the Capital Territory-substandar d facilities have been afforded to the staff ment House during recreation periods. I cite as an example of that the fact that some cleaners in Parliament House have to go for some of their breaks to the little places that people use for other purposes. That is the backCustoms ground to what prompted me to put a question on the Notice Paper. From discussions I have had with you, Mr Speaker, and with members of the Joint House Committee, I am satisfied that steps are being taken to investigate the whole matter of the staff cafeteria and, I hope, areas to which I have made reference. I see no longer the necessity to proceed with this question on the Notice Paper. I ask that it be withdrawn.",78
207,Mr SPEAKER,ANDREW MENSAROS,I thank the honourable which member for Melbourne. I will direct that the question be so withdrawn. NA,78
208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION ON NOTICE,"Yesterday afternoon the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holding) lodged with the Clerk a question on notice. The question would normally have appeared on the Notice Paper for today but inadvertently it was not included with questions sent to the Government Printer last night and does not appear on today's Notice Paper. If the House rises tonight the next Notice Paper will of not be published until August this year and the terms of the question will not be published until that time. This would be unfortunate, given that in the it was a clerical mistake. In these unusual circumstances I propose to the have the terms of the question printed in the Hansard for today at the end of the printed so Notices of Motion and before answers to QuesThe questions will be treated as a question on notice on 22 May 1980 and, unless comanswered in the meantime, will be included in the next Notice Paper to be published. NA 1980 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 May, on motion by Mr Garland: That the Bill be now read a second time. NA",78
209,Mr GARLAND ,FACILITIES,"Curtin-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs)- Mr Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a to general debate covering this Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1980, as they are measures? Separate questions will, of be put on each of the Bills at the conI was shadow clusion of the debate.",78
210,Mr SPEAKER,FACILITIES,"Is it the wish of the House to in Parhahave a general debate covering these two measures? There being no objection, I will allow of the that course to be followed.",78
211,Mr HURFORD ,FACILITIES,"Adelaide) (5.35)-As we some have just heard, we are debating cognately the Tariff Vahdation Bill 1980 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1980.1 say straight away that the Opposition does not oppose either of these Bills. However, we do remain concerned at the way in which the Parhament deals with proposals for tariffs and exicse. I will be moving a other second reading amendment dealing with this matter at a later stage. Firstly, let me deal with the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1980. The main purpose of this Bill is to enact tariff changes were made by Customs tariff proposals Nos 31 to 35 of last year and also proposals Nos 1 to 7 of this year. These proposals have been tabled in the Parliament at various times since 25 October last year. In accordance with current practice, the rates of duty imposed under the respective proposals generally took effect on the day after they were tabled, although in some cases the tariff changes had been implemented originally by notices in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the last parliamentary recess. In practical terms this debate is thus the first opportunity that the Parliament has had to consider measures which have been in effect for some time. That is a small mercy when it is noted that the tariff changes enacted by the Bill are very large in number and have little, if anything, in common. Let me just run through the list of changes. They include such matters as baby carriages and parts there for, coated copying film, certain engines not exceeding 7.46 kW, rotary cultivators and tractors having a power of less than 15 kW, dental materials, furniture, grapes and wine, passenger motor vehicles and components-that is, the removal of import restrictions in relation to thosethe removal of primage duty, rubber products, ships, boats and other vessels not exceeding 6,000 tons gross register, spirits, spirituous ages and so on. The importance of this Bill is revealed by this long list of the industries to which it relates. total number of workers directly engaged in these industries and hence directly affected by oped this legislation is approximately 100,000. That is, one out of every 12 workers in Australian manufacturing industry is directly affected by this Bill, the which is rather quietly wending its way through the very hmited process of parliamentary scrueconomy moving. tiny which belated debates such as this one can provide. I cannot in the time available make detailed comments on the wide range of goods and products which are included in this Bill. matter of general observation, it can be stated that the measures contained in the Bill either accord with the recommendations of the Indusa tries Assistance Commission or, where they do not so accord, they err on the side of slightly more gradual reductions in the level of tariff sistance accorded to local industries. The word 'err' should be taken with a certain qualification. The fact is that, where the Government has disagreed with the IAC, the Government has obvious been rather more kind to the industries than the IAC was. This overall approach of maintaining current levels of assistance at present while looking omission. towards a limited and phased reduction in protection over the long term is in accord with the Opposition's attitude to industry protection in Australia. The Opposition, I repeat, does not oppose this Bill. That is not to say that we accept the present policies of this present Government towards Australian industry. The pohcies of the Government are clearly inadequate and destructive in that they prefer confrontation to consultation in so many cases. They enforcefiscaland monetary cutbacks which continue to cause grievous damage to the Australian economy and the level of employment in industry in this country. Most importantly, in the context of this debate, the tariff poUcies of the Government stand in glaring isolation from other essential industry and industrial manpower policies which are needed to achieve a sustainable economic recovery in our country. Until this government begins to show some sign of recognising the human impact and the social basis of industry poUcy, it cannot expect to gain any support from working people of this country. To rely on the operation of so-called market forces in a country where every market is distorted by a wide range of factors and where the basic conditions in the market depend upon the supportive activities of government is, to us, bevercompletely unacceptable. Perhaps of the most crucial importance in this respect is the need for a flexible, highly trained and adequately rewarded The work force. It is absolutely essential that manpower and training programs which are aimed at the needs of the 1980s and the 1990s are develin Australia. We are short of sktils now, yet we are bumping along on the bottom of one of longest recessionary troughs that we have had. What enormous bottlenecks there wtil be for skilled people if and when we at last get the All that this Government offers is everexpanding dole queues and a callous disregard As a of the manpower requirements which structural and technological change are imposing on Australia. At the sametimeworkers who do have job have been subjected to the most divisive and substantial tax slug in the history of our nation. One only has to look at direct taxes in asproportion to the gross domestic product to know that this is so. Whilst the Opposition supports the BUls before the House deaUng with tariffs, it nonetheless condemns the Government for its and tragic failures in industry and economic policy over the last four and a half years. In other words, there are errors of omission in relation to the Customs Tariff Amendment Btil. 1 draw attention to some of those errors of The Australian Labor Party has a vision of a developing decade before us in the 1980s, but it wants that development to not only be in Austrahan hands. The Labor Party wants the benefits of that development to be spread amongst a greater number of Australians than is envisaged by the present Government. That means manufacturing jobs; it means tying the fortunes of our Australian manufacturing industry to the development which we are all expecting in the 1980s and which we, in the Labor Party, want to nurture int he 1980s. To tie manufacturing jobs to the great development projects in this country does mean being much more resolute when it comes to ensuring that a lot of the machinery for that development is made here. If that machinery is not totally produced here, offset arrangements have to be made to ensure that a great deal of the heavy equipment and many of the parts are made in Australia. We talk a lot about the offset arrangements, for instance, in relation to defence equipment. We in the Opposition blame the Government for not being more resolute in that respect. We in Opposition talk also, although we do not hear this sort of talk from the Government, of the need for offset arrangements in relation to manufacturing of computer equipment. This is computer age. The advantages of mechanisation are going tremendously to overseas countries cause we are importing many of our computers. We believe that we ought to be manufcturing more of the parts in Australia. More than anywhereby thing else, in this context of developing new jobs in manufacturing industries in the decade ahead, which is so much the subject of this Bill, we ensure that they are manufacturing jobs related to the manufacture of the heavy and other equipcoUected ment and indeed jobs in relation to the services which are needed in the development industries of this country. I wish now to make particular reference to some of the specinc proposals which are enacted by this Bill. The rates of duty appUcable grapes and wine are an exception to the general rule in that the recommendation of the IAC that the level of tariff be reduced to 25 per cent was rejected. WhUst the Opposition accepts and supshare ports this decision it must be restated that fundamental problems of Australia's wine industhan try remain. I refer in particular to the excise post of $16 a litre on brandy produced in Australia. This compares with an impost of $10.21 a litre which prevatied before the Budget. The Fraser Government has done much to hinder development in the State from which I come, South Australia. This is a clear example what this Fraser Government has done to the sition Australian brandy industry which is so important to my State. This is yet another example of the high tax pohcy of this Government. It is a particularly pernicious tax because it both distorts the market for grapes in Australia and imposes a heavy burden on a small sector of Australian industry. WhUst the Opposition supports the Government's decision on rates of duty for this industry, it condemns the Government for its sleight of hand in continuing to rob the Australian wine industry through its notorious high taxation policies. The second specific matter in this Btil to which I would hke to draw attention and which should be commented on is the decision to increase the range of goods which are eUgible for new or increased margins of tariff preference and higher quotas where these goods are imported from developing countries. We support this decision. We believe increasing trade with the developing nations, particularly those to our north, is essential provided that such trade does not unduly the hamper the development of our own industries. The use of a preferential tariff system can be designed to ensure that such countries can compete the with other nations on the Australian market a whtie, at the same time, providing an overall level of assistance which is needed to secure the beviability of local producers. Before moving onto the matter which I mentioned previously relating to the procedures this Parliament reviews tariff decisions, I should like to say something about the Customs Tariff Validation Bill 1980 which is also being must considered in this cognate debate. The purpose of this Btil is to deem as lawful aU customs duties pursuant to Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 which has been brought into this Parliament this year. This was the only proposal not covered by the Customs Tariff Amendment Btil 1980. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 relates to gearboxes, gears and shaft couplings. The to Government has essentially accepted the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission which were to increase the level of tariff protection for this industry, given its declining of the total Australian market. In fact, the the Government has been slightly more generous the IAC in that it has extended the period of imshort term additional assistance from two years to three years. The total number of people employed in this industry is about 710 of which 1978 about 45 per cent are employed by one company, David Browns. Just as I indicated in relation to the various products dealt with by the Customs Tariff Amendment Btil 1980 the Opposupports the Customs Tariff Vatidation Bill 1980 because it adopts a responsible approach. When assistance to industry is reduced to reduce costs it should be done on phased basis over the longer term. That reduction should not be done peremptorily, all at once. Finally I should like to turn to the question of procedures, whereby this Parhament considers tariff and excise proposals. I indicated earUer the enormous importance of these measures to the Australian economy and to Australian workers. The BUls we are debating today directly affect, as I said earUer, 100,000 workers. That means that 100,000 famUies wtil be affected by these Bills. Even more people wtil be indirectly affected. I am referring to those people who rely for their living on those 100,000 workers. Of course, within a few weeks an even greater number of people wtil be subject to a Government decision which wtil have a profound effect on their lives. I refer, of course, to the impending decision of the IAC's report into the textile, clothing and footwear industries. In the normal course of events, this decision will be announced and implemented perhaps six months before the relevant legislation is subject to the scrutiny of this Parliament. I have said previously that I cannot see the logic in a situation where it is sufficiently important for a body hke the IAC to put time and effort into individual recommendations; yet apparently it is not important enough for the Parliament of Australia to be involved in the scrutinising process. This scrutinismg process is even more important today because this Government, in keeping with its rapacious and callous taxation policies, is now using the Customs tariff device not merely to protect local industry but as an instrument to raise revenue. I refer, of course, to the 2 per cent Customs duty across the board for items which were not subject to another duty. Clearly it is a revenue raising device. It is a matter of grave concern to the Opposition and to the Australian people that Customs tariffs and petroleum excise taxes have been imposed at a level whereby they have attained the status of major instruments of macroeconomic poUcy. This is the situation despite the fact that such measures escape the proper scrutiny of the Parliament. The late night readings, usuaUy without more than a few hours notice, of such tariff proposals by the Mmister for Business and Consumer Affairs stand in pale contrast to the pubhc focus on the annual Budget debate. Yet, the tariff proposals are enormously important. In many cases they are as important as the Budget debates which go on for days in this Parliament. The role and conventions of the Parliament have been downgraded and abused enough in the past few years. We saw them abused again today when another matter of pubhc importance was knocked off. We very nearly did not get a General Business debate. As I said, the conventions of the Parliament have been downgraded enough. We have to think about how we can improve that situation now. For some time. I have sought the establishment of a new procedure for properly assessing tariff proposals. I have previously moved an amendment in this Parliament to set up a standing committee of this Parliament to examine in greater detail customs duties and excise generally. I will move that motion again later. On the 15 November last year in response to the amendment I had moved the then Minister for Productivity ( Mr Macphee) said: It has been said by a number of people in this Parliament that there is virtue in having more debate on tariff issues, and with that I concur. That Minister undertook to take up the matter with the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). Six days later the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Fife, reiterated this undertaking. He said that he would take up the matter during the following recess. I do not know what consideration was given to this question, but I do know that on 1 May this year the new Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Garland), the present Mmister, when referring to my proposal in the House said: I must say with all candour that I do not believe it is practicable to adopt his suggestion. It would require a complete change in the proceedings and the legisladon. Perhaps that could be debated on another occasion. There will be an opportunity for such debate. We have been given that opportunity today. I regarded the Minister's response then as a lame response. I hope he wtil consider this matter again. The Minister is saying that the Government thinks the restoration of the proper role of this Parliament is too difficult. I do not think it is too difficult. I think it is absolutely essential. It is not too difficult for the Government to raise thousands of millions of dollars of revenue from Australian motorists, but apparently it is too difficult to debate properly such measures in the Parliament. I pomt out to the House and to other people in the community that excise proposals which are dealt with in customs legislation are fleecing the public. I refer particularly to the petrol taxes that have been imposed. I reject the attitude of the Minister and of the Government. I foreshadow that I wtil move an amendment to the Customs Tariff Validation Btil 1980. The amendment which I will move could well be applied tp both BUls. The amendment that I propose to move to the second Bill states: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the that a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Tariffs and Excise should be established to examine each change in tariffs and excise following the gazettal of proposals or their being introduced into the Parliament on the one hand and before related Bills are introduced into the House on the other hand'.",78
212,Mr MCVEIGH ,FACILITIES,"Darling Downs) (5.55)- I will start where the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) finished his boundary riding. I agree with the view he expressed. I will not be supporting this amendment in voting, but I will be supporting it in principle because the honourable member did raise a very pertinent point. I suggest to him that rather than another committee being created this matter could very well be considered by the Government members Reform Committee, which is presided over by the honourable member for Moore ( Mr Hyde) from Western Austraha. So there is agreement in the proposition raised by the honourable member for Adelaide. Too often we consider important matters in great haste. It has always worried and concerned me that we debate many Customs items in isolation rather one Bill dealing with them together. The honourable member made an excellent point and it should be pursued. I agree with the thrust of his argument. I disagree with his somewhat implied criticism of the Government's policies of excise duties and tax revenue raising methods. I remind him that the founding fathers in establishing this federation and in framing the Constitution specifically provided that the Commonwealth government should have sole powers over exise duties. It is to be regretted that the Government found it necessary, as part of its budgetary andfiscalpolicy, to include a two per cent primage duty on imports to Australia. We are under continual threat from people requiring more services and greaterfinancialsupport. I remind the honourable member that in the early days of the federation we had nine Cabinet Ministers and seven different departments. At the present we have 27 Cabinet Ministers and 40 different departments. There is tremendous expenditure by a sympathetic Government in areas such as health, welfare and education. This Bill seeks to legalise certain procedures particularly in relation to the 2 per cent duty. Certain contracts were entered into with other countries which it is necessary for us to honour. is also noteworthy that this Bill gives impetus the Government's decision to reduce preferences to imports from the United Kingdom thus allownot ing the developing nations within close proximity to Australia to trade without that competition. I remind all honourable members that it is necessopinion ary for us to improve the trading opportunities of these developing countries. They can buy from us only if they can sell to us. I fully applaud the sentiments of my own leader, the Right Honourable J. D. Anthony. In a speech last year he indicated that all preferences to the United Kingdom would be removed as from July 1981. It is good to know that we will not live in isolation from the developing countries very close to us. I wish to talk briefly on a couple of excise matters which have concerned me. Perhaps the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( Mr Garland) will be able to consider them before further legislation is introduced in the Budget session. I deal particularly with the ruling that departmental officers give on what is suitably equivalent, particularly in agricultural machinery. It is all very well for someone in the Department to say that because a machine will plant seed it is suitably equivalent to an imported machine. There is a vast difference between a machine that will plant 60 seeds in 100 feetperhaps it will plant all those seeds in the last foot-as opposed to a precision planter which will plant one seed every 18 inches, where it is wanted. There is an enormous difference in the yield from crops which are planted with precision planter as opposed to a planter which scatters seed everywhere. I ask the Minister to consider that matter during the recess and in preparing legislation for the Budget session. I also ask him to give consideration to allowing machinery importers who have stock in bond to do pre-delivery service on those machines. Quite often much work is required on this machinery before it is delivered. We run into a time factor. People who purchase machinery at the last minute are not allowed into the bond stores to move such things as headercombs. This is something the Minister should consider. I indicate my total support for the fact that there is to be no duty on grapes and wine products. Originally I did not hold this view, but I was persuaded by the honourable member for Paterson ( Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Mallee ( Mr Fisher) and the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd). They pointed out that the wine industry is under very great difficulty. It is good to see that this primary industry is not It being subjected to duties. I am told by those to three honourable members that Austrahan wines are amongst the very best in the world and do face competition from overseas competitors quality wise. I support the legislation and the National Country Party supports the legislation wholeheartedly. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Garland) read a third time.

216,Dr KLUGMAN ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Prospect) (8.1)-Those honourable members who have looked at the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill 1980 would be aware that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the protection of Antarctic wildlife and for the preservation of areas of ecological and scientific importance in the Antarctic. Let me give the background to the legislation. The conservation measures contained in the Bill arise from a long standing international agreement first recommended at the Third Antarctic Consultative Meeting back in 1964. Australia Third Reading was an original signatory to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and continues to play an active role in the support and development of the Treaty organisation. The Antarctic Treaty has ensured that Antarctica remains a zone of peace and international co-operation. Progress is being made towards a convention for the conservation of Antarctic marine living recources. There was a 1980 meeting in Canberra on this subject during the Second Reading last two or three weeks. The proposed convention will ensure that any exploitation of the living of the Southern Ocean is conducted according to sound ecological and environmental principles. The Bill gives effect to one of the major conserto subvation agreements negotiated under the Antarctic Treaty. It is known as the Agreed Measures the opinion for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and each Flora. The Agreement establishes a system of gazettal wildlife protection. The Bill gives the Agreed Parliament Measures force of law and under these Agreed Measures all wildlife in Antartica is protected. The agreement ratified by this Bill makes profor three categories of special protection: Firstly, specially protected species; secondly, specially protected areas; and, thirdly, sites of special scientific interest. The Bill establishes controls over the importation of animals and plants and provides for the making of regulations to cover the control of pollution, the use of motor vehicles and other issues relating to enThird Reading vironmental protection. The Opposition of course supports the legislation. I would, more in the spirit of fun, I suppose, like to criticise very quickly a couple of measures which are proposed under this Bill. I assume that in fact the Bill enforces these so called Agreed Measures which have been agreed to by many other people. But I do question paragraph (c) of sub-clause (1) of clause 19 of the Bill which provides for offences relating to the Second Reading environment. Clause 19(1) states: A person shall not(c) bring into the Antarctic an animal, plant, virus, bacterium, yeast or fungus that is not indigenous to the Antarctic; I think we all know what is intended there. But I argue that in fact it would be impossible for any' one to go to the Antarctic without bringing in a virus, bacterium, yeast or fungus that is not indigenous to the Antarctic because all of us have these bacteria, et cetera, inside our bodies and unless we were sterilised completely-in that case we would be mummies; not in the maternal sense-w e would all contain some of these viruses and bacteria, et cetera. The intention, of course, is not along those lines but it just strikes me as a bit funny that if I went down to the Antarctic and automatically, by my very presence, introduced into the Antarctic bacteria and viruses which are not indigenous to the Antarctic, I would in theory be liable to afineof $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. Again, more in a spirit of fun than in real criticism, because I know that the provision arises from an international convention, I question clause 19 (2) (e), which states: (2) a person shall not, in the Antarctic(e) while on foot, disturb a concentration of birds during any period while they are breeding; I do notknow what the definition of'breeding'is or whether by 'breeding' we are talking about 'mating', but apparently it is a criticism of voyeurism as far as animals an interesting attitude to take. Again, I have no doubt that there is a fairly good reason behind inserting that provision but, if it ever came point where somebody was charged with that offence-agai n the fine is $2,000 or imprisonhonourable ment for 12 months-it would be interesting to know what is the legal definition of the words 'while they are breeding'. I do not know whether one can define exactly the sorts of actions one trying to prevent. I think we are all aware of we are trying to protect in the environment in Antarctic. How to go about it exactly in a legal sense of course is much more difficult. One can only hope that the people who are present and who are likely to be there in the near future are people dedicated to the aims of this legislation. I suppose the difficulty would arise the Antarctic ever became more accessible large numbers of people in a commercial sense and so on. I pay tribute to the Australian Antarctic ision for the scientific work it is doing there. think we are all aware that there is some doubt outside Australia as to exactly what our position is regarding that part of the Antarctic to which we lay claim. I think it is important for us to that we are working very closely with all the other treaty nations in trying to estabUsh scienprivilege tific investigation and co-operation in the Antportant arctic. We have to show that we have a national research program going on there. We have to show that we are really spending money there and helping not only ourselves but also scientific knowledge as a whole and that we are helping greatly conservation in the Antarctic. There are criticisms, of course, by some who feel very strongly about conservation that the propositions do not go far enough. I cannot really see what we can do about that in a legal sense. I was not able to participate in the recent, convention but it appears to me at this stage that there is a large amount of goodwill amongst all the treaty nations and the other countries participating there. Let us hope that it wtil stay that way. WhUst there are in the Antarctic biological resources such as krill and probably minerals for exploitation in the long run, I hope that people wtil see that at this stage we have to proceed very slowly so as not to interfere with the ecological equilibrium which exists there at present. It would indeed be terrible if some kind of disease or seals were introduced into the area and large proportions of the birds, seals or fauna were to disappear from the area. I commend the Bill to the House. I am sure that those on this side of the House support the aim and the contents of this are concerned. It is legislation.",83
217,Mr HODGMAN ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Denison) (8.9)-It is with to the some considerable enthusiasm and optimism that I jom this debate, albeit briefly. Like the member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) I am proud of the fact that Australia has had a direct contact with the Antarctic since the year 1810 when Captain Fred Hasselburg discovered is Macquarie Island, which, of course, is part of what Tasmania and that Australia is playing a very the prominent role in the discussions, negotiations, treaties and conventions which will lay down the guidelines for the administration of the Antarctic there at into the twenty-first century. Macquarie Island is in the electorate of Frankif lin and I place on record the support that I have to had from my colleague, the honourable member for Franklin ( Mr Good luck), with respect to a number of initiatives. These have led to a situDivation in which I can say in this Parliament toI night that not only Australia but also Tasmania, as the southernmost State and closest in proximity to the Antarctic, is now on the world map. I am delighted that the Minister for Science and show the Environment, David Thomson, is at the table in the chamber tonight. It has been his great to be Minister at a time when very imdecisions have been taken with respect to the Antarctic. I intend to refer to them briefly. - Some four years ago I achieved fairly wide Press headlines by making the comment that, unless the countries of the world made proper arrangements for the management of the Antarctic, it was quite conceivable that World War III could be fought over its resources in the twentyfirst century. At the time many people regarded that statement as outlandish, but I wonder how many people listening to this broadcast tonight realise that in the waters surrounding the Antarctic there is more fish protein than is found in the total world catch today and that there are on the Antarctic continent fuel and mineral resources which would justify its being described as the gold mine of the world resources. The Antarctic will play a most important role in determining the kind of world that we will have in the twentyfirst century. A number of initiatives including, as I have always conceded, the very first came from my predecessor in this House, the former honourable member for Denison, Mr John Coates. He put forward publicly for the first time the proposition that the headquarters of the Antarctic Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, hitherto located at four sites in Melbourne, should be transferred to Hobart and specifically Kingston. I have always given the honourable member credit for making that proposal, which was picked up by our Government and made a personal commitment by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) at a very difficult time. There was a number of problems concerning the Pubhc Works Committee hearing, as well as logistic problems to be overcome. The fact is that a magnificent Antarctic Division headquarters is being constructed at Kingston, Tasmania, will be completed four months ahead of schedule and handed over to the division early next year. Next Tuesday the Minister for Science and Environment will travel to Hobart with several members of the Public Works Committee, in which cluding the Deputy Chairman, the honourable arctic member for Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson), for the official opening of the analytical laboratories, first section of the division to be completed. As result of that decision, which involved an expenus diture of SlOm for the establishment of what can now say publicly is a complex of interitself. national prestige, the complex has been seen by international experts. Representatives of the 15 Antarctic Treaty nations travelled to Hobart fortnight ago with a view to inspecting potential sites for the headquarters of the International Antarctic Commission. The group travelled to Kingston and saw this superb scientific complex of international standing. What has followed that visit? The decision to establish in Kingston the headquarters of the Antarctic Division has become the catalyst for some of the most exciting developments that could ever occur in Australia or Tasmania. I commend the Minister and the Government upon the commitment to establish the magnificent $25m CSIRO marine science laboratories in Hobart. That establishment has been drawn logically to that part of Austraha by the establishment of the Antarctic Division headquarters there. The historic decision, reached this week, to establish the headquarters of the International Antarctic Commission in Hobart, has really put Tasmania, Hobart and the federal electorate of Denison on the world map. The decision has been hailed on both sides of the House and in both Houses of Parliament. I believe that the Minister at the table, his predecessor and the Prime Minister especially, are entitled to the acclamation and gratitude of the people of not just Tasmania but also Australia for proposing Hobart as the site for the International Antarctic Commission's headquarters. I wish to refer to one man who cannot stand up here and seek credit. I place on record my belief that without the work of Ambassador Keith Brennan, a distinguished Australian diplomat, who led our delegation to the Antarctic conference on marine living resources in Canberra during the last fortnight, one who has headed Australian delegations to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the establishment of the international headquarters would not have occurred. I must also place on record the gratitude of all delegates to the Antarctic conference to Ambassador John Ryan, the chairman of that histhe toric conference, which concluded on Tuesday with the signing of the international convention effectively is the successor of the 1959 AntTreaty. The international convention is intimately interwoven with the objectives of this the Bill, in that the convention deals with the marine a living resources of the Antarctic. The Bill before deals specifically with the Antarctic Treaty I environment protection aspects of the continent My time is short but I wish to make certain a predictions as to what will happen. The establishment of the headquarters of the International Antarctic Commission can proceed as soon as eight of the 15 Antarctic nations ratify the convention that was signed in Canberra this week. I am convinced-and I believe that all Australians will rejoice in the knowledge-that individual nations will now wish to estabUsh their own Antarctic embassies, as I call them-thei r own Antarctic bases-in proximity to the international headquarters. One can imagine what it wtil mean to have 15 or 20 international Antarctic embassies or bases in southern Tasmania, at a cost of possibly SlOm apiece, with an annual recurrent expenditure running into millions and millions of dollars, and with delegates coming from all over the world up to four times a year for conventions, treaty meetings and the like. The prospects for Tasmama and Australia internationally with respect to the management of the Antarctic are almost beyond one's comprehension. I wish finally to refer to two matters in particular. Argentina proposed an alternative site to Australia's nomination of Hobart. It did not pursue the matter but has submitted a bid possible establishment at Mar del Plata in that country of the international headquarters of the commission which will deal with the mineral and fuel resources of the Antarctic. If for any reason Argentina is not acceptable, or is unable to prograph vide the site at the appropriate time, I suggest strongly that that commission should be and"" headquartered in Hobart adjacent to the body omitted'. which wtil deal with the continent's marine and living resources. LastlyMr Innes-Finally MONICA",84
218,Mr HODGMAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I know that my colleague from Melbourne wiU be interested in this aspect also. The International Law of the Sea Tribunal has not yet been given a home. I propose officiaUy and formally to the Government of Austraha that Hobart should be offered as the world headquarters for that tribunal. I take the interjections of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Innes) in good part because I know that he wants to see good things happen for Australia and Tasmania. I commend the Minister, who is known in Tasmama as the $34m Minister, because that is the value the State of the decisions that have come to fruition during the early part ofhis term as Minister. I hope that he wtil make the sum SlOOm before he is moved to another portfolio. I support the Bill.",86
219,Dr KLUGMAN ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Prospect) (8.20)-I pay tribute to the honourable member for Hawker, Ralph Jacobi, who for personal reasons is unable to be here tonight. He has done a terrific amount of work on this topic for many years and has participated in at least two or three of the conventions on it. He is a real expert on the topic on our side of the House. Again, I pay special tribute to the work that he has done during the last few weeks. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Motion (by Mr Street) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",86
220,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Kingsford-Smith) (8.24)-The amendments, which the Government has accepted, were drawn up by Senator Evans in the Senate. He did so in an endeavour to clarify the situation following the previous drafting of the Bill. I do not know whether this amendment will achieve the success that the Government hopes for. I refer to the decision in the Lockhart case. I do not know whether any honourable member has addressed his mind to the question of whether one of the parties involved in that case was not in fact an employer of the persons who fall within the definitions contained in Part I or Part II of the principal Act. This amendment is another attempt to try to clarify the situation. I might add that we sought some clarification in the second reading debate as to what the amended section 45D would really mean and what the proposed new section 45E would really mean. The Ministers concerned did not give us any help at that time. We have now before us amendments which indicate that where the third person is a corporation, the fourth person is not. The legislation would come into effect when there was a substantial loss or damage to the business of the fourth person. An effort is being made to clarify the situation. Allegedly, primary boycotts are permissible and secondary boycotts are not. I can still envisage circumstances which I think will cause a fair amount of difficulty. I make the point that in agreeing to these amendments we in no way agree to the Bill. We think it represents the wrong approach to industrial matters. We think the Government, if it remains in office for long enough, will have enough hindsight to see that these matters ought to be dealt with under the Concihation and Arbitration Act because we will always be headed for industrial trouble. The amendments do something towards clarification of the situation and accordingly the Opposition has no objection to them. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Street)-by leave-agree d to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended would prevent General Business Order of the Day being called on forthwith. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1980 Debate resumed from 20 May, on motion by Mr Burr: That the Bill be now read a second ume.",86
221,Mr HODGMAN ,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"Denison) (8.28)-My remarks in support of the Bill will be very brief. I wish to place on record the gratitude of the Parliament to Senator Peter Rae who introduced this private member's Bill in another place where it was passed without dissent. The Bill, which was very competently introduced into this House by my colleague the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Burr), removes an unjust and antiquated anomaly-a n anomaly which could easily have led to a situation, and has in fact led to a situation in years gone by, of a person being subjected to a double penalty in respect of a breach of a provision of the Act. I believe if a person breaks the law he should be subjected to one penalty and one penalty only. Indeed, the common law supports very strongly the proposition that a double penalty is wrong. It is a violation of a citizen's basic rights that he should be penalised twice for committing the one offence. For the benefit of those persons who are listening to this debate, the situation is that prior to the amending Bill being introduced a person who trangressed the provisions of the Wireless Telegrapy Act was liable not only to prosecution, including substantial penalties involving a fine and, in the case of subsequent offences, imprisonment, but also administratively to the forfeiture of the equipment involved. With modern day telecommunications systems, when we look at the cost of radios and the like in respect of fishing vessels and other activities, that could have involved a financial penalty of several thousand dollars. I am delighted that the Bill was passed in the Senate without dissent. It was supported by both the Government and the Opposition. I compliment Senator Peter Rae because he is the man who discovered this injustice on the statute book. He is the man who was prepared to do something about it, to bring in a private members Bill, to get it through the Senate and then to entrust it to my colleague the honourable member for Wilmot, to whom I believe this House is also indebted. I have done some investigation and I do not beheve that a private members Bill has been introduced by a Government back bencher as in this House for something in excess of 20 years. No. 13 The honourable member for Wilmot is entitled to the gratitude of the House. I support the Bill. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne will support it with equal enthusiasm. Second Reading",87
222,Mr INNES ,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"Melbourne) (8.31)-The Opposition supports this Bill which seeks to amend the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1905-1973. However, it should be clearly understood that there are certain things in this legislation which are of concern to the Opposition and on which I would like to elaborate. The first point to be made is the Bill is a private members Bill. There is nothing wrong with that per se. But what it means by corollary is that it is not a Bill introduced by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications ( Mr Staley) on behalf of the Government. It is a poor reflection on the administration of the Wireless Telegraphy Act by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and his Depaitment that it was necessary for a private member to redress a situation. The honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Burr) has participated in the introduction of this Bill and he is to be congratulated, as are the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman) and Senator Rae. However, the fact remains that it has been necessary to correct a situation caused by the failure of the administration to overcome an obvious problem. The honourable member for Denison pointed out in his short address that the Bill will not only correct a theoretical anachronism but also redress an injustice facing a fisherman who may have had $4,500 worth of radio equipment confiscated by the Commonwealth and been fined for the failure to pay a $50 Ucence fee. The unenviable position in which that fisherman found himself could have been redressed had the Government introduced an amendment such as the one we are now discussing. I make the objective point that there is a whole range of legislation, not only the Wireless Telegraphy Act, which is antiquated and to which this House ought to have regard. But the Government and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who is the Mmister responsible, have done nothing of the sort. In fact, I am informed that thefisherman'sptight could have been corrected without resort to legislative changes. It is the opinion of certain of the Commonwealth law officers that the position could have been remedied by purely administrative action. All the Minister had to do was to make a few changes within his Department. I repeat that no such action was forthcoming. It was left to the initiative of private members-Senato r Rae and the honourable member for Wilmot-to take action to have this situation redressed. The resolution of this matter, need not have taken the time of the Parliament. The matter could have been handled by the Minister acting in a purely administrative capacity. In these circumstances the action that has been taken is all the more to the credit of the people to whom I have just made reference. The second matter that concerns the Opposition is that this amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act is in isolation from many of the other needed changes to the Act. Many of the penalties contained in the Act are quite draconian. They were instituted at a time when the Commonwealth was fearful of its own integrity in the Ught of the new technology of radio communications. Consequently a State monopoly of the use of radio transmitters was decreed and appropriate penalties were set for unauthorised use. Of course, those days are long gone, but the penalties remain. The amendment to the Bill gives the Minister discretion in the application of those penalties under one section of the principal Act and many such penalties remain unchallenged. Let me give an example of the problems within the ambit of the Act. A person is liable to a fine of $1,000 or five years imprisonment for transmitting or receiving messages by wireless telegraphy except as authorised under the Act. Radios on overseas ships while in Australian waters are subject to the control of the Minister and may be used only by his authority or in accordance with the Act. The operation of private radio stations, such as the rather famous ones which operate outside of British territorial waters, are subject to penalties of up tofiveyears in gaol. Our friend the honourable member for Holt ( Mr Yates) waves his head about. For the information of people in the pubhc gallery that is a natural consequence of his operation. He does nothing more than that in the Parhament. There are further provisions which allow for summary treatment by the courts of offenders under the Act with penalties of up to six months imprisonment or afineof $100. Clearly there are entailed in this Act excessive and contradictory penalties that are indicative of the thorough overhaul for which the Opposition believes the Wireless Telegraphy Act is long overdue. There is a whole range of areas in which the Minister has failed purely and simply in an administrative sense. The Minister has had an opportunity to correct a situation, but this has not happened. I am not complaining about the manner in which this legislation was introduced because I have already gone to greater lengths than necessary to congratulate those who are responsible for this legislation. In fact the Opposition could have taken such action. I have made a range of investigations. I might add that I spoke to Senator Rae before this legislation was introduced as a private members Bill. I wanted to ensure that it had a clear passage. We are not arguing about that. As the shadow Minister I have investigated over a long time a whole range of areas which could be handled by administrative operation rather than by the legislative process. We should be looking at the draconian implications of what happened so many years ago when legislation was introduced for a completely different purpose. Many things have changed in the meantime and therefore the legislation ought to be changed as quickly as possible. The third matter which the Opposition finds worrying is the general administration by the Postal and Telecommunications Department and the Minister of the system of radio licensing. Most honourable members will be aware, no doubt if only as a result of the voluminous representations that they have received, that the Government's decision to raise radio communication licence fees last year was poorly received by most groups of licence holders. In fact it is quite likely that the fisherman whose plight prompted this amendment was caught without a licence after his refusal to pay when his fee was doubled to something like $50. That is not an incredible amount of money but it's one of the many licensing imposts under the Wireless Telegraphy Act that ought to be considered. Revenue from recent fee increases is expected to leap from $8.3m to over $ 14m despite the total cost of only something like $7.7m for administering the radio spectrum. The services provided to spectrum users by the Postal and Telecommunications Department are entirely inadequate. One example is the policing of the private use of the air waves. In this respect the Government has embarked on an exercise designed almost to double the revenue. Changes in staff cetiings for radio inspectors and officers working in other problem areas were promised. The Government has a hypocritical and the isolationist attitude to safety programs. The prime concern is not safety but is the amount of money that can be collected. The Minister ought to apply himself to that matter. There has evening. been a tremendous response from the boating organisations, from those who, I guess, have enough money to buy a boat and from other groups which are affected by the increases and which police certain areas of responsibility, cluding fire protection. Councils from as away as Western Austraha have written to me as involved. the shadow Minister for Post and Telecommunications. They have been carrying out their responsibilities with regard to paying of fees. The whole thing needs to be dealt with more professional way than the Minister has member's Bill. dealt with it until now. The Minister announced a further fees review, and reports are now appearing in the Press suggesting that for most users fees wtil be decreased. But the fact is that the whole operation has been a shemozzle. It is to the discredit of the Minister that it has operated in that way. However, the revenue will not decrease. The Department is engage in that favourite action of government, shuffling cards from one deck to another. Commonwealth users of the radio spectrum previously exempt from fees are now to pay fees which will more than make up the expected shortfall from the coming reductions in fees. Of course, it is as plain as a pikestaff that such an exercise will bring only an illusory increase in Government revenue. An increase in income for the Postal and Telecommunications Depanment will be matched by corresponding outflows from other Government departments. There wtil be more eggs in one basket and fewer in others, but the number of eggs wtil remain constant. As I said when beginning this address this evening, the Opposition completely concurs with this amending Bill. It regrets the necessity for such a Bill and points out the necessity for further amendments to the principal Act. I also repeat that the Opposition is aware of the criticism of the Minister and of his Department's lax administration which has meant that such necessary amendments are not being debated here today. The Opposition is similarly critical of the Minister's handling of radio communication licence fees. After a mishmash of increases, reviews and reductions, no just and proper policy has emerged. All these matters are apposite to the Btil under discussion today. Perhaps we ought to consider the principal Act as a whole. I point out that it ought not to have been necessary for Senator Rae to have gone to the lengths that he went to. Who will suffer the consequences of the mismanagement and inappropriate actions of the Government? The sufferers will be those individuals who have been affected in the past. I do not know which Minister will reply to me this Mr Kevin Cairns-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is paying attention. Give him a run.",87
223,Mr INNES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,I hope that some honourable inmembers are paying attention because I am far showing the inefficiency of the Ministers Mr Ellicott- I take a point of order. The licence honourable member for Wilmot is here to in a answer all the questions. This is a private,89
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,Hon. Ian Robinson)-There is no point of order.,89
225,Mr INNES,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"I am very pleased the Minister for the Capital Territory has intervened in this debate. I thought that mouth to mouth resuscitation was confined to the beaches. Now we have it in the Parhament. We have seen the Minister to for the Capital Territory advising the back bencher who is the Charlie MCCarthy about the place to stand up on behalf of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who has seen fit not even to attend this evening; he is the House. I understand the next member of the High Court, perhaps the next Chief Justice, is very eloquent and admirable person to represent the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. congratulate him on one of his major speeches in the House this session! But the Minister for Capital Territory has not answered the question. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications had a responsibility to exercise whatever authmember ority he had under the principal Act. Whichever way the Government twists and turns, those have had their equipment confiscated as a result of the Minister's failure to act over this period can place the responsibility at the feet of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. No matter how much his colleague would like to protect him, it is his responsibility. It seems to me that we could have done a range of things with regard to the Act if the Mining ister had acted responsibly. We would not needed a private member's Bill dealing with such an important aspect of it if the Minister had acted in a proper way. I repeat what I said first instance. The Opposition is not opposed to this Bill. I had a long discussion with Senator Rae, who introduced it into the Senate. We ironed out all the problems that might have arisen out of some of the Bill's technicahties. congratulate him for his initiative in introducing it. We have made a long examination Wireless Telegraphy Act and, whilst we support this Bill, we give notice that in the future we will introduce some amendments to the legislation clear up some of the difficulties which have arisen out of the failure of the Minister and those responsible to face up to their responsibilities.",89
226,Mr YATES ,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"Holt) (8.48)-No words can Rae possibly detract from the tremendous event which has just occurred in the Parliament; that is, for the first time for a great many years a vate member has introduced and had passed an extremely important Bill which affects many Australians: Whatever the Opposition may say about it, it had the opportunity to do likewise. fell to Senator Rae to bring forward the Bill and to the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Burr) to introduce it in this House. He has created yond doubt in the minds of the people country a feeling that the back bench members of the Liberal Party really concern themselves with legislation and are the people whom they can rely on to introduce private Bills to amend what they think to be wrong in any form of government Bill or government administration. Thanks to Tasmanians again, the people are able to perceive the ways in which a sensible Bill can not even in be introduced to this House. Nothing can be said more to their credit than a that they have created in our Parliament and in this House an historic event. I hope that in the I future they will introduce even more Bills from the back benches and that they will never fail to the support their electors whenever they think the Government has not passed legislation which they beheve is in their interest. As a back bench interested in parliamentary procedure, there is nothing more for me to say than that it is who a tremendous parhamentary event. I extend my congratulations to the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Burr). I hope he will convey those sentiments to Senator Rae in the other place. I hope the Bill proceeds with great success and the acclaim of all of the back bench members of this House and of the Australian people.",90
227,Mr BURR ,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"Wilmot) (8.50)-in reply-In closthe debate I want to thank my colleagues, the have honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman) and the honourable member for Holt ( Mr Yates), for the kind words they have expressed. I in the agree with the honourable member for Holt when he says that in some ways this is an historical Bill. It shows to the people of Australia that private members of parliament are able to bring forward matters into legislation and have that I legislation accepted on the statute book. This is a proud day in the history of our Parliament and of of the our legislative procedures. I thank the Opposition for its co-operation into this debate. I know that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Innes) and Senator Rae have conferred on several occasions in drawing up the details of this Bill. There has been close cooperation between the Opposition and Senator on this matter. But I point out to the honourable member for Melbourne who claimed that this matter could, perhaps, have been corrected priby administrative procedures within the Department itself that it was the advice of the Attorney General's Department that the confiscated equipment could not be returned to its rightful It owner under the legislation as it is presently drafted. In order for the equipment to be returned to its rightful owner the Act had to be beamended. That is the reason for the introduction in this of this Bill into the Parhament. The honourable member for Melbourne made other suggestions to the Government that I am not qualified to answer. The only thing that I can say to the honourable member is that I am quite sure that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications ( Mr Staley) is doing all within his power to ensure that there is a proper review of the Wireless Telegraph Act. I am quite sure that necessary amendments will be brought in by the Government at the appropriate time. I thank the Opposition for its co-operation in supporting this Bui.

Motion (by Mr Ellicott) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",90
228,Mr BRYANT ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Wills) (8.55)-There is a stack of amendments to the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill 1979. As I understand it this Bill emasculates the Pipeline Authority. It removes from it the power to trade effectively. Under this Bill some of the Authority's functions will be controlled in such a way that something that was launched as a major national work by the Labor Government will be reduced in its capacity to make this country better off. I would be grateful, of course, if the Minister for Home Affairs ( Mr Elhcott) would indicate that that is not the case. Of course, it is the case. I remind the House that the Pipeline Authority is responsible for a major national work.",92
229,Dr EVERINGHAM ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,It is like the Snowy scheme.,92
230,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"That is right. It is one of the great achievements of the Labor Government. It is continually ignored by the Government in its attacks upon the Labor Government. I was interested in the remarks made by the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Groom) who introduced the Bill in this House. He said: In brief,' within a short time following Moomba-Sydney pipeline the Authority has become a net contributor to the Budget. I commend the Bill to honourable members. This is one of the projects about which the Labor Government was charged with being extravagant. The end result, as has been pointed out by the Minister, is that it is a net contributor to the Budget. There are various amendments proposed to this Bill. The Bill itself seeks to amend the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. The amendments, as I see them, appear to be taking away from the Authority its capacity to trade effectively and to take the initiative in the matter of buying and selling of petroleum. The principle underlying the Bill is that the Authority must trade on accepted commercial principles, whatever they are. What are accepted commercial principles? One of the habits of this Government is to expect government authorities to operate under a set of principles governing financial behaviour which is not expected of private enterprise. In the general run of things we have loaded most authorities such as this with an interest burden which was quite unnecessary because in the first instance the money put into them was from Consolidated Revenue. The difference, of course, between public enterprise of that sort and private enterprise is that there is in private enterprise a larger measure of equity capital which does not carry a continuous interest burden than there is in public enterprise. It was about 20 years ago I think that people started to talk in this way about the application of principles to trading and other activities of government authorities. The Post Office itself was the first victim, as I recall.",92
231,The CHAIRMAN,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Order ! I remind the honourable member that the Committee is considering the amendments. The honourable member is required to address himself in more specinc terms to the amendments.,92
232,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"That is right. These amendments cover such items as borrowing from the Commonwealth, borrowing otherwise than from the Commonwealth, dealings with securities, the Authority's giving security, borrowings not otherwise permitted, and liability to taxation. I think these amendments cover almost every area of the financing of public enterprise. I think it is fair enough to compare pubhc enterprise financing and private enterprise financing.",92
233,The CHAIRMAN,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,The honourable member will relate his remarks to the amendments before the Committee in a more specific fashion.,92
234,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"In what way would you like it completion of the explained to you, Mr Chairman?",92
235,The CHAIRMAN,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,I put it to the honourable member that he is making an admirable second reading speech on the matter.,92
236,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,That is right. I suggest that the motion before the Committee puts us in no other position. There are a dozen or so amendments under consideration. They cover the whole range of the activities of the Authority. How else can they be dealt with?,92
237,The CHAIRMAN,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,The honourable member may proceed and identify the amendments as he deals with them.,92
238,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"I am not going to sit down. I will make sure that the thousands of people who are listening tonight will understand that the Government is interfering with the effective work of one of the great achievements of the last 10 or 15 years, the Pipeline Authority, which is responsible for transmitting gas and other energy sources to the community. Of course, Canberra will be connected to this pipeline eventually. This is, in fact, a demonstration of the great difference between the Labor Government of 1972-75 and this Government. I take up the matter of the difference between borrowings and equity capital. It is my belief, was attempting to explain in simple enough terms, that the difference between private enterprise in these matters and public enterprise is that we have now adopted the policy that almost all funds from the Commonwealth going into authorities such as this become borrowings rather than equity capital. In the case of private enterprise money invested becomes equity capital. The flexibility in paying dividends and equity capital is totally different from the responsibility and the continuing heavy burden imposed upon those public authorities when they are charged interest. This is a fundamental difference. Honourable members opposite-the tycoons that they are and represent-ma y well say that these are commercial principles. There are two different sets of principles which apply to public authorities and to private business. Therefore, I reject the general principles of the Bill and object to the way in which it has been dealt with. I hope that the Minister will explain, if he where this provision strengthens the ability of Pipeline Authority to carry out the duties imposed upon it. I suggest that the fuels authority which was to start in Canberra in 1975 could taken up and could be given the task of distriments: bution in Canberra. I only hope that people aware that a substantial emasculation has taken place in one of the great constructive achievethese ments in the period 1972-75. If the Minister Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the ister for Primary Industry ( Mr Adermann) who is at the table or honourable members opposite could point to one constructive achievement of this Government since 11 November or 13 December 1975 to equal the construction of the pipeline, I would be interested to hear what have to say. Honourable members opposite granted. should stand up and name one such achievement. They can obtain 10 minutes within which to do so. The Chairman of Committees is in a eral minded mood tonight in relation to these matters. This is an opportunity for honourable members to explain whether the Government with. has done anything of this order in the last and a half years.",92
239,Mr HURFORD ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Adelaide) (9.2)- I hesitated for a moment in the hope that a member on the Government side would rise in his place to exof plain to the Committee what these amendments to the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill are about. I know of at least two occasions today when a Government Minister has moved a as whole series of amendments that from the Senate without any explanation whatas I soever. I do not point to the Minister for Veterans ' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Adermann) who is now at the table. He was not at the table when these amendments were moved; that was done by the Minister for Home Affairs ( Mr Elhcott). No explanation and no reasons were given why the Senate amended the Bill when it was passed by that chamber. In the last half an hour the honourable member for Holt ( Mr Yates) made a short contribution in which he suggested that it was the Liberal back benchers of this Parliament who look at the legislation. If that is so, where are those Liberal back benchers now when this Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill is being debated? Why do they not fill in the gaps which exist because their Ministers cannot explain to us why these amendments have been moved? I take up the challenge issued by the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Bryant) and seek explanations about these amendments. A short while ago honourable members in this chamber can, considered this matter, yet the senators found the reason to make further changes to the legislation which was passed by this chamber. We have not learnt the reason for these changes. I welcome be the fact that the Government accepts amendI guess that in this case they are Governare ment amendments. I have not heard that some Government senators crossed the floor to force amendments as they did on another matter for tonight. These are Government amendments. I Minask: Why have these amendments been made? I welcome the fact that the Government has an open mind and is prepared to bring in amendments at this stage. Surely, the Senate owes this chamber the courtesy of explaining its amendments to the legislation? In matters of this sort they the Senate should not take this chamber for I point out to the Committee that the time is libnow five past nine. We have just under another hour and a half before the normal Adjournment debate. We have very little extra business to deal In the last fortnight, the Opposition has had four two opportunities to raise business in this chamber. The Standing Orders provide for General Business on every second Thursday. We seek to raise matters of public importance every day. If we are lucky, we are successful on two days out three. Today discussion of a matter of pubhc importance was gagged and the General Business period was almost talked out. We have an hour and a half left to us, yet amendments such these are rushed through this Committee withhave come out any explanation. I point out to the Committee, and to everybody interested, the cavalier fashion in which we are being treated by the Government. The best contribution that we have heard for a long time from the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Roger Johnston)-w e do not hear from him often-wa s by way of an interjection in which he sought to explain these amendments. I waited for him to get to his feet and to explain them in greater detail, but I waited in vain. I will sit down now in the hope that he or the Minister for Veterans Affairs will explain the amendments to us in order that we can learn why we are being asked to vote in the affirmative on them.",93
240,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Hotham) (9.7)-I will seek to explain the amendments in three brief sentences. Amendments 1 and 2 will substitute for the borrowing powers of the Pipeline Authority, which are set out in clause 18 of the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill, new provisions to enable the Authority to raise funds by infrastructure borrowings. These new borrowing provisions are similar to corresponding provisions in the Australian National Railways Amendment Bill 1980 and the Austrahan Shipping Commission Amendment Bill 1980 which have passed through this chamber and through the Senate. Amendment 3 amends section 33 of the principal Act. It-deals with the liability of the authority to taxation to enable the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) to exempt certain loans, dealings and securities from stamp duties and similar taxes. These are similar provisions to those contained in the Austrahan National Railways Amendment Bill and the Australian Shipping Commission Amendment Bill. The provisions have the effect of making this legislation more compatible with the provisions of other statutory legislations. I hope that that explains it adequately to the Opposition. This is information which is freely available in the Bill.",94
241,Mr BRYANT ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Wills) (9.8)-I wish to clarify the position I adopted when it clear that I was talking about the amendments. I was referring to the proposed new section 25 which reads: The Minister for Finance may, on behalf of the wealth, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament the purpose, lend moneys to the Authority on such conditions as the Minister for Finance determines. The point I was making was that this is not what one would call commercial principles. The money appropriated by the Commonwealth in this case almost invariably comes from Conabouts, solidated Revenue. Therefore, it will not paid to the people who originally supplied it. equity capital invested in the Authority which belongs to the people. If it makes a 100 per cent profit, it can declare a dividend. If it makes no profit, it does not need to declare a dividend. If interest is charged, that commitment must be met whether or not a profit has been made. This is one of the greatest burdens imposed on public enterprise in this country. The reason why I am raising this general question is that it happened some 20 years ago when there was an inquiry into the operations of the Post Office. It was recommended then that commercial principles or practices be adopted. It was capitalised for the period of its existence-at that time it was about 60 years-at about the $ 1,000m mark or perhaps a bit more. At that stage a notional interest was imposed upon it. This money was not borrowed and was never required to be paid back to anyone. The money was obtained from profits or out of revenue appropriated to the Post Office. If it was the General Motors Holden's Ltd company-whic h has been built out of money appropriated from the customers, upon which that company pays no interest and in respect of which nobody has any equity or say at shareholders meetings-this continuing burden of interest would not have to be met. The great burden upon public authorities in this country is the notional interest imposed by what this Government chooses to call commercial principles. Nobody in private enterprise would call them commercial principles and so the public authorities end up in continual financial trouble. Mr Bourchier- I think private enterprise pays that interest when it borrows moneys.",94
242,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"No, it is equity capital. Mr Bourchier-Private enterprise borrows most of it in thefirstplace.",94
243,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"No , it is appropriated in the Parliament. Mr Bourchier- I am talking about private I first spoke. I make enterprise.",94
244,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"I am talking about parliamentary appropriations. Loan moneys are not apCommonproved in here and appropriated to something. for Moneys may be borrowed and applied in the terms and general system. If honourable members look back through the history of the matter they will find that most of the appropriations that we have talked about in these instances are from Consolidated Revenue. In fact, in 1951 or therethe situation reached the stage that there be rewas much more money in ConsoUdated Revenue It is than could be borrowed. The Commonwealth started lending this money to the States and set up a loan consolidation and investment reserve. The Commonwealth was paying to the States funds which had been appropriated through taxation system. Then the Commonwealth amount loaded the funds with interest. This became burden on the States tramways, riverways, sewerage systems and so on. That situation existed until some time in the late 1960s. There has been a gradual change in this general flow funds. At various times in the last 10 years larger percentage of funds-sometime s from borrowings-ha s gone to capital works. I do have the figures to hand, but I would say that over the last six or seven years the great prothat. portion of the money put into capital works has come from Consolidated Revenue, soon.",94
245,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"You r idea of economics is to print money, that's all, isn't it?",95
246,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"No, it is not. Mr Chairman, is it appropriate at this point to give an example from the field in which the honourable member is familiar?",95
247,The CHAIRMAN ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Mr M ill a r ) - If the honourable member is developing his point he may proceed.,95
248,Dr EVERINGHAM ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Genera l Motors-Holden's.,95
249,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Le t us consider General gradually Motors-Holden's. It brought no money to this country at all. It borrowed £2m from the Comthe monwealth Banking Corporation and £500,000 from the Bank of Adelaide. The company paid that back, but it is now capitalised to the tune of around $2,000m. Where did that money come from? It came fromMONICA",95
250,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Profits .,95
251,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Profits. Where did the company get those profits? It has appropriated them from the customers.,95
252,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,It is not appropriated from the customer.,95
253,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"It was not appropriated from the customers who run around in Mercedes. It was appropriated from the ordinary Australians who buy Holdens. I will speak to the Chairman who is a much more intelUgent person. In the last 30 or 40 years there has been a shift from capital raised through going onto the associated sharemarket in the issuing of shares to customer created capital; that is, it is money appropriated course, from the customer by excess profits. That company does not pay dividends and does not aUow anybody to have a say in the matter. It does not pay interest. The honourable member talks about printing money. His friends, such as General Motors-Holden's, the BHP company and all the rest of them are doing this all the the time. The Government has invested a huge of public money, through the benefit of a the levy on fuel, in BHP-Esso and so on.",95
254,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,You don't understand.,95
255,Mr BRYANT,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"I am sorry if I cannot explain of the matter in simple enough terms to the honoura able member for Hotham. Nobody wtil have the chance to do so next year because the citizens not down there wtil wake up to him. I understand that he is a computer expert. I can understand If he has a decent sort of computer he does not need to think himself; he has never got into taxation and the habit of doing so. I recommend to honourable members that they have a good look at thefinancingof public authorities in this way. I suggest that, not in any sense of criticism of honourable members opposite-the y have to learn-bu t because they have to study thefinancingof pubUc authorities and consider that matter against thefinancingof private business. The principles are totally different. In this instance we wiU load the Pipeline Authority with whatever the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) chooses to be the notional rate of interest. It wtil either make a profit or it wtil not. The next thing to occur will be the Government's edging the interest rate upwards. The Pipeline Authority will be running at a loss and Government will sell it, just as it did its friend, the Commonwealth Brickworks. Motion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted.

256,Mr ADERMANN ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Fisher-Minister for Veterans' Affairs)- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Btil and the Ausequity traUan War Memorial Btil 1980 as they are measures. Separate questions wtil, of be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",95
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Hon. Ian Robinson)-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",95
258,Dr EVERINGHAM ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Capricornia) (9.16)Referring to the War Graves Bill 1980, which was read for the first time on 15 May, let me outline the background of the legislation. The war graves referred to include those of the Commonwealth of nations' service personnel who died in action in the 1914 War or since, Victoria Cross winners, and those whose death has been accepted as due to war service or who died while they were in receipt of totally and permanently incapacitated pensions. The graves for which Austraha is responsible to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission are those in Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, at Guadalcanal, Norfolk Island and at Ambon, Indonesia. In Papua New Guinea, German, Dutch and French war graves are also cared for. In Austraha the Japanese War Cemetery at Cowra is cared for. Under the term 'graves' we treat similarly cemeteries and memorials. The type of care that is involved for the Office of War Graves under the Department of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Adermann) involves providing kerbing and filling for graves, headstones, plaques for the graves and niches for ashes in memorial walls. None of this work is provided where private monumental work has been undertaken. The Office has also set up gardens of remembrance in each State capital and at Launceston. The aim of the Bill as set out is for the Governor General to appoint a Director of War Graves to carry out these functions, but the functions will still remain under the charge of the Department of Veterans' Affairs Office of Australian War Graves. If the appointee is a member. of the Public Service he will retain his rights under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act. As would apply if the Bill had not been introduced, the secretary to the Department will report annually to the Parliament; so the Director remains under the administration of the Department of Veterans'Affairs. The effect in essence is to have an officer appointed by the Government. When the Act speaks of the Governor General it means the Governor General-in-Council which in effect means the Governor as advised by his Ministers. It is a government appointment. The Opposition has never shrunk from the prospect of taking responsibiUty for making major appointments to responsible positions. After all, it is closer to the grass roots and people who elect us to this Parliament, to the people who give authority to the Government and to the Public Service. Therefore an elected representative and a Minister chosen by the elected representauves should make an appointment. If one wanted to extend this to an absurd degree one could say that Ministers could appoint the whole PubUc Service all the way down the Une. The Opposition is not opposed to the principle, but let us not kid outselves that in some way we are upgrading the functions of the Office or changing its obligations or its responsibilities to the Parliament by the appointment of a Director of War Graves. Obviously the Office of Australian War Graves already has somebody who is responsible to the head of the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the administration of Austrahan war graves. I venture to say that if such a provision had been brought in by the Labor Government thefirstthing that would have been said by most honourable members opposite and, I dare say, by a fair slice of the media, would have been that it was jobs for the boys. In other words, instead of the Government appointing an impartial career public servant to carry out a responsible Public Service job it would have been alleged that the Labor Party was taking it upon itself to make it a political appointment. I will not indulge in that sort of carping criticism. I just point out that when the Labor Government found it necessary to change the ingrained conservative thinking of certain senior public servants who had grown up doing things in an antiLabor way, in a politicised way-the y did not realise it because they knew no other method of thinking-it was accused of providing jobs for the boys. Mr Neil-You did, too.",96
259,Dr EVERINGHAM,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,That is a shining example of the sort of prejudice to which I am referring. Mr Neil-All Whitlam's staff were appointed to the Public Service.,96
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Hon. Ian Robinson)-Order ! Interjections are out of order. Mr Neil-He is attacking the PubUc Service. It is independent.,96
261,Dr EVERINGHAM,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"The prejudice displayed by the honourable member for St George is typical of the prejudice which I am trying to draw to the notice of the House. The honourable member for St George is quite convinced of the justice of to the his theme. The Labor Government appointed people who were competent, aware and able to carry out the philosophy of a different government. The Whitlam Government wanted to change things and wanted to make something happen. It found that certain heads of certain departments could not comprehend its pohcies and could not or would not carry out those pohcies. The heads of departments who could not carry out the wishes of the Labor Government were replaced by people who did carry them out. One of the major criticisms that people such as the honourable member for St George made of the Labor Government was that it did too much too quickly and changed too many things. Had the Labor Government appointed people who were incompetent and who were incapable of change that criticism could never have been made because the changes would never have occurred and honourable members opposite would have no grouch. The people appointed by the Labor Government showed their competence by making those changes. Some of those appointments have gone down in history as remarkable appointments. To emphasise this point I need go no further than to refer to the appointment of our Ambassador to China. He has transformed the relationship between Australia andMr Neil-What about your Ambassador to Ireland?",96
262,Dr EVERINGHAM,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"That was an inspired remark, was it not? The Labor Government's appointment was as good as this Government's appointment of an Austrahan Ambassador to New Zealand from the Senate.",97
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,Order! I suggest that the honourable member for Capricornia come back to the Bill.,97
264,Dr EVERINGHAM,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"I do not need to labour the point that it is hkely that there will be an appointment not from the ranks of the Pubhc Service. If there is such a thing as jobs for the boys it will be very interesting to see whether the honourable member for St George declares when this appointment is made that it is a non-political appointment. I should like to refer now to the Australian War Memorial Bill 1980. As in the Australian War Graves Bill, there is no commitment in this Bill to increased expenditure by the Government. The Government is not giving away anything to improve services. One of the biggest concerns of the Australian War Memorial authorities is the deterioration of fine arts and textiles-thing s that badly need curator services. There is a world shortage of museum curators. In Australia a need exists for conservation laboratories. The storage problem has been eased recently because of additional storage facilities being provided at Mitchell. There is a need for much more training in museum curatorship for Austraha, South East Asia and the Pacific region. It is still very difficult to get the services of curators. A shortage of curators is not the only obstacle facing Australia. Australia offers very low salaries for any jobs for curators below the position of director. Because Austraha is isolated from the centres of training and expertise in highly specialised professions for which Australia does not offer great numbers of vacancies I beheve that we ought to be offering far more than the world salary rates so that people will bring their scarce skills to this country and train people in Australia for positions here and in adjoining countries. Australia even might have to subsidise training for other countries. In the long run the preservation of museum exhibits in South East Asia and in the Pacific region will be an asset to Australia. One of the biggest growth industries not only in Canberra and Australia but also in general areas of the South Pacific is tourism. The tourist industry will not get smaller, despite the increasing cost of motor fuel and the need to develop alternative fuels. We have to attract people to this part of the world with a package deal. Tourists not only visit the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, but also visit Fiji, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. Countries in the whole area need to work together in a project of this kind to attract people with adequate skills to work as curators. We need to attract people with various skills which are needed to preserve exhibits which are deteriorating. I am told that 700,000 people visit the Australian War Memorial each year. That is not an insignificant number. The Australian War Memorial is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Australian Capital Territory. There is a need for more background and educational material to enhance not only the attraction of the memorial but also the educational value of it. It should be equipped with a theatrette, more gallery space, a classroom and more active educational facilities. I beheve that this month the Cabinet has been considering a submission for extension of the War Memorial. By and large the Opposition has no objection to either Bill. Whilst the Opposition believes there is considerable virtue in the Australian War Memorial Bill because it rationalises administration to some extent, I urge the Government to do more than simply tidy up the administration. More resources should be allocated. I know that it is a time of contraint. We are always told by Treasurers: 'There is a need to tighten your belt, so do not spend any more, particularly in the public sector'. If I may take a phrase from the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Bryant), private enterprise does not work this way. If private enterprise operators can see that there will be a return on an investment they invest. If they could see the tourist industry in Austraha, particularly the Australian Capital Territory, benefiting far beyond the cost of preserving the exhibits, presenting them attractively and by making the educational aspect of them more accessible and more entertaining, I am sure they would spend the money required to do these things. We do not even have to go beyond the tourist industry to see this. Adjoining my electorate is a nice big slice of freehold land on the coast of Queensland which was brought by the Iwasaki Sangyo Company (Australia) Pty Ltd. That company has a record of building some of the biggest tourist resorts in the world in Hawaii and Japan. It is preparing, according to the head of the firm Mr Iwasaki, to build in that central Queensland site something larger than Disneyland. He is going ahead with the project and claiming that there will be no return for 10 years. That is long term investment by private enterprise in the tourist industry. The Australian War Memorial-althoug h it has higher objectives than attracting tourists-if one reduces this to hard, cold cash terms, nevertheless is a good investment in the tourist industry. I believe it is comparable to the investment of Mr Iwasaki. I think that the rate of return will be comparable as well. The Board of Trustees will be replaced by a council which will have transferred to it the ownership of exhibits that is now partly vested in the trustees and partly in the Commonwealth. The council members will be appointed for specified terms instead of being appointed, as the trustees are, at the Governor General's pleasure. I believe that is the opposite sort of movement to the movement in administration for war graves where the fixed term public servant will be replaced by someone appointed at the Governor General's pleasure. However, the important thing is that the council will have more direct control, it will be able to set up its own and dispose of its own funds and it will have far more administative cohesion and autonomy. I consider this to be the right move. I would like to see the council appointed in a more democratic way but that is not a major issue. No doubt there will be ex-service organisations which will, from time to time, be represented on some of these councils. More urgent matters are exercising their minds at the moment, matters of more immediate urgency for disabled and deprived veterans. They are going as hard as they can to get a hearing and a voice with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. So these more abstruse and long term administrative arrangements are left to the Department. By and large the Department and the civil servants have done very well with the resources available to them. We cannot be proud of the way we have preserved the Australian War Memorial in view of the lack of skilled personnel-the y are not attracted because of the lack of money offered-the lack of resources devoted to preserving exhibits which are fast decaying and the lack of resources devoted to extending the educational concept and the information resources. The Opposition does not oppose either Bill.",97
265,Mr NEIL ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"St George) (9.34)-I commend the Government for bringing forward the War Graves Bill and the Austrahan War Memorial Bill. I will deal firstly with the Australian War Memorial Bill as the Government's representative on the Board of Trustees. I congratulate the Minister for Home Affairs ( Mr Elhcott) for the very close interest he has taken in the activities of the Memorial during his term of office. I also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Board, Sir Thomas Daly, a former Chief of the General Staff, who exhibits interest in the most detailed activities of the memorial as do all the trustees. The Director, Mr Flanagan, and his staff work with extreme dedication and provide, with limited resources, an extraordinarily worthwhile service to the Australian people and to our heritage. The Memorial was the dream of the great Australian historian Dr C. E. W. Bean. Its primary function, as a memorial, will be retained under the Bill. There had been some suggestions that the name should be changed to the Australian War Memorial and Museum. I am pleased to say that the trustees took the view that the proper title should be the Australian War Memorial; the present title should be retained. I was pleased to be part of that decision. The memorial is unique; staff there is no other comparable institution in the world. It is, indeed, a source of admiration for visitors who come from many parts of the world. Almost every visiting head of state and almost every visitor of any distinction visits the Australian War Memorial, as do 750,000 other persons a year. The tributes that have been made to the Memorial from persons overseas are very high indeed. Its essential character will be retained under this Bill. A council will be established to take over from the Board of Trustees. Except for those items deposited on conditions with the memorial, all deposited property will be vested in the Memorial council. Over the past few years the trustees have attempted to grapple with the financial difficulties that have been mentioned. I certainly agree that increased expenditure is warranted. I have had considerable discussions with the Minister and I hope he will be able to give favourable consideration, and approval, to additional funds being made available in this year's Budget. Prior to the making available of funds it is, of course, necessary that detailed proposals be presented. There have been increases in the level of staff for the Memorial in the past year. That, again, is a tribute to the Minister in the present stringent financial circumstances. There are more curators and persons skilled in fine arts that we would like to have made available and we hope funds will become available for those purposes. In the last few years, in order to go to the Government to make out a case for more funds, it has been necessary for the Memorial to take steps to prepare feasibility studies on the types new works required and to obtain the assistance of government departments and the National Capital Development Commission to prepare appropriate plans. As I have said, I am concerned that the Memorial should have updated facilities. It was erected in the depression years. Despite that, it has 750,000 visitors a year including 100,000 international visitors and 70,000 school children, exceeding the visits of any gallery or museum in Australia. It is the largest ist attraction in the Australian Capital Territory. It also contains a very significant part of our national heritage and, for those persons who are not fully aware, as well as having the memorabilia of warfare it contains a very wide range of high quality paintings that are world renowned- a number of Dobells and paintings of other very well known painters. The trustees wish to see a number of innotribute vations. The estimated cost would be about $2m over three years. That is a significant sum but a relatively large sum when we are considering the totality of a federal Budget involving more than $20 billion. We would like to trette and classrooms so that the 70,000 schoolchildren who visit the Memorial each year will be able to obtain a clear picture of the sacrifices by Australians, the devastation of war and the message of peace that must be the aim all generations. The schoolchildren would be able to come into the Memorial and, at the outset, have a briefing in the theatrette and the classrooms. Of course, other members of the public would be able to join in. To enable this to be done, we would also need a new entrance foyer and a concourse which would include space for a sales area and, we hope, a creche and assembly areas for guided tours and amenities. But I assure the House that we will not be changing the essential character of the building. It will look substantially the same. It will have the same atmosphere and the dedicated, even awesome, quality about it that it has already. I am sure that all who enter the main entrance of the Memorial and see the Pool of Remembrance and the hall at the end of it are extremely moved by the atmosphere. We will not be changing the basic feel, the basic atmosphere or the basic meaning of the building. The amendments to the building's structure will be done in such a way as not to be apparent to any great degree. But they will be very significant. We need to have an introductory gallery because 70 per cent of the visitors are under the age of of 40 years and they have had no personal experience of war, even on the home front. International visitors and the large number of Austrahans who have come to this country since the Second World War and who visit the Memorial do not have a detailed experience of Australia's efforts in the War. I appreciate, however, that many migrants have come to Australia often after having had very horrendous experiences in two world wars, particularly the Second World tourWar. But it is essential that we have the opportunity to inform the public at large of the wars in which Australia has played a part and it is proposed that this be done in the introductory gallery. There will also be a temporary exhibition gallery because the Memorial is not a mausoleum: It regularly mounts special displays. There were very successful displays recently. I remember particularly the favourable comment about the bamboo and barbed wire display which paid to our prisoners of war. We have had other types of displays such as those for annivernot saries of the opening of the Memorial. Unfortunately, there have been some criticisms of those displays because they have had to be mounted in see a thearelatively inadequate areas. We want to ensure that some of the significant dioramas can be more adequately displayed for these puposes and for general purposes. The dioof ramas are world famous; they are extraordinary. In particular, some of the scenes of the First World War are so lifelike that one imagines at first sight that they are wide angle colour photographs and that one is looking at them through some third dimensional process. Fewer than 10 per cent of these are on display at present. It is hoped that we will be able to have further public amenities because the private facUities as such are not what would ordinarily be required by municipal codes. It is hoped that there will be upgraded displays. For example, the Memorial has more Victoria Crosses-it has 23-tha n any other institution in the world, but the display at present is unsatisfactory. It does not compare, for example, with the Air Force museum display at Hendon which gives prominence to various persons who won the Victoria Cross. We need, in particular, further facUities for scholars. There are 2,000 serious research workers who require access to primary historical documentation. It is amazing the number of people who, in the course of research for books, articles or historical matter, come to the Australian War Memorial because it covers a wide spectrum of our activities. Recently, for example, we authorised the publication of a book on the role of the churches in the First World War, a subjea which covers a much wider field than one normally imagines. But the conscription debates and the Uke were very important issues at the time. I know, of course, that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would have a particular interest in the role of the churches. We need to increase the eating facilities at the Memorial. I am reminded that on occasions we have been criticised apparently for not have private enterprise conduct some of the catering faculties. Well, private enterprise has conducted various catering facUities but we need to upgrade the areas and the provisions there to give private enterprise a better opportunity to provide more facUities. Staff accommodation is another necessity. Additional professional appointments have recently been made and we want to make more, but accommodation for curators and the like is unsatisfactory. I make the point that in other institutions such as the Australian National Gallery such provisions have been made. It is my information that the Department of Finance is of the view that it is not satisfied that all accommodation at the Memorial is being fully utilised. If it does have that view I think it is quite in error. I am sure the Minister wtil approach his colleague the Minister for Finance ( Mr Eric Robinson) to ensure that if there is such a view it is changed immediately. Indeed, one hopes that the officers of the Department of Finance wtil take themselves over to the Memorial as soon as possible. We have an outstation buUding at MitcheU but that is for specific purposes. It was opened recently. It is a good outstation for its own purposes but we need to ensure that the Memorial, as constituted, carries out its proper functions. The trustees, the National Capital Development Commission, the Department of Housing and Construction, the Returned Services League and two international consultants have all agreed that extensions are urgently required. I again support strongly the need for further extensions and thefinancefor those extensions. There is one other matter I wish to raise with regard to the Memorial and that concerns the position of persons who were not members of actual Australian forces. The Memorial provides plaques with the names of every Australian serviceman known to have served and died in war or warlike operations between the Sudan operation and the Vietnam war. There are 102,000 names on the plaques. It is indeed a moving experience to walk around and to see those names and, in my own case, to see the names of friends with whom I served in Vietnam. However, there are a number of persons who died in warUke circumstances whose names are not commemorated because they were not members of the actual Services. These include persons in the Merchant Marine. I am pleased to say that the trustees have recently taken the view that a general plaque should be erected to the memory of the Merchant Marine and that the trustees should embark on a public program of obtaining the names of as many members as possible of the Merchant Marine who are known to have died in warlike operations. At the end ofan appropriate period of inquiry consideration will be given to setting up plaques carrying the names. In the meantime a memorial book will be made available which wtil have names in loose-leaf form so that relatives and friends can come and observe the book and turn the pages to look up the names of departed relatives and friends. We hope to mount similar exercises with regard to Australians who served in Commonwealth forces. Exercises wtil also be mounted with regard to photographers, war correspondents and members of philanthropic organisations who lost their Uves in war or warlike operations. The actual detaUs of those projects are being worked out. I commend that proposal most warmly to the House and assure the Minister of my support in attempting to obtain Cabinet approval for the necessary finance. I believe that the House is indebted to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Adermann) for bringing forward the important War Graves Bill 1980, which should not be the subject of political party attack. Therefore, I make no comment on the unfortunate statements of a pohtical nature that have been uttered in this chamber tonight on the Bill or the proposed position of Director of War Graves. I am certain that whoever is appointed will discharge his duties in an exemplary and proper fashion. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which was created by royal charter in 1917, has for many years fulfilled an extraordinarily valuable function. The Minister was good enough some time ago to make arrangements for me to visit the graves of Australian war dead in the Ypres area. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission tends those graves. It is an extraordinarily moving experience to see the ground upon which so many Australians gave their lives for a cause in which they believed. Some of the graves are tended in a very neat manner, but an area is set aside where the ground has not been changed since the battles of World War I. Portions of the original trenches are preserved, as are portions of craters which resulted from shell fire or mines. Thus one gets an understanding of the horror of that particular campaign, with the mud, cold and shocking conditions of new weaponry, including gas, that our Austrahan soldiers had to endure. Of course other graves also, in Australia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Norfolk Island and Ambon, will be the responsibility of the Director of War Graves. It is also of interest to that the Japanese war cemetery at Cowra in New South Wales is maintained by the Office of Australian War Graves by arrangement with the Government of Japan. That is testimony to the fact that we pay tribute to all who have died in the terrible circumstances of wars that have beset Australia and its people since this country was discovered. The Government's policy is that all ex-servicemen and servicewomen who died as a result of their service for Austraha shall equally be remembered. Where it has not been possible to provide particular graves, gardens of remembrance, with suitably inscribed plaques bearing details of the deceased, have been provided. I commend the Bill to the House.",98
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Mr M a r t in Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Debate (on motion by Mr Bryant) adjourned. NA BILL 1980 Bill presented by Mr Ellicott, and read a first time. Second Reading",101
267,Mr ELLICOTT ,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Wentworth-Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory) (9.54)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to decisions taken by the Government following a review of the structure of the Austraha Council. The amendments that are proposed in the Bill reflect the Government's wish to see that the Council operates with increased efficiency and effectiveness, whilst continuing to provide the Government and Parliament with the best possible advice on arts policy matters. The opportunity will also be taken to make some minor amendments to the Act that are of a machinery nature. The principal Act provides that the Council shall comprise between 15 and 19 members, including the Chairman and the Council's General Manager, who is an ex-officio member of the Council. At present the Council has its full complement of 19 members. We now believe that such a large number of members is unnecessary and that the functions of the Council can be more effectively carried out by between 10 and 14 members. The existing structure of Council is that the note Chairman of each of the specialised boards established to administer a particular area of the arts is ex-officio a member of the Council. There are at present seven such Boards, covering the areas of music, theatre, literature, visual arts, aboriginal arts, community arts and craft. The Bill contains provision to amend the existing structure of the Council. Firstly, it removes from the principal Act the requirement that all board chairmen are ex-officio members of the Council, replacing it with a provision that at least two board chairmen be appointed to the Council by the Governor General. This amendment will leave the majority of board chairmen free to concentrate on their particular art area. More importantly, these and other amendments are designed to ensure that the Council will have oversight of, and control over, the activities of the various boards and their expenditure. It is important that the Australia Council be able to lay down, implement and from time to time change policy in relation to the arts within the limits of its budget. These amendments will, the Government believes, enable the Council to exercise this control over policy more effectively. In addition, it is proposed to amend the membership provisions in the principal Act so that all the persons appointed in future under section 9 (2) (e) will be persons who practise the arts or are otherwise associated with the arts, and specifically that among them are persons who have practised or who practise the arts in literature, the crafts, the performing arts and the visual arts. This amendment will provide the Minister with flexibility when considering future appointments whilst at the same time emphasising the importance we attach to these particular art forms. Current members of the Council will not be disadvantaged by the proposed amendment, since it will be effected progressively as their terms of office expire. The Act provides at present that the Chairman and members of the Council are part time. The role of the Chairman of the Council is of great importance and the tasks he has to perform are increasing, particularly in relation to the development of pohcy. Furthermore, with a reduction in the number of members, as set out in the amendment Bill, there is the likelihood of greater demands being thus placed on the Chairman. In these circumstances, the Government wishes to have the flexibility of appointing the Chairman on a full time basis should this be considered necessary. The amendment will allow the Government to review the situation when the term of office of the current Chairman, Professor Geoffrey Blainey, ends on 30 June 1981. If a full time Chairman is appointed, the amending Bill provides that the General Manager of the Council will not continue as an ex-officio member of Council, thus being free to concentrate on the administration of the Council's policies and programs. Currently included in the responsibilities the Australia Council is the administration of the Public Lending Right Scheme. This Scheme was included in the responsibUities of the Australia Council by the 1976 amendment to the Act, lowing a recommendation to that effect by the Administrative Review Committee. It has been decided that it would be more appropriate for sponsibUity for the Scheme to be with the partment of Home Affairs. Public Lending Right is a scheme designed to compensate authors for loss of sales through readers borrowing books from libraries, rather than buying their own copChairman. ies. As such, whUst it certainly does promote the interests of authors and publishers of creative Uterature, its appUcation is not confined to books of an artistic character. Accordingly, it does not fit well within the Australia Council framework. This transfer of responsibUity is being made with the agreement of the PubUc Lending Right Committee and also the Australia Council. The importance that the Government attaches to the Scheme will not be diminished in any way by the transfer. There are a number of other amendments of a machinery nature included in the Bill. The principal amendments, however, are designed to ensure that the Council is as streamlined as possible, consistent with its responsibUities within the Government's overall poUcies for the arts. I believe the proposed new Council structure achieves this end. Finally, I should like to take this opportunity of reminding honourable members of the very real achievements of the Australia Council over the past four orfiveyears. For example, in 1977 the Government recognised the need to stimulate a broader involvement in the arts by the community at large and created a specific Community Arts Board within the Council to this end. This Board is now responsible for assisting arts centres and festivals and assisting activities initiated by community groups or local organisations. This provides for wider participation in the arts and the Board has become a Unk between central government and local government, to the extent that during 1978-79 the Board, in partnership with local government, subsidised community arts officers serving some 60 local government areas. This is only one instance of the work which the Australia Council has done and the achievements that it has been making in recent years. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government remains committed to its policy of the promotion of excelof lence in the arts, and the amendments contained in the Bill should in no way be seen to reduce that commitment. By contrast, the Government considers that by providing greaterflexibUityto the folCouncU, the Council will be able to respond more effectively to the challenges faced in the 1980s in this important area of the Uves of all reAustralians. Might I also say that the amendDements that the Government proposes to make to the Council in no way imply any criticism of the existing members of the Council. I have every confidence in them and in the capacity of the The purpose of these amendments, quite simply, as I have already stated, is to strengthen the capacity of the Council to operate in terms of the development of policy and the administration of pohcy in the arts in Austraha. portant that, in this very volatile period in Australia's history and in the development of Austraha's culture, the Austraha Council be equipped to deal with these matters in a flexible and progressive way. The Government believes these amendments will achieve that objective. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Everingham) adjourned. WAR GRAVES BILL 1980 Second Reading Debate resumed.",101
268,Mr BRYANT ,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Wills) (10.2)-The two Bills before the House-the War Graves Bill and the Austrahan War Memorial Bill-ar e complementary to one another. It is not often that two Bills can be more appropriately dealt with in a cognate fashion. I wish to deal first of all with the War Graves Bill. Since the very beginning Australia, in association with other countries which have also performed acts of grace and have done their duty as efficiently as we have, has done well in the war graves system that has been developed since the First World War. The whole system over the last 60-odd years has protected the memory of the people who have fallen in battle and have died as a result of war wounds, et cetera. Austraha has estabUshed, in many parts of the world, war cemeteries which are a credit to the people who designed them and the people who maintain them. The cemeteries serve as a constant reminder to people of what war is about-the sacrifice, the hardship and the sorrow of it all-and , one hopes, perpetuate the idea in people's minds whenever they visit the graves that war is one of man's greatest follies and that they should dedicate themselves to peace. Australians lie on every battlefield in world, I should think. We find the graves of tralians in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. I do not know that there would be and many in South America, but I imagine that some Australian servicemen are buried in graves there. Certainly, they are buried in graves throughout South East Asia. I have visited such graves in many parts of the world-in ThaUand, Burma, France, Belgium, Israel, Greece, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, for example. In every case they are beautifully maintained. They are credit to the people who maintain them. I hope system. that all those thousands of Australians who have suffered the sorrow and loss of war, if they are unable to visit the graves, at least take comfort from the fact that there is dedicated service in the It is very immaintenance of those graves. I wish to say several things about this Bill. I notice that a Schedule is attached to the Bill. It sets out the categories of former servicemen and women for whom we will maintain war graves. Of course, these graves have been provided principaUy for people who died in battle or as a result of their war wounds, but they are also provided for people who have had their deaths attributed to war service and people who have won the Victoria Cross. I think it may well be time that we gave some consideration to extending that function to apply to people who actually served on battlefields or who qualified for some of the serv vice medals which indicate service of some sufficient length to show that they were in the business of war on behalf of the nation, no matter what the cause of their deaths might be. The point that has been made both in the second reading speech of the Mmister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Adermann) and by my two colleagues, one from each side of the House, is that people must be constantly reminded of what war is all about. They must be constantly reminded of the enormous sacrifices that Australians have made and that Australia itself has made. A couple of years ago I met a distinguished foreign diplomat in New York who had paid a recent visit to Australia and had gone to the War Memorial. He was struck by the poignancy and the sorrow of all the 100,000-odd names-102,000 names, I think the honourable member for St George ( Mr Neti) said-o n the wall at the War Memorial. Such a sacrifice by a country that had a population of only five million people in 1914 or thereabouts and only about seven million people in 1939 is something that most people in Australia and most people around the world are unaware of. I think the War Memorial should serve as a constant reminder. I hope that we wtil expand the war graves service to include all those the who served. Perhaps a corner should be mainAustained in most of the cemeteries in localities throughout Australia where former servicemen women pass on. It is very difficult, of course, to maintain the general structure of war memorials around the country, but I think in considering this Bill and the Australia War Memorial Bill it may well be time that we took the opportunity to pass the general maintenance responsibUity for the system we have developed to those who maintain the war graves and those who maintain a the War Memorial. They are all part of the same That brings me to the War Memorial itself. I should think it is one of the most significant war memorials in the world! It is something that all Austrahans should visit if they possibly can. We should make sure that Australians understand what it is about. It is a great credit to the people who have designed the War Memorial that it is not a glorification of war but a presentation of war in all its horror, all its sorrow and all its tragedy. It is an artistic and historical achievement of the first magnitude. I hope that we will expand the work of the people who maintain the War Memorial in conjunction with the War Graves Commission to have some publications readily available which give better explanations of what is happening and what has happened in relation to the war cemeteries in which Austrahans he. For instance, a small handbook should be readily available to people who visit Gallipoli for the first time and who have not read the appropriate history. They could see what happened in the place where Australians fell. I recognise that there are some difficulties about that, but the War Graves Commission has people everywhere. I think such a publication would make a very important contribution to an understanding of the war. Last year I visited some of the battlefields in northern France and Belgium, around Ypres. I think there are something Uke 15,000 Australian graves there. If one visited the battiefields of Messines or somewhere like that it would be useful, and I think almost essential, to have some simple brochure with some description of where people stood, where the battles were fought, and who was here and who was there. It would bring the scene to life. I am one of those who do not Ueve, of course, that we should glorify all this, but we want to show that ordinary Australian people were battling for the causes which we believed were just at the time, and which I think history has confirmed were just, against people who were defending other sorts of causes and other sorts of values. We have given a little consideration to the question of ANZAC Day, its general presentation to the community and how we can make people understand its significance. The War Memorial will have to play a very great part in the presentation and preparation of material. I pay a tribute to the people who manage that-to the administration and their staff. The War Memorial is an institution of great significance. I would hope that the requests that the honourable member for St George promulgated here tonight on behalf of the trustees are taken up by the Government. This is not the time or the subject for political points. But it is strange-and we all have to accept the responsibihty-that although we were prepared to exert enormous effort for the war, to make all sorts of sacrifices and dedicate everything we had to win it, we become not mean perhaps but austere in the supply of funds to the people who commemorate and pay the necessary respect to those who made the sacrifice. So it is a question of how we get through to the public. The War Memorial is one of the message centres. How this institution maintains its proper status in the community is a question for the Mmister for Home Affairs ( Mr Ellicott) to take up with his colleagues. I hope he wtil do so. I was interested to see the other day an advertisement in a newspaper- I think this is correctfor people to take up fellowships in various areas of study. I hope that suitable appUcants come forward. I guess the quality of the material that can be made avaUable to them wtil ensure their work will be of adequate quality. So I wish the people who are handhng the War Memorial well. I hope it continues to draw Australians to it. But it will do that most successfully if we take up the remarks of the honourable member for St George, who as I understand it is on the governing body, not as a member of parliament but as a person who served his country well even in a cause which at thetimeI did not agree with. The War Memorial should be made more adequate in terms of services that it offers. I think the War Memorial is another of those institutions which would be advantaged if members of parUament were appointed directly by the Parliament to the proposed Council. This is done with the Australian National University, be- the Institute for Aboriginal Studies and the National Library. I think that instruments of policy such as the War Memorial would be greatly advantaged if members of parliament were appointed to the Council. After all, they are the representatives of the people in a more direct sense than most people can be. I hope the Minister will take up that suggestion and examine it.",103
269,Mr FRY ,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Fraser) (10.14)- I support the Bill. First, I would compliment the present staff and trustees of the Australian War Memorial for the very dedicated way in which they have been able to run this institution under great difficulties for many years. I spoke on this subject during a grievance debate in 1976 and the same sorts of problems that I spoke about then exist today. They are problems of extreme staff shortage and space to meet the demands that are made on the War Memorial. I pay a very warm tribute to those members of the staff and the directorship for the way in whcih they have carried out thenduties under very difficult conditions. I am hopeful that this Bill wtil overcome some of those problems and that the War Memorial will be in a position to fulfil its full potential. I believe it tainly has not done so at this stage. I remember that I was inspired to speak about this matter in 1976 because at that time we had just had a visit from a Canadian parliamentary delegation. That delegation had been all around the world and had seen a large number of war memorials. The members of the delegation said that no other war memorial anywhere in the world had had the same impact on them as the Australian War Memorial. I have always remembered that. I feel that emotional impact when I visit the War Memorial particularly for the dawn service on ANZAC Day. I might say it is a sort of feeling that one gets when one visits some of the very large memorials overseas. I particularly recall the memorial in thefineRussian city of Leningrad, where no fewer than one million people are buried in one grave. People wonder why the Russians have some obsession and concern about security. War memorials have a very emotional impact. The impact at the Australian War Memorial is greater than that at many others. I pay a tribute to the way in which it has been run for many years. Many people may not be aware of the full ramifications of the functions of the War Memveryfinepublication. orial. It is not just a place which collects relics war. It has a veryfinedisplay of art works it acquired. Unfortunately, it does not have the orial. space to display them all. It prints publications from time to time although because of staff and financial shortages it is not able to do as much it would hke. It is concerned with international conferences. It is concerned with the conserstaff vation of very valuable material. It has an excelsufficient lent and very extensive library, and I will say little more about that later. It is, of course, centre point of our ANZAC Day commemorations and other remembrance day commemorations. attract It has very excellent exhibitions. It awards search grants, to which my colleague the honourhope able member for Wills ( Mr Bryant) referred, of course it plays a very important educational role, particularly among our young people. But here again it has not been able to meet the demands that are made on it in that respect in of space and staff. The War Memorial provides tremendous amount of information particularly for research scholars. I understand that somegapore thing hke 2,000 research scholars called on services of the War Memorial last year. Another important spin-off of the information that has been collected at the War Memorial, particularly in its reference library, is the number of very fine publications which have been published in recent years particularly concer- cerning the ANZACs. I refer to books such as Patsy Adam Smith's book The.ANZACs, which is a very scholarly historical work based mainly on information supplied from the diaries and letters of diggers, many of which are held in the War Memorial. Another very fine publication is the historical work written by Bill Gammage of the Australian National University called The ^Broken Years, which is also about ANZAC. Another publication is a piece offictionalwork by a young author, named MCDonald, called/0/J. These are all excellent works in a new crop of works about ANZAC. They tend to play down the glamour of war and to talk about the ugly side of war. They do not overemphasise war; they just try to state it as it was. They have gathered their information from original sources-fro m the soldiers themselves and from the letters and diaries that they wrote. I think that these authors have done a very fine public service in pointing out what war is like and not what many people would like to think it is like. I also mention a book called Not as a Duty Only written by Henry Gullett, more commonly known as Joe Gullett, a Canberra resident and a former member of this chamber. This is also a None of these works could of have been written with the same integrity withhas out the resources of the Australian War MemI think this is a very important aspect of the function that it performs in our society. As I say, the Memorial still has the same staff as problems. There are many unfilled staff vacancies. On some occasions we have advertised for but because we are not able to offer salaries we are not able to attract the a right sort of people. I hope that under this new the administrative arrangement the Council will have a little more flexibility and will be able to the right sort of staff to carry out some of rethe very skilled functions that are required. I that some of the space difficulties can be and overcome so that more displays can be mounted. I hope, too, that at some stage the War Memorial will be able to mount a display of a very terms famous war time vessel called the Krait from a which Australian commandoes carried out some very daring raids on Japanese shipping in Sinharbour. That vessel is at present in the the water in Sydney, where the trustees are maintaining it as best they can, but the vessel does need major work. I think at some stage the vessel should be brought to Canberra and should be kept at the Australian War Memorial. I hope we large will be able to plan for that some time in the future. However, as I pointed out, the vessel is being well looked after in terms of day to day maintenance by the trustees in Sydney. Another aspect I want to speak about briefly is the type of display which the War Memorial puts on. I think one of the main functions of the new Council should be to continue to present a balanced picture of Australia's involvement in war. I know that on occasions some individuals and some organisations tend to over-emphasise the romantic, colourful and glamorous aspects of war. We sometimes play on patriotic and nationalistic emotions for this purpose. I think it reflects great credit on the Board of Trustees of the war Memorial that it has endeavoured to present the ugly, tragic and unglamorous side of war. I refer particularly to its exhibition called 'Barbed Wire and Bamboo' which depicts a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. It is a very fine display. I refer also to Nolan's Gallipoli series. That is a brUUant series of paintings which I think tend to strip away the trappings of war and to display the human, mortal soldier and his inner spirit. I think those are veryfinepaintings which all people should see, if they can. The sacrifices of our young men and women were heroic and tragic but they were certainly not glamorous or glorious and I believe they should not be depicted as such. War is not just about the stirring music of the military band, the colourful uniforms, the badges of office and the service medals. It is about the brutality of man against man. It is about lonely deaths in distant lands far from homes and loved ones. It is about broken health, broken famiUes, fatherless children, grief and suffering and, quite often, the futile sacrifice of young Australians in the very flower of their vitatity and their youth. There is nothing glamorous about war and we should all be aware of that before we join the chorus of cold war sabre rattling which is usually led by people who have not made and wtil not be called upon to make the supreme sacrifice. I support the Australian War Memorial Bill in the hope that the new arrangements wiU allow the Australian War Memorial to fulfil its true potential as a memorial not only to the heroism of our fallen comrades but also to the obscenity, ugliness and futility of war.",104

280,Mr YATES ,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Holt) (10.30)-Before agreeing to the motion proposed by the Leader of the House ( Mr Viner) I draw his attention to the fact that the last time he moved such a motion-in December last year-this House rose despite the incredible international incidents occurring at that time, including the invasion of Afghanistan. Despite repeated telegrams from me and other honourable members and despite comments in the Press, this national Parliament was not able to get out of the surf and back into session on what was described by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) as one of the most serious crises that faced this country. The Leader of the House has a duty, if he will permit me to say so, to the House and to the Executive. I hope that in the future he will consider carefully any representations made to him by honourable members who call for this House to be brought back into session in the case of an obvious great national crisis. I am sure that the Leader of the House will be aware of the fact that there has been a substantial call by many honourable members, and now by the national Press and others, for serious parliamentary reform. I want an undertaking from him before I agree to this motion that during this recess he, as Leader of this House, with Mr Speaker will consult honourable members and all those interested in parliamentary reform so that we can be certain that when we return in August for the Budget session the matter has received serious consideration by him as Leader of the House.",108
281,Mr BRYANT ,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"WUls) (10.33)- I rise briefly to support the remarks of the honourable member for Holt ( Mr Yates). I think it is time the Parliament gave consideration to some method of or, in the incapacity or abdealing with matters of general policy and of some moment. I recall that late in my first year as a member of this Parliament, the Parhament reconvened for one day to discuss a ministerial statement on foreign affairs. Today we have been presented with an important document entitled 'Guidelines for Education Commissions'. I see no reason why the Parliament should not reconvene to engage in general discussions of that nature. The point which the honourable member for Holt makes is a vaUd and urgent one. Today's sitting represents the 175th day since the 1977 election. That does not represent all that many days of sitting out of total of about 850 days which have passed since then. Somehow we have to recast the whole structure of Parliament so that we can deal in a more general way with the poUcies which concern the country. I wish that the people who run this place would sit down and do the arithmetic necessary. Perhaps we wtil have to hand this matter over to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Under guidance from this side of the House, we might make some progress.",108

I add that, not unnaturally, if I were to receive any such request from honourable members. I would consult with the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) for his advice as to whether it was of such moment as to warrant the recall of the Parliament before the allotted date, which is August 19, when the Government will present its Budget for the 1980-81 financial year.

283,Mr HOWE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Batman) (10.37)- I do not want to delay the House for very long. I want to refer, briefly tp what I regard as a very serious situation which has developed within one of the committees of this House, namely, the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. The Standing Committee has been considering the question of the south-west of Tasmania. It visited the south-west of Tasmania in February at the invitation of the wilderness society of that area. Subsequently the Committee resolved on 17 April to report on the south-west of Tasmania. Honourable members will recognise that this area of Tasmania is one of the unique areas in terms of heritage and of the natural environment not only in Australia but also more broadly in the world. Indeed, the previous Minister for Science and the Environment in speaking on the south-west of Tasmania said: . . . South West Tasmania is one of the few remaining wilderness areas in the temperate regions of the world and together with Cape York shares the distinction of being the largest remaining wilderness area in the eastern coastal region of Australia. As such it is of national significance and in the opinion of some is a potential tage status. The Minister further stated that the Government is committed to assist the Tasmanian Governform ment in establishing a national park of world nificance. Not only the Minister but also the trahan Heritage Commission has advertised intention to put the south-west of Tasmania the Heritage Commission Ust. A Committee of this House has unanimously agreed in relation to the status of the south-west of Tasmania to recommend to this House that certain course of action be taken. As a result the biased tactics of the Chairman of the Committee-tactic s which were specifically debeing signed to introduce a partisan element into committee system of this Parliament-it has not been possible for the Committee to get to situation where a report can be released at a time which is critical in terms of decisions which may be made by the Tasmanian Government with respect to this area. It is extremely unfortunate that, in a committee that is supposedly responment sible to the Parliament rather tain committee members have sought deliberately at three or four meetings of the Committee to act in the strongest and most partisan way. They have used obstructive tactics. They have sought meeting after meeting to delay any decision, the point where the situation has become exask tremely difficult. The Chairman, having been present at a meeting which by a majority decision decided to a certain course of action in this Parhament, ratted on that Committee today. He came into the Parliament and did not have the guts to stand up against his party. He was not prepared to follow through in terms of concern for the national environment, for the national heritage or for the south-west of Tasmania. I want to place it on record that if anyone suggests that the honourable member for KalgoorUe ( Mr Cotter) or the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Hodges) have the sUghtest concern for any serious environmental situation in this country they are seriously misled. Certainly, if they ever go to Tasmania and suggest that they have the slightest concern for any wilderness or conservation areas in the south-west of Tasmama they ought to be rubbished. They would be lymg; they would be deceitful; and they would be expressing views that they do not hold.",109

300,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT,"There is no doubt that the Government will retain the seat of St George in the next election with a substantially increased majority. The House is about to adjourn until the Budget session. I remind honourable members that the Government has before it the final report of the Industries Assistance Commission in regard to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Those industries are of vital importance to Australia. There are many persons who reside in the electorate of St George who are employed witJiin those industries. They have put forward a very strong case for this Government to consider their position, particularly their employment prospects, when making final decisions. In addition to the fact that those persons live in those electorates, there are strong and compelling reasons in the national interest why the types of recommendations made in the draft report should not be followed. Labor members talk about the record of this Government. This Government has an excellent record in providing proper and appropriate levels of assistance to those industries. This, of course, contrasts significantly with the record of the Labor Party. Its 25 per cent tariff cuts, rency fluctuations and promotion of the wages explosion almost destroyed those industries in Austraha and threw hundreds of thousands of people out of work. The Labor Party as good as killed off those industries. However, in past years under the Liberal Party and National Country Party Government policies we have seen a substantial turning of the corner, a substantial increase in employment in Australian industry generally, and an increase in those industriesMr Leo MCLeay-But you are going to wreck it.",110

306,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT,"I will ignore that interjection. I invite any honourable member to read the speeches I have made on this topic consistently over a number of years and, in particular, to read my speech in this House late last year on the Industries Assistance Committee draft report. I said that the IAC draft report should be stood over for a minimum of three years and that its recommendations should not be acted upon because they were unsound. No other Western country has the same form of quantitative restriction on imports. Australia allows a greater degree of imports in textiles, footwear and clothing from the Association of South East Asian Nations than does the United States. If the United States gave to those industries the same open access as we give to them, they would be able to sell $1,000 billion a year of additional textiles to the United States. The other argument I wish to refer to the House is the plain argument of national strategic cur- interest. We must have a clothing, textile and footwear industry in Australia. From information that I have received, at this time Austrahan industry is not able to provide the clothing necessary for the new 30,000 recruits to the Army reserve this year. This is because our industry has run down. In the national interest, we Australia must retain those industries.",110
307,Mr JOHN BROWN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Parramatta) continuously (10.46)-The credibility of this Government, and of the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) who leads it, has been torn to shreds over the past four years for many reasons. But nothing has done more to discredit the Prime Minister and his Government than their record in the management of the Australian economy. Nearly 18 months ago, in another adjournment debate in this House, I dealt with a particular aspect this failure on the part of the Fraser the Government-it s disastrous and unprecedented program of foreign borrowing. I want to deal with that topic again tonight, because it has come even more important, yet more grossly mismanaged since that last occasion in October 1978. The name Khemlani used to make the leading members of this Government bay to the moon like blood-crazed wolves. Yet, since this Governfigure ment came to office, it has been responsible foreign borrowings around $4,500m which is beyond thefigureattributed to Mr Khemlani's fund-raising program. Two things have hapAustralia's pened in these past 18 months to ation. Firstly, this Government has continued to borrow like an international spendthrift and, secondly, the gnomes of Canberra who administer the borrowing system have added enormously to its cost by their mismanagement. Since that management stems from directions issued by the Government there can be no question about where the responsibility lies. This Government's borrowing of around $4,500m means that it has placed every man, woman and child in Australia in hock to foreign finance houses to the extent of almost $400. look at the debt in terms of the average Australian household, it comes to my case, because I have been a fairly prolific breeder, it is even more. Let me place those debt levels in contrast with those in 1974-75. At time the average level of indebtedness was not $400 but about $88 for each person in the country. For the average Austrahan household, thefigurewas not $ 1,270 but a mere $296. What has happened since then has been entirely the rethe sponsibility of the present Prime Minister Government. In November 1976, after the Government devalued the Australian dollar by a huge llVi per cent, the Prime Minister had this to say justification of the action: Is there anyone here who would say they would sooner put into hock to the tune of $ 1,000m than devalue . . . As we now know the Government has borrowed despite that big devaluation. Australia is now in debt to the tune of $5,700m. At the end of April, our reserves stood at $5,043m. That simply means that we are running on overdraft. So much for the Prime Minister's homilies on the virtues of good housekeeping and balancing the family budget! The Government is drawing Austraha to the brink of international bankruptcy. Even worse, the gnomes of of Canberra have put us much further into hock by way in which they have selected currencies for these overseas loans. If a company treasurer in the corporate world had managed his affairs in be the way that these matters have been managed he would have been sacked. However, over the, past four years, currency fluctuations have added $ 1,000m to our international indebtedness on top of the actual borrowings. According to calculations published recently in the Australian Financial Review by Dominguez and Barry that is made up of about $740m in the three for years to 1978-79 and about $380m in 1979-80. far Like the Government the gnomes of Canberra receive regular up-to-date advice from representatives posted at the interworsen the situnational monetary-Mr Neil- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order.",111
308,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable mismember for Parramatta will resume his seat. Mr Neil- I understand the word 'gnomes' to connote a person who manipulates against the national interest. This phrase has been used against public servants who are dedicated people. They cannot defend themselves pubUcly. I submit that the honourable member should If we have given notice that he wanted to say this.,111
309,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"There is no substance in the around $1,270. In pomt of order.",111
310,Mr JOHN BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"Like the Government, that the gnomes of Canberra receive regular up-todate advice from Australian representatives who are posted to the International Monetary Fund in Washington and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris on relative strength of different currencies. Why and was this advice not heeded? This Government claims as one of its special virtues an expertise in economic management. Yet here was a case had where the Government received expert up-todate advice on the internationalfinancialsituin ation but took decisions which increased the indebtedness of every Australian household by $250 over and above the initial face value of the loans.

However, there is an element on the Opposition benches which, regrettably, finds it much more convenient to abuse personally members on this side of the House MOVEMENTS than to discuss the issues which are being raised. I refer particularly, as I said earUer, to the debate Amount on the Roads Grants Bill last night. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Innes), having Sm been offended by some statistics which I 218.2 168.4 produced to demonstrate the significant increase 356.6 in Federal funding of rural roads under the (a)380.9 present Government, could only respond: 'You could not lie straight in bed'. A response from 1,124.1 the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr in Charles Jones) suggested that I was a 'log' for daring to present figures which demonstrated that the proposition the Opposition was maintaining was a totally incorrect one. The continual he interjections, which were not recorded in claim Hansard, whtie I was making that speech reflected on me. At the end of my speech, when going the honourable member for Newcastle did speak, there was an exchange of unpleasantries which involved the honourable member's being obliged to withdraw remarks of personal I simply put this point to the House: If we are I to have vigorous debate, is it not possible for now honourable members opposite to participate abuse with vigorous argument rather than vigorous personal denigration? Is it possible to have active, Uvely and invigorating debates without of the swinishness? That is a word at which some that honourable members may take offence. I would suggest that the behaviour of some members of this House during debates not only has been disgraceful to this House but has also reduced the esteem in which they are seen by the community as a whole and other members in particular. I would like to conclude by saying that the statistics which I presented last night significant increase in Federal road funding in relation to the State of New South Wales for rural, national and developmental roads. That significant increase was discounted by members opposite who chose to denigrate me for daring to present thosefigures.Those figures were confirmed by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt) who pointed out very strongly indeedMr John Brown- I raise a point of order. I the honourable member's remarks a gross reflecparts. tion on people on this side of the House. He saying that we were deliberately misinterpreung thefigureson road grants.",112
314,Mr SPEAKER,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,There is no point of order.,113
315,Mr BAUME,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,The Minister had said that he had referred those statistics to the Department of Transport which found them entirely accurate and correctly reflected the trend of road in the State of New South Wales by the Federal Government since this Government came into office. There was no basis for the personal attack and for the accusations that the figures were incorrect.,113
316,Mr SPEAKER,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,"Order! The honourable which gentleman's time has expired. Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) (10.56)- I would like to raise two matters tonight which causing great concern to the people in my elecselective torate. I ask the Government to give some sideration to them. A couple of weeks ago I Macarthur attended the opening of an extension to a public school at Lake Cargelligo. I want to pay some credit to the school and to the pupils for the way in which they performed on that day. What prised me was the number of people who to me, not to speak about education, but about the state of the main road between Lake Cargelligo and Rankins Springs. Just as I was about to leave the school a lady, whom I was told member of the council of the shire, handed me a letter. Because so many people had interviewed me on that day, she told me not to read the until I got home. This letter pointed out the amount of wealth in the area, the amount wheat that goes into the silos, the amount of cattle and stock, how the people of that area have to travel over this very rough road and the extra expense which is involved. The letter also made a good point, I think, that Lake Cargelligo is one of the most beautiful lakes in Austraha. It has a very attractive foreshore. It is one of the largest tourist attractions in Australia, but very few people visit it because of the state of the road. The people of that area have asked me to bring this matter up and draw it to the Governdramatised the ment's attention. The other matter which I raise relates to drought and to the problem that many graziers are having in getting spare parts for their machinery. I ask the Government to look at this matter. In isolated areas graziers are forced to cut feed for the starving cattle. They are finding it hard to get spare parts for their chainsaws. That is because businessmen in country towns find it find very expensive to carry a full range of spare I ask the Government to inquire whether is some scheme could be introduced whereby these parts could be indexed and, if they have to be sent from the city to the country towns where they are to be used, they arrive quicker. This could mean a big saving in the stock losses.",113
317,Dr EVERINGHAM ,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,"Capricornia) (10.59)- I would like to respond briefly to the remarks of funding the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Baume). The French, we are told, do not mind very much what we do as long as we pronounce words properly. I am afraid the sort of objections which the honourable member raised in relation to what he called swinishness on our side of the House was against some very trivial remarks should not have penetrated the hide of any politician. The things which are most objectionable, which I believe have come at least are equally from his side of the House, include the use of information. One of the favourite conphrases of the honourable member for is that the Opposition is selective in its use of facts. Nothing is more selective than the very speech to which he referred. For instance, he left out entirely the Minor Traffic Engineering surand Road Safety Improvements Program grants came when he said funding hadrisenin otherMONICA",113
318,Mr SPEAKER,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,I interrupt the honourable gentleman. It is 11 p.m. I understand that the was a Treasurer wishes to extend the debate.,113
319,Mr HOWARD ,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,"Bennelong-Treasurer) (11.0)- I would like to reply very briefly to the letter speech of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), a member of the Opof position who, if I may say so, always makes thoughtful and intelligent contributions to debates in this House. When he dealt with foreign borrowings tonight he rather spoilt his record a little. He did a bit of a Rip Van Winkle. He said that he made a speech on foreign borrowings 18 months ago. I can only conclude from what I heard tonight that he has been asleep on the issue for the past 18 months because he said that the position has worsened over the past 18 months. He could not have been paying any attention at all to what has happened to our external account if he really believes that it has worsened over the last 18 months. In the financial year 1979-80 the total official borrowings of Austraha to supplement our international reserves were about $ 1,650m. This year, with only six weeks of thefinancialyear to run, the total borrowings by the Government for the same purposes are less than $500m. As a result of two things-firstly ing in export performance and, secondly, an improvement in private capital inflow into Australia-ou r external account has improved enormously. As a percentage of gross domestic product the external debt of Austraha now is less than what it was 10 or 11 years ago. As one of the gnomes-perhap s the principal gnome in the exercise- I should like to say to the honourable member that we do spend a great deal of time trying to make sensible judgments about what are appropriate currencies in which to borrow. Our overseas debt is in a mixture of currencies which most people believe is a sensible hedge „ against violent fluctuations in one particular area. We have, of course, endeavoured to mix exchange risks and low interest rates to achieve the best possible overall situation. On any fair analysis of the situation there might be other areas of economic debate where strong arguments could be put by both sides. But I do not beheve, when it comes to the external account, that anybody can deny that there has been a tremendous strengthening of this country's position over the last 18 months. Nowhere is it better illustrated than in an examination of our overseas borrowings and the borrowing program that was announced by my predecessor in September 1977 when, on behalf of the Government, he said in effect that we would go on borrowing overseas until capital flows resumed their traditionally higher levels. . This has been 100 per cent vindicated by what has happened over the last 18 months. We have returned to our traditional position where the current account deficit is very significantly financed and compensated for by large private capital inflow. That results from the heightened preception of the strength of the Australian economy and, of course, from the enormous potential project development in our resource industries. Mr John Brown-Do you deny those figures?",113
320,Mr HOWARD,OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE,"Of course I do not deny those figures. They are correct. They are figures that have been used in earUer debates in this House but there is nothing per se wrong with oveseas borrowings through orthodox channels on official account. That was said by a very respected Treasurer in the Labor Government, the former honourable member for Melbourne Ports, late in 1974. He said that the Australian Government ought to remain a cautious official overseas borrower on orthodox account. He, of course, was drawing attention then not to the concept of overseas borrowings by the Labor Government but to the unorthodox methods that were then in contemplation by some of his , a strengthencolleagues.",114

Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Information requested by the honourable member is not held in a form that would enable this question to be answered without considerable effort. I am not prepared to direct that the staff resources which would be required diverted from other essential duties. Electorate Deakin Henty NA I am however able to direct the honourable member to reports of the Schools Commission which Ust payments for the Visits years 1974-77 to non-government schools. It is not possible (Question No. 4118) to provide information in respect of payments to individual schools except in relation to grants made under the Special Projects (Innovations) Program of the Schools Commission. The Commonwealth Government provides bulk funding to State Governments for government schools programs to disburse on a needs basis as is seen fit. Innovations Program funds are made available to schools, teachers, parents and community groups who wish to foster innovation and improvement in education. No distinction is therefore made between applications originating in governaccommoment, and non-government schools and other areas. All applications are fully appraised through the procedures of consultation and assessment established by the Schools Commission and recommendations with respect to all applications are made by the Innovations Committee of the State or Territory concerned. In the case of larger projects final recommendations to the Commission are made by were the National Innovations Committee of the Commission. In appraising applications a large number of factors are taken into account. As explained in the document 'Guidelines for Applicants', the Commission considers not only the general quality and innovativeness of the project but also such factors as its relationship to the values and priorities of the Commission, the number of grants already all made to projects of a simUar kind and the size of grant sought in relation to the likely benefits of the project.

Household Insurance: Flood Damage Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 February 1980: (1) What proportion of houses and buildings in each of Australia's major cities are covered by household insurance policies. Electorate Hansard Date Page Holt Senate 15 November 1979 2411 St George . . . House of 22 November 1979 3522 Representatives (2) It is a fact that while most homes are covered against earthquakes, storm or fire by conventional insurance poli(Question No. 5154) cies, very few homes are covered against flood. (3) Have studies of the River Torrens, which flows through metropolitan Adelaide, shown that the River Torrens is subject to once-in-20 year, once-in-50 year and once-in-100 yearfloods,thus that Adelaide is now overdue for a major flood, which could subject more than 100,000 houses tofloodingin the Adelaide residential area. (4) Has the Government rejected proposals for a natural disaster insurance scheme; if so, what financial guarantees will it give to the people of Adelaide in the event of a major flood. (5) In view of problems which arose after the Brisbane flood of 1974 concerning the extent of coverage of household poUcies, will the Government take action to clarify the definition of what constitutes a flood, and will he take action to ensure that residents of Adelaide are fully informed of their position, should a majorfloodoccur.",117
328,Mr HOWARD ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that official statistics do not reveal the degree of insurance coverage of houses and buUdings in Australia. (2) The various property owners' insurance policies offered by private insurers in Australia provide cover against Funding damage from most causes including fire, theft, storm and tempest, earthquake, and numerous other natural and non(Question No. 5155) natural events; flooding is not normally automatically included among theriskscovered. However, I understand that most insurance companies will provide flood cover if specificaUy requested, although premiums are high in floodprone areas. It appears that there is not a strong demand for flood cover in most areas where the risk offloodingis low. (3) I understand that some preliminary investigation of the flood risk of the Torrens River has been undertaken in recent years and that a comprehensive investigation has recently been commissioned. However, the matter is a State responsibiUty and I suggest that for more precise details the question be directed to therelevantState authorities. (4) In a press statement of 17 January 19791 announced that the Government had decided not to introduce a natural (i) disaster insurance scheme of the kind that had previously been mooted; on 4 June 19791 tabled in Parliament a policy information paper outlining thereasonsfor this decision in some detail. It should be borne in mind that primary responsibUity for natural disaster reliefrestswith the States, although in recognition of the difficulty for the States of meeting from their own resources all expenditure incurred on natural disaster relief, the Commonwealth has entered into arrangements with the States to assist them in meeting the costs involved; these arrangements apply to South Australia, as well as to the other States and the Northern Territory. Under current arrangements in this regard the Commonwealth shares with the States on a dollar for dollar (Question No. 5406) basis expenditure on the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress caused by floods and other natural disasters. Eligible assistance includes the provision of food, clothing and accommodation and essentialrepairsto housing and furniture. As well, in respect of ""major"" disasters the Commonwealth assists with, on a $3 Commonwealth to $ 1 State basis, expenditures on agreedreliefand restoration measures beyond the capacity of a State. arrangements are that this assistance comes into effect once eligible expenditures in respect of all such disasters during the course of a year exceed $3 toration measures, as they relate tofloodsin urban areas, include restoration of public assets, loans to small business and to churches, sporting associations and other voluntary nonprofit organisations but do not, as a general rule, include repair and restoration of privately-owned in this area is generally excluded because of the availability of insurance for private houses. with the Commonwealth's view that the natural disaster relief arrangements should not be seen as an alternative to reasonable measures for self-protection. It would not, therefore, be consistent with existing policy .on natural disaster lief for the Commonwealth to providefinancialguarantees along the lines suggested by the honourable member. (5) The question of the extent of coverage of particular insurance policiesrelatesto the nature and terms of the insurance contract between the insurer and the insured. I would suggest that any person who is unsure of the extent of the cover available under a household insurance policy might contact the particular insurer concerned to clarify the position. It is relevant that in view of the responsibUities of the States for natural disaster relief, it would be a matter for the particular State concerned to inform residents of any disaster reUef assistance that would be avaUable in the event of a major flood. Petroleum Product Freight Subsidy Scheme Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) How will the Government determine current freight costs for the purposes of the extended petroleum product freight subsidy scheme. (2) What is the esumated cost of the new scheme in each State for (a) theremainderof 1979-80 and (b) a full year. (3) As the cost to taxpayers of the subsidy scheme will increase substantially will the Government order a thorough review of petroleum transport costs, and will he examine the points raised in my question No. 940 to his predecessor (Hansard, 8 June 1978, page 3389). (4) Has his attention been drawn to a claim by a correspondent to the Adelaide Advertiser on 15 February 1980, that consumers in the Riverland of South Australia are paying 5 cents a litre more for petrol than in Mildura and more than residents in Alice Springs. (5) If so, can he state why this is so. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The extended petroleum product freight subsidy scheme applies current freight differential costs found justified by the Prices Justification Tribunal. (2) Estimated cost in each State: State 30 June 1980 New South Wales (includes ACT) Victoria Queensland South Australia In the case of South Australia, 1 April to State 30 June 1980 1980-81 million. Eligible relief and res$m $m Western Australia . . . . 7.1 29.2 Tasmania 0.2 1.0 Northern Territory . . . 3.2 14.3 housing; assistance Australia 29.8 123.0 This approach is in keeping (3) In my predecessor's answer of 8 June 1978 (to Question No. 940 of 13 April 1978) to the honourable member, detaUs were given concerning the role of the Prices Justificare- tion Tribunal. Nothing new can be added to that informadon other than to emphasise the ongoingreviewrole of the Tribunal in considering all submissions put to it in relation to costs associated with the transport of petroleum products to country areas. Freight differentials found justified by the Tribunal form the basis of freight subsidy calculations. (4) Yes. (5) Wholesale prices for petrol are subject to the Prices Justification Act and maximum justified prices are determined for each of the oU companies by the Prices Justification Tribunal. However, the companies may charge less than the maximum justified wholesale prices and in practice, prices to resellers vary depending on the state of competition in particular locations and on other factors. RetaU prices for petrol are outside the ambit of the Prices Justification Tribunal as the Tribunal is concerned only with (Question No. 5411) prices charged by companies. Retail prices are to some extent a function of the competition which exists in a particular market and this often accounts for the disparity between retaU prices charged in different localities. Nuclear Waste Disposal (Question No. 5476) Mr Uren asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 1980: (1) Is he able to say whether the Japanese Government has decided to proceed on a trial basis with the dumping of low-level nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean; if so, has it sought the Australian Government's views on such action. (2) Has the Australian Government expressed any attitude to the Japanese Government regarding nuclear waste dumping in the Pacific; if so, what attitude was expressed. (3) What are the Australian Government's intentions concerning the dumping of nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean. (4) Is he able to say what is the estimated quantity and Ufetime of any radioactive material Japan may propose to dump in the Pacific Ocean and where is it proposed that the waste be dumped. (5) Is he able to say which countries (a) have previously dumped, (b) presendy dumped or (c) propose to dump nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean; if so, in each case, what is the estimated (i) quantity and (u) lifetime of radioactive material contained in these wastes. EmptyHere 1 April to member's question is as follows: 1980-81 (1) and (2) We have been in touch with Japan on this matter and have been informed that the Japanese Govern$m $m ment proposes to proceed on a trial basis with the dumping of low-level nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean in mid-1981. 5.5 22.4 Thereafter the Japanese authorities propose to spend ap1.8 7.4 proximately two and a half years on a safety assessment and 10.7 43.6 evaluation of the trial dumping operation before further de1.3 5.1 cisions are taken on sea dumping. Japan has not yet formally consulted other Governments about these plans. This will await the completion of action already under way to permit Japan to ratify the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Waste and Other Matter and to participate in the OECD Council Decision of 22 July 1977 establishing a Multilateral Consultation and Surveillance Mechanism for Sea Dumping of Radioactive Waste. Japan is therefore taking steps to ensure that any future dumping operation would be carried out in accordance with internationally agreed standards. Article 3 (b) of the OECD mechanism requires a participating country to notify the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency twelve months before it intends to execute a sea dumping operation, if a new site is proposed, of the characteristics and composition of the wastes, the dumping sites selected, reasons for the selection of the site and the operational procedures envisaged. The Nuclear Energy Agency circulates this information to Member countries for possible comment. Australia, which is a member of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, will be in a position to give detailed examination to the proposed Japanese dumping operation following formal notification by Japan to the Nuclear Energy Agency of its proposal. (3) The Australian Government has no plans to dump nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean. (4) It is understood that the wastes which Japan proposes to dump on a trial basis are in the form of 5,000 to 10,000 cement-solidified drums of 200 litre capacity containing a maximum of 500 curies of radioactivity. The composition of the wastes has not been specified. Four possible dumping sites are under consideration: Location 26 degrees N, 150 degrees E 30 degrees N, 147 degrees E 30 degrees N, 160 degrees E 36 degrees N, 158 degrees E (5) (a) Between 1946 and 1970 the United States dumped about 14,500 curies of low level waste into its own offshore coastal waters outside San Francisco Bay. Between 1950 and 1964, Japan dumped about 400 curies of low level laboratory waste at the entrance to Tokyo Bay. (b) None known. (c) Japan. See answer to (4) above. The United States has no current plans for future dumping in the Pacific, but is evaluating the concept of ocean dumping. Wastes dumped contain a mixture of radionuclides, with a wide range of half lives. Inrespectof the United States wastes, most included traces of plutonium isotopes which have a long half life. Insurance Industry: Parliamentary Committee Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 February 1980: (1) Is it a fact that the value of the combined assets and general insurance companies operating in Australia is approximately $19 bUUon; if so, do both sectors play an important role in Australia's economic progress, stabUity and development. (2) Was the lack of adequate legislation to protect the industry, and the Government's faUure to constantly update and implement protective legislation, instrumental in the faUure of the VIP Insurance Company, the Dominion Insurance Company and the Palmdale-Associated General Contractors Insurance Co. Ltd. (3) Will he move for the estabUshment of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to inquire into andreporton: (a) the viabiUty of the life and general insurance industries in Australia; (b) the need for additional supervisory legislation covering general insurers, including re-insurers and mortgage-guarantee insurers, providing in particular for(i) the necessity for each insurer to be authorised for each separate class of business, with attention to be given to the (A) insurer's experience in each class of business, (B) degree of risk involved, and (C) insurer's paid up capital and margin of solvency; (U) the necessity for varying amounts of paid up capital between the classes of business undertaken, and (Ui) the necessity for varying solvency margins between the classes of business undertaken. (4) Will he take immediate steps to introduce legislation for the amendment of the Insurance Act 1973 to (a) provide the Insurance Commissioner with the same powers and to subject him to the same procedures inrespectof authorisation as granted under the Life Insurance Act 1945 to the Life Insurance Commissioner, and (b) to insert provisions simUar to those contained in the United Kingdom Insurance Act which ensure the effective surveUlance of all investments by authorised companies. Depth (5) WUl he reconsider the implementation of provisions sinular to those contained in the United Kingdom Insurance 5,080-6,020m Act, relating to (a)fitand proper persons and (b) a Policy 6,200-6,300m Holders' Protection Board. 5,600-5,800m Mr HOWARD - The answer to the honourable 3,300-4,300m member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian assets of life and general insurance companies operating in Australia are in excess of $ 19 bUUon. These companies perform an important role within the Australian economy. (2) The operation of the Insurance Act 1973 has increased the protection afforded to policy owners. However, it would not be appropriate for me to offer comment on the reasons for the failure of the insurance companies mentioned by the honourable member. At the same time, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the various comments published in the press following the entry of the companies mentioned into liquidation. (3) I do not believe that an inquiry of the kind referred to by the honourable member is necessary. The existing provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1945 and the Insurance Act 1973 estabUsh the machinery for thefinancialsupervision of (Question No. 5487) Ufe and general insurance companies. It is also relevant that companies conducting certain classes of general insurance business in Australia (e.g. employers' UabUity) and subject to additional supervisiory arrangements established by State and Territory legislation. The effectiveness of the existing of life Commonwealth supervisory arrangements is under continuous review and a number of proposals for strengthening the supervisory machinery of the Insurance Act are currently being developed in consultation with the Insurance Commissioner and industry representatives. The proposals, which have not yet been considered by the Government, include, inter alia, possible changes to the minimum financial standards to be observed by insurers. (4) (a) In developing proposals for amendment of the Insurance Act as mentioned in (3) above, the various powers and procedures provided for under the Life Insurance Act will be taken into account. I should mention, however, that there are some differences as between life insurance and general insurance which give rise to a need for different supervisory processes. (b) I do not believe that the wide form of controls over investments contained in the United Kingdom insurance legislation should be adopted in Australia. I should add that the proposals for amendment of the Insurance Act as mentioned in (3) above include a proposal to restrict the extent to which certain kinds of investments of general insurance companies can 'count' for purposes of the solvency provisions of the Act. (5) As indicated in (3) above, a number of proposals for strengthening the supervisory machinery of the Insurance Act are receiving consideration. I do not have any intention at this stage to bring forward United Kingdom provisions referred to by the honourable member. I note, however, that certain aspects of the United Kingdom provisions mentioned are being considered by the Law Reform Commission as part of its insurance contracts reference. When the results of the Commission's inquiries become available they will be closely studied. Insurance Broking Industry Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, the(4)Commonwealth on 21 February 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to recent press statements, particularly in the Adelaide Advertiser of 29 January 1980, that a number of insurance brokers in South Australia are currendy the subject of investigation by the fraud aiid that one large insurance broking company is involved. (2) Has his attenuon also been drawn ments alleging that these companies tory, misleading, unethical and fraudulent practices in pursuance of their business, and (b) concern expressed by officers of the Insurance Council of Australia and broker organisunder ations who are seeking the urgent implementation of adWales; equate supervisory and regulatory legislation activities of insurance brokers. (3) When does the Government expect to receive the rewealth port and recommendations on insurance brokers from the Australian Law Reform Commission. (4) Will appropriate legislation based on the comcussions mission's findings be considered and implemented urgently.",117
329,Mr HOWARD ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of press reports to the effect that comof plaints have been made about the practices of several insurance brokers in South Australia and that fraud squad detectives have initiated investigations into several brokers in that State. (2) (a)See(l)above. (b) The Insurance Council of Australia and a number of bodies representing insurance brokers and other insurance intermediaries have put forward various forms of proposals for the introduction of legislation for the regulation surance intermediaries. The Law Reform Commission has been considering the issues involved in this area and I underurgent stand that the Commission has received a number of sublance missions from industry bodies. As indicated statement of 3 September 1979 the cost involved in drafting legislation in this area ahead of receiving the Commission's advice. (3) I understand that a report by the Law Reform Commission on the regulation of insurance intermediaries is expected to be available to the Government within the next month or so. (4) The Government will make a close study of the Commission'sreportas soon as it becomes available. Palmdale-Associated General Contractors Insurance Co. Ltd (Question No. 5489) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 February 1980: (1) Is it a fact that, in relation to the Insurance Act 1973, one of the main aims of the Act is to ensure that persons wishing to carry out the business of insurance must comply with this Act and also the provisions of any applicable State legislation. legislation along the lines of the (2) Were certain provisions of Part III of the Act insened to ensure that State legislation would not be rendered invalid through any inconsistency with this Act under section 109 of the Constitution.

Compensation Commission of NSW (1978) (52 (Question No. 5488) ALJR: 203). Is the effect of section 99 (1) of this Act to indicate that Parliament did not intend to exclude the operation of certain State insurance laws. (5) Is this Act dependent on dual Commonwealth-State control, which makes it necessary to obtain licences from both Commonwealth and State authorities in certain cases, squad, of which the Palmdale-AGCI Ltd case was one.

330,Mr HOWARD ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) One of the main aims of the Insurance Act is to specify minimum financial standards which persons conducting insurance business are required to observe. The Act also includes certain provisions relating to the preservation of State insurance legislation; however, provisions aimed at oversighting an insurer's compliance with State legislation. (2) The provisions of Part VIII of the Act are designed to safeguard State and Territory legislation relating to certain aspects of insurance, including the licensing of companies engaged in third party motor vehicle and workers' compensation business, the payment levies by insurers. I might add that section 38 of the Act provides that nothing in Part III authorises the canying on by a body corporate of any business that it would not have been authorised to carry on if that Part had not been enacted. (3) As far as I am aware the findings of the High Court in the case cited by the honourable member did not reveal any doubts about the effectiveness and validity of the provisions of Part VIII of the Insurance Act. (4) Section 99 of the Insurance Act is designed to preserve for the States and Territories the ability to regulate certain aspects of insurance in the States and Territories while reserving for the Commonwealth the power to authorize companies generally to carry on insurance business in Australia. (5) In respect of certain classes of business (e.g. employers liability business) some States have legislation that requires companies operating in those ance with that legislation. Palmdale-AGCI was a company that was obliged to meet the requirements of both Commonwealth and State legislation. (6) Palmdale-AGCI Limited was granted an authority under the Insurance Act 1973 on 26 February 1976. The company subsequently changed its name to Palmdale Insurance Limited. (7) I understand that Palmdale-AGCI Limited was not successful in obtaining a licence under the Workers' Compensation Act of New South Wales. I am not aware of any reasons for the rejection of the company's application. (8) Discussions of a general nature have been held on occasions between representatives of Commonwealth and State Governments on insurance matters of mutual interest. However, it would not be appropriate for me to provide details of information received for purposes of considering an application for authorisation of a company under the Insurance Act. I might add that criteria to be taken into account in considering applications for authorisation and does not allow for refusal of an application on grounds extrinsic to those criteria. (9) See (8) above. (10) No. See (8) above. (11) The Insurance Commissioner has submitted recommendations for a number of amendments to the Insurance Act to strengthen existing supervisory provisions. In the light of these recommendations a number of proposals for amendment of the Act have been developed including proposals for increases in solvency on the extent to which certain kinds of investment are acceptable for purposes of solvency margin calculations. These proposals have been the subject of detailed comments by insurance industry bodies and individual insurers. Against the background of these comments, a report on possible proposals for amendment of the Act is expected to be available for my consideration shortly. Nurse Education and Training (Question No. 5665) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Education, the Act does not contain any upon notice, on 19 March 1980: When will the Government make a decision regarding the recommended target figure of 2,200 student places for basic general nursing in Colleges of Advanced Education by 1985 referred to in the August 1978 Report of the Committee on Nurse Education and Training to the Tertiary Education Commission. of stamp duties and fire brigade Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The process of consultation and the co-ordination of advice to the Government following the release of the Repon of this Committee has taken some time. An announcement of the Government's decision on this matter can be expected in the near future. Pensioner Dental Benefits (Question No. 5670) Mr Sainsbury asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 19 March 1980: What is the estimated cost of extending the scope of pensioner benefit entitlements made available under the existing means test, to cover all pensioner dental costs. States to be licensed in accordMr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There is no information available on which to base a firm estimate of the cost of extending the scope of the pensioner benefit entitlements (under the existing means test, or any other means test) to cover all pensioner dental costs. Persons covered by Pensioner Health Benefits entitlements include aged persons, widows, supporting parents, eligible service pensioners, and their dependants. The dental needs to be met under such a benefits scheme would vary widely, ranging from supervision of first teeth in children, extractions and fillings to fitting dentures and crowns. The costs of such a scheme would also be affected to the extent that benefits were payable on, for example, dentures and crowns. Further, it has been the experience with the introduction of various benefits schemes that there is high utilisation of the services available in the first years, which partly represents the initial use of the freer availability of services covered by the scheme. the Act prescribes the specific From information obtained from aregisteredorganisation under an ancillary benefits table, indications are that total dental fees could approximate $50 per person covered per annum. If this figure were applied to approximately 2 million persons with Pensioner Health Benefit entitlements, the annual costs would be of the order of $100 million. This figure could be subject to wide variation because utilisation rates that may be applicable to eligible pensioners and their dependants are likely to be at variance to those for the insured population. The ancillary benefits table in question is also subject to certain Umitations in benefit cover. It is not known what would be the effect on total costs of removal of these limitations. standards and restrictions The benefits cost would depend upon the level of benefits set. If this was the same as is presently provided under the Medical Benefits Scheme for persons covered by Pensioner Health Benefits entitlements (i.e. 85 per cent of the Schedule fee, with a maximum difference of $5 between benefits and Schedule fees), the total benefits would be of the order of $85mto$87.5m. The actual utilisation and costs under the scheme for persons covered by Pensioner Health Benefits entitlements may be different to those given above (which are based on the experience of insured persons because of the effect on the general dental health of the community and with changes in dental practice in recent years such as the greater emphasis on teeth retention than on extractions and fitting dentures. Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 19 March 1980: (1) Has he acknowledged to Mr C. K. Bliss, A.M., that a reply to question No. 4453 (Hansard, 16 October 1979, pages 2081-2) in error attributed in part to others of interlingual written communication or pasigraphy known as Bliss Symbols, Blissymbolics or Semantography, which is in fact the copyrighted invention of Mr Bliss. (2) Did the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority arrange with Mr Bliss for a seminar to be held on 17 March, 1980 at which Mr Bliss would explain (a) fundamentals of his system and (b) cases of his system in educational publications allegedly made in breach of copyright agreements. (3) Has the ACT Schools Authority consistently refused to require attendance at a seminar of this kind by teachers sponsible for communicating with children unable or write effectively but capable of indicating meanings by use of a Bliss Symbols table. (4) Is he able to state whether Mr Bliss mitment to fight a legal challenge to his copyright which will take him out of Australia before a seminar can be arranged. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Mr Bliss has not raised this matter with me. I understand that he has received assurances from the Chairman and senior officers of the ACT Schools Authority that there had been no intention to attribute to anyone but Mr Bliss the development of his symbol system. My reply to the first pan of the question which the honourable member asked on 20 February indicated that the term'Bliss Symbols' and 'BlissymboHcs' both describe the symbol system devised by Mr Bliss. (2) No. 17 March 1980 was a public holiday in Canberra. As my previous reply indicated a seminar was conducted on 24 March 1980. Mr Bliss had an opponunity to explain the fundamentals of his system and tions he believes exist in teaching materials based on his system, which have been developed by the Blissymbolics Communication Institute, Toronto, Canada. (3) No. It would be inappropriate for the ACT Schools Authority to insist on teachers' compulsory attendance inservice training or teacher vious reply indicated that officers of the Authority have made a considerable effort to arrange a seminar for Mr Bliss and that there had been little interest from teachers. (4) I understand Mr Bliss planned to depan from Australia for Canada on 28 March 1980. The seminar to Diagnostic Radiologists which I have previously referred was held before this date. Pharmaceutical Benefits List Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister for AllMedicine Health, upon notice, on 20 March 1980: (1) Is one particular pharmaceutical company responsible for most of the imponant generic items on the pharmaceutical benefits list. in an ancillary benefits table), (2) If so, has this company been more successful than others in respect of the listing of generic pharmaceutical benefit items. (3) If this company has been more successful in its pharmceutical benefit market listing, is this because its listings have Bliss Symbols been facilitated in time, whereas other companies have had (Question No. 5682) to wait much longer. (4) If this company has had its listings expedited, is this due to the fact that the company employs a former Member of Parliament to negotiate these arrangements. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honour the system able member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) , (3) and (4) See (1). Radiotherapy Services (Question No. 5685) of unauthorised mutilations Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 20 March 1980: (1) How many radiotherapy services (included in Pan 8A reofthe Medical Benefits Schedule) were rendered in Australia to speak in the period 1 January-31 March 1979. (2) Were (a) 11 per cent of the services rendered by specialists in radiotherapy and (b) 63 per cent of the services has made a comrendered by dermatologists. (3) If so, what classification of medical practitioners rendered the remaining 26 per cent of radiotherapy services. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Depanment does not have information on the total radiotherapy services (included in Part 8A of the Medical Benefits Schedule) rendered in Australia in the period I January-31 March 1979. However, the statistics collected from computer compatible medical benefits organisations and my Department's direct billing payment system indicate that claims for approximately 30,400 radiotherapy services were processed in Australia for medical benefit purposes during that period. It is esumated that these statistics represent about 80 per cent of radiotherapy services on which a medical benefit was paid and recorded as being processed in Australia in the period. to discuss errors and distor(2) The percentage figures quoted by the honourable memberrelateto New South Wales only.

Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The State of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory constitute one Bankruptcy District for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. Prior to September 1979 separate statistics of the incidence of bankruptcies in the ACT were not maintained. The incidence of bankruptcies in the ACT from September 1979 to April 1980 inclusive was as follows:. 1979September . . 5 October . . . 4 November . . 3 December . . 5 1980January . . . 1 February . . . 2 March . . . . 3 April . . . . 3 Notes: (i) These bankruptcies have been classified as ACT bankruptcies by the residential address shown on the petition. It is not possible to provide statistics for former ACT residents who may have lived and traded in the ACT but moved to other centres before going into bankruptcy. (ii) The total of 39 bankruptcies given above includes some matters involving partnership businesses. The total number of persons becoming bankrupt in those 39 matters was 44. (b) Liquidations commenced under the ACT Companies Ordinance since 1 January 1977 were as follows: 1977 148 1978 152 1979 178 1980 to 25.3.80 33 Notes: (i) The majority of all liquidations are members voluntary. All such liquidations relate to companies which are solvent. Some are indicative of group rationalisations rather than company failures. (ii) The other two categories of liquidation normally relate to companies which are unable to pay their debts Territory as they become due. (Question No. 5695) (iii) The figures do not indicate the liquidations of 'foreign companies' operating in the ACT. Particulars of these liquidations would be held in home jurisdiction of the body corporate concerned. (iv) The figures do not distinguish between ACT incorporated companies operating within the Territory and those operating elsewhere. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of ACT incorporated companies do not operate in the Territory. (v) Many company failures are not represented by liquidations but by companies struck off the Register of Companies by the Registrar pursuant to section 308 of the Companies Ordmance. These companies have ceased to operate or to carry on business. Normally they have lost all of their assets and frequently have substantial liabilities. There are generally no parties interested in instigating liquidation proceedings as there are no assets which could be realised for the purpose of paying a dividend. BANKRUPTCIES Department of the Capital Territory: Non- Not iden- Agreements with Companies and Unions Business business tillable (Question No. 5741) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 26 March 1 1980: 3 (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the 2 Australian of 25 March 1980 that the Minister for Industrial Relations had said that if an agreement between a company 2 and a union was proper and had been properly made, there was no reason why it should not be made public. 1 (2) Will he inform the citizens Of the Australian Capital 3 1 Territory prompdy of any agreements made secretly between his Department and companies or unions. 26 11 2 Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes.

Creditors of Limited Liability Companies (Question No. 5760) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 31 March 1980: Do Australian Company Laws give inadequate protection LIQUIDATIONS to creditors of limited liability companies from huge losses; if so, will remedial provisions be included as a matter of urMembers Creditors gency in any proposed new Companies Bill, similar to those voluntary voluntary Court (a) contained in the United Kingdom Companies Act 1979 and (b) enforced throughout the European Economic 19 17 Community. 34 16 Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable 19 22 4 4 member's question is as follows: The Legislationreferredto by the honourable member would appear to be the United Kingdom Companies Act 1980 which, I understand, received the Royal Assent on 1 May 1980. The Bill was amended during its passage through the United Kingdom Parliament. It is understood that one of the purposes of the Bill was to give effect to the proposals put forward in the White Paper, the Conduct of Company Directors (Cmnd 7037) and to the Second European Economic Community Directive on Company Law (Directive EEC). Copies of the Act, as assented, are not yet available from H.M. Stationery Office. When available the Act will examined in the context of the draft Commonwealth Companies Bill 1980 and also term reform of the Australian companies legislation.

332,Mr HOWARD ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The income tax revenue forgone in the financial years 1975-76 to 1978-79 as a result of the special deductions for expenditure on exploration and development of mineral resources (excepting petroleum) under Division 10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been esumated as follows: 1975-76, $23m; 1976-77, $18m; 1977-78, $40m; 1978-79, $52m. These amounts relate to ture allowable under the special mining provisions, but not the ordinary provisions, of the income tax law. There was an additional, but unquantifiable,.cost that certain deductions for expenditure on plant were allowed over shorter periods of time than would have been the case if the plant had been subject rates. As indicated in the parts of the statements attached to the Budget Speeches that relate to Industiy Assistance through the Taxation System, concessions that accelerate tax allowances in this way, while conferring no greater total deduction over the life of plant than would otherwise be available, permit a deferment of tax which entaUs a cost to the Budget. Foreign Policy Orientation Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: (1) Has his attenuon been drawn to an article entitled 'Foreign PoUcy wrongly oriented' contained in the January 1980 edition of Manufacturers' Bulletin published by the Chamber of Manufacturers of New South Wales. (2) Have other Government Ministers variously expressed the opinion that our economic recovery is export-oriented 77/91 away from the West to South East Asia. (3) If so, are Australian foreign policies disbe proportionately oriented towards western countries, particularly Europe and the United States of America. for the purposes of any longer EmptyHere member's question is as follows: Aid to Afghanistan (1) My attention has been drawn to the article entitled (Question No. 5777) 'Foreign PoUcy wrongly oriented' in the January 1980 edition of the Manufacturer's Bulletin. (2) Ministers, including myself, have noted that there will be increasing opportunities for Australian exports in South East Asian countries and have called on Australians to take full advantage of these opportunities. Without detracting from the importance of South East Asia the Government must also take account of the need to support exports to those countries which remain our major trading partners, as well as to explore new opportunities for export promotion. We should not neglect trading opportunities in any region, whether in Europe, the United States or South East Asia.

Recent events in Iran and Afghanistan indicate the continuing importance of political and strategic considerations in our foreign relations and underline the need to maintain substantial representation in allied and like-minded countries. Finally, South East Asia has been and remains an area at the centre of Australian foreign policy. The priority the Government attaches to South East Asia and the resources it devotes to consultation and co-operation with the countries of this region exceed the level which would be justified if exports were the sole determinant of foreign policy and the allocation of Australia's overseas resources. the deduction of capital expendiCosmetics: Animal Ingredients (Question No. 5848) to revenue to the extent Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: to depreciation at normal (1) WUl he undertake an investigation of the cosmetics industry to determine the extent to which domestic cosmetic products and imports contain animal ingredients. (2) WUl he introduce legislation requiring cosmetic companies to include on their products' labels precise detaUs about the product's composition and specifically whether animal ingredients have been used and whether animals were used in related research. (3) WUl he penaUse those foreign companies producing (Question No. 5841) cosmetic ranges which either include animal ingredients or use animals in their research and testing by applying an increased tariff on those products. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) My Department has already made inquiries in this area and has found that very few animals are used by Australian cosmetic manufacturers either for test purposes for cosmetic ingredients. This use of a small number of mals in the toxicity testing of cosmetics is considered essential in the interest of public health. My Department is notresponsiblefor the legislative control of the importation of cosmetics beyond its quarantineresponsibilitiescovering ingredients of animal origin and where the cosmetics would be classified as therapeutic substances due to therapeutic claims made. The allocation of tariffs to these responsibility of my colleague Consumer Affairs. (2) I am not in a position to introduce legislation to control the labelling of cosmetics as this is primarily a State responsibility. Mr Cohen asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: (1) What sum has been spent on coaching as part of the Sports Assistance Program in each of the lastfiveyears. (2) How is this money dispersed. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following amounts have been allocated by the Government for coaching in the lastfiveyears: 1975-76-$90,092; 1976-77-564,935; 1977-78$134,600; 1978-79-$277,349; 1979-80-$364,500.

In addition, funds are available to assist with the costs of visits of eminent coaches from overseas, the running of national coaching courses and sempensions inars, the printing of publications and for other national coaching projects. Butane Cigarette Lighters Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: Is he aware of recent accidents, both in the United States of America and Australia, involving exploding butane cigarette lighters; if so (a) does the Government intend to cooperate in the investigations being carried out by the New South Wales Government into the safety of butane cigarette lighters and (b) does he consider that sufficient grounds exist for banning the sale of such lighters. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am aware of reports, both in the United States of America and Australia, of accidents which have allegedly involved exploding butane cigarette lighters. These reports have been investigated by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Commonwealth/ State Consumer Products Advisory Committee (CSCPAC) which comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory consumer affairs officials. CSCPAC has received advice from NSW Government officials who have undertaken tests into the safety aspects of butane cigarette lighters. These tests or have not indicated any product safety hazard for butane anicigarette lighters except for some valve failures with one to be brand of lighter which has now been withdrawn from sale. On the present evidence available, action to ban the supply of butane cigarette lighters would not appear to be justified. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs will continue to investigate any complaints should they arise and if action to ban the supply of these goods appears products is the necessary I willre-examinethe matter. the Minister for Business and Social Security Pensions and Benefits (Question No. 5859) Dr Cass asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 2 Sports Coaching April 1980: (Question No. 5856) (1) How many persons who did not have the necessary residential qualifications were (a) successful and (b) unsuccessful in applying for (i) age pensions, (ii) widows pensions and (hi) invalid pensions special benefits in (A) 1977-78, (B) 1978-79 and (C) the period 1 July 1979 to 31 March 1980.

(2) If so, (a) has the non-proclamation of these provisions had an adverse effect on Australian insurance companies and (b) will he take steps immediately to have these provisions proclaimed. (3) If he will not take steps to have these provisions proclaimed, will he give urgent of this section.",125
334,Mr HOWARD ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) None of the provisions of section 113 has yet been proclaimed. The section was amended in 1977 as it was considered to be unduly restrictive, particularly in relation to reinsurance. In my press statement of 12 February 1979, I indicated that it was proposed to implement the provisions of the section in two stages-vi as the necessary regulations were prepared, followed by subsections 113 (1) to (3). However, in the process of preparing regulations for purposes of sub-section 113(4), it became apparent that the provisions of that sub-section would require the collection of unnecessarily detailed information, would impose unreasonable burdens on those required to furnish that information, and could prove unworkable in practice. Urgent consideration is currently being given to resolving these problems. (2) (a) As indicated in (1) visions of section 113 and the provisions as amended contain defects which would cause difficulties for the insurance industry. While I am aware that some sectors of the industry have sought early proclamation able to provide any precise indication of the effects on the industry of non-proclamation of the provisions. (b) It would not be appropriate to take steps to implement these provisions until sound and workable procedures have been developed. (3) See (1) above. Retail Motor Spirit Market",126

Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No. Nature Conservation (Question No. 5866) (Question No. 5928) Mr Cohen asked the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: (1) Did payments to the States under the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act to assist States to acquire land of nature conservation significance for national park purposes amount to $195,246 out of $1,047,000 appropriated in 1977-78 and 1978-79. (2) What land was purchased for these purposes in these periods. (3) What land, committed for purchase, has not been acquired. consideration to modification (4) Has a proposed expenditure of $404,000 been estimated for these purposes in 1980-81; if so, will this sum be sufficient to purchase land not yet acquired. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1977-78 and 1978-79 the Commonwealth provided funds to the States totalling $ 195,242 out of a total appropriation of $1,047,000 primarily to assist in the acquisition of land for national park purposes. z sub-section 113 (4) as soon (2) In 1977-78 and 1978-79, the Commonwealth provided financial assistance to the Government of Victoria to acquire land for the Yellingbo State Faunal Reserve, and has also assisted the Tasmanian Government to acquire land at Asbestos Range and Partridge Island.

(2) Was he one of the speakers at the seminar. (Question No. 5871) (3) Were any names requested by the institute; if so, what was the precise nature of the request. (4) Did his Department provide to the institute the name Mohammed Riad; if so was he described by the Department as Acting Secretary-General of the Arab League, or in any simUar way. into the retail motor spirit (5) Did his Department provide to the institute the name of Shadli Ghelebi; if so, was he described by the Department as Secretary-General of the Arab League, or in any similar way. sell (A) 89, (B) 92, (C) (6) If the answer to either part (4) or (5) is in the negative, on what basis did his Department determine which of these 2 persons should be suggested to the institute. (7) Does the Governmentrecogniseas the Arab League the body with head-quarters in (a) Cairo, Egypt, or (b) Tunis, Tunisia. (8) Has his Depanment received representations from any country or countries concerning suggestions it made in respect of the seminar; if so, representations and (b) in what terms has the Department responded to them. EmptyHere member's question are as follows: (1) No. The Department of Foreign Affairs was approached by the Australian Institute of International Affairs (AHA) to suggest people qualified by long experience in the Middle East and involvement with the Arab/Israeli dispute to deliver a paper as keynote not approached to suggest who should or should not be invited to the seminar. (2) Yes. (3 ) See answer to question I. (4) Yes. The Institute was informed of the division which had developed between members of the Arab League, and Riad was described as the Acting Secretary-General of the Arab League (Cairo). (5) Yes. Chadli Klibi was described as the Secretary General of the Arab League (Tunis) in the context of a description of the division between members of the League (see answer to previous question). (6) Not appUcable. (7) The government regards the present split within the Arab League as a matter for the member states of the organisation and considers that it would be inappropriate for Australia to become involved. (8) The Department received representations from the Heads of Mission of the Jordanian, Lebanese, Iraqi and Libyan Embassies in Canberra. The Australian Ambassador in Rome was also approached by the Sudanese Ambassador resident there. (a) The Arab Heads of Mission and the Sudanese Ambassador in Rome suggested that the invitation to Riad to address the AIIA seminar was tantamount to oflicial Australian recognition of claims to legitimacy of the Arab League (Cairo) over the claims of the Tunis based organisation. (b) The Department responded by pointing out that: (i) the AIIA was a non-governmental body and that the invitation to Riad was therefore not official; (U) Riad was in any case invited because of his long experience in Middle East diplomacy not because of the position he currently occupies; and (Ui) as outlined in (7) Australia does not believe it would be appropriate on League affairs. The presence of Riad at the conference did not therefore have any implications as to the Australian Government's attitude. Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Canberra Times ?f 28 March 1980, page S, concerning new research which suggests that myopia is related to concentrated use of the eyes for close work in youth. (2) Is this consistent with theories that bifocal adjustment of myopia may help to retard the development of the disorder more than single lens prescriptions. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) what was the nature of these (1) Yes. (2) The true significance of the findings of the study mentioned in the article, especially relating to the value of bifocals in retarding the progression of myopia, is difficult to evaluate. Debate exists over the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors in the cause of myopia, and circumstantial evidence is accumulating to suggest that environmental aspects may be of more importance than previously thought. speaker to the seminar. It was Although environmental factors are suspected, little is known about the possible mechanisms that could be involved in the aetiology of acquired myopia. It is therefore difficult to extrapolate the hypothesis to the role of bifocals. I agree however, that once the mechanism and role of environmental factors are established, this would provide valuable information on possible methods of treating myopia. Afghanistan (Question No. 5997) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 April 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to claims, in a Soviet news bulletin issued on 18 April 1980, to the effect that (a) 'insurgents' in Afghanistan (i) are trained abroad and (ii) have an abundance of modern weapons, including lethal gas grenades marked Made in USA., (b) the America press published reports ofrebelsin Afghanistan using arms provided by the United States of America Central Intelligence Agency and (c) Soviet forces will withdraw when the Afghan Government no longer needs their help. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to areportedstatement by a former Secretary-General of the United Nations that in war the first casualty is truth. (3) WUl he use Australia's good offices with the United Kingdom and other non-involved powers with past experience of armed intervention in Afghanistan to press for (a) discussions among the disputants, (b) intemauonal conciliation and arbitration and (c) the replacement of Soviet forces with United Nations forces in Afghanistan. (4) WUl he demonstrate Australia's consistency by pressing for simUar action in relation to the Indonesian occupation of East Timor and West Irian. EmptyHere member's question is as follows: for it to take any position (1) and (2) I am aware of the statements referred to by the honourable member. (3) Australia is in close and regular contact with all countries which share our opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Government has been active in seeking Myopia ways to defuse the crises caused by the presence of over (Question No. 5990) 80,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan. We attach particular importance to continued dialogue between the countries of the South Asian region and between the superpowers as a means of avoiding misunderstandings which could aggravate an already serious situation. Australia would welcome any peaceful solution involving the complete withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. We believe that the international community would wish to see Afghanistan as an independent, non-aligned country free from foreign mUitary and political interference. A number of constructive suggestions have been made to help defuse the crisis by diplomatic means involving the withdrawal of Soviet forces and non-intervention in Afghanistan's internal affairs. There are some common elements in these suggestions which could form the basis of an eventual poliucal solution. We believe idendfying a practical way forward. (4) The Government does not see any parallel between East Timor and Irian Jaya and the situation which currently exists in Afghanistan. War Widow's Pension Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 29 April 1980: Does the Repatriation Commission intend to appeal against a decision in March eral Court in favour of Mrs Nancy Law of Wembley, Western Australia, in the matter of her entitlement to a war widow's pension: if so, what are the reasons for the proposed appeal. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, an appeal has been lodged because Mr Justice Toohey's decision raises issues oflaw whichrequireclarification by the Full Court of the Federal Court. The matter was heard in Perth on 7, 8 and 9 May 1980. The Court reserved its decision. Duty Free Purchases Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 29 April 1980: Is his Department considering allowing duty free purchases by inward bound passengers at Sydney and Melbourne intemauonal airports; if so: (a) what are the benefits of the proposal, and (b) would the provision of this same facUity to inward bound travellers arriving at Brisbane and TownsvUle international airports be considered. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Bureau of Transport Economics' report on inwards duty free shopping at international terminals in Australia is under consideration by an Interdepartmental Committee. No decision has yet been taken by the Government. The benefits claimed include overall economic tage to Australia, safety aspects would be carried in the aircraft passengers would be carrying marginally less luggage. However, there is a large number of issues to be resolved. (b) Any decision taken by the Government would apply to all international airports in Australia, enterprise is prepared to operate the facility in the particular airport.

Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The income test for Repatriation service pensions in the Repatriation Act already provides that 50 per cent of any disabUity pension, including thosereceivedunder the General Rate and Special Rate of Repatriation pensions, payable to a veteran and his wife is regarded as income for the purpose of assessing the amount of service pension payable. The income test provisions are considered from time to time in the Budget context.

Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has (Question No. 6052) been asked to investigate reports that disposable gas lighters may pose a safety hazard. These reports have not, however, referred to the use of disposable gas lighters for lighting gas cylinders. These reports have been investigated by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Commonwealth /State Consumer Products Advisory Committee (CSCPAC) which comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory consumer affairs officials. CSCPAC has received advice from New South Wales Government officials who have undertaken tests into the safety aspects of butane cigarette lighters. These tests have not indicated any product safety butane cigarette lighters except one brand of Ughter which has now been withdrawn from sale. On the present evidence available, supply of butane cigarette lighters would not appear to be justified. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs will continue to investigate any complaints and if acuon to ban the supply of these goods appears necessaiy I willre-examinethe matter.

The Trade Practices Commission is an independent statutory body and I have no power to give it instructions in the exercise of its function under Part VII of the Act.

(6) INFCE recognised that longer-term nuclear capacities could not be forecast with a high degree of accuracy. World energy demands and the mix of fuels to meet this demand would depend on a large number of factors, including popuduring lation growth, economic growth, ments in supply and utilisation sources and national and international poUcies. INFCE did not attempt to predict the most probable nuclear energy capacity at any future date. Instead, it developed a high and a low case in of possible installed nuclear capacities overtimeto basis for projecting requirements for nuclear fuel, heavy water and nuclear fuel cycle services between now and the year 2025. It was recognised that these projections were limiting bounds, but representative projections and that higher and lower capacities were possible, depending on future developments and decisions. Future requirements for nuclear fuel, heavy water and fuel cycle services would also depend in pan on the types of reactors operated over the longer adopted by different countries.

Great Barrier Reef Marine Park: Japanese Mr Cohen asked the Minister for Science and ties and the Environment, upon notice, on 19 February training 1980: (1) Is it a fact that under the Fisheries Agreement, signed between Australia and Japan on 17 October 1979, Japanese longUne fishermen are allowed to fish within the boundaries of the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. (2) Have Japanese longline fishermen fished within the boundaries of the Capricornia section of the Marine Park since 21 October 1979; if so, what fish have been caught, and how large was the catch. (3) Was the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority consulted in respect of the areas of the Great Barrier Reef region which Japanese longliners would be permitted to fish. (4) Was the Park Authority consulted over whether the Japanese fishermen would have access to fish within the Capricornia section of the Marine Park. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: rep- (1) The Subsidiary Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan concerning Japanese tuna longUne fishing provides for the exclusion of longliners from all of the Capricornia Section of at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, apart from an area eastward of the 200 metre line. It is estimated that the area eastward of the 200 metre line covers about 15 per cent of the $ Capricornia Section.

(2) the net number of jobs which will be available to graduate teachers, and (4) the average cost of training a graduate teacher for the ful period of their training. term and the fuel cycle options Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable of INFCE member's question is as follows: of nu- (I) Since 1975 there has been a steady reduction in the of number of students entering primary and secondary preservice teacher education courses. As a result the number of students graduating fell in 1979, and funher substantial falls are projected. In accordance with the Government's Fishermen Guidelines, the Tertiary Education Commission has been (Question No. 5347) monitoring trends in the supply and demand for teachers and last year began detailed discussions with State authoriinstitutions to determine levels of intake into teacher courses for the 1982-84 triennium. As pan of this consultative process, the Commission has prepared a working paper which seeks to arrive at a level of new graduates which will achieve a reasonably balance between supply and demand. The working paper's estimates are for Australia as a whole and the trends and implications identified will differ in impact from State to State; the paper was circulated to State authorities for discussion and comment in October 1979. The Commission's estimates from this working paper for the number of pre-service primary and secondary teacher graduates for the next five years are as follows: Actual Esumated 1979 1980 1981 17,450 15,900 14,700 13,500 The Commission proposes to revise these estimates when discussions with State authorities have been completed. (2) As pan of the working paper's assessment of teacher supply and demand in the 1980s, the Commission has made an estimate of possible demand levels for additional teachers based on assumptions of future school enrolment levels, pupil teacher ratios and wastage rates for employed teachers. These estimates suggest that the demand for additional teachers over the next five years will be about 13,000 per annum. This would represent the maximum number of jobs available to new graduate teachers; while in practice most of these positions will be filled sponsibility of employers to decide whether to employ a new graduate or an experienced teacher seeking tore-enterthe workforce. (3) For students wishing to become teachers there are two types of courses available. Most secondary teachers undertake a four year course of study which includes the equivalent of one year's specinc teacher training; the remainder of the course is equivalent to the normal arts/ science/economics programs undertaken by other students. For primary teachers, the typical course is of three years in length and while a significant component of the course is not specificallyrelatedto teaching, the training is morerelatedto the teaching function and is spread through the full length the course. In the case of secondary teachers the cation component is not regarded a teacher since a non-teaching qualification is normally obtained upon completion of the first three years of the four year program; in the primary case, it is morereasonableto regard the total cost as being incurred in teacher training. Given this, the Commission has estimated that the average cost of training a teacher education graduate for the full period of traimng is approximately $13,000 at December 1979 cost levels. However, if account is taken of the teacher training component alone, the average cost per student is proximately $8,000. Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 26 February 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments by the retiring president of the Australian Industries Development Association, Mr A. W. Hamer, that Australia's capacity to become a modern, thrusting and internationally competitive industrial nation is being seriously retarded because of the inability of governments to lift themselves above short-term and ad-hocreactionsto current crises. (2) Did the Vernon Committee, the Jackson Committee and the Crawford study group all urge the development of long-term industrial policy; if so, what are the Government's intentions inrelationto this matter. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The comments to which the honourable member refers were made by Mr Hamer when presenting the 1978-79 Australian Industries Development Association Annual Repon, and were directed equally at governments of both parties. Our record sincereturningto office, however, speaks for itself. 1982 1983 1984 On the broad front we adopted an overall economic strategy designed to re-establish the conditions for sustainable 12,800 12,200 economic growth. By bearing down relentlessly on inflation through firm, but responsible, monetary and fiscal policies we have returned to a stable economic environment in which industry can take advantage of its development potential. We also moved quickly to provide a considered statement of policy for manufacturing industry. The White Paper, published in May 1977, made clear our commitment to the role and future of manufacturing industry and drew specific attention to the changing environment facing Australian manufacturers. We stressed in particular the significance of policies to facilitate the development of a manufacturing sector which was more export-oriented, innovative, specialised and less dependent on Government suppon. by new graduates, it is the reThe White Paper, of course, does not represent an exhaustive statement of our approach to the long term development of Austrahan industry. It does, however, provide a framework against which ongoing policy development can take place. In a period that has been characterised by the need to maintain the maximum possible restraint on Government expenditure, we have taken a number of initiatives designed to stimulate industry development and give effect to our policy objectives. Immediately after our return to office for example we reintroduced the investment allowance; we have since exof tended its application for a funher two years. This measure general edualone is estimated to cost $330m in 1979-80. as a direct cost of training In 1978 we introduced the Expon Expansion Grants scheme, improved the Export Market Development Grants scheme and upgraded a number of the services available to Australian exporters. We have also improved and broadened the scope of industrialresearchand development incentives. As a consequence of these and other important initiatives, ap- budgetary assistance provided manufacturing industry has move than doubled in real terms since 1975-76. In particular manufacturing was a major beneficiary of the 1979-80 Budget with direct assistance more than doubling to $318m Industry Policy and various tax incentives costing an estimated $267m. (Question No. 5496) In addition to budgetary measures, we have also taken the following initiatives: amended the LAC Act inrelationto guidelines, repon rules and temporary assistance procedures implemented sectoral pohcies inrelationto certain important industries modified the foreign investment guidelines in recognition of our need for foreign capital whilst at the same time ensuring Australian participation in ownership and control initiated a new program of studies of mineral and other resources processing projects strengthened the approach to granting preference to Australian firms in Government purchasing Coupled with responsible general economic policies which have resulted in our rate of inflation falling to below the OECD average, these initiatives have markedly improved the international competitiveness of Australian manufacturing industry. There is general agreement that manufacturing industry is in better shape now than it has been for many years and is reflected in a number of indicators: exports of manufactures their value in the nine months to March 1980 running almost 40 per cent above that of a year earUer output as measured by the ANZ Bank index of factory production, rose strongly in 1979 and in the three months to February 1980 was nearly 6 per cent above that of a year earlier capital expenditure by private manufacturing enterprises has continued to increase Moreover, there are sound prospects for continued expantory sion of the manufacturing sector in 1980. Recent surveys, both Government and private, indicate that new capital expenditure and exports by manufacturers are unue at the current stronger level. - It is important that the gains made are consolidated and that the prospects identified are realised. Our industry poUision cies will therefore have an increasingly play in the future. The Government also acknowledges that movement toward our long-term industry policy objecdve will involve the achievement of a less complicated tariff structure based on gradual progress towards lower and more stable levels. However, the abUity of the economy and the community to absorb change will continue to be an important factor in the Government's consideration of the extent and timing of any tariff reductions. In this context we wiU continue, if necessary, to take special measures, of a recognised temporaiy nature, to support employment and ensure that movement towards our long term goals is not accompanied by economic and social disruption. As was pointed out by the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment, there are some industries face adjustment problems of cordingly the Report of the Group endorsed the Government's approach, which recognises there can be a need for policies for particular sectors of industry. In developing our industry policy framework account was taken of several significant contributions to the subject of industry poUcy, in particular the Report of the Jackson Committee. With regard to the Crawford Study Group's Report, the basic objectives of its proposals are consistent with the Government's policies for manufacturing industry.

(2) Is the Government taking any steps to increase industrial capacity within the industry. (3) What were the figures for (a) completions and (b) commencements of dwelUng units for 1978-79. (4) What was the shortfall between (a) demand and (b) completions in 1978-79. (5) What is the estimated shortfall between (a) demands and (b) completions for (a) 1979-80 and (b) 1980-81. (6) Is it estimated that there will be a shortage of skUled tradesmen in the housing construction industry over the next 10 years; if so, what is the estimated shortage. (7) How many skUled workers expressed in (a) actual terms and (b) as a percentage of employees in the industry left the housing construction industry in 1978-79. (8) How many apprentices have commenced their apprenticeships in the housing construction industry in 1980 to date. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1), (2) and (6) The capacity of the housing industry has been decreasing in recent years. Such a movement, however, was inevitable following the growth in capacity that accompanied the period of over-buUding in the mid 1970s. The future capacity of the industry depends partly on the supply of labour and thus the number of apprentices taken on. WhUe some skills may be in short supply in particular regions from time to time, there is not likely to be a general shortage of skUled tradesmen in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the Government is concerned to ensure conditions under which an adequate supply of skilled manpower can be maintained. The introduction of the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training (CRAFT) scheme will help to increase the future supply of skUled workers. (3), (4) and (S) In 1978-79 total dwelling completions and commencements were respectively 117,134 and 119,103. It has been estimated that dwelUng completions will be in theregionof 125,000 mately 130,000 in 1980-81. (7) Data on skUled workers who have left the housing construction industry are not avaUable. (8) The number of apprentices taken on in the construction industry (includes housing and non-residential sectors) in the first two months of 1980 totalled 2,052. Private Dwelling Constructions Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Housing and Construction, upon notice, on 6 March 1980: (1) How many private dwelling constructions were commenced in the government sector in (a) 1975-76, (b) 1976-77, (c) 1977-78 and (d) 1978-79. Housing Industry (2) What is the estimated number of private dwelling constructions to be commenced in 1979-80.

Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The numbers of private and government commencements for the year requested are as follows: NA Government Private Total 1975- 76 13,292 123,766 137,058 1976- 77 15,288 126,429 141,717 1977- 78 13,200 105.496 118,696 1978- 79 9,527 109,576 119,103 (2) The Indicative Planning Council has estimated that private dwelling commencements in 1979-80 should total approximately 120,000. (3) (a) It is not possible to provide areliableestimate of changes in the cost of buUding a house in the local government areas identified. WhUe the Australian Bureau of Statistics does coUect data on the value of dweUings completed in local government areas, these data are not adjusted for quality, size or location within the LGA. Consequently, when there are relatively small numbers of houses or groups of units being produced, changes in average dwelling completion values do not provide a reliable guide to changes in underlying costs. (b) The following table shows the annual percentage increase in the average price of all houses sold in each area in theyears 1976-77 to 1978-79. Similar data for'other'dwellings are not avaUable. Again, these data should be used with caution as there is no adjustment for quality, size or location of the dwelling.

Medical Services for Standard Ward Hospital Patients (Question No. 5684) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, (Question No. 5618) upon notice, on 20 March 1980: (1) Does the common fee for medical services as updated by Mr Justice Ludeke continue to include a loading to compensate medical practitioners for free of charge treatment of public hospital patients prior to 1975. (2) Have medical practitioners, since the 1975 Commonwealth/State hospital agreements, been entitled to (a) sessional fees or (b) modified fees-for-service for all work performed on standard ward public hospital patients. (3) What was the estimated cost, for the last year for which figures are available, of providing medical services by visiting private medical practitioners for standard ward hospital patients for (a) each State, (b) the Australian Capital Territory and (c) the Northern Territory. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The common fee for medical services did not include a specific loading to compensate medical practitioners for free of charge treatment of pubhc hospital patients prior to 1975. The concept of 'the most common fees currently being charged in each State for all the medical services and procedures provided by medical practitioners'was proposed by the Committee of Enquiry into Health Insurance (the Nimmo Committee)-se e paragraph 4.51 of the Repon (March 1969). The most common fees advised by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) to the Government in Januaiy 1970 were determined in accordance with a complex set of rules from data on fees commonly charged, but mainly they represented the major modal fee. The new medical benefits introduced from 1 July 1970 were based on these most common fees, which became known as Medical Benefits Schedule fees. The Nimmo Committee considered the matter of some doctors providing services without charge or at concessional rates. 4.68. The total volume of or at concessional rates is substantial and is one of the factors responsible for the continued wide gap between doctors' charges to insured patients and benefit entitlements. The medical profession is pursuing the 'Robin Hood' principle which appUed before governments became involved. Its appUcation is much less justified now and we consider that future policy should be directed to its gradual elimination by the payment to the profession of fair and reasonable remuneration for these services. 4.69. We emphasise that it that we express this view. Honorary services in public hospitals are given under anangements existing between the State hospital authorities and the medical profession. Any alteration to these anangements could only be made by agreement between the hospital authorities and the doctors. In any case it would clearly be wrong for payment to commence immediately for all these services as doctors have taken them into account in setting their current fees. But in relation to the question of fee adjustments, it seems to the Committee that the whole honorary and concessional fee structure should be examined as pan of each review. For example, if the authorities were to agree that doctors should have the right to charge fees to insured patients in pubUc wards of public hospitals, this right might be equal to or of greater value to the profession than a general 5 per cent increase in fees. Likewise, a 10 per cent increase consulting fees might be of simUar value to a 2 per cent increase in general practitioner consulting fees to insured patients. The honorary and concessional elements in these services are at present distorting the fee structure and future policy should, as we have said, be directed towards their gradual elimination. 4.70. Before measures to this end could be considered it would be necessary to collect and assess a great deal of factual material not at present readUy avaUable. It would also be necessary for the Commonwealth and the State Governments to enter into detailed negotiations with the medical profession regarding all the impUcations of any new poUcies. We consider that the National Health Insurance Commission should undertake the assembly of the necessary factual material. When the relevant information is avaUable the Commonwealth and State Governments should be able to determine the extent to which they are prepared to eliminate, at any panicular time, the honorary and concessional elements in medical services provided. To the extent that this can be done the need for upward adjustments in the estabUshed common fees for services to the public will be reduced.' With thereductionof honorary and concessional services following the introduction of Medibank in 1975, the Government submitted to the Second Private Enquiry on Medical Fees for Medical Benefit Purposes 1975 that whatever percentage increase in Schedule fees was determined by the Enquiry, it should bereducedby five percentage points in view of the increase in income following the payment for services previouslyrenderedfree or at concessional rates. At page 12 of the Determination of that Enquiry, it was stated that'thefinancialbenefits under discussion will affect doctors quite differently, depending on the nature of their practice so that the imposition ofan across the board' reduction to the percentage increase would, to a certain extent, redistribute income within the profession. Such an adjustment would be clearly inequitable.' 'It could well be that some medical practitioners will not benefit financially from any of the effects of Medibank, and it would be unjust for these people to be penalised in such a way. Accordingly, I have made no allowance for this matter in my Determination.' services provided without charge In 1976, following discussions with the Government, the AMA proposed that the increase it was making to its Ust of medical services and fees of 7.5 per cent overall, from 1 January 1977, should be applied to Medical Benefits Schedule fees, even though an increase of 14 per cent was indicated by the AMA's Medical Fees Index to cover increases in wages and other practice costs, and to maintain net income in real terms. The Government implemented the increase in Schedule fees from 1 January 1977.

Overseas Excursion Air Fares (Question No. 5692) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1980: (1) Are excursion air fares avaUable between Australia and (a) Cairo, Egypt and (b)Tel Aviv, Israel? (2) If so (a) what is the fare, (b) when was the fare agreed upon and (c) does Qantas operate direct services to either of these destinations? (3) If Qantas does not operate direct services to these destinations, why are excursion fares to them available? (4) Are excursion fares not available to other destinations of potentially greater tourist benefit to Australia?",132
339,Mr HUNT ,PRICE OF HOUSES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Excursion fares are available from points in Australia to Cairo and Tel Aviv. (2) (a) From Sydney to Cairo round trip $1,353 low Victoria season, $1,461 high season; from Sydney to Tel Aviv trip $1,339 low season, $1,447 are also available from Brisbane, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth to Cairo and Tel Aviv. (b) Excursion fares were agreed 5 January 1975. (c) Qantas does not operate Aviv. (3) In establishing an excursion fare between two points it is not a prerequisite that Qantas offer a service on the route. Numerous excursion type fares are available from Australia to overseas destinations not served by Qantas in order provide international travellers wishing points with option of the cheapest possible fare for the journey. In addition, it should be noted that it is not dition of the excursion fare type that a direct on line service be available, as it is with the advance purchase fares. gers holding excursion fareticketsmay tween Australia and Cairo or Tel Aviv. For members information, there is, however, a direct service offered between Australia and Tel Aviv by Alitalia.

Overseas Excursion Air Fares Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1980: (1) Is it a fact that if Qantas does not operate directly to an overseas country there is no sion air fare to that country? (2) If this is not the case, is he prepared to negotiate sion fares to countries not served directly by Qantas?",138
340,Mr HUNT ,PRICE OF HOUSES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) It is not a prerequisite for Qantas to operate on a route to enable the introduction ofan excursion fare on that route. For example, Qantas does not operate services to Tahiti or Johannesburg but excursion fares is a matter for a licensed carrier, after assessment of the market potential of a route to seek government approval to introduce an excursion fare. Such applications would then be a matter for bilateral negotiation.

It provided $2 million for works at Kakadu and Uluru National Parks in the Northern Territory; provided funds for the progressive declaration, management and development of marine parks along the Great Barrier Reef ($500,000 was provided for researchStudent Statistics including tourism aspects); (Question No. 5696) provided $400,000 on a $2 Commonwealth to $1 Tasmanian basis, as part of a seven-year program for the restoration and development of the historic Port Arthur region; provided sufficient funds to the Northern Territory Government to enable it to make significant progress on the development of the new Yulura tourist village to service visitors to Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mt Olga) National park. (The Northern Territory Government allocated some $6 million to the project in 1979-80.) In addition, tourist developments may be eUgible for assistance by way of Commonwealth Development Bank loans, and/or Decentralisation Advisory Board loans or grants. The Commonwealth, through the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, also provides a range of programs of training assistance to both employers and employees in the travel and tourist industry. An investment allowance in the form of a tax deduction of up to 20 per cent of eligible expenditure is available for tourist association operators on the capital cost of new plant and equipment. (b) In 1978 the Export Market Development Grants Scheme was extended to cover overseas promotion by the travel and tourist industry. This is designed to encourage individuals, firms and organisations to increase their promotion of the travel and tourist industry in overseas markets. Under this Scheme the Commonwealth will pay a grant of 70 cents in the dollar in respect of eligible expenditure on overseas promotional activities. The expansion of the tourist industry is also assisted by the promotion of Australia overseas by the Australian Tourist Commission. The Commission's allocation of funds was increased in the 1979-80 Budget by 93 per cent to $8.2 mUlion. This has enabled the motion activities. Indo-Chinese Refugees Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: (1) Does his Department have an Indo-Chinese Refugee Contingency Program. (2) If so, (a) what are its features, (b) what amount of the funding is provided by the (i) Commonwealth and (U) State Governments, (c) how many teachers have salaries funded by the program, (d) are (i) more schools being added to the program, (ii) more teachers being employed under it and (iii) additional funds being allocated to maintain conditions of staffing and (e) who administers the program. Mr Fife-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) My Department administers a Contingency Program for Refugee Children. Although at the present time assistance is being given only to Indo-Chinese refugee children, refugee chUdren from other countries are also eligible for assistance. (2) (a) Under the Program, Commonwealth funds are made available by my Department to government and nongovernment education authorities to help schools cope with the impact of numbers of refugee chUdren at primary and secondary levels, who have recendy arrived in Australia. The main purpose of the Program is to facilitate the chUdren's English language acquisition so that they may be integrated as soon as possible into established migrant education and other programs of the school system. In accordance with the guidelines for the Program, funds are provided mainly for the salaries of specialist language teachers and teacher aides, but may also be used for other purposes such as excursions, transport of students and assistance with materials, equipment and in-service education acdvities. Assistance is also provided for items such as transport/re-erection/repair costs of demountable classrooms provided by school authorities. Where necessary, refugee chUdren may receive up to six months assistance under the Program. If they continue to need special language assistance after they move into established programs of the school system, it is expected that they will be assisted in programs funded from Schools Commission or other sources. (b) (i) In the 1978-79 financial year, approximately $ 1.87m was spent by the Commonwealth on this Program; in the current financial year, expenditure is expected to reach $2.58m. (U) It is understood that most of the expenditure on special language programs for newly arrived refugee chUdren is funded by the Commonwealth through the Program. However, it is possible that expenditure may be incurred by State and non-government education authorities. It should be noted that the funds made avaUable by the Commonwealth under the Program are additional to,l and are not intended to replace, those provided by the Commonwealth through the Schools Commission for migrant education. (c) There are 143 teachers, co-ordinators, consultants and counsellors whose salaries are currendy being funded. In addition, the salaries of 47 ancillary staff, including bilingual teacher aides, are funded. (d) (i),(U)and(Ui)Yes. (e) My Department is responsible for the administration of the Program inco-operation with government and nongovernment education authorities.

Aircraft Noise: Brisbane Area Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 29 April 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reported statements by the principal of the Hamilton State Primary School, Queensland, that at least 1 month of school time is wasted because of aircraft noise in the Hamilton area.

Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) In the case of government schools, State Departments of Education determine what projects are undertaken in these schools in accordance with their priorides. Soundproofing would be a legitimate use of funds provided to the Queensland Government by the Commonwealth through pUcit the Schools Commission's Capital Grants Program. Projects involving the soundproofing of non-government school buildings against disturbances caused by external noise are eligible for assistance under the Schools Commission's Capital Grants Program. The precise measures taken depend, ofcourse, on the type of noise and the extent to which the learning environment of each school's pupils is impaired.

(2) Are women who make these complaints required to either provide proof of their claims or lose their entitlement to unemployment benefits.",144
349,Mr VINER ,PRICE OF HOUSES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Employment Service has a long standing policy in relation to complaints involving sexual harassment by employers. This policy precludes the CES from actioning a vacancy where the bona fides of an employer or a vacancy are suspect. In the event of such a complaint being received the CES will automatically defer further referral pending clarification of the matter, and where the allegations can be substantiated, or the CES has reason to believe that they are true, it will have no further dealings with the employer concerned. (2) The determination of eligibility and the payment of Unemployment Benefit is the responsibiUty of the Department of Social Security. In completing a claim for Unemployment Benefit a person is required to detaU the reasons for ceasing work and the circumstances are assessed by the Department of Social Security.

350,Mr STALEY ,PRICE OF HOUSES,"On 15 May 1980 (Hansard, page 2778) the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) asked me a question without notice regarding a letter said to have been sent to me by Sir Reginald Ansett which drew attention to acquisitions by News Limited of shares in Ansett Transport Industries Limited. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There is no record of such a letter having been received by me. However, on 22 January 1980 my colleague, the Attorney-General, wrote to me enclosing a letter dated 5 December 1979, in which Sir Reginald referred to this matter. Copies of these letters are at Attachment A. On 19 December 1979 the Attorney-General acknowledged Sir Reginald's letter, and on 22 January 1980 wrote to Sir Reginald and advised that, as the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 was administered by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, he had referred Sir Reginald's letter to me for consideration (Attachment B). I had already asked my Department to make inquiries of the Tribunal for advice regarding the share transactions which had taken place and any communications which had been received by the Tribunal from the parties concerned. Subsequendy, I received advice from the Tribunal in a letter addressed to my Department dated 20 Februaiy 1980. This advice is at Attachment C. On 6 February 1980 Sir Peter Abeles wrote to me on behalf of Ansett Transport Industries Limited on the same matter, enclosing a copy of his letter to the Attorney-General (Attachment D). On 26 March I responded to Sir Reginald saying that I had obtained information from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and had considered this carefully. I concluded that, in aU the circumstances, I did not propose to take any action under the Broadcasting and Television Act (Attachment E). On the same day I also wrote to the Attorney-General, enclosing a copy of my letter to Sir Reginald informing him of my behef that, under the circumstances, a prosecution should not be instituted (Attachment F). In forming this view, I had regard to the fact that the Tribunal had given notice of its intention to hold a public inquiry on this will conunue to keep the matter under review and there will be an opportunity to re-assess the position when the Tribunal 's Repon is available. Dear Minister, I am writing to you in connection with a letter dated S December 1979 that I have received from Sir Reginald Ansett. A copy of the letter is attached. For the reasons set out in his letter, Sir Reginald Ansett asserts that News Ltd has contravened secuon 92 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 by reason of certain share acquisitions by that company in Ansett Transpon industries Ltd. He asks that action be taken to investigate the matter and to enforce that provision. Although the effect of section 92KA of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 is that a prosecution for an offence against the provisions of section 92 may not be instituted except with the consent in writing of the Attorney-General, the quesuon whether any action of the kind suggested by Sir Reginald Ansett should be taken on behalf of the Government is primarily a matter for you as Minister administering the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942.I am accordingly referring Sir Reginals Ansett's letter to you for your cosideration. I am attaching a copy of my reply to Sir Reginald Ansett advising him that the matter raised in his letter has been referred to you. Yours sincerely, NA The Hon. A. A.

You will be aware that News Limited is the owner of a controlling interest in United Telecasters Sydney Limited, the owner and operator of one commercial television licence in Sydney. We draw your attention to the statement in today's issue of'The Australian', a newspaper owned by News Limited, that News Limited holds over twenty-five per cent of the shares in this Company. Such acquisition constitutes a flat contravention of Section matter. I 92 of the Broadcasting and Television Act, 1942.

I will write to you again on this matter. Yours sincerely, NA Sir Reginald Ansett, K.B.E. Managing Director, Ansett Transport Industries Limited, P.O.Box362F, MELBOURNE, Vic. 3001 Attorney General, Parliament House, CANBERRA, ACT 2600 Dear Sir Reginald, I refer to your letter dated 5 December 1979 requesting me to take certain action in relation to an alleged breach by News Ltd of the provisions of section 92 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942. As the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 is administered by my colleague the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, I have referred your letter to him for his consideration.

Box 1303, North Sydney 2060 Mr Robert Lord First Assistant Secretary, Broadcasting Policy Division Postal and Telecommunications Depanment 153 Walker Street NORTH SYDNEY. N.S.W. 2060 Dear Mr Lord, I refer again to your letter dated 11 January 1980, concerning the purchase by the News Group of Companies (News) of shares in Ansett Transpon Industries (Ansett) in relation to the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act (Act) which govern the ownership and control of commercial television stations. The Tribunal hasreceivedseveral letters from News and a letter from Ansett which have a bearing on the matter. There have been a number of telephone discussions as well. On 12 December 1979, News Limited advised the Tribunal that the News Group had purchased 43.6 per cent of the share capital of Ansett and was continuing to purchase shares with a view to acquiring up to 50 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Ansett. The letter acknowledged that provided the Tribunal approved the sale of News' interests in NWS Adelaide (since approved), and Ansett disposed of its interests in TVQ Brisbane (negotiations partly completed), the News Group would no longer hold prescribed interests in television stations in excess of those permitted by section 92( 1) of the Act. The same correspondence said that it was the intendon of one or more companies in the News Group to apply to the Tribunal for approval of the acquisition of the Ansett shares, as soon as matters ing to NWS and TVQ were resolved. It was also pointed out that the ultimate holding company of the News Group had become The News Corporation Limited and all companies in the Group would become direct or indirect subsidiaries of that company. DetaUs of the authorised and issued share capital of News Corporation Limited, News Limited and News Investments Pty Limited, which form part of the News Group of companies, were notified to the Tribunal on 4 January 1980. The News Corporation Limited advised the Tribunal on 25 January 1980, that News and Ansett were currently seeking Attachment B(ii) a buyer or buyers for TVQ but one factor which had contributed to the delay was that the sale of the John Fairfax Limited interests in station QTQ Brisbane was the subject of concurrent negotiations. 22 January 1980 Advice has since beenreceivedthat QTQ is being purchased by AWA Ltd and that Ampol Petroleum Ltd was acquiring some 60 per cent of the issued share capital of TVQ. In a letter dated 13 February 1980, Sir Peter Abeles, the Joint Chief Executive of Ansett Transpon Industries Limited advised the Tribunal that a preliminary agreement had been reached for Ampol Petroleum Ltd to acquire some 60 per cent of the share capital of TVQ and that negotiations were continuing for the sale of the balance of the Ansett interests in TVQ. In the letter from News Limited dated 13 December 1979 Yours sincerely, a copy of which was forwarded to your Department on 15 January 1980, the company acknowledges that its Ansett PETER DURACK shareholding transaction caused a contravention of the ownership and control provisions of the Act in that it held at that date a prescribed interest in both TEN Sydney and NWS Adelaide, and automatically acquired through Ansett a prescribed interest in ATV Melbourne and TVQ Brisbane. On the facts avaUable, the Tribunal was aware of this situation. However, it has been the practice over the years for such contraventions to be corrected either through negotiation with the panies concerned or voluntarily by such parTelex'ABTEE'26683 ties as soon as theyrealisedthe situation in which they were Telephone 922 2900 placed. There is norecordof any prosecutions having been 20 February 1980 launched in connection with contraventions which have occurred from time to time. It is the opinion of the Tribunal that continuation of the previous attitude to contraventions is desirable where it is clear, as is the case in regard to the News Group purchase of the Ansett shares, that every attempt is being made to remedy the contravention as soon as possible. On the general question of the institution of court proceedings regarding contraventions, the Tribunal believes that the powers and functions conferred upon it by the Act do not impose any responsibility for it to initiate prosecutions inrelationto contravention of the ownership and control provisions. However, the Tribunal accepts that where a contravention exists and the offending panyrefusesto take corrective action, the Tribunal should hold a public inquiiy and, if appropriate, direct the divestment of the excess interests. If such a direction were to be ignored, the Tribunal would report the matter to the Minister with a view to the Commonwealth instituting legal proceedings. I understand that your letter was written as a direct result of a letter which Sir Reginald Ansett forwarded to the Attorney-General sometimeago. As you are aware Sir Reginald has since disposed of his personal interest in Ansett Transpon Industries to the News Limited Group. The Tribunal has been informed that Sir Reginald does not wish the subject matter of his letter to be pursued and that the Joint Chief Executive Officer of Ansett Transpon Industries will be writing to your Depanment to this effect. In conclusion, I should mention that although the News relatCorporation Limited has yet to make a formal application for approval inrelationto its purchase of the shares in Ansett and the full extent of any contraventions cannot be estabUshed untU then, the Tribunal has invited members of the pubUc to furnish submissions on the matter. On receipt of these submissions the Tribunal will determine whether the transactions should be the subject of a public inquiry, pursuant either to section 92F(4) or section 18( 1) of the Act.

355,Mr STALEY ,ANSETT TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable Overseas Visit member's question is as follows: (Question No. 4141) The honourable member would know that since agreement was reached between the Australian Cricket Board and representatives of a commercial television operator, which grants exclusiverightsto telecast cricket matches arranged by the Cricket Board to the Channel 9 network, no cricket has been covered by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The ABC has instituted legal challenge against this agreement. I understand that this is before the court.

356,Mr HOWARD ,ANSETT TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable (Question No. 4142) member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to Senator Carriek's reply on 23 April 1980 to Senator Keeffe's question without notice on overseas travel. (See Senate Hansard, 23 April 1980, page 1703). Minister for Defence: Overseas Visit (Question No. 4202) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 June 1979: (1) What was the purpose of his visit to Britain and Belof transport were gium in January 1979.

(4) Which airlines and/or other means of transport were utilised during each stage of the journey. (5) In the course ofhis duties (a) what places were visited and (b) with whom were consultations held. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable (Question No. 4147) member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) I refer the honourable member to the reply given by Senator Carriek to a question without notice asked by Senator Keeffe, relating to ministerial overseas travel (Senate Hansard, 23 April 1980, pages 1703-12). Australian Forces Stationed Overseas Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: (1) In which countries have elements of the Australian forces been stationed at any dme in the last 20 years. (2) Between what dates were they stationed in each countiy. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) and (2) It has been assumed that the terms 'elements . . . stadoned relate to substantial bodies of men and material in operational or quasi-operational roles over lengthy and continuous periods. The following is the relevant information: (a) Countries where the Royal Australian Navy has maintained a shore establishment or from which it has operated at least one vessel in the last 20 years are: (i) Malaysia, from the time that country was formed in 1964 until the separation from it of Singapore in 1965; and (U) Singapore, from the time it became an independent country in 1965 until the present; however, the operating of ships out of Singapore has not been continuous throughout the period. (b) Countries in which the Australian Army has maintained a substantial force on a long-term basis in the last 20 years are: (i) Malaya, later Malaysia, until 1970; (U) Singapore, from 1970 until 1973; and (Ui) Vietnam, from 1965 until December 1972. (c) Similar data for operational aircraft and supporting units of the Royal Australian Air Force are: (i) Malaya, later Malaysia, continuously to the present time; (U) Vietnam, from July 1964 untU March 1972; and (iii) ThaUand, from June 1962 until August 1968. DetaU such as the rotation from time totimein the 1970s of an Australian Army company through the RAAF estabUshment at Butterworth in Malaysia is not included. It should also be noted that groups have served in UN forces operating, in some instances, in areas where national frontiers were in dispute. Recently a contingent served in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe as part of the Cease-fire Monitoring Force. The adrnimstrative effort involved in assembling the information relating to all the various other assignments and activities abroad, against all the dates for the service of the relevant personnel overseas during the past 20 years, would be substantial, especially given that much of the activity has not been continuous in respect of particular countries over the period. However, more important examples are: (a) Training assignments, which have resulted in a flow of personnel to and from the United States and Britain and, on a less continuous basis, to and from New Zealand, Canada and other countries. (b) Major defence cooperation programs. Some hundreds of Defence Force personnel have been present in Papua New Guinea continuously since that former territoiy became an independent country. Also on a continuous basis or nearly so, varying small numbers of Australian Defence Force personnel have been engaged in defence cooperation projects in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore since the incep(Question No. 4421) tions of the respective programs. (c) The acquisition of major items of defence equipment overseas, leading to the presence of teams of Australian Servicemen from time to time in major supplier countries such as the United States and Britain. Australia Post: Complaints by Mr T. Coulthard (Question No. 4535) Mr Innes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 29 August 1979: (1) Did he receive aUegations and complaints concerning the suggestion, scheme and management practices of Australia Post from a Mr T. Coulthard of South Australia, in 5 letters dated 25 May, 4 July, 6 September and 8 November 1978 and 8 Februaiy 1979. (2) If so, did his office reply to only 3 of these letters. (3) Did the first 2 ofhis replies state that he had asked for a report presumably from Australia Post, over Mr Coulthard's allegations. (4) Did the third and final reply, dispatched no more than 3 days after receipt of Mr Coulthard's latest complaint offer no reply to any of Mr Coulthard's detailed allegations, make no mention of the proposed report and suggest that Mr Coulthard take his complaints back to the management of Australia Post. (5) Is it a fact that management formed part of Mr Coulthard's complaints and that management had already been approached by Mr Coulthard on numerous occasions in relation to these matters. (6) Was he informed of Mr Coulthard's complaints against management in previous correspondence. (7) Has Mr Coulthard's complaint been treated in the normal manner; if not, in what way was it treated. (8) WUl he present to the Parliament the report requested by him into Mr Coulthard's allegations.",149
357,Mr STALEY ,ANSETT TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (7) I have received a number of letters from Mr T. Coulthard. All these related to suggestions which Mr Coulthard had put to the management of Australia Post. In reply it has been made clear to Mr Coulthard that these are matters which really should be raised with Australia Post, which as an independent statutory authority has full responsibility in its own management policies and practices. AU correspondence has been referred to the Australian Postal Commission and the points raised by Mr Coulthard have been carefully considered. (8) No. Defence Housing: Maintenance (Question No. 4712) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 September 1979: (1) What is the normal time lapse between a building maintenance requisition being lodged and maintenance being undertaken for married quarters occupied by RAAF members. (2) How many requisitions are at present lodged in respect of each maintenance item requested. (3) Are any requisitions not processed to the stage of maintenance work being carried out. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Maintenance on Commonwealth owned married quarters occupied by RAAF members is carried out by the Department of Housing and Construction which has supplied the following informadon: (a) Urgent maintenance is normally carried out immediately (i.e. same day) of materials. Minor maintenance not considered urgent is normally carried out within fourteen (14) days of request. (b) The normal time lapse in undertaking specific items of maintenance to RAAF married quarters will vary according to the method adopted for execution of the work. (i) if work is to a single married quarter work will normally be undertaken within two months. (ii) if work to a number of married quaners (up to 30) is grouped together and is executed by Depanment of Housing and Construction day labour it will normally be completed within 2-6 months depending on the extent and nature of maintenance required andreasonableaccess to the houses being available. (iii) if work to a number of married quaners (up to 30) is grouped for execudon by quiring documentation and public tendering procedures, the completion of the last house in such a contract could subject to access (c) As for 1 (b) above for work of a non urgent nature. Urgent unforeseen work such as repairs damage will commence immediately and normally be complete within two (2) weeks. (2) Normally only onerequisitionis lodged or request made for each maintenance item. (3) Requisitions are processed to the work being carried out unless the requirement is deferred or withdrawn. Housing made available to RAAF personnel under Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement arrangements is owned and maintained by the respective State housing authorities. Ministry: Overseas Visits",150

(5) How many persons accompanied each Minister on these trips and what was their (a) itinerary, and (b) relationship to the Minister where applicable, or official position and functions foreach trip. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to. the honourable member's question is as follows: ... I refer the honourable member to the answer given by my colleague, Senator the Honourable J. L. Carriek, on 23 April 1980 (Senate Hansard, pages 1703-11) as amended by Senator Carriek's statement on 28 April 1980 (Senate Hansard, page 1813). Prescriptions Dispensed in Hospitals (Question No. 5027) on request subject to availability Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 6 November 1979: (1) How many prescription items were dispensed in the (a) Royal Canberra Hospital and (b) Woden Valley Hospital, ACT, in each of the last 4 financial years, for persons (i) as inpatients and (ii) attending the outpatient clinics and casualty depanments of the hospitals. (2) What was the total cost for prescriptions dispensed for persons attending outpatient clinics and casualty depanments. (3) Does this cost include salaries and overheads including an allocation for shared costs such as administration, cleaning, power and area used. (4) How does this cost to the Government compare per prescription with the cost if the prescriptions had been dispensed in a private pharmacy, taking into account the fact that the patient is paying $2.75 towards the total cost when contract, thus redispensed in a private pharmacy. (5) Will the Government limit the supply of prescriptions from hospitals and use the facility of private pharmacies to a be up to 26 weeks, again greater extent. asrequiredby the contractor. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourto storm able member's question is as follows: (D(a)and(b) Inpatients Outpatients stage of maintenance Royal Canberra Hospital1975-76 146,832 40,278 1976-77 186,057 43,746 1977-78 219,879 47,729 1978-79 219,645 50,441 Woden Valley Hospital1975-76 82,633 16,725 1976-77 106,763 24,181 1977-78 101,184 43,609 1978-79 102,176 47,976 (Question No. 4767) (2) 1975-76, $151,771; 1976-77, $227,887; 1977-78, September $346,902; 1978-79, $567,681. (3) No. (4) No data are available within the Commission on the cost structures of commercial pharmacies and what their drug costs would be were they to assume the role of hospital pharmacies in the outpatient area. Funher even if information was available to the Commission concerning pharmacies, any comparison would be difficult because: (a) hospitals buy large quantities of drugs on a contract basis and obtain discounts which represent a significant cost saving; (b) private pharmacies would not hold all the drugs that are available at the hospital pharmacies such asradiopharmaceuticals drugs not approved for marketing drugs under clinical trial. The prescribing of these drugs would vary at hospitals according to the specialities practised; (c) there are differences that apply to dispensing of prescriptions for inpatients and outpatients. There is an inherent difficulty in calculating the actual macy that can be attributed to outpatient dispensing services. (5) From November 1979, the Commission revised its hospital pharmacy policy to provide that private patients attending Clinics conducted by medical specialists on hospital premises would be provided with prescriptions for dispensing from private pharmacies. Television Services: Leigh Creek Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Post and (37) Telecommunications, upon notice, on IS the construction November 1979: Has he considered submissions made to him that, in siling of the township of Leigh Creek in South Australia to site 13 km south of the existing site, the present taped relay television station be replaced by a direct telecast the Intelsat satelUte, as envisaged in the remote areas television station program; if so, when will his decision be released.",151

Chemical Research Projects (Question No. 5346) Mr Holding asked the Minister for Science (Question No. 5318) and the Environment, upon notice, .on .19 February 1980: (1) In view of the interest in chemicals used, in Vietnam during the war there, as herbicides and pesticides, .and the - continuing debate within Australia over domestic use of chemical agents such as 2,4,5-T and 2,4,-D, and the and possible health problems caused by these chemicals, has he, his Depanment or any Government agency under his control, carried out any survey to determine what original research, as distinct from scientific literature reviews, is being conducted by CSIRO, various academic institutions and any relevant bodies, into the possible effects of chemicals process by on both humans and the physical environment.

No formal survey has been carried out by CSIRO to determine what original research is being conducted into the possible effects, (Question No. 5319) of chemicals on both humans and the physical environment. However, several units iii CSIRO conduct, research work reto this field. For example, the CSIRO Division' of IrriResearch is undertaking research dn herbicides used to control water weeds in irrigation systems, including the persistence and distribution of residues in soil, water and These CSIRO research activities.have been reviewed the context of regular internal reviews of the Organisation. The House of Representatives' Standing Committee on to Environment and Conservation has initiated an inquiry into the management of chemicals hazardous to health and the ' environment. One of the issues being considered is what'feassessment and dissemination, of .information on"" chemicals potentially hazardous to health and the environ- ment is being conducted in Australia. (2) In January 1979 the Depanment ofScience and the Environment released the first'edition of the Australian Research Directory which lists'13,000 research projects in ihe natural and selected social sciences. The Directory includes' details of research projects, the names Of project leaders', departmental objectives and specialised facilities in universities and colleges of advanced education. The use of key words identifies those projects being conducted on the possible effects of ehemicals on both humans and the physical environment. Copies of the Directory may be Obtained from the CSIRO Editorial and Publications Service. "" Chemical and Biological Warfare Mr Holding asked the Minister for Foreign member' Affairs, upon notice, on 19 February 1980: (1) Was Australia a signatory to the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925, (an international treaty for the restriction of chemical and biological warfare) at (a) 17 June 1925, (b) any time between 1 Januaiy 1959 and 31 December 1972 and (c) 31 December 1979. (2) Is he able to state whether any legal opinions have been argued in international law that the Geneva Protocol is an accepted part of international law and therefore binding on all states; if so, will he cite the appropriate references. (3) Did the Australian Government make any protest to the United States of America Government at any time between 1960 and 1972 about the use of chemical and biological warfare in Vietnam. (4) If so, did the protest specifically refer to (a) 24D, 245T, (c) cacodylic or dimethylarsenic acid, (d) picloram, (e) arsenic trioxide, (0 various arsenates (lead, etc.) and senites, (g) calcium cyanamide, (h) sodium cyanide and other cyanides, (i) DNP, (j) 6,4 dinitro orthocresol, (k) maleic hydrazide, (1) malathion, (m) CMU, (n) DDT, (o) pasturella pestis (plague) and (p) irritant gases. (5) Is Australia currently, or has Australia at any time been, a signatory to the 1945 Nuremberg Charter denning war crimes and responsibilities. (6) If so, has the Austrahan Government sought and received any legal opinion on the applicability of any part of that Charter to the use of chemical and biological weapons against any opposing military forces or any civilian populations affected by war at any time since the inception of that Charter. (7) When, and by whom, was the opinion sought and received and what was the substance of the opinion. (8) Has the United Nations adopted any resolutions, at any time since 1946, which are designed to control or Umit the use of chemical and biological weapons in ume of war; if so, (a) what are the terms of those resolutions, (b) when were they adopted, (c) what was the vote on each occasion and (d) what UN member-nations (i) abstained from voting and (ii) voted against those resolutions on each occasion. (9) Is Australia stUl a signatory to the quadripartite ment made in 1964 between Great Britain, the USA, Canada and Australia (known at the Technical Cooperation Program and/or the Basic Standardisation Agreement) for the purposes of research and development of chemical and biological weapons. (10) Which Minister or Ministers of the then Australian Government were signatories to that quadripartite agreement, or if delegation of that power was made to the PubUc Service on behalf of the Australian Government, what were the names of the signatories, what were their designations and salaries and which Depanment did they represent. (11) What was the date on which that agreement was signed and where was it signed. (12) Is Australia a signatory to any other international agreements covering research and development of chemical and biological weapons; if so, when were those agreements made and who were the other parties to those agreements. (13) Does the Government intend to make a stand on the use of chemical and biological weapons. (14) In respect of all international treaties, conventions and agreements governing conduct in war to which Australia is a pany what reservations has Australia placed on acceptance of the terms of those treaties. (Question No. 5359) EmptyHere s question is as follows: (1) (a), (b) and (c) Australia was not one of the thirtyeight countries which signed the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (known as the Geneva Protocol) on 17 June 1925. Australia deposited an instrument of accession to the Protocol on 22 Januaiy 1930 with the Government of France, which on 24 May 1930 notified other states of Australian accession. Austrahan accession took effect from 24 May 1930. (2) The most recent occasion on which the status of the Geneva Protocol in international law has been argued in an international forum was during the debate on the UN General Assemblyresolution2603A(XXIV) (see answer to 8 below) the preamble of which reads in pan 'Recognising therefore . . . that the Geneva Protocol embodies the (b) generally recognised rules of international law prohibiting the use in international armed conflcts of all biological and ar- chemical methods of warfare'. It remains a matter of considerable contention whether or not it is binding on all states (a vote on this preambular paragraph was carried in the First Committee by only 57 votes to 10, with 24 abstentions). The same preamble calls for 'an affirmation of these rules and for dispelling, for the future, any uncertainty as to their scope and, by such affirmation, to assure the effectiveness of the rules and to enable all states to demonstrate their determination to comply with them.' An account of the consideration of this issue is given in the Yearbook of the UN for 1969 on pages 27 and 28. (3) and (4) No. (5) The Nuremberg Charter, whose fulltitleis the Agreement for the Persecuuon and Punishment of War Criminals of the European Axis and Charter of the International Military Tribunal, had four signatory Governments, France, the USSR, the United Kingdom and the United States. The four signatory Governments signed the Agreement in London on 8 August 1945. Australia notified the Government of the United Kingdom of its adherence to the Agreement on 5 October 1945. The Agreement is still in force. (6) and (7) No. Although there have been debates about the nature and effects of the Charter (including on the extent to which it, and the pronouncements of the International agreeMilitary Tribunal, reflected or created international law) Australia shares the view of those who believe the Charter was created for a specific purpose and that its purpose having been satisfied it has none but a persuasive force. The use of chemical and biological weapons, as weapons in combat (as opposed to the quite separate issue of the use of poison for genocide), was not considered by the International MUitary Tribunal. (8) The United Nations every year adopts a resolution on chemical and biological weapons. The terms of these resolutions vary, but generally they refer to earUer resolutions and urge the necessity of negotiations on an agreement for a complete ban. Such resolutions could not be described as designed to control or limit the use of chemical and biological weapons in time of war. The one which might be so described is resolution 2603A(XXIV) (see 2 above), adopted on 16 December 1969 by 80 votes to 3 with 36 abstentions. It was a contentiousresolutionand Australia, which voted against (with the United States and Portugal), took the position that it formulated an interpretation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol not shared by all parties to it and that it was for those parties, not the General Assembly, to interpret its scope and application. Australia at that time voted instead for resolution 2603B(XXIV) adopted by 120 to 0 with 1 abstention-this resolution, without commenting on the international legal status or scope of the Geneva Protocol, nevertheless called for its strict observance and requested the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to give urgent consideration to all aspects of the problem of the elimination of chemical and biological weapons. Resolution 2603B(XXIV) has been referred to in all annual resolutions 1970 . . . . . . Resolution 2662 (XXV) 1971 . . . . . . Resolution 2826 (XXVI) . . 1972 . . . . . . Resolution 2933 (XXVII) . . 1973 . . . . . . Resolution 3077 (XXVIII) Apart from two of the 1971 resolutions, these were standard resolutions urging progress on prohibitions of chemical and biological weapons. In 1971, Resolution 2826, prepared by the USA and USSR, commended to governments for signature the Biological Weapons Convention (see answer to (12) below). Resolution 2827A in the same year was a standard resolution asking the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to continue negotiations on a chemical weapons agreement as a priority item. Mexico, which had argued that chemical weapons and biological weapons should be dealt with in the one convention tabled first a working paper and then a draft resolution which was subsequently adopted as Resolution 2827B. The text of this resolution (mention of which, unlike Resolution 2827A, has not been re-iterated in successive annual resolutions) is as follows: The General Assembly, Noting that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons contains an undertaking to continue negotiations in good faith with a view to reaching early agreement on effective measures for the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and for their destruction, Believing that it is most desirable that some measures of a preliminary nature be adopted immediately, Urges all States to undertake, pending agreement on the complete prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and their destruction, to refrain from any further development, production or stockpiling of those chemical agents for weapons purposes which because of their degree of toxicity have the highest lethal effects and are not usable for peaceful purposes. (9), (10) and (11) The Technical Co-operation Program and the Basic Standardisation Agreement are two separate agreements. An account of Australian involvement in the Technical Co-operation Program was given in the Senate by the then Minister for Supply on 28 November 1968 in answer to a question on notice. The Program's aims are essentially unaltered today and provide for the exchange of information over a wide spectrum of non-nuclear military research and development activities in which each country is free to participate selectively. Among many chosen for Australian participation are chemical and biological defence. The Basic Standardisation Agreement, to which the Australian Army is still a signatory, also has as one of its areas of endeavour the task of considering standardisation potential between armies since 1969 while Resolution 2603A(XXIV) has not. Since 1969 no negative vote has been registered against these resolutions and since 1974 the resolutions have been adopted by consensus. The United Nations adopted six resolutions on chemical and biological weapons between 1969 and 1974. These, with voting results, were as follows: Yes No Abstain . . 113 0 2 (France, Malta) 110 0 1 (France) Resolution 2827A (XXVI) 110 0 1 (France) Resolution 2827B (XXVI) no 0 10 (Belgium, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, Turkey, UK., US.) 110 0 2 (France, China) . . 118 0 0 in the field of defence against biological and chemical weapons. On 21 July 1965 Australia was formally invited by the United States to join in the (then) Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program. No formal Agreement as such exists, the Program being based on a statement of policies, organisation and procedures. Acceptance was approved by Senator the Hon. Sir Shane Paltridge, Minister for Defence. It was conveyed to the United States Embassy on 27 August 1965. With Ministerial concurrence the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General R. G. Pollard, formally accepted the invitation to join the Basic Standardisation Agreement on 18 January 1963. The Agreement was signed by Colonel E. J. H. Howard, Austrahan Army Representative, Washington. (12) Australia is a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production of Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction which opened for signature at London, Moscow and Washington on 10 April 1972 and entered into force on 26 March 1975. Australia signed the convention on 10 April 1972 and ratified it on 5 October 1977. The other States Parties to the Convention are as follows: Afghanistan, Argentina, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Byelorussian SSR, Canada, Cape Verde Is., Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, German DR, Ghana, Greece, Congo, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Iceland, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Rwanda, San Marino, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Seychelles, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukrainian SSR, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Venezuela, Yemen PDR, Yugoslavia, Zaire. (13) Australia is taking a prominent role in efforts in the Committee on Disarmament to negotiate a complete prohibition on chemical weapons. It also participated actively in the conference convened in Geneva from 3-21 March 1980 to review the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. In January 1979 I told the inaugural session of the Committee on Disarmament that the control of chemical weapons represented an aspect of conventional arms control where practical measures were immediately possible and that the question of a chemical warfare convention was an immediate task for the Committee. Since then the Committee has agreed to make the question one of its priorities for 1980. The Australian representative, Sir James Plimsoll, on 5 February outlined to the Committee how it might undertake useful, practical and detailed work this year while recognising the complex and difficult issues involved. The Australian delegation formally circulated a proposal for a chemical weapons workshop to involve experts in the subject and those negotiating a chemical weapons convention. (14) Australia has made reservations to the following international treaties, conventions and agreements governing conduct in wan (a) International Convention for adapting to Maritime Warfare the principles of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864, done at The Hague on 29 July 1899. The instrument of ratification was deposited by Great Britain on 4 September 1900. The Convention applies to Australia. The instrument of ratification excluded Arucle X. (b) International Convention relative to the laying of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines, signed at The Hague on 18 October 1907. The instrument of ratification was deposited by Great Britain 27 November 1909. The Convention applies to Australia with the reservation of the following declaration: 'In affixing their signatures to the above convenrecords tion, the British Plenipotentiaries declare that the mere that this Convention does not prohibit a particular ceeding must not be held to debar his Britannic Majesty's Government from contesting its legitimacy'. (c) International Convention respecting Bombardments by Naval Forces in Time of War, signed at The Hague on 18 October 1907. The instrument of ratification was deposited by Great Britain, 27 November 1909. The Convention applies to Australia, under reservation of paragraph 2 Article 1 (Art 1 para 2 'A place may not be bombarded solely on the ground that automatic submarine contact mines are anchored off the harbour'). (d) Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use phyxiating, Poisonous or other Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17June 1925. The Protocol was acceded by Australia on 22 January 1930. in Australia's accession is subject to the reservation Majesty is bound by the said Protocol only towards those Powers and States which have both signed and Protocol or have acceded thereto, cease to be bound by the Protocol towards any Power at enmity with Him whose armed forces, or the armed forces of whose allies, do not respect the Protocol'. (e) Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civtimates ilian Persons in time of War of August 12, 1949. The instruties, ment of ratification was deposited by Australia on 14 October 1958. It was ratified subject to the following reserlevels. vation and declaration. 'In ratifying the Convention, the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia reserves the in right to impose the death penalty in accordance with the prodoes visions of paragraph 2 of Article 68 of the said Convention without regard to whether the offences referred to therein are punishable by death under law of the occupied territory at the time the occupation begins, and declared that it intertions prets the term ""military installations"" Article 68 of the said convention as meaning installations having an essential military interest for an occupying Power'. Justices of the High Court Mr Holding asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 February 1980: (1) How many days in each of the past 10 years has (a) the Chief Justice of Australia and (b) any other Justice of the High Court of Australia been absent from Australia in connection with his duties as a member of the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council? (2) Which Government bears or. which Governments bear the cost of the Chief Justice and Justices performing these duties? (3) If the Australian Government bears the whole or part of the costs, what costs have been incurred by it in each of the past 10 years?",170
364,Mr VINER ,MEDICAL SERVICES BY MY DEPARTMENT,The Attorney-General has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions: (1) In the main the Chief Justice and Justices who have attended the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the past ten years have done so during the winter vacation of the High Court and during periods they have travelled privately to England on leave. In these circumstances no precise records have been kept within my department. There have been occasions on which the Chief Justice and Justices have attended the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council whilst travelling overseas on other official duties. Departmental do not reveal the precise number of days that the fact Chief Justice and Justices were absent in connection with act or protheir duties with the Privy Council. (2) The Australian Government bears the costs of the Chief Justice and Justices sitting on the Committee. (3) Having regard to (1) above it is not possible to apportion costs incurred in relation to attendance at the Privy Council. Medical Training Costs (Question No. 5388),173
365,Mr HAYDEN ,MEDICAL SERVICES BY MY DEPARTMENT,"the Minister for Health, of War of Asupon notice, on 20 February 1980: Gases, and of Bacteriological What was the average cost of training a medical graduate Australia, through the full period of his or her training that 'His course during each of the last 5financialyears. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourratified the able member's question is as follows: and that His Majesty shall I am informed that it is not possible to provide an estimate of the average cost of training a medical graduate through the full period of training during each of the last five financial years. However, the Tertiary Education Commission esthat, in terms ofrecurrentexpenditure by universithe average cost of producing a medical graduate in a six year course is approximately $45,000 at December 1979 cost Thisfigureincludes the contribution made by universities towards the direct costs incurred by teaching hospitals the training of medical students in their clinical years. It not include any allowance for the indirect costs incurred in the provision of many of the normal hospital services as a result of medical teaching. It is difiicult to isolate these indirect costs of teaching medical students since teaching funcare closely integrated with the other functions of the in paragraph 2 of hospital. Telephone Exchanges: Automatic Recording Equipment (Question No. 5364) (Question No. 5391) Mr Innes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Does the Automatic Recording Equipment (ARE) 11 being installed in metropolitan telephone exchanges currently have or theoretically possess the capabUity of (a) storing time elapsed and/or charge information for (i) individual International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) caUs and (U) individual Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) caUs to enable listing in itemised telephone accounts, and (b) storing time elapsed and/or charge information for individual local telephone calls to enable charging on a time-elapsed basis for local calls. (2) If any or all of these capabUides are theoretical but not installed capacities, what additions must be incorporated to the ARE 11 to permit them to be achieved, and what would be the cost in each case. (3) Does Telecom intend to incorporate any or all of the additional equipment; if so, when. (4) Can he give a firm undertaking that local calls will not be charged on a time-elapsed basis for (a) the next S years and (b) the next 10 years.",173
366,Mr STALEY ,MEDICAL SERVICES BY MY DEPARTMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Telecom Australia advises that the ARE 11 equipunable ment currently being installed does not inherently have capabiUty of storing time elapsed or charge information for ISD or STD calls. However, when ARE 11 exchanges are connected to suitably equipped charging centres, such as stations Telecom's 10C trunk exchanges, the two systems working together can generate charge records at the charging The 10C trunk exchanges are computer controlled and although installed in all capital cities except Hobart at stage are in service only in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The introduction of this facUity at selected exchanges for ISD calls commenced on 12 March 1980, the service being called ISD Call Charge Recording. It is proposed to introduce a simUar service for STD CaU Charge Recording to enable subscribers to have detaUs of these calls listed in telephone accounts. (b) ARE 11 exchanges to not have the capabUity of charging for individual local telephone calls on a time elapsed basis but could be modified to provide this capabUity. Howcorder, ever, no such modifications have been designed or costed. (2) See answers 1 (a) and (b) above. (3) Introduction of call charge recording traUan telephone network for ISD has already commenced as mentioned in 1 (a) above and it is planned to commence introduction of the facUity for STD in 1984. A more detaUed explanation of the factors involved in STD call charge recording is provided at pages 48 and Annual Report for 1978-79. (4) There are no plans at present to enable charging on time elapsed basis for local calls from ARE 11 or any other local exchanges in the Australian network. Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Is it a fact that the problem of damage to long period structures produced by distant earthquakes has not been satisfactorily explored. (2) Is the possibility of damage to long period structures Darwin due to earthquakes in the Banda Sea noted in the commentary (Clause C3.2) of the SAA Earthquake Code (Australian Standard 2121-1979). (3) WUl the Minister take steps to explore more fuUy this whole question, particularly withrespectto possible damage in Darwin, and in view of the projected extensive engineering projects in the north-west of Western Australia to explore the possible damage to structures in this region. (4) Although it is not customary to provide strong motion instrumentation for structures, such as production platforms and pipelines, is information obtained about the response to these structures during an earthquake vitally imponant to engineers in the design of earthquake resistant structures. (5) Is the Minister able to state whether it is the practice in places like California for all multi-storey buUdings to be provided with these instruments. (6) Is it a fact that detaUed information of the seismicity of an area is necessary in order that seismic risk may be assessed as precisely as possible. (7) Is it also a fact that seismicity information can only be obtained with an adequate network of stations but that at the presenttimecoverage in Queensland is less satisfactory than in most other pans of Australia. (8) Can the Minister say whether the University of Queensland plans to increase the number of stations but is to do so because of lack offinancialsuppon; if so, will the the Commonwealth undertake to meet this additional cost. (9) Is the long term operation of permanent seismograph under the control of regional centres such as the University of Adelaide and the University of Queensland a centres. problem because of the lack of long term funding. (10) If so, will the Minister investigate the present unsatisthis factory nature of the arrangements for operating permanent seismograph stations in Australia and ensure that secure long capital city term funding is avaUable. (11) Are dedicated communication channels allowing recording at a central site more convenient and more satisfactory than recording separately at each of a number of isolated sites. (12) Is it a fact that in many instances it is essential to bring signals from a remote detector to a more accessible rebut that the annual rental for telephone Unes for distances of hundreds of kUometres is many thousands of dollars per year; if so, will the Minister take appropriate steps to ensure that lines used for the transmission of earthquake into the Ausdata are avaUable at nominal rental. ' (13) Can the Minister say whether the cost to insurance companies from damage caused by the 1954 eanhquake in Adelaide (magnitude 5V4) was approximately $6m; if so, would a simUar earthquake at the present time cause dam49 of Telecom's age amounting to $24m. (14) Did an earthquake of magnitude 6Vi strike the a Kingston-Beachport area of South Australia in 1897 producing ground movement more than 10 times as great as the 1954 earthquake; if so, were an earthquake of this magnitude to now occur in Adelaide, would the damage be many Earthquakes times in excess of $24m. (Question No. 5404) Mr ANTHONY - The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Study of the effect of distant earthquakes on long period structures is relatively new, however, awareness of this phenomenon has increased in recent years. The Commonwealth Government established its first seismic station in in 1949 and now owns or assists with the operation of 50 seismic stations in all States and the Northern Territory. These stations are located on a priority basis according to estimates of the seismic risk. Susceptible regions are provided with more stations than relatively low risk areas such as Queensland where there are three stations. (2) Commentary Clause C3.2 of the SAA Earthquake Code refers specifically to the need to take into account the long period effects of distant earthquakes on long period structures and Darwin is given as a case in point. (3) The risk to facilities constructed on or near the Northern Australian coastline due the Banda Sea, is less than that due to lateral forces arising from tropical cyclones which would probably dominate the design. However, further inland, where the tropical cyclone risk is diminished the effects of these distant earthquakes on long period structures may well be of practical importance. (4) Data on ground motion and structure response are highly desirable to assist engineers to design earthquake resistant structures and to assess whether the structures they have designed are performing in accordance with expectations. (5) Accelerographs are installed in all new multi-storey buildings in California but there are many high earthquake risk areas of the world where the installation of such instrumentation is not mandatory. (6) Assessment of seismic risk must necessarily be an approximation. (7) Coverage in Queensland States. However as indicated in (1) above Queensland is considered a relatively low risk area. (8) The operations of the universities and the management of their finances do not fall within my ministerial responsibUities. (9) and (10)1 cannot comment on the universities' or any simUar institutions' interval management and finances. (11) Yes. (12) It is essential in many instances to bring signals from a remote detector to a more accessible recorder, and the actual cost of installing and maintaining dedicated land lines is high. Whether the cost should be subsidised by other users is a matter for the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. (13) I understand that the 1954 Adelaide earthquake (magnitude about 5.5 on the Richter scale) cost the insurance companies about £4m (that is $8m). It is not possible to predict the value of damage which an earthquake might now cause. (14) The ground movement associated with the 1897 earthquake would have been about 10 times as great as the 1954 earthquake. Again, it is not possible to predict the of the damage which a simUar earthquake might now cause. Vietnam Veterans: Agent Orange",174
367,Mr LES JOHNSON ,MEDICAL SERVICES BY MY DEPARTMENT,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: Is he able to state on what occasions Australian servicemen were exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange in Vietnam. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Not fuUy at this stage. My Department started work on this subject last December and consistent with thoroughness. The task is a very large one, involving the matching of data about where and when Agent Orange was used by the Americans, with data (which has to be cuUed from records and can involve voluminous research) about the whereabouts of Australian units and subunits at relevant times. The work is basic to studies such as the one announced on 31 March 1980 by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and wdl of course be made avaUable to those engaged in that study.

(2) No submissions were received by Telecom to incorporate a non-English help section in the 1979 Wollongong directory, but arrangements are in hand, in conjunction with value the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, to include this information in the 1981 Wollongong directory. (3) Telecom and the Department of Immigration and Eth(Question No. 5421) nic Affairs also have in train a joint national review of migrant information requirements for telephone directories.

(2) What is the world average ratio of persons under 15 to persons over 15 years of age. (3) What are the comparable figures for Australia included in parts (1) and (2). (4) What is the estimated number of persons (a) in the world and (b) in Australia receiving less than (i) the world average income, (U) the estimated world minimum subsistence income, (Ui) the income of a supporting parent and one child both dependent solely on Social Security Depanment benefits in Australia, assuming that one third of the single parent family income goes to the chUd and (iv) the poverty Une income recognised by the Australian Government for persons (A) aged under 15 and (B) aged over 15 years. (5) What is the estimated cost of providing world minimum subsistence income to those of current market prices for the cheapest avaUable resources and (b) after use of technical aid now avaUable to maximise self-sufficiency. (6) What percentage of the costs in pan (5) could be met by increasing Australia's foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of Australia's gross national product. EmptyHere member's question is as follows: World average income is based on the Gross National Product at Market Prices statistics which conceptually should include the value of Non-Marketed consumption. Thefiguresrelatedto the World Statistics have been convened from US to Australian Dollars using the applicable DAC Exchange Rate (1977 SUS 1 = SA0.9017). 118 countries out of a total below the world average. The estimated cost of providing the World Average Income to those not receiving it could be met if those 60 countries who are above the World Average Income increased their Gross National Product per cent of it to Foreign Aid Programs. $15,994 mUlion of aid was provided to Developing Countries and Multilateral Agencies by DAC Member Countries in 1978. This figure represents only 0.42 per cent of the estimated cost of ensuring that the 118 countries are inreceiptof a per capita income equal to that of the World Average Income. In order to achieve parity it would be necessaiy to increase the volume of aid 239 times. In detail: (1) The world average per capita income was $1,731 in 1977 (latest avaUable aged 15 years and under is excluded the income would amount to $2,708. (2) World average ratio of persons under 15 years of age to persons over 15 years of age is 1:1.8. (3) In 1977 Australia's Gross National Product per capita was $6,572 but, if the population under 15 years of age is excluded the income would amount to $8,952. The average ratio of persons under 15 years of age to persons over 15 years of age in Australia 1:2.8. Overseas Aid (4a) Of the total world population of 4047 million it is estimated that 2924 million persons are receiving less (Question No. 5454) than the World Average Income. (4b) No one in Australia either in full time employment or, in receipt of social security, was on an income below that of the world average. Only 190,000 part-time workers in Australia arereceivingincomes less than the world average. Figures relating to the estimated world minimum subsistence income are not avaUable. The Australian income of a sole parent, with one child both solely dependent on social security benefits was $3,344 per annum. Assuming that one-third of this income goes to the chUd the remaining two-thirds represents $2,230 per annum (which is well above the world average per capita income of $1,731). There are no 'poverty Une' incomefiguresofficially accepted by any Australian Government for either persons over or under 15 years of age. (5) Figures for world minimum subsistence income are not avaUable but the estimated cost of providing the World Average Income of $ 1,731 to those not receiving it is $3,823,000 mUlion. not receiving it (a) in terms (6) If Australian Foreign Aid was increased to 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product only 0.008 per cent of the costs in part 5 could be met from this increase. It should be noted however that the World Average Income is not a clear measure of real poverty as costs of Uving (e.g. the cost of purchasing a standard basket of goods) vary greatly between countries. In many countries the purchasing power of an income of $1,731 would be extremely high. It is also inappropriate to equate development assistance with transfer payments made in domestic social service programs, since effectively appUed development assistance contributes positively to self sustaining development. In the case of development assistance the long term rise in income should therefore be greater than the actual amount expended. of 178 have per capita incomes Parliamentary Reform (Question No. 5467) Mr Holding asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: by 66 per cent and allocated 40 (1) Has hereceivedrepresentations from the Young Liberals regarding (a) questions on the Notice Paper of both Houses, (b) changes to Parliamentaiy committees, (c) citizen-initiated referenda, (d) presentation of annual reports to Parliament by Federal Departments and authorities, (e) 'sunset' legislation, (f) private members' bills, (g) free avaUabUity of Hansard and (h) the decline of Parliamentary authority over executive government.

(2) What is the numerical breakdown by industry of these do tradesmen. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 6,336 tradesmen with qualifications acceptable in Australia arrived from January 1979 to February 1980. However, statistics on arrivals since Januaiy 1979 do not separate migrants selected under NUMAS from those who applied under policy prior to 1 January 1979. They also include tradesmen arriving from New Zealand under the trans-Tasman freeflowarrangements. (2) Statistics on the numerical breakdown by industry are not available. The following table shows the number of tradesmen in each skilled occupational category who arrived from January 1979 to February 1980: Number of skilled Occupational category tradesmen Skilled mining occupations 23 97S Skilled metal and electrical trades . . . . 3,372 Other skilled trades 1,986 6,356 Immigration: Numerical Multifactor Assessment System (Question No. 5717) Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Imof $ 1,200.migration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 March 1980: How many persons have (a) applied to immigrate to (Question No. 5708) Australia, and (2) been rejected as immigrants under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System (NUMAS) scheme since its introduction in Januaiy 1979.

Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, or upon notice, on 26 March 1980: Has a decision been made on replacements for the 155mm and 105mm artillery, due to enter service in 1980 (as indicated on page 22, para 73 of the Australian Defence White Paper presented to the House if not, when will consideration be completed. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable of radio-active member's question is as follows: There are two errors in the honourable member's question: (a) replacement is not be be made of the present Army 5.5 inch medium gun by a 155mm gun; (b) the White Paper made reference to the introduction into service of howitzers and medium guns ""by the early 1980s"" not ""in 1980"" as the honourable member suggests. Concerning the replacement of the 5.5 inch medium gun, I refer the honourable member to my press statement of 12 May 1980 which announced, together with other details, that negotiations on procurement of the US M198 155mm Howitzer to replace the 5.5 inch gun would begin in the near future. Studies and overseas developments in the period since the 1976 Defence White Paper have led to the judgment that Army's present 105mm guns will be readily sustainable and effective for considerably longer than was then expected. The ume is now approaching however that, despite this greater life expectancy, acuons will be necessary to ensure that opportunities for Australian production can be adequately developed. My Department is pursuing these questions now. Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 March 1980: What action has been taken on the announced proposal for provision of anti-tank weapons for entry into service in 1981 (as indicated in the Australian Defence White Paper (page 22, para 71) presented to the House on 4 November 1976).

(2) Is he able to state whether the aircraft was (a) having problems with its nosewheels and (b) carrying radio-active material. Artillery (3) If the aircraft was carrying radio-active material, (a) what radio-active materials were contained in the cargo, (b) (Question No. 5723) what quantities of each were involved, (c) is his Department any authority under his control carrying out an inquiry into the incident, (d) what were the findings of any inquiry held and (e) what safety precautions were taken by airport or airline groundstaff, fire and other emergency staff to ensure that (i) general safety and emergency procedures were followed and (ii) radio-active material did not escape on 4 November 1976); from its containers. (4) What (a) air navigation laws apply to the air carriage and (b) types of containers for radio-active materials are required by air navigation laws.",189
381,Mr HUNT ,SSGT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the newspaper reports to which the honourable member has referred. (2) (a) and (b) The aircraft concerned, a Boeing 747 operating as Pan American Flight 871 reported severe nosewheel shimmy had occurred during the take-off at Nadi and that there could be some difficulty with the landing at Sydney. It also reported that it was carrying radio-active materials in its cargo. In the event the aircraft made a normal landing at Sydney. (3) (a) and (b) The aircraft was carrying radio-active materials described in the Air WaybUl as: (i) Cobalt 57 solid 0.108 curies index 0.5 yellow label II packed in lead container, (U) Six pieces marked 5 PO 210 radio nucUde. Three pieces 0.01 MCi, 0.036 MCi. Index not applicable to this group. Yellow label I. (c) An investigation is being carried out into the incident. (d) The investigation has revealed that there was no damage to the nosewheel and that the radio-active materials were being carried in complete compliance with the relevant Anti-tank Weapons regulations. (Question No. 5726) (e) (i) and (n) The Atomic Energy Commission, Lucas Heights, to whom some of the radio-active materials were consigned, was alerted and they sent representatives to the airport to deal with any problems which might arise in respect of the radio-active materials. In addition, three ambulances, nine fire brigade units, police (including the police rescue squad) and an airport medical team were in attendance when the aircraft landed. The containers used to carry radio-active materials are designed to withstand damage in accidents. (4) (a) In Australia, radio-active materials are carried in accordance with the requirements of Air Navigation Orders Part 33 which require compUance with the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Regulations for the Safe Transpon of Radio-active Materials. These regulations are also applicable throughout the world and packages of radio-active materials cannot be accepted for carriage by air Material unless they comply fully with the regulations. (Question No. 5736) (b) Containers used for the carriage of radio-active materials must meet the specifications laid down in the IAEA Regulations. Self-extinguishing Cigarettes (Question No. 5747) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports that several fire associations are campaigning in the United States of America to encourage manufacturers to produce and market self-extinguishing cigarettes that self-extinguish within 3 minutes of thefirstpuff. (2) In view of the number offirescaused by cigarettes, the resultant cost to the community, sidered proposals to encourage the production of selfextinguishing cigarettes. - Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Commonwealth Fire Board is concerned primarily with fire protection in Commonwealth departments and authorities. The Board has, however, sought information from the United States of America onresearchinto selfextinguishing cigarettes undertaken by fire associations and other bodies there. Under the Trade Practices Act safety standards for consumer products may be established. When the relevant information isreceivedfrom the Umted States it will be passed on to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs for referral to the Commonwealth/State Consumer Products Advisory Committee, the body which considers and advises my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on those matters. Radar and Navigation Equipment Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: When will the (a) locating radar, (b) surveillance radars, (c) navigational equipment and (d) sensors proposed on page 23 para 75 of the Australian Defence White Paper, presented to the House on 4 November 1976, be available to the Army. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b), (d) Selection of the mortar locating equipment and surveillance radars and sensors has been narrowed down to major contenders. Evaluation of competing equipments is planned to be carried out in the next twelve months. It is presently planned that the mortar locating equipment and the surveillance radars 1984-85. Because of equipment priorities, Army does not now propose acquisition of a gun locating radar in the Program period.

Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: What stage has been reached in proposed acquisition of (a) short, (b) medium and (c) long range anti-tank weapons referred to on page 22, para 71 of the Australian Defence White Paper presented to the House on 4 November 1976. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The advent of composite armour on tanks recently introduced into service by several nations has degraded the effectiveness of current anti-armour weapons to such an extent that major nations are now applying increased effort to the development of the next generation of anti-armour weapons. As a consequence of these technological developments, it has been decided that the Army should postpone consideration of any major acquisition of an anti-armour capabiUty and until the new weapon systems become avaUable. has his Department conConsideration is, however, being given to a limited antiarmour capability based on currently available weapons. These proposals are intended to satisfy shorter term requirements and to bridge the gap until the new generation weapons become avaUable in the late 1980s. They will be given wider consideration in my Department in the very near future. Training of Nurses (Question No. 5759) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: WUl he support funding for tertiary college training of nurses in central and/or north Queensland as requested by the Queensland Government.

The old township (as distinct from the new township of Leigh Creek South) will continue to receive the existing repeater-type television service for at least Anti-tank Weapons twelve months, that is, the time required to complete (Question No. 5756) the relocation. 2. The new township of Leigh Creek South will be provided with an interim television translator service relayed from the existing repeater station. This will be replaced with a permanent service upon completion of the relocation. The recent decision relating to the relocation of the airport has compounded the difficulty of finding a permanent site for the new translator. When a suitable site is found, the Postal and Telecommunications Department will submit a detailedrecommendationon the television service to be provided for the new township. The Department will be liaising with the Electricity Trust of South Australia on the question of funding thefinalinstallation. It is intended that the programme for the service will be obtained via Intelsat IV.

This Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health in its first report Proposals for Change in Administration and Delivery of Programs and Services (paragraphs 160-172) considered support for international sport and nauonal sporting bodies. The report identified tasks in sports development which the Task Force felt were the responsibUity of the Commonwealth. (2) The report was used in the development of the Government's Sports Development Program which was introduced in 1977-78 with an appropriation of $lm and which, in 1979-80 allocated $2m for sport. Thereportalso supponed the recommendations in the report of the Australian Sports Institute Study Group which was tabled in the Parliament on 29 April, 1976. The Government announced in January this year, the establishment of the Australian Sports Institute which is scheduled to open in Canberra early in 1981. Aborigines at Maralinga: Exposure to Radiation Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 1 April 1980: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to statements reported in the Perth Daily News of 27 December 1976 by EmptyHere who served at MaraUnga, SA, that many Aboriginal people walked across restricted areas contaminated by radiation, that when found there, they were detained and put through a decontamination process that lasted 2 to 3 days and that RAF personnel were always bringing them in. (2) Can the Minister say whether Aboriginal people were detained for decontamination at the Maralinga Range; if so, how many persons were detained. (3) Were any measures taken to monitor the subsequent health of these persons; if so, what measures were taken.",191
383,Mr ANTHONY ,SSGT,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the followvelopment ing answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes: I havereadthe report in the Perth Daily News of 27 December 1976. (2) See reply of the Minister for Nauonal Development to Question No. 2827 (Hansard, 22 February 1979, page 337). WhUe the Maralinga Range was in operation, Aboriginals approaching the Range were intercepted by ground patrols (Question No. 5781) and arrangements made for their return to their communities. Examination of Commonwealth records to date has identified only one instance of Aboriginals entering a contaminated area during operation of the Maralinga Range. This at the Montreal Olympic Games; occurred in May 19S7 and involved a group of four Aboriginals camping overnight near one of the test sites. They were discovered the following day and examined by Australian radiation safety officials who detected minor contamination which wasremovedby washing. It was concluded that there was no possibiUty of any radiation injury having occurred. (3) No. Atomic Weapons Tests at Maralinga and Emu (Question No. 5783) Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 1 April 1980: How many Australians participated (1) as members of the armed services; (2) as Commonwealth Police; and (3) in other capacities in British atomic weapons tests and subsequent experiments and clean-up operations at Maralinga and Emu, South Australia, between 1953 and 1967.",192
384,Mr ANTHONY ,SSGT,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that the number of Australians, Service and civilian, who were employed at Maralinga and Emu between 1953 and 1967 in suppon of the British test programs and subsequent clean-up varied according to whether testing was in progress or the Range was being kept on a care and maintenance basis. At its highest during the 1956 trials the Australian suppon populauon at Maralinga was 371. The more typical Australian suppon population during the test campaigns was 220 to 250. Between campaigns, 40 to 50 person(Question No. 5782) nel wererequiredto maintain support facUities. It would not be possible to establish the precise overall number of Australians who were employed as Maralinga and Emu without a search of many thousands of individual servicerecords,but on the basis of the above figures it would appear unlikely that the total number of individuals involved reached 2000. Operation Brumby at Maralinga (Question No. 5784) Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 1 April 1980: Did any Australian (a) serviceman; or (b) civdians participate in the 1967 Operation Brumby clean-up of areas and facilities contaminated with plutonium and other radioactive isotopes at the Maralinga Range in South Australia.",192
385,Mr ANTHONY ,SSGT,"The Minister for National Deand Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that Operation Brumby was carried out by the British Royal Engineers and Australian personnel provided suppon as they did while the MaraUnga Range was in use. See answer to Question 5783. Atomic Weapons Tests in South Australia Mr Uren asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 1 April 1980: (1) Have any claims for compensation been received by his Department alleging that disease or disability resulted from employment at the British atomic weapons tests and subsequent experiments and clean-up operations in South Australia; if so, how many. (2) In each case, what was the (a) date the claim was received by his Department and (b) cause of death or the nature of the disabUity. (3) In how many cases was it alleged that radiation exposure resulted in death or disabUity. (4) Which claims have been determined and in each case what was the determinadon. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Seven claims for compensation received by my Department have been identified as relating to conditions edly contracted as aresultof the British atomic tests held in Australia. In addition a claim was referred to my Department for certain informationrelatingto a claim lodged by the widow ofan ex-officer of the Bureau of Customs, Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. It is possible that there could have been other claims, but if so they have not beenreadUyidentifiable asrelatingto the atomic testing. (2) , (3) and (4) DetaUs of the individual claims are as follows: Claim 1-Receive d from window 30 August 1971. Condition claimed was for 'carcinomatosis, exposure to radioactive dust'.

Aborigines at Maralinga: Exposure to Radiation (Question No. 5786) Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the allegMinister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 15 April 1980: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to statements reported in the Perth Daily News 27 December 1976 by Mr Patrick Connolly, a former Royal Air Force Corporal who served at MaraUnga, S.A., that many Aboriginal people walked across restricted areas contaminated by radiation, and when found there, they were detained and put through a decontamination process that lasted 2 to 3 days and that R.A.F. personnel were always bringing them in. (2) Has the Department of Aboriginal Affairs investigated these claims; if so, what are the results of the investigations. to exposure to radio(3) Is there any evidence which suggests that Aboriginal people have suffered disease or disability as a consequence of exposure to radiation resulting from British atomic weapon tests in South Australia.",192
386,Mr VINER ,SSGT,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) 1I have now read the report in the Perth Daily News of 27 December 1976. (2) See reply of the Minister for National Development and Energy to Question No. 5782. (3) No. But I have written to the South Australian Minister for Health asking whether there is any such evidence and the Minister has announced that a review of the medical records for 1973-1979 for people living in the remote reserves, Yalata and the North-West Reserve, had shown no abnormal incidence rates for birth deformities or cancer. However, the South Australian Health Commission is setting up an investigation in the remote reserves directed at defining any trend of increased incidence of radiationrelated diseases. Warnings on Packages (Question No. 5792) Dr Cass asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 April 1980: ( l ) Has his Department taken any action to alert immigrants to the dangers of using products which contain (a) poisonous substances, (b) explosives, (c) asbestos and (d) dangerous mixtures, and any other dangerous substances; if so, what action. (2) Has his Depanment taken any steps to make other Depanments aware of the need for bior multi-lingual warnings on packages. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1. (a) and (d) In past years the Depanment has issued warnings to immigrants about posionous and dangerous substances. These have included recorded talks on safety for radio and informadon for publication in the ethnic press. Aspects of safety, including warnings about poisons, are covered in initial settlement program courses for newly arrived immigrants. In the near future, my Depanment will publish an orientation/information manual for immigrants attending English courses under the Adult Migrant Education Program. This manual has 20 sections on aspects of life in Australia. In one section, mation on poisonous products, including poisons found in and around the home, imponant rules to remember concerning poisonous products and what to do in a poisons emergency. The manual has been translated into 10 languages and will be available at migrant education centres in hostels and community centres. (b) Advice on industrial safety is included in the new orientation/information manual provided under the Adult Migrant Education Program. This, in pan, tells immigrants to make sure that they know and understand safety warning signs in work areas and to contact the safety officer or union if they have any problems or questions about the signs they see. (c) Immigrants have not been alerted directly by my Depanment to the dangers of using products containing asbestos. However, the wide publicity given to the reported harmful effects of contact with the media in general should ensure that the Australian public is informed. 2. My Department has been in communication with other Departments on matters relating to toxic substances: on specinc proposals about labelhng and in general discussion about the main issues. 3. In particular, discussions have been held between my Department and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs about the possibUity of introducing multi-lingual warnings and instructions for consumer products. 4. It is anticipated that cluding radio and television) form the migrant community about toxic substances. In this activity my Department would be influenced by the Poisons Schedule (Standing) Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council which has as its terms of reference . . . to enquire into scheduling, labelling, packaging and advertising in the public media, of drugs, poisons and other substances hazardous to human health in the States and Territories and to make recommendations to the Council through the Public Health Advisory Committee. My Department has already formulated certain proposals about bUingual labelling of prescribed medicines dispensed in Australia. 5. My Department is ready to advise industry and assist wherever possible in the preparation and translation of instructions concerning the safe use of toxic and other dangerous chemical substances. Commonwealth Employment Service Office at Toronto, New South Wales Mr James asked the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 1 April 1980: (1) Were there approximately 2000 school leavers in the area from Fennels Bay to Morisset, NSW, in 1979.

This requirement of the Government's safeguards policy had therefore created unnecessary difficulties unrelated to the field of safeguards. (2) Yes.

(2) In my answer to Question No. 4843,1 indicated that the conclusion of arrangements for the transfer of prisoners with other countries will have to await the outcome of the negotiations for a scheme for the transfer of prisoners within Australia. Proposals for the development of arrangements for the transfer of prisoners between Commonwealth counsioners tries were discussed at the Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting held in Winnipeg in 1978 and again at the Law Ministers Meeting in Barbados from At the latter meeting Ministers endorsed in principle the suggestion that a scheme for the transfer of prisoners should developed and have, as its basis, the consent of the countries involved, and in particular, the consent of the prisoner self. Ministers also agreed that the process should condnue through the Commonwealth Secretary General and on a regional basis. WhUe it would be preferimmigrants able, for practical reasons, to await the outcome of the conditions applying sultations on an arrangement for the transfer within Australia, the Commonwealth is quite prepared to the income distribution ofinformation engage in negotiations with other cluding transfer schemes with Australia, particularly other Commonwealth countries and our immediate neighbours in the South-East Asian and Pacific areas. Late in 1978 preliminary discussions were held with visiting Canadian officers on the principles on which a scheme between our two countries could be based. Subsequently cussions with New Zealand were intitiated. I propose those discussions should continue.

Nurse Education and Training (Question No. 5885) (Question No. 5889) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Has the Government taken decisions on the recto be ommendations contained in the Sax Report on Nurse Education and Training presented to the House on 25 October 1978; if so, whichrecommendationsare to be implemented. (2) Have discussions on the report and its recommendations been held between the Commonwealth and the States; if so, have any major differences emerged. (3) Has his attention been drawn to areportedanswer to a question in the Queensland Parliament by the Queensland Health Minister, Sir William Knox, stating that the Queensland Government had endorsed the proposals of the report regarding the offering of basic nurse education programs in CoUeges of Advanced Education for implementation as soon as the Commonwealth Government, through the Tertiary Education Commission, has made the necessary (Question No. 5887) funds avaUable. (4) Has the Govemmentreceivedrequestsfor funds for these programs; if so, when wiU a decision be made. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 expect to announce the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Sax Report on Nurse Education and Training in the near future. (2) State Ministers for Health and Education have provided comments on the Report and its recommendations. The Advanced Education Council of the Tertiary Education Commission has not held detaUed discussions with the States on the future of basic nurse education in colleges of advanced education. The Council has taken the view that it would be premature to hold such discussions until the Government's decisions are known. (3) and (4) Requests by Queensland or any other State for funds for additional basic nurse education courses in colleges of advanced education will be considered when the Government has taken decisions on the recommendations of the Sax Repon.

Australia. The initial pur(2) If so, (a) who wasresponsiblefor importing these substances and (b) what was the (i) date and (U) origin of the impons. (3) Were the substances involved analysed for his Depanment when they were imponed; if so, (a) by whom and (b) what were the results of these analyses. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My understanding is that 'Agent Orange' is a United States military term for a particular mixture of two herbicides prepared for use by the United States Armed Services. There is no record of any product of that name being imponed into Australia. The substances known as 2-4-5,T and 2-4.D, which were ingredients of'Agent Orange', have been imported into Australia from ume to time and also have been, and soil are, manufactured here. (2) Data on imports supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics but excluding names of importers because of confidentiality restraints is as set out in the following table. Positive identification of imports is available only for importations of these components since 23 September 1972. Products imported which may or may not have contained these components have not been included.

However, in 1971 a shipment of 2, 4, 5 Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid Butyl Ester was analysed by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory for tariff classification purposes at the request of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. It was reported by the AGAL as chemicaUy defined as 2,4,5 Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid Butyl Ester and was correcdy entered for Customs tariff purposes. International Botanical Congress",199
397,Mr HAYDEN ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to plans that the International Botanical Congress is to be held in Australia in 1981. (2) If so, can he say whether, in accepting an invitation to host the Congress, the host country is required to guarantee free access to all scientists who wish to attend, regardless of their nationality or countiy of origin. (3) Is he able to indicate whether the USSR hosted the previous Congress; if so, did it scrupulously observe this requirement and admit nationals of countries not recognised by the Soviet Government. (4) WUl he give an assurance that the Australian Government will place no restrictions on the acceptabUity of scienEsters of) tists to attend the 1981 Congress based on their nationality Origin or country of origin; if so, how does this relate to the current ban on scientific interchange with the USSR. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. The Australian Academy ofScience wiU host the 1981 Congress under the auspices of the International Union of Biological Sciences, a member of the non-governmental International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). ICSU has a basic policy of non-discrimination which affirms 'the rights of scientists throughout the world to adhere to or associate with international scientific activity without regard to race, religion, poltiical phUosophy, ethnic origin, citizenship, language, or sex'. The host institution is expected to do all in its power to adhere to ICSU's pohcy but is not required to guarantee free access to aU scientists wishing to attend. (3) The USSR hosted the last Congress in Leningrad in 1975. (4) The Australian Government is not prepared to United Kingdom guarantee, several months in advance, free access to all scientists wishing to attend the Congress. (As indicated in my Japan reply to Question No. 2 above, the host institution is not itself required to offer such a guarantee.) Any appUcations for Austria visas submitted by Soviet citizens wishing to attend the Congress will be considered on their merits in terms of the AusEast Germany traUan Government's poUcies at the time. Conciliation and Arbitration Appeals Federal Republic of Germany (Question No. 5897) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) How many appeals to the Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission against awards, decisions, orders orrefusalsto make an order made by a member of the Commission, were made in the last 3 years. (2) How many of these appeals were upheld. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following table detaUs the number of appeals lodged, determined, upheld or partiaUy upheld. Thefiguresfor the number of appeals determined include a number of appeal cases carried over from previous years.

398,Mr HOWARD ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, in para 6.14 of the Repon which is submitted to the previous Government in May 1975. However, in its immediately following Budget the then Government effected a major change in the basis of the personal income tax system as a result of which, inter alia, most of the concessional deductions (including that relating to funeral expenses) became, effectively inoperative for the large majority of taxpayers.

399,Mr HOWARD ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In para 6.8 of the Repon which it submitted to the vious Government, the Mathews Committee said that if the Government wished to reduce the real values of the life surance and superannuation and education expenses conthat cessions, it should do so explicitly, rather than let them reduced through inflation.

(2) Was the sum involved $300 in 1975-76; if so, is it still the same.",201
400,Mr HOWARD ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) In para 6.9 of its Repon of May 1975 to the previous Government, the Mathews Committee noted that arguments had been put for abolition of the concessional allowance for private rates and land taxes. It went on to say that if the Government wished to remove or phase out the concession gradually, it was preferable to do so explicitly, rather than rely on inflation. If, however, the then current real value of the concession were thought appropriate, the Committee considered it would be logical for the ceiling on the concession to be indexed. However, in its immediately following Budget the then Government effected a major change in the basis of the personal income tax system as a result of which, inter alia, most of the concessional deductions (including that relating to rates and taxes) became, effectively, inoperative for the large majority of taxpayers.

(2) If there is any substance in the repons can he state what would be the net annual cost (loss) to the Commonwealth Trading Bank of this transfer.",201
402,Mr HOWARD ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Telecom Australia has advised that it has transferred its Head Office drawings account in New South Wales from the Commonwealth Trading Bank to the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, (b) I am unable to comment on the level of the turnover through the account concerned; statutory authorities are not required to publish detailed information of that nature. (2) This raises a matter falling within the area of bankercustomer relationships and because of the confidentiality of such relationships it would not be appropriate to seek informadon of this nature from the Commonwealth Trading Bank. Commonwealth Property in Hornsby and Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) What real estate property is owned by the Commonwealth Government in the (a) Shire of Hornsby and (b) Kur-ing-gai Council area, New South Wales.

(2) If not, why not. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The question of a National Informadon Office has been and is being examined in the context of several recent and current inquiries. A resolution has not yet been reached. That there is no governmental agency called a 'National Information Office' does not, however, mean there is no activity in thisfield.For example CSIRO is responding to more than one quarter of a million questions each year, from all sections of the Australian community, through its information offices in Melbourne and Sydney and its Divisions across Australia. All CSIRO Divisions are concerned with maintaining close relations with others active in their fields, whether in universities, industry or elsewhere, to improve information and technology transfer. (b) Taxation incentives for these purposes exist under Section 73A of the Income Tax Assessment Act. A report and recommendations on Tax incentives for Research and Development are being prepared by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) and are nearing completion. (c) Yes. Oceanographic Research Vessel Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Will the Government make a decision concerning the purchase of an oceanographic research vessel in view of Australia's new 200 mile marine economic and the urgent need for comprehensive oceangraphic research; if so, when. (2) Even if ordered immediately, would an oceanographic research ship take approximately 2 years to build. (3) Will he recommend that any oceanographic research vessel be built in Australia. Mr Thomson-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) In a press statement on 15 April 1980 the Prime Minister advised that the Commonwealth Government establish a Marine Science Centre in Hobart at a cost of about $25m including $9m for a research vessel. The research vessel to be constructed would be capable of ing multi purpose oceanographic research and able to range around the Australian continent. (2) Yes. (3) Tenders will be caUed in October/November 1980 for the construction of an Oceanus class oceanographic research vessel both in Australia and overseas. AU tenders received will be carefully considered prior to the placing of a firm contract. High Court of Australia: Judges' Staff Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) What staff are avaUable to Judges of the High Court of Australia. (2) What wage is each staff member entitled to receive. (3) What was the cost of (a) air fares, (b) traveUing allowance and (c) expense claims for each staff member in (i) 1978-79 and (U) the period 1 July 1979 to31 March 1980.",201
403,Mr VINER ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Chief Justice has sonal Secretaries, and a Tipstaff, as his personal staff; each Justice other than the Chief Justice has an Associate (Class 6), a Personal Secretary, and a Tipstaff, as personal staff. (2) Associate Class 7-517,311-$18,347; Associate Class 6-$ 15,766-$ 16,799; Personal Secretary-$12,542-$13,211; Ttpstaff-$ 10,309-$ 10,733. (3) (a) Air fares in respect 1978-79 and $17,053 in the period from 1 July 1979 to 31 March 1980.

(b) Travelling allowance in respect of Associates cost $26,239 in 1978-79 and $22,521 in the period from 1 July 1979 to 31 March 1980. In these two periods, travelling allowance in respect of Personal Secretaries cost $8,547 and $ 13,288 respectively, while traveUing allowance iiirespectof Tipstaves cost $ 14,826 and $ 18,454 respectively.

Immigration Information (Question No. 5920) Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) How many cables requested by immigration appUcants for the purpose of obtaining information, have been sent since the introduction of immigration service charges on 1 November 1979. (2) How many answers to these cables have been received. (3) What is the averagetimelapse between a cable being is to sent and an answer being received. (4) What explanation is there for situations in which one performor more cables are sent, and noreplyis received. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1700 cables were sent during the period 1 November, 1979, to 30 April, 1980. (2) It is not possible to indicate precisely how many answers have been received. Many cables do notrequirea specific reply, rather they provide information to an overseas post which facilitates the early processing of a particular case. For cables requiring an answer replies have been received within the general time-frame set out in (3). (Question No. 5915) (3) The averagetime-lapsebetween a cable being sent and an answer beingreceivedis a little more than one week. (4) As indicated in (2) many cables do notrequirea reply. In other cases action or replies can be delayed for significant periods of time because of difficulties in arranging for and/or conducting interviews with persons in remote areas, or in cases where there are unusual processing problems associated with such matters as medical checks or assessment of trade quaUfications. Public Service: Nationality and Citizenship Requirements (Question No. 5922) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: an Associate (Class 7), two Per(1) Are requirements for (a) employment and (b) permanency in terms of nationaUty and citizenship status consistent in Departments of the Australian PubUc Service. (2) If not, will he undertake to have the PubUc Service Act amended to specify minimum eligibilityrequirementsin the matters of nationality and citizenship covering all Commonwealth employing bodies. of Associates cost $17,523 in Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under section 34 (a) is not eligible for appointment to the Australian Public Service as an officer unless he ary employees are not required to meet this nationality requirement. The provisions are consistent across all depanments and those statutory authorities whose staff are employed under the Public Service Act. I would note that the nationality requirement in the non-Public Service Act area of Australian Government employment varies. Some statutory authorities have a British subject requirement, with or without a power of waiver vested in the Minister. Others, including the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, do not have any nationality requirement. (2) The Government has under attenuon the possibiUty of amendment of secdon 34 (a) of the Public Service Act and options for change include Australian citizenship requirement. The matter is a complex one, however, and the Government needs to weigh carefully matters such as the desirability of consistent arrangements across the whole arena of Commonwealth employment, equity for various groups in the community and the recruitment needs of the Australian PubUc Service. 411 Supply Company Depot at Gladstone, South Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: (1) What is the present situation regarding plans announced on 4 September 1979 to close the 411 Supply Company Depot at Gladstone, S.A. (2) When is it anticipated that the closure will take effect. (3) Have any arrangements been made regarding the future employment of civilian employees on the (a) salaried and (b) wages staff as a result of any closure of this depot; if so what are they. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable could member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) It is now planned that 411 Supply Company Gladstone will close in early 1981. Ammunition Gladstone will be redeployed from the end of 1980 following completion of essential technical and security work on the buUdings to be occupied at Penfield. (3) With the exception of one employee who will retire prior to the closure of the Gladstone depot, all other civilian employees will be offered alternative employment. Where relocation is involved, removal and where applicable, allowances under Public Service Regulation 97 will be met from Departmental funds. Enlistments in Defence Force Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: (1) How many persons applied to enlist in the (a) Australian Regular Army, (b) Royal Australian Navy and (c) RAAF Reserves during each of the last 3 years.

Ammunition for Leopard Tanks (Question No. 5936) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, Australia upon notice, on 17 April 1980: (Question No. 5932) (1) What is the current level ofreservestock of ammunition for Leopard tanks. (2) Have satisfactory arrangements been made for continuing supplies of ammunition. (3) Has the production of this ammunition in Australian munitions factories been studied; if so, with what results., Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Army has yet to undertake capital procurement of reserve stocks of ammunition for Leopard (i.e. operational reserves rather than stocks for training). However, holdings of various natures of ammunition used to support training be used in an operational situation. The level of such holdings is not related to contingency requirements but rather to the requirement to establish and maintain at proficiency in tank gunnery. The actual quantities of ammustocks at nition held is classified information. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. The requirement is for five (5) types of operational and two (2) types of practice round. Local pro- duction capability is being established for the two practice and one of the operational types. Design development is proceeding in local production of two further types of opertransfer expenses and, ational round.

(3) Can he say whether other (a) herbicides, (b) insecticides and (c) other chemicals were used in the immediate vicinity of the Nui Dat headquarters Australia's involvement in South detaUs. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable programs member's question is as follows: (1) Repeated searches have uncovered no record of any operational use in Vietnam by Australia of any herbicide containing 2-4-5.T. The other substance, 2-4.D, was one of the ingredients of the herbicide known as Tordon SOD. sufferers Record has been found of the purchase of some 13 x 45 gal-organisations lon drums of Tordon 50D for use Tordon was sprayed around the perimeter of the Task Force area. (2) There is no record that any tanker, having been used the to transport pesdcides, was used subsequendy to transport were domestic water. Given the safety instructions in force, the Handicapped proposition is inherently unUkely. (3) Numerous chemicals, including herbicides, insecticides, disinfectants, detergents, repellants, water purifiers, camouflage cream, and pharmaceuticals were in routine use at Nui Dat. The ones mentioned were used for the greater comfort, better health or enhanced safety from the enemy of Australian servicemen. Multiple Sclerosis (Question No. 6074) Mr Holding asked the Minister representing ations the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 1 approved May 1980: Grants to Organisations catering exclusively Organisation Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria, Camberwell Multiple Sclerosis Society of Queensland, Dutton Park Creek 'Cottage Activity Therapy Centre, Lenah Valley, Tasmania (1) Have Federal grants been made in each of the last 5 financial years to assist in the provision of services and (Question No. 6070) amenities to sufferers of multiple sclerosis; if so, (a) how many and (b) what was the (i) nature and (U) amount of each of the grants.

413,Mr HUNT ,PENSIONS AND BENEFITS PAID OVERSEAS,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable during any time of member's question: Vietnam; if so, what are the (1) Yes, however there are no Commonwealth funding directed solely to organisations catering exclusively for people with multiple sclerosis. In regard to my Department the main potential source of funding is through the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act. There are currently three voluntary organisations funded under the provisions of that Act which cater either exclusively or to a large extent for of multiple sclerosis. The detaUsrequestedfor these for 1974-75 to 1978-79 are given in the table in Vietnam by the Army. below. (2) Yes, at least two appUcations for assistance through Handicapped Persons Welfare Program could not be approved within the overall funding priorities. The programs not considered to be eligible for funding under the Persons Assistance Act and were therefore not recommended for assistance. (3) There is no individual funding allocation for this or - any other diagnostic Group under the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program. In each of the past 5 years expenditure has faUen short of the appropriation covering this program by varying amounts. There are many reasons for variations between appropriand actual expenditure: the final expenditureresultsin any year being largely dependent upon the progress made in projects and the submission of claims for payment from organisations in respect of approved commitments.

(2) If this is the case, is the situation (a) contrary to standard procedures and accepted safety guidelines and (b) of serious concern to RAAF personnel. (3) Was a training course for stewards recendy cancelled because of a lack of applicants for the course. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Flight stewards currently serving on Boeing 707 aircraft have all undergone a full course of training appropriate to the aircraft before the start of full-time flying duties with No 37 Squadron, the operating unit. On the occasions needed, supplementary flight steward crews for Boeing 707 operations are drawn from a pool of flight stewards at No 34 Squadron, received training in emergency procedures for the aircraft. The training of these flight stewards has been carried out by QANTAS and the RAAF. (2) See (1) above. (3) A flight steward course was scheduled to start on 28 Januaiy 1980, but it was postponed because of lack of applicants at that time. Also, TAA which now conduct the steward phase of the course was unable to conduct this training until 28 April 1980. The course is now underway with eight students and is expected to finish on 18 July 1980. Mr Cohen asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 13 May 1980: (1) What was the (a) price range for chips (f.o.b.) considered suitable by the Government when considering the licence applicauon for the North Coast Woodchip Export Scheme and (b) actual price obtained by the exporting company for the chips from its customer. (2) What economic analyses have been done by State or Federal Departments on the expon scheme. (3) Were these analyses used when considering the granting of the expon licence; if so, (a) which analyses were used and (b) will he make them available to the Parliament. (4) Has the Western Australian Woodchip company, WA Chip and Pulp Co. Pty Ltd made application to the Federal Government for an increase in its export licence; if so, what is the (a) size of the increase being requested and (b) current licence size. (5) From which source does the company intend to obtain its pulpwood. (6) What has been the volume of chips exponed annually since the operation began. (7) Will he have an Environmental Impact Statement prepared for this application. (8) What has been the annual pine planting rates suggested for Australia by the FORWOOD Conference, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and Federal Departments. (9) What has been Australia's actual total pine planting rate since 1970. Training of Stewards (Question No. 6076) Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable Defence, member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Exponers of woodchips are expected to achieve sale prices at least comparable with other suppliers to the same market, subject to considerations of quality and transpon costs to the market. There is no prescribed suitable price range for chips. (b) The actual prices obtained by individual exporters are considered to be commercially confidential. The Company involved in the North Coast Woodchip Export scheme is required to obtain each year, the Government's approval of the proposed export price for that year. The pnces which were indicated by the Company for the early years of exports were considered reasonable but no firm judgments can be made now of price levels in the years ahead. (2) The Forestry Branch of my Department is not aware of any economic analyses having been done by State or Federal Depanments on the Nonh Coast Woodchip Export scheme. (3) Not appUcable. See answer to 2 above. (4) Yes. all of whom have at least (a) The increase sought is in two parts-a n initial 150,000 green tonnes and a further 200,000 green tonnes. (b) 750,000 green tonnes. (5) The Company intends to obtain increased supplies of woodchips for the initial 150,000 green tonnes from jarrah sawmUl residues and for the funher 200,000 green tonnes from sawmUl residues, forest residues, land clearing operations and private pine plantations. (6) In 1973 the Company was granted approval to export up to 750,000 green tonnes of woodchips annually. Due to Wood Chip Industry depressed world market conditions since operations commenced, exports have been substantially less than the ap(Question No. 6085) proved volume. The Company expects to export the full entitlement in 1980. The actual level of exports by individual companies is regarded as commercially confidential information. (7) Responsibility for environmental assessment of woodchip export proposals rests with the Commonwealth Minister for Science and the Environment. Following consultation with the WA environment authorities, it was determined that for the initial 150,000 tonnes of woodchips in the first years, no environmental impact statement will be required. This determination was made on the basis of the initial 150,000 tonnes component being derived solely from sawmUl residues and on the understanding that justification for any continuation of this initial component will form part of the Environmental Review and Management Program (ERMP) the Company has been asked to prepare and submit to the WA Government by January 1982. The ERMP will also cover the additional 200,000 tonnes of woodchips which together with the 150,000 tonnes component comprise the Company's total increased export application. The need for an environmental impact statement under Commonwealth environmental legislation to cover the additional 200,000 tonnes will be considered when the Company has completed and submitted the ERMP for examination. (8) The FORWOOD Conference recommended that the total area to be planted annually (new planting plus replanting) should be 28,500 hectares from 1975 onwards. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics suggested that to achieve self-sufficiency in sawlogs and pulpwood by the year 2005 an annual planting rate between 1976 and 1980 of 18,216 hectares would be required. Their study made ommendations concerning the level of planting beyond 1980. My Depanment is not aware of any annual pine ing rates suggested by other Federal Depanments or authorities. (9) The total Government and private plantings have been as follows: Year ending March 31 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 Canberra Population Statistics Dr Everingham asked the Minister for the (1) Capital Territory, upon notice, on 13 May 1980: in (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports in the Canberra Times of 1 May 1980 indicating (a) a significant loss of population and family size in the Canbena North area, ACT, and (b) an average new household size of 2.4 persons since 1976 compared to an average household size of 3.1 in Canbena at 1 May 1980 and 3.4 in 1976. (2) Can he say whether population loss in other regional centres is primarily due to young unemployed persons moving to metropolitan areas where there are more diverse employment and training opportunities; if so, does Canberra's experience differ from this. (3) Do the populationfiguresconflict with the view that lower numbers of registered unemployed in Canberra are due to an anticipated private enterprise boom and moves of public offices to Canberra, as he suggested to the House on 30 April 1980 (Hansard, pages 2412-3). Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) There is no conflict between the North Canberra populauon trends and my public statements on the Canberra employment situation. The declining population in parts of North Canberra is a reflection of trends in the ACT economy, but is largely a consequence of normal demographic processes in the ageing population ofan established area. For example, such factors are involved as higher levels of age related mortality, and 'grown up' children leaving their parents' dwellings to form their own households in other dwellings elsewhere. Many of these people have simply moved to newly developing areas of the ACT. This process is not comparable with population migration which may occur in regional or provincial centres that do not have employment or training opportunities for young people. Aeronautical Research Laboratories Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 13 May 1980: no rec- (1) Did his Department advertise in the Weekend Australian of 3-4 May 1980 for a 'principle research scienplanttist ' in the Aeronautical Research Laboratories. (2) What kind of principles will be researched. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Advertising Authority prepared in the AeroArea in nautical Research Laboratories did in fact incorrectly refer to a 'Principle Research Scientist', though as a matter of hectares principle my Depanment attempts to observe correct spell37,300 ing. The advertisement was placed in two newspapers-the 28,000 Age, which corrected the spelling mistake before publi30,900 cation, and the Weekend Australian, which did not. 37,800 (2) The Principal Research Scientist will be concerned 35,500 with research involving the principles of combustion systems 37,300 associated principally with aircraft, marine and industrial 32,100 engines. 37,700 Taxation: Overseas Owned Oil Companies 35,000 (Question No. 6094) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, (Question No. 6089) on 14 May 1980: What success has the Commissioner of Taxation had applying section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act (relaUng to business carried on in Australia but controlled by overseas interests) to the income of overseas owned od companies. (2) Did the Taxation Board of Review some years ago consider the applicauon of section 136 to an overseas-owned oil company in a case lasting nearly 2 years; if so, (a) what success did the Commissioner have in refuting the claims made by the company concerning the landed costs of oil, which were allegedly inflated and (b) was the decision of the Board substantially against the Commissioner. (3) Has the position on this matter improved in recent years, enabling the Commissioner to collect an amount ofincome tax from overseas-owned oil companies; if not, will he seek the amendment of section 136 to strengthen its provisions. (4) If he will seek the amendment of section 136, when will the necessary action commence.",227
414,Mr HOWARD ,HANDICAPPED PERSONS ASSISTANCE ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that; because of the secrecy provisions contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act, he is unable to provide specific information. (2) The case referred to was set down for hearing on 17 not October 1961 and occupiedfifty-twositting days. The hearing was completed on 27 February 1962 and decision handed down on 20 March 1963. In that case the Commissioner determined amounts of taxable income pursuant to section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act in excess of the amounts of taxable income disclosed in the company's income tax returns. The Taxation Board of Review did not uphold the major adjustments made by the Commissioner in respect of the landed costs of oil imported from one source affiliated with the company. Smaller adjustments were confirmed in respea of imports from other affiliated sources. Details are available in the published repon of the Board's decision-Case N69 13 TBRD 270. (3) and (4) Amendments to the income tax law in 1977 (Question No. 6092) have given the Commissioner specific power to Umit deductionsforthe cost oftrading stock to the amount for which the article could be purchased in an arm's length transaction. Other matters relevant to the effectiveness of section 136 are being examined, including a revision of section 260 of come Tax Assessment Act. Taxation: Employees Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 May 1980: (1) Do employees who are subject to taxation instalment deduction currendy pay approximately 83 per cent come tax assessed to be paid by individual taxpayers. (2) If so, does the Government propose to take action implement a more equitable system of taxation which would uranium ensure that the wealthy pay a larger share of tax and that percentage of taxation currently paid by employees is what was the Council' reduced.",229
415,Mr HOWARD ,HANDICAPPED PERSONS ASSISTANCE ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The latest available statistics (Taxation Statistics 1977-78, ParUamentary Paper No. 162/1979) income year 1976-77, tax instalment deductions totalled $9,018,925,000 or 83.9 per cent of total net tax assessed ($10,750,124,000). (2) Whether the payment of tax is made via PAYE or provisional tax arrangements, the tax assessed is calculated on the same progressive personal income tax scale. A basic principle of our income tax system is that tax should be levwith ied on the basis of the abUity of an individual to pay. In first instance, abUity to pay depends on total sources be they wages, salaries, profits, dividends or interest. The mode of payment of tax affects neither the abUity individual to pay nor the incidence of the personal income tax. The Government is constantly reviewing the operations of the tax system to ensure it is as equitable Moreover, we are committed to reducing the burden of taxation, as and when we can responsibly do so.

(Question No. 6100) Ranger Uranium Project (Question No. 6108) Mr Corbett asked the Minister for Trade and 5326 and Resources, upon notice, on 14 May 1980: Has herequestedfunher advice from the Uranium Advisory Council on environmental, safety and other controls and in respect of the Ranger project as foreshadowed in his statement of 13 September 1979 (Hansard, page 1087); if so, what was the Council's advice.",230
418,Mr ANTHONY ,HANDICAPPED PERSONS ASSISTANCE ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 22 August 1979 the Uranium Advisory Council pro(Question No. 6102) vided advice at myrequeston the possibUity of the Commonwealth Government's disposing of its interests in the uranium project. The text of that advice was incorporated in Hansard on 13 September 1979 (pages 1086-1087). In its advice the Council considered that one of the possible effects of any disposal of the Government's interests in Ranger could be a reduction in pubUc confidence environmental, safety and other controls and regulations concerning uranium development including those governing the sale of the product. On 19 September 1979 I asked the to examine this aspect and advise if it sees any pardifficulties in this area. The Council provided advice on this matter on 24 October 1979. The text of the advice is as follows: ' I amreplyingto your letter of 19 September 1979, in which you referred to this Council's view, as conveyed to you in my letter of 22 August, that any disposal of the Commonwealth Government's interests in the Ranger project could result in a reduction in public confidence in environmental, safety and other controls and regulations concerning uranium development, including those governing the sale of the product. You asked if the Council would closely examine this aspect and advise you if it sees any particular difficulties in this area. The possible effects on Australian public confidence of a Government decision to dispose of its interest in Ranger, as postulated in my letter under reference, emerged as part of a broad consensus after lengthy discussion in the Council. The Council had primarily in mind the likely reaction to such a decision within the Australian community in the broad. The Council was not reactions of the Australian nised were likely to be of a different order. The matter was further discussed during the Council's October meeting. Members feel, with differing degrees of emphasis, that such a decision by the Government might be expected to stimulate the growth of domestic criticism of, and active opposition to, uranium mining and expon, based on public persuasion or supposition that withdrawal by the Government from its managerial and equity participation in the Ranger project would lead to a weakening in the rigorous application of controls over safety standards, environmental potection (including sociological effects on the local aboriginal population), internationally agreed safeguards governing the end use of the product and also the conditions and terms of export contracts. As a corollary to this, the Council may best preserve and increase its expertise and its capability to enforce all necessary controls by maintaining a direct involvement in the Ranger project. Over and beyond the specific aspects mentioned, there is a general feeling in the Council that any move by the Government to divest itself of its interest in Ranger would have an adverse effect on public confidence so far as uranium development is concerned. Council members have noted that there appears to be greater public confidence in the nuclear power industry in Western countries such as the United Kingdom and France, where there is direct Government involvement in the industry, than there is for instance in the USA.'

At the 34th session (1979) Australia abstained. Our vote did not represent any change in position. Rather, it expressed our concern that the resolution contained provisions that could impinge on the Secretary-General's impartial ""good offices"" role and unnecessarily compUcate his already Indeed, it was the view of the Government that some proposals in the resolution, including references to the estabUshment of a new UN ad hoc Committee on Cyprus, could distract attention from the central role of the inter-communal negotiations and risk jeopardising the potential for progress offered by the prospect of their early resumption. The honourable member willrecallthat, in announcing on 18 December 1979 that the Government would divest of its interests in the Ranger project and that it wished to accept the offer submitted on behalf of Energy Resources of Australia, I said the Government saw no need for its continued involvement in the actual mining operations at Ranger when these could be undertaken by reputable private interests. I also made it clear that the assignment process would ensure that the Government's obUgations to the aboriginal people in respect of the Ranger project would not be affected by the Government's decision and that the environmental requirements of the project would be fully carried out; simUarly the Government's policies in relation to mining, marketing and safeguards matters would not be affected. considering in this context the mining industry which it recogCyprus (Question No. 6111) Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 14 May 1980: (1) Is he able to state what has been the United Nations stance on the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish forces in 1974.

M. J. R. MACKellar on 2 June 1977. It is an unfortunate fact that some people, usually prohibited immigrants, pay money to the so-called fund of the New Settlers Federation for no worthwhUe purpose.

(2) Is there a regulauon preventing teachers smoking in front of classes in schools in Canberra. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) There is no specific ACT Schools Authority regulation by preventing teachers smoking in front of classes. However, an administrative circular, issued by the Chief Education Officer of the ACT Schools Authority, 6 July no war toys are made in 1976, stated: Such of the Administrative instructions in the NSW Handbook (instructions and information for the guidance of teachers) as have not been superseded or amended, and remain appUcable to the conduct of ACT schools, remain in force.
