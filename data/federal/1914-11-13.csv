33,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [10.55].^-I moveI Thut this Bill be now read a second time. This is a measure to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-11, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1914. The I under- circumstances that have induced the Government to introduce this legislation at the present stage are in themselves so extraordinary as to merit a general review. I hope I shall not unduly trespass upon the attention of honourable members in calling to their minds some parts of the history of this Act. No legislation has.had a more chequered history; in none is there such a melancholy contrast between the conditions that were to exist under it and those which do. Many honourable members can recall without difficulty that most eloquent oration with which Mr Deakin introduced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in 1903. It has been said that three parties have, at various times, given their approval to this legislation; and I think it may be said, without exaggeration, that three parties have at different times condemned it . The idea underly-' ing the Statute was in itself redolent of RAILWAY. the best spirit of progress. Mr Deakin, in introducing the original Bill , spoke of it in glowing terms as the excursion of law into the last sphere of human activity. He kindled in our plastic minds a most delightful vision of industrial contentment, a vision of a land from which strife would be absent, in which all difficulties would be smoothed away, and in which all warring factions would find a haven of perfect peace in the most expeditious and pleasing way. In the honourable gentleman's panegyric nothing was wanting to create an industrial Eden; but since then, however, many serpents have entered it , and it is now a wilderness. This measure has been amended, I think, five times. These amendments have been necessitated by decisions of the High Court. The power on which the Statute is based is derived fro m sub-section xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, as follows: Tho Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of monwealth with respect to: . . . (xxxv.) Conciliation and arbitration surcharged for the prevention and settlement of industrial optimism - introduced various disputes extending beyond the limits of one Statu The honourable member for Flinders has well observed in this House that there is hardly one word in that sub-section that chastened spirit. has not been the subject of the most fierce and prolonged discussion-tha whole sub-section has been a veritable battleground. The purview of the Court has been so restricted, and the approach to it so hedged about, that today tribunal, which was to be shorn of all technicalities, in which evidence was be obtained, not according to the rules governing ordinary Courts of law, but where equity and good conscience alone were to guide the President in ascertainhibition to the Arbitration Court. ing the truth , is hampered by technicaliidea ties to an extent not seen in any Court of law. Of this we have lately had exhibition in the Tramway Prohibition case, the culminating effort of a long hibition. series of attacks, that has been well termed a public scandal. This brings me to the immediate reason for the introIts duction of this measure. For while the High Court has, in very many cases, shorn the Arbitration Court of its powers, disastrous consequences. it has never struck a blow so deadly i its effects, so calculated to cripple the Court and its powers to preserve indusdecision without alarm. tria l peace. Of the other decisions the High Court, it might be said that they left the Court with some powers of usefulness. There was some prospect of doing the work it was established to though this became less hopeful with disputes. each hostile judgment; by this one it completely paralyzed. The Arbitration ' [26]- 2 Court has been likened to a ship which, leaking heavily, comes into port continuously for repairs, and, being repaired, goes out to sea again only to find herself buffeted by fresh"" gales, and becoming more unseaworthy than ever. This has gone so far that the ship is now past hopes of repair. I do not wish to disguise from honourable members that this measure ift not introduced in the vain hope of making the ship seaworthy, but of merely patching it up until it can get into port. I ani: profoundly convinced that nothing short of an amendment of the Constitution will! do what is necessary. The Government introduce the meathc Comsure with a certain amount of misgiving. In times past, we havewith almost incurable amendany ments of this Act, only to see them all hopelessly wrecked and discredited, mere objects of contempt and derision. I in troduce this measure, therefore, in a very I do not venture to say for a moment that the High Court t the will not attempt to clip its wings. There is about the High Court, in some of its aspects, an air almost sublime. It will not tolerate the suggestion that there this can be within the domain of the law, under the Constitution, anything it may to not only inquire into or review, but that it may not quash or veto. An attempt was made by this Legislature to prevent the High Court issuing orders of proThe in our minds at that time was that we were clothing the Arbitration Court an with power to make an award which could not be the subject of an order of proB u t the High Court regarded this attempt of the National Legislature merely as a stimulus to further efforts. latest achievement has been truly magnificent. But this magnificent achievement is likely to be followed by most I do not hesin tate, indeed, to say that no citizen who desires industrial peace can view the latest It is a decision of absolutely incompatible with industrial peace-nay , more, it is nothing short of a direct provocation to industrial war. The Arbitration Court was established for the do; prevention and settlement of industrial But if we can gather, from the is hideous entanglement of technicalities and long-drawn-out litigation in the tramways case, any substantial principle - u o man knoweth what a "" dispute"" is! Could anything be at once more grotesque and more incompatible with the maintenance of industrial peace than such a position ? It is perfectly clear, as I shall show from the remarks of the Judges themselves, and from the unfortunate experience of organizations, that the mere attempt to peacefully formulate a demand according to the spirit, and even the letter, of the law, will not suffice to create a "" dispute."" Nor can this method hope to succeed even if pushed to the very brink of industrial war. Even a strike itself, though ib extends beyond the limits of any one State, will not necessarily create such a dispute as will give the Arbitration Court jurisdiction. That is the position, as I shall show from Mr Justice Powers' own judgment. To strike is an offence under the Act, yet to create a dispute without a strike is almost hopeless. These are the Soylla and Charybdis between which the industrial organizations have to steer their hopeless way. If they do not push their formal demand for better conditions beyond the point of demand and refusal, no matter how widespread is that demand, how just the claim, or how contemptuous the refusal, they cannot be certain that an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Act and the Constitution has been created. If they strike they commit an offence ! It is perfectly true that the High Court has said a strike is not necessary to prove a dispute. On the other hand, they have said over and over again, and in this case particularly, that a demand followed by a refusal or no reply, followed again by a further demand and refusal or no reply, does not constitute a dispute within the meaning of the Act and the Constitution. But between peacef u l demand and refusal and the strike there is no standing place which an organization can hold. I do not deny that in that rarer atmosphere in which the High Court exists there may be such a point, but there is no place where an organization can stand. As an abstract proposition, doubtless, it may be successf u l l y maintained that while demand and refusal are not enough to create a dispute, yet it is not necessary to strike, but for practical purposes there is no alternative. What solid ground is there on which an organization can rest when a formal Mr Hughes. demand and refusal fails to prove a dispute except that of a strike? But why should it be necessary to break the law in order to invoke its aid ? The meaning of the word "" d is put e "" is surely clear enough. In ordinary Courts of Law these difficulties do not arise. A breach of the peace under the civil law may take one shape or another; there may be a violent assault or merely a technical one by laying on a hand. The Courts in practice have no difficulty in determining what is or what is not an assault, and the penalty is measured according to the gravity of the offence. But in this Arbitration Court there is no method of determining what an industrial breach of the peace is no man knows, and no one can tell him. The Arbitration Court is not permitted to tell us, and the High Court will not tell us. Through the ages one of the mysteries that has engaged the attention of man has been the riddle of the Sphinx ; what was it she had to say? What is the meaning behind that inscrutable smile; what is the answer to the riddle? No man knows. But, compared with the riddle presented by the Arbitration Court, the Sphinx is to be read as plainly as the writing on the wall. What is a dispute? Mr Justice Powers was so overwhelmed with the f u t i l it y of trying to answer the question that, after listening carefully for days to evidence that would have convinced most Courts, not only that there was a dispute, but that it was one of a damnably interminable character, he referred the question to the High Court, which, however, politely declined to answer it . The High Court said, in effect, "" Do not ask us now,"" and so left it to the Court below to grope its way blindfold instead of dealing with the matter as the spirit of the Act intended. This Arbitration Court was to be one shorn of all circumlocution and technicalities, but it has become a place where circumlocution and technicality have taken up their abode, indeed, it is their very citadel. Conditions have arisen there that would not be tolerated in any Court of law; let me prove this by referring shortly to the facts in the tramways case. I may be pardoned for doing this in order to make perfectly clear the position that the Government have taken up in this regard. The Government would not lightly bring in legislation attempting to .amend the Act, since their desire is for an .amendment of the Constitution, which would enable us to do away with this - miserable battledore and shuttlecock busiuess. We throw the High Court an .amending Act, and they hurl back its - shattered remains. Then, spurred on by the demon of eternal hope, we pass another; again it is thrown back; the - organization^ outside ask for bread; they are given a stone-o r a bubble. I wish to show what complete justification there is for this statement of the case and for introducing this legislation. sider the position in the tramways case. If ever there was a dispute between employers and employees there was one between the tramway men and the employers. What do words mean? Have they lost their meaning and become gibberish ? Are we arguing in terms of which we know nothing, or using well known words of our own language? What is a "" d is put e "" ? Where there is a disagreement between employer and - employee as to the terms and conditions of employment, there is primd facie a dispute and a case for the Court. A man asks for 9s. a day, shorter hours, and other conditions, and the employer ignores the request or refuses it ; there is a These things create a dispute. the plain common-sense view of the man in the street, and that was the in tention of this Legislature. Court was created to settle industrial - disputes, and so maintain industrial peace. Tf au organization of men engaged in running the tramways demand better conditions, surely this Court ought to be able to hear whether their demand is a just one? As far back as 1904, there was considerable dissatisfaction among the tramway men in some of the States. The dissatisfaction grew, and at length a Federal organization was formed which formulated a plaint. It is contended that the manner in which this was done was not in order, and that the rules of the organization were loosely drawn. Tbese allegations may be perfectly true, but what has that to do with the community for whose benefit the Statute was passed ? What is the principle on which this legislation rests ? It is the maintenance of industrial peace, for the benefit, not merely of industrial organizations, but of the community. A manufactured dispute, or one which has not been put before the Court according to the rules or regulations, is as much a danger as any other dispute; perhaps, it is a greater danger, because it is some evidence of precipitate action, and so indicates that the danger of industrial strife is mere acute. If there is a dispute in the streets, does any one ask whether it is manufactured ? Not at all. It is sufficient that it is a breach of the peace, and the law at once in terferes. If this great war which is now devastating the world is not a manufacCon- tured war, what is it? Does any one really think that the assassination of the Austrian Arch-Duke was sufficient cause why the nations of the world should plunge themselves into a welter of blood ? The present war is a manufactured war, but it is nevertheless very real. That a dispute is manufactured has nothing to do with the fact that a dispute exists. The one question is not whether it has been deliberately created, but whether it menaces the community. If so, let the Court deal with it on its merits. If any organization brings forward a bogus dispute, let it pay the penalty. But every dispute oughfc to be the subject of imdispute. mediate attention by the Court, and That is technicalities ought not to strangle it either at the threshhold or later. The dispute in the tramways case was a very For this real one; it threatened the welfare of the community very seriously. Thousands of men were involved, and the hearing occupied the attention of the Arbitration Court for ninety-three days. No other dispute that I can recall engaged the Court for anything like tnat period. There were ten parties to the dispute. In the case of eight of them agreements were fixed up, and those agreements were incorporated in the awards made by the Court and became operative. In the case of two parties, the Adelaide and Brisbane disputants, no agreements were possible, and awards were made. But the respondents in both casss appealed to the High Court for an order of prohibition. The application engaged the F u ll Court for no less than twenty-three days, and seventeen of those days, according to Mr Justice Powers, were occupied in arguing technicalities, the object of which was to hamstring the awards by hook or by crook. Mr Justice Powers in liis judgment says: "" I do not see how the work of the Court can be continued on present lines after the decision in this case until the Act is amended."" And Mr. Isaacs declares the proceedings be a shocking waste of public private time, money, and The Arbitration Court, after hearing all the evidence at first hand, and having had all the witnesses before it, decided was a dispute; but the High Court, on second-hand evidence, decided there was none. To what extent it was influenced by the evidence of Prendergast-one those rare examples of a totally nature, a man who apparently did not know right from wrong-we But his treachery had nothing to do with the merits of the case. The only question tnat interested the community was, Is there danger of a dislocation of the tram service ? That was the question. Were the trams to be stopped and the whole business of the community to be thrown out of gear? That was the issue the Arbitratioiii Court ought to have been able to answer; and, answered, its decision should have stood. The Court evidently thought the dispute was real, and, on the merits, made an award. In the case of eight of the parties that award was accepted. Court now has decided that there was no dispute, and has issued a prohibition order in respect of the claimant organizations in these two cases, bringing the eight agreements to the ground, for which there is now no legal sanction, them. It is true that still continuing by consent, but owe nothing to the law in this matter, and either party can break the agreements tomorrow without penalty or fear of consequences. This, then, is the position to which the community has been reduced by the most recent decision of the High Court. The law not only does not protect the Commonwealth from industrial but creates conditions which industrial peace almost The High Court has decided that there was no dispute between the tramway men and their employers. But the facts show that if there was no dispute in this case, there cannot be in any. Let me show this by quotations from the judgments of the Justices then selves. the very real nature of the dispute, Mr. Air. Hutjhas. Justice Isaacs, in his recorded judgment, Arbitration saidThen came Badger's famous ultimatum demanding the surrender of "" Badge or billet."" At that time the re were 480 unionists in the Justice Brisbane branch; they were forbidden to come "" to to work so long as they wore a little brass and symbol called a badge. They had agreed, it energy."" is true, to abide by the company's regulations, and it was within the letter of the law that the company could, without breaking its agreement with them, forbid them from coming to there work so long as they wore the badge. And the company did so forbid them. It was, however, an undoubted lock-out, and not a strike. On the 22nd the company advertised that men might resume, but only if they surrendered the of badge. In other words, the lock-out conunmoral tinued. In other words, a lock-out had occurred, cannot say. yet the Court said that there was no dispute. Looking at the dispute generally, not only as it affected Brisbane, but also as it affected the men in the four States, His Honour went on to sayThousands of men, as we have seen, from all parts of Australia, and grouped in branches, first framed tlieir tentative sectional schemes of demand, entrusted their representatives to which discuss and standardize them in common council as one body, and eventually reconsidered having separately the united set of conditions approved by them, adopted the in, and resolved to demand them, and authorized the organization to make that demand for them, which was done. The employers, one and all, rejected the demands. The High I desire honourable members to follow this, because here we get a clear statement of the position created by the High Court judgmentWhat were the men then to clo? Unless they aro required to strike in order to convince the along with Court that they are in earnest, nothing more these are than they did is possible, as it seems to me. they Dealing with the manner in which the dispute had been formulated, His Honour quoted the Taff Vale case as an analogous oneThe sole difference of substance between the case (Taff Vale ease) and the present is:There a strike, with its attendant horrors, took place. Here it was happily averted, except where stated. But is the Court going to tell strife, the workers of Australia that, notwithstanding make all tlicir efforts to maintain the peaceful conimpossible. tinuance of industry, they have always to choose between openly striking-for a mere threat to strike could still be challenged as unreal-and running the risk of being told they are not really in dispute? Disguisu it as we may, that was and is at the root of the argument. Could any criticism be more severe? Yet 1 Speaking as to it comes, not from a partisan, but from one of the Justices who heard the case. I put :it to honourable members that the position which has been created is one which ought not to be allowed to continue. It invites industrial chaos. And unless something is quickly done to put the Court in a positi on to say what is an industrial dispute - w e do not hope to do more than that-the Court will completely break down. Its powers to grapple with industrial troubles will still be inadequate. Nothing short of power to review and deal with the industrial conditions generally will suffice. That power we cannot now give it . any rate, the community have a right to expect that the Legislature will do whatever is possible to prevent the Court being an object of contempt and derision. And we owe it to the meu who have made every attempt to settle their disputes in peaceful and lawful fashion, that they shall not be the sport of those persons who, while pretending to prefer industrial peace fco industrial war, and while lauding "" law and order,"" - defraud men, after the expenditure of thousands of pounds and years of effort, of the fruits of their labours. The Bill beforefcheChamber aims at putt i ng the Arbitration Court into the position we thought it occupied before the - decision of the High Court in the tramways case. It may put the Court in a better position; on the other hand, it may not improve the position of the Court at all. It may be that the measure is destined to prove but another futil e - effort, ancl that the High Court may pour a broadside into the battered hulk. But I feel that the responsibility - of refraining from taking any step which will make for industrial peace is one that I cannot The position is serious; it is indeed critical. Any one who has a knowledge of industrial affairs knows that the organizations are now waiting to see what is to be done. I have been informed that there are no fewer than three conferences representing very powerful industrial bodies now being held in this city, in order that the organizations may know exactly where they find themselves, and in order that they may decide upon what action - should be taken. The whole industrial world of the Commonwealth is astir, because not only has the decision of the High Court in the tramways case upset the award and the agreements which rested on that award, so far as the tramway men are concerned-it has also made the position impossible in regard to other awards for other organizations. The decision, indeed, strikes at the very foundations of industrial organizations and their relation to the Federal Court of Arbitration. I do not hesitate to say that there is not one award which could fair l y go through the same ordeal and escape unscathed. And I am of the opinion that in no case heard by the Court was there one dispute more real than that But, at in the tramways case; nor one in which could not be found some technical flaws which, being proved, would upset the awards made. Nor can there be one found where the claim to consideration by the Court was more just. Therefore, in what positiou are we today? Industrial chaos threatens us at any moment. The keystone has been taken out of the arch, and at any moment the whole fabric may collapse. If there had not been a state of war it would have happened already. The war alone has prevented an industrial crisis on a gigantic scale. Every one familiar with industrial organization in this country knows this to be an unexaggerated statement of the position that exist3 today.",7
34,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,You r difficulty is that you are putting in the keystone before the foundation has beeu laid.,12
35,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is very difficult to know what is the keystone and what the foundation. The whole thing is like a moving picture, assuming a thousand shapes, but baffling all attempts at analysis. An amendment is called for. The shoulder. Judiciary has recommended an amendment ; in fact, it is upon the recommendation of the Judiciary that this Bill has been introduced.",12
36,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When you speak of the Judiciary, do you mean all the Justices of the High Court?",12
37,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No. I shall quote from the remarks of those Justices who made this recommendation. Let others quote from the remarks of those Justices who do not make the recommendation. Viewing the facts, the position created by this recent judgment, the recommendation of the Justices who dissented from it , the Legislature and Government cannot refrain from taking what steps are possible in this matter, whether these are destined to be successful or prove utterly hopeless. What shape the amendment should take is indicated by the Justices. Mr Justice Isaacs, in delivering his judgment, said:Claimants, however, anxious to have the fundamental question determined at once, have no means of doing so, but must run tlieir chance to the end. Respondents, on the other hand, can, if they choose, move at once, or, if they prefer to have a double chance of winning, by evidence or by exhaustion, may wait. It is not only inimical to general welfare, but quite unfair, that one party alone should have the choice of lying by, taking the chance of a favourable judgnient, and if not then satisfied, of upsetting the whole proceeding, very possibly on some merely technical point. If the respondent is dissatisfied with the award, and can only manage to ferret out some technicality that happens to be considered part of the strict and unbending machinery of the law, the merits of the question count for nothing, substantial justicu counts for nothing, the probability, or even certainty, of general turmoil and publie loss and inconvenience are immaterial and irrelevant; so, too, are the supposed settled relations of otlier parties perfectly contented with the award. Thus the whole structure laboriously and patiently built up by the Arbitration Court as an equitable settlement necessary to secure industrial peace disappears as an unreality in the eye of the law-bu t one which certainly leaves very real and very lasting evil effects behind. If, however, as previously suggested, jurisdiction were given under the judicature chapter of the constitution of the Arbitration "" Court,"" within the meaning of that chapter it is clear (see Ex parte Williamson, 15 C.L.R., at p. 583) that, subject only to whatever appeal or assistance by way of case stated to this Court, a Parliament chose to permit or provide, the basic question could be definitely settled before the huge extent of the main controversy was incurred. T must not, however, be taken as recommending an appeal. He went on to say that would not lie against the Court if it were given jurisdiction the judicature chapter of the Constitution and were clothed with those powers. Then he went on to say what had always been regarded as a dispute in England, and dealt with the earliest application of arbitration in disputes, in England, in what ner the demands were' how they had arisen, and the general recognition of the principle tive bargaining. His Honour pointed out that in drawing up their logs the men necessarily must leave details to their leadens, that their leaders made these demands on behalf of the men, and that Mr Hughes. these demands, if rejected, constituted a dispute. He saidIf this commanding principle be, for instance, applied to the question whether the Brisbane men really wanted the extra few pence per day they demanded in the combined log, or were mentally content to receive what they put into their sectional log, the answer would be that the danger to the public disregarded such a test; whether they would or not the result in the case of the possible stoppage to the travelling publie and to other industries dependent on the prompt arrival of passengers, is the same in either case, and should be averted. Then, speaking as to the necessity for. clothing the Court with power to determine at the threshold what an industrial dispute is, he said It seems to me it ought to be judicially determined at the threshold whether the entry of the Arbitration Court upon an arbitration inquiry is justified or not. If it is, let it proceed, and the result, whatever it may be, depend on the merits alone. If not justified, then let it be prevented at the outset. Such a shocking waste of public and private time, money, and energy as has occurred in the present instance ought not even to be possible. Surely no more scathing criticism was ever expressed by a Judge in any case. Nor was there ever a case which so well merited it. The ends of justice have been defeated, the purpose for which the Statute had been created swept aside, the interests of the community gravely imperilled. The respondents have not given a thought for the welfare of the community or for the maintenance of the principles upon which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act rests. Yet what is the alternative to this legislation ? Honourable members who do not believe in the Act, who do not desire to amend it , prohibition should be honest, and say they will go Arbitration back to the old condition of things; that under they prefer to revert to barbarism. It will be no new thing. Germany has set us an example. If there be some industrial Germans here who, under the pretence of upholding the law, would precipitate industrial strife, let them take their industrial courage in both hands and say so. This man- much is certain: There is no half-way formulated, house between an amendment of the law and industrial chaos. Legal redress cannot of collec- now be granted to any industrial organization under the Federal Act. The A r b i tration Court has no jurisdiction to ascertain whafc is a dispute. No one will tell it , and it has not the power to determine it for itself. Such a position is untenable, and ought not to be allowed to continue. This Bill clothes the High Court with th© power to determine at the outset what an industrial dispute is. The jurisdiction is to be exercised by single Justice upon application. The sons for giving jurisdiction to the High Court rather than the Arbitration Court, as suggested by their Honours Isaacs, constitutional. Higgins, and Powers, J . J - will , I think, the Constitution Act suggest themselves to honourable members. We wish to avoid, not to create, further trouble. Admittedly, to clothe the A tration Court with the power to judicially determine what is a dispute would be simpler than the proposal in the Bill ; whether it would prove more satisfactory is quite another matter. Their Honours are strongly of this opinion. Mr . tice Higgins, speaking as President of the Arbitration Court, when giving his award in the tramways case, saidThe position of the question-doe s pute exist?-is most unsatisfactory. Act assumes that the existence of a dispute the most obvious thing in the world, a.nd, cording to the High Court, Parliament given mc any jurisdiction to decide the quespleases, tion. I understand that my finding ou the question is not even to be treated as prima right, and yet, when the question comes before the High Court, the High Court takes no evidence on the subject. As actually happened in the Merchant Service Guild Case, may spend days and weeks in going into the merits of claims, and, after I have made award, the whole proceedings become a nullity, because the High Court cannot find in the transcript any sufficient evidence of what understands by the word "" dispute."" My and energies, which belong to the public, wasted, and the irritated employees aro put under a temptation to strike work. There two courses which occur to me that Parliament could adopt to put an end to this position. is to commit the question of the existence of a dispute to the High Court, and to forbid Court to arbitrate until the High Court fies that there is a dispute. The other is-i Parliament thinks that this Court, having opportunity of meeting the employers and employees face to face, and of seeing the conditions of labour, should be able to form a better ment-to commit to this Court jurisdiction ascertain whether there is a dispute or Something must be done to improve the present anomalous position; but it is for Parliament tn say what ought to be done. Mr Justice Powers, commenting on that statement when delivering judgment in the tramways prohibition case, said, "" entirely concur as to the second suggesthis t i o n . "" I have already quoted His Mr Justice Isaacs' remarks. But upon general review of the position, and while 51 ? giving every weight to the recommendations of their Honours, it has been thought best to give jurisdiction to the High Court in the manner set for t h in the Bill . By clause 5 we have endeaa voured to meet the situation. Whether reawe have done so remains to be seen. It is a veritable quagmire; but I am of the opinion that the proposed amendment is ""Under section 71 of the judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested in a Federal Supreme Court, called the H i gh r b i - Court of Australia, and any other Federal Court that the Parliament may create, and any such other Court as it may invest with Federal jurisdiction. Section 76 of the Constitution provides thab Justhe Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter arising under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation, or arising under any laws made by a disthe Parliament. The distribution of the The is judicial power of the Commonwealth is acso far unlimited that the Parliament may has not create aa many Federal Courts as it and, subject to the sections of the facie Judiciary chapter of the Constitution, assign to them such functions in regard to the interpretation of the Constitution, or I of any law made under it , as it pleases. The question arises whether we can clotlie an the Arbitration Court with power to determine what is and what is not a dispute it in accordance with the meaning of paratime graph xxxv. of section 51 of the Conare stitution. It has been held, and is now are settled law, that the Arbitration Court is not a Court within the meaning of secOne tion 71 of the Constitution. The High this Court has decided that the President of certithe Arbitration Court is an arbitrator f exercising judicial functions. Paragraph the xxxv., of section 51, empowers this Parliament to make laws for the settlejudgment of disputes by processes of conciliato tion and arbitration. Our powers in renot. gard to industrial matters are limited to such purposes. The Arbitration Court has been created by this Legislature to exercise powers under the Constitution. It is to prevent and settle industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any I one State. The question is, can we clothe Court with power to judicially deHonour termine what is a dispute within the a meaning of paragraph xxxv. of section The recommendation of Isaacs, Higgins and Powers, J.J., is that the Arbitration Court should be clothed with power to determine what is and what is not a dispute. The question arises, "" Can we, by any means at our disposal, do this?"" I do not say that we cannot. There is no constitutional reason why jurisdiction to determine what is and what is not a dispute should not be given a Court other than the High Court or the Arbitration Court. But the wisdom of doing so is doubtful, and the expediency still more so. Such a Court would-if it wore to be really usefulhave jurisdiction to determine all matters arising under paragraph xxxv. of section 51, or of any laws made thereunder. But these powers would be considerable; and the High Court might hold that, although the Legislature could create a Court to deal with the interpretation of certain parts of the Constitution, the power of the High Court to interfere where it is alleged that an inferior Court has exceeded its jurisdiction was not in any way impaired. I do not say that the High Court would so hold, but I do not propose to take any risk in the matter. I think that we shall achieve what is necessary by the provision in clause 5When an alleged industrial dispute is submitted to thu Court(a) in the case of a. dispute submitted to the Court by plaint-the complainant organization or association ; and (6) in any otlier case-an y party to the proceeding or the Registrar, may apply to the High Court, for a decision on the question whether the dispute, or any part thereof, exists, or is threatened or impending or probable, as an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. 2. 'J im High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the question. 3. The jurisdiction of the High Court under this section may be exercised by any Justice of the High Court sitting in chambers. 4. The decision of the Justice on the question shall be final and conclusive, and shall not be subject to any appeal to the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction, and shall not be challenged, appealed against, quashed, or called in question, or lie subject to prohibition or mandamus in any Court on any account whatever. If clause 5 is watertight, the High Court once the Justice has decided the matter, will not be able to review the decision either by way of prohibition or in any other way whatever. If the clause is within our powers, the Arbitration may apply for a decision as to whether Mr Hughes. there is a dispute, and, once that point is decided, the matter is finally settled. Had that been possible in the tramways case we should have been spared the ' ' shocking waste of public and private time, money, and energy'' caused by the tramways prohibition case. Cases will be settled more speedily, because no appeal is allowed, and no order of prohibition can lie against the Justice. I do not know that I can usefully elaborate the argument in favour of this provision further, but I wish to hear the objections that may be raised against it . I do not invite criticism of our determination to make the Act workable, so as to enable the waterlogged and leaky ship to reach port, but I do invite honourable members to help the Government to effect repairs in the best way possible in the circumstances. I shall be very ready to accept any workable suggestions tending to improve the efficacy of the proposal. The position is full of difficulties and dangers, but these have to be fairly faced. An honest attempt must be made to prevent industrial chaos by assuring those organizations that have awards that these will not be interfered with, and that those seeking redress may do so with perfect confidence. Thus time, energy, and money will be saved, and the patience of the community will not be frittered away.",12
38,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why is one Judge to exercise the proposed jurisdiction ?,15
39,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Six Justices occupied twenty-three days in hearing the prohibition case, and decided, by four to two, that there was no dispute. Far be it from me to cast any reflection on the Judiciary, but I think that, if there had been sixteen Justices on the Bench, the case would not yet have been finished. The High Court itself has decided that the question of whether or not a dispute exists is one of fact, and its determination can be more expeditiously arrived at by one man than reviewed, by six. The flaw in this provision, if there be a flaw, is, therefore, not there. The points to be considered are the constitutionality of the proposal, and, subject to that, whether it will work expeditiously and well. I invite the criticism of honourable members to these points. Court I propose to deal very briefly with the remaining amendments of the principal A.ct for which this Bill provides. At the outset, let me say that all have been suggested either by the Court or by the Registrar. All , except that dealt with, relate to defects in machinery not vital in themselves, but which have caused a great deal of trouble, confusion, and delay. I ask honourable members to believe that in the performance of its functions fchis new Court, launched with such eclat on the industrial waters some nine years ago, is continually experiencing trouble in its internal mechanism. The cogs grind; the bearings grow hot. An endeavour is here made to deal with these troubles. Clause 2 deals with the position of an employee dismissed by his employer because he belongs fco an organization. Under the Act as it stands, in order to secure a conviction it is necessary to prove that an employee has been dismissed merely because he is a unionist. Ifc is a fact, and one of the most cheering evidences of the innate goodness of mankind, that convictions have been secured for this offence under the existing law. But for every oue offender caught, ninety-nine go free. It is obvious that if a man wishes to dismiss an employee because he is a unionist, he may easily do so. An employer may discharge a man because he is a unionist, and say that he has dismissed him because he does not like his appearance. We are amending the principal Act so that the onus will rest on the employer, and this is quite compatible with the policy of the Act. Collective bargaining has become part of the warp and woof of our industrial fabric. We do not recognise individuals; we recognise only organizations. whole system is based upon the principle of collective bargaining. The object of the Act, the work for which the A r b i tration Court was established, is to settle industrial disputes between organizations and employers. These threaten the peace of the community. Disputes between isolated individual employees and their employers are negligible. Those "" dwellers in the caves"" who talk about the rights of the individual are invited to crawl into the daylight, and to see the new world, in which the individual workman, except in cases so rare as to be insignificant, does not really count at all. There are combinations of workmen and combinations of employers. These are the factors with which the Court has to deal. This Bill is to deal with conditions as they are, not as they were, or even as just- they might be. Therefore, in order that we may secure collective bargaining, and leave an organization perfectly free to embrace witliin its grasp every person engaged in the industry to which it relates, no man must be penalized because he belongs to an organization. The law : says to a worker- "" Before ye shall receive industrial salvation, it is necessary that ye shall enter the fold of a union."" To penalize a man for doing that very thing the law desires to encourage is obviously wrong. And particularly so in this case, because the Federal Court cannot make a common rule. Under fchis law there is only one way in which a man can be in dustrially saved-that is, by becoming a unionist. In these circumstances, if we gave an employer power to penalize a man because he belonged to a union we should strike at the very taproot of the whole system with which the Statute was deliberately designed to deal. We propose to provide, therefore, that the onus of proving that a man has been dismissed for some reason other than being a unionist shall rest upon the employer. If an employer dismisses one of his men he must show that he did not dismiss him for being a unionist. Thereupon the onus of proof, as the lawyers in the House know, will fall upon the other party, and he will have to make out his case.",15
40,Mr HANNAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is a very difficult case to make out.,16
41,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It certainly is. In The my experience of the Court in New South Wales only one conviction was secured. It is proposed that any fine that may be recovered may be paid to the victim. If a man is dismissed because he is a unionist, and the Court orders his employer to pay a fine, it is even-handed justice, I think, that the man so dismissed should receive the fine. It is not, however, to go to him, ipso facto. The Attorney-General may direct that the whole or any part of a fine so imposed shall be paid to the person injured. Clause 3 provides for an amendment, of section 19 of the. principal Act by inserting in paragraph b, after the word "" organization,"" the words "" or by an association registered for the time being as an organization."" cover the case of an association has registered, and whose registration is subsequently found to be defective. this amendment were not made, then, as has already occurred in several cases, any award or benefit that an might have received would fail if it were found subsequently that its was defective. This clause will enable an organization in such circumstances to retain its rights. I think it a very necessary provision. Clause 4 amends section 21 of the principal omitting the words "" exists and is,"" and inserting in their stead the words, ""exists, or is threatened, or is pending, or probable as."" This will extend scope of the measure so that a certificate by the Registrar that a specific dispute exists will now cover a dispute that exists, or is threatened, pending, or probable. Clause 6 deals with the list of members and officers of an filed with the Registrar, and provides that such a list filed with the Registrar on behalf of the organization or association shall be evidence that the persons named in it were at the date of filing and officers, and that such officers were duly appointed. This proposed ment arises partly out of the case. The question as to whether a man is a member or officer of an organization is most difficult to prove. case of the organization I have the honour to nected, and which has branches all over Australia, we should be unable to prove membership in one case out of two. Those who know anything about the way in which organizations are controlled must be aware of this. The man who does the bookkeeping of an organization of workers is not an expert he. is a workman. He does his best; but he is not an expert bookkeeper. Bill deals with industrial tions as they are, and an etherealized perfected race of human beings, every unit in which has received a collegiate education. It deals with workmen, who have little time and no training in office work, and who are liable to fall into technical when preparing a plaint for hearing in the Court. This clause will make the certificate of the Registrar sufficient eviAfr. Hughes. This will dence that the officers and members of which an organization are the officers and the members on the list. If Clause 8 extends the power of the Court under section 29 by declaring that the award of the Court organization shall be binding on all parties it summoned to appear as parties to a dispute registration or required to answer the claim. The law as it stands applies only to those who appear, or who are' represented in the Court. It does not apply to those who are summoned, but do not appear. As Act by there is no power to make a common rule it follows that to exclude those upon whom notice to attend has been served, but who do not appear, is to curtail very the dangerously the scope of the Court. It is proposed, therefore, to extend the industrial scope of an award to all those who have been served but do not appear. Clause 9 amends section 38 of the Act , and deals with a difficulty that has arisen organization in its working. It is proposed to insert, after paragraph (d), the following: (da) to order compliance with any term of an order or award proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been broken or not obmembers served. Section 55, which determines what a amend- registered organization may be, is Tramways amended by inserting at the end of paragraph b of sub-section 1 the wordstogether with such other persons, whether In the employees in the industry or not, as have been with which appointed officers of the association and adbe con- mitted as members thereof. This amendment was introduced to deal with circumstances that have arisen in several cases. If honourable members look at sub-section 6, they will see that no person can be a member of an organization unless he is a member of an association of not less than 100 employees. Ifc is essenaccountant; tial, therefore, that every member of an organization should be an employee in the This industry. An employee is a person who organiza- has existing contractual relations of emnot with ployment with an employer. It follows, therefore, that every secretary of every large organization is excluded from membership of an organization. This rule construed strictly excludes officers of long standing, such as the honourable member for the Darling and myself. On the face irregularities of it , such a rule is opposed to the spirit of the Act, and operates most unfairly. So soon as an organization grows to any size, it is impossible for a man to attend to its affairs and at the same time to carry on the Ordinary duties of his employment. It is customary, therefore, to appoint a secretary, who devotes himself exclusively to the work of the association; aud the moment he takes the appointment he ceases under this section to become a member of the registered association. Clause 11 amends section 58A of the Act by providing that where, for any reason, an organization changes its name, its registration shall not be affected. The amendment of section 60, which is effected in clause 12, arises out of the experience of the Court in , I think, the amalgamated miners' case. Here the Court found itself compelled to cancel the registration, although it certainly did not desire to do so. It is proposed to clothe the Court with discretionary power. Clause 13 provides that every association which, at the coming into operation of the Bill , is registered as an organization, shall be deemed to have been duly registered. This is to cin""e any defects that may have occurred in the registration of any organization now registered. I have taken up much more time FISHER than I intended, but my excuse must be that this measure is one of supreme importance to the industrial welfare of the country. The circumstances that have induced-indee d comCommonwealth pelled--the Government to introduce the Bill are such as to call, in the most the present time. emphatic way, for publicity. The rewhich sponsibility for the continuance of these conditions rests now on this Legislature. The necessity of an amendment of the to create some authority to judicially termine what is a dispute is obvious. do not rjretend for a moment that this measure does anything more than patch up the badly-leaking vessel for the very understand short time, let us hope, that remains fore it gets into port. But although an merely as a sort amendment of the Constitution is needed before we can hope to clothe this Court with powers commensurate for the great the Bank. work it is called upon to do, yet as present need is so urgent we must do what is possible in the circumstances. The attempt is amply justified, even though it sbould fail in its object. There is imposed on every that power. honourable member a duty to the public. He has to use his every effort, not to serve his own or his party's in - the Bank 1 terest, but to conserve, above all things, the welfare of the whole people, which rests absolutely on the maintenance of industrial peace. It is clear that a Court which has no authority to seltle industrial disputes, which cannot even determine what a dispute is, and which, at the end of three years, finds the patient work of its hands mauled and disfigured out of all recognition, cannot hope to maintain industrial peace. But such a position must not be allowed to endure. The decision in the tramways case has created a condition of things in compatible with the maintenance of in dustrial peace, inconsistent with the principles on which the A ct rests, gravely imperilling the welfare of the community. For these reasons I ask the Chamber to approve this measure, and so prevent a state of industrial chaos and disaster. Debate (on motion by Mr Glynn) adjourned.' COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL.

At present, the Commonwealth Bank is doing a large bnsi.ness without any capital in the way of cash. It lives altogether on the deposits in the Savings Bank-includin g th© considerable amount taken over with the Tasmanian Bank-and on the interest and non-interest bearing deposits of its customers. The basis of the Bank's capital is the credit of the Commonwealth.",19
47,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is nothing better !,19
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the credic of the Commonwealth is all that is necessary, why give power to £10,000,000? The credit of the Commonwealth is the sole capital that the Bank has had from the beginning up to the present; and that this has proved sufficient is shown by the fact that no use whatever has been made of the power to issue debentures. That being the case, we - ought to be told why the Bill is introduced at the present time. As far as I can see, there is no necessity for it . As for th© hypothetical case of buying up some bank, that is a point that ought to be carefully considered by the House. - Seeing that we have been doing very good business with the Bank, that we have got this institution going, that it is doing the Commonwealth's business both here and in London, and doing all exchanges for the Commonwealth, and assisting the Government when necessary, BO far as its powers go, why is it necessary [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bank Bill. to increase the capital of the institution from £1,000,000 to £10,000,000? That proposal means that this Parliament is to authorize the borrowing and expenditure of £10,000,000 by the Bank. The indebtedness of the Bank is the indebtedness of the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth is responsible for every action taken by the Governor of the Bank. For what purpose is this £10,000,000 required ? My right honourable friend said that he did not intend to borrow the money just yet, and perhaps he would not borrow it for a long time. Then, what is the urgency of getting this power to We have borrow? I have shown that no action is contemplated, except that there is a vague idea that the Commonwealth might buy up some other bank. The credit of th© Commonwealth is sufficient for all transactions, because the debentures are available as a stand-by if they are required. This proposal of the Governmeut is merely a placard which is intended to make a show in the window, but is not for use. If it is intended for use, wo have a right to know what that use is to be. Let us look at two of the biggest banking institutions in th© world. The Bank of England, which has done so much in connection with the financial crisis brought about by the war, has a capital of only £14,500,000. There is certainly a rest reserve of £3,500,000; whilst the fiduciary issue of the Bank of England is only £18,500,000; beyond which l i m it a sovereigin must be deposited for every note issued. The great Bank of France borrow has a capital of only £7,500,000. How different is the management of the Bank of England from the management proposed by the so-called Democratic party now in power.",19
49,Mr SHARPE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do you not think we are a Democratic party ?,19
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So far as this Bank is concerned, the Labour party is very autocratic. They propos© to entrust all this money to the control of one man. The Bank of England is controlled by a directorate of twenty-four members, selected from the most eminent commercial and banking men in England, and a Governor and Deputy-Governor as well. Ther© is some security in management of that character; but in Australia wo are to leav© th© whole control to one man. Certainly, th© Treasurer has to approve of the Bank raising this money, but fancy the so-called Democratic party allowing the Governor of the Bank and the Treasurer of the day - wh o may even be a member of ,this hated Opposition - - to £10,000,000 of money without knowledge or approval of this Parliament! Is this responsible government, under which Parliament is supreme? Why is there this second attempt to ignore the Parliament of the country in a matter so very important as the raising of money ? We know that if the Government desire to spend any money at all, they must submit the items for parliamentary approval, and an appropriation must be made before the expenditure can be incurred. In regard to loans, also, wo are obliged to set forth in the clearest way how every item in the Loan Bill is to be expended; we have to give the specifications of the work very often; and Parliament is supposed to be cognisant of everything which it is proposed to do before approval is given. Why, then, should we deal differently with the raising of £10,000,000 for the purposes of a banking institution ? Do honourable members opposite approve of giving to Governor of the Bank and the Treasurer for the time being the right to buy, say, the great Bank of New South Wales, and make it part of the Commonwealth institution, without the cognisance of Parliament? Do they agree that Parliament should be set at nought, and not even consulted ? Once the Governor gets the money, the control of the Treasurer will cease. The power of the Treasurer applies only to the raising of the money. I do not know whether the Treasurer has to approve of a bank being purchased ?",19
51,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes .,20
52,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Treasurer and the Governor are to raise the money, to buy a bank, and tell us after the transaction is complete, when the Bank with its millions of money will be under the absolute control of one man. I am not saying anything against the present Governor of the Bank. I believe he is an excellent man, and all the time. I occupied the position of Treasurer, he and I worked most amicably together. fore, there is nothing personal in my criticism. The Governor may be one of the wisest of men, but he ou^ht not to have sole control of this Bank, and unlimited expenditure. This institution is not like the Bank of England, with its twenty-six directors, comprising men in the highest positions in the commercial raise and banking world, and who are always the there to aid the institution. There is no other institution of the sort in the world where the absolute control is given to one man. I do appeal to honourable members opposite to have a little regard for constitutional usage. The Government are proposing to entrust to one man in the' community the whole credit of Australia. We are responsible for everything the Governor does, and must pay the piper if any loss is made. But we are committing ourselves to intrusting the country's credit to one man. who is a law unto himself.",20
53,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He is not that.,20
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"To all intents aud purposes, the Governor is a law unto himself. Is that a reasonable thing to do ? Is there any precedent for such a course? Is it a safe procedure? Is it responsible government, which means that Parliament shall be consulted before, expenditure is incurred ? Are we going to allow the the Governor and the Treasurer for the time being to pledge the credit of the country for the purchase of a commercial enterprise at a cost of £10,000,000, without Parliament being made aware of the transaction until it has been completed ? Do we realise our responsibility to the people when we vote away the powers in trusted to us under the Constitution ? 1 desire to say only a word or two in rc gard to my action as Treasurer in cor nexion with the branch of the Saving -; Bank which had been established with : > - flourish of trumpets in England. O M looking into the matter, I came to the con elusion that there was no power in the Act to establish a Savings Bank outside of Australia. I consulted the Attorney General, and he gave a very deliberate opinion that there was no power to have a Commonwealth Savings Bank anywhere .except in Australia. I at once called the attention of the Governor of the bank to the fact, and told him that he must not act illegally. He did not like that in struction, but he said he would achieve his purpose in another way. I replied that, There- so long as he established his banks within the law, I had no objection. At the same time, I was glad to find that the Governor's action was not in accordance with the Act. I look upon the Commonwealth - as being a portion of the Empire, and under great obligatiou to th© Old Country. It seems to me that, to enter into competition to catch the savings of the people in England, and to offer a higher rate of interest, was not either patriotic or fair on our part. It did not seem to me that such a policy would bring us closer to the people, and the financial institutions of the Old Country. They require the savings of their people as much as we require the savings of our people. They have obligations far greater than we have, and why should we try to grasp the last farthing of the English people? proved of that policy then, and I absolutely . disapprove of I was, therefore, glad that the original Act did not permit us to have a branch in London. I think it is a bad policy to attempt to interfere with the savings of the people of Great Britain when they are required in the Mother Country for its protection and for the conduct of public affairs, just as it is bad policy for the Commonwealth lo enter into competition with the State Savings Banks, and take away the savings of the people in the States, which are required for the further development of the States.",20
55,Mr SHARPE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do they not get a lot of our money in Great Britain?,21
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What about the £300,000,000 odd that we owe the British peopl©? Does the honourable Member contend that Australia is a v greater country than Great Britain , and that they are under a greater obligation to us than we are to them? Surely the honourable member has some regard for the country in which he was born and nurtured? Does he come here and think that he is a better Australian than those who belong to the country? not approve of our entering into competition in Savings Bank business with the Old Country. I do not approve of the Bill before us. It is not required. There is no necessity for it . it is contrary to constitutional usage and to our system of responsible government to entrust to any one except Parliament the raising and spending of money.",21

63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Her e and now I make my protest against these controversial measures being brought forward for the consideration of Parliament at this time. The procedure is a distinct breach of an agreement that honourable members opposite made with the people. I do Mr SPEAKER - I am sorry to have to interrupt the honourable member, but I have twice called him to order for discussing something that is foreign to the Bill before the House. On the motion Above all, for the second reading of the Bill the honourable member must say whether he approves or disapproves of the principles of the measure.",21
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that it is always in order to discuss whether a Bill should be before the House.,21
65,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,If I permit discussion on the lines pursued by the honourable member the House might very soon be discussing everything but the Bill itself.,21

These can only be discussed in Committee. The honourable member must know that I cannot allow him to roam all over matters quite outside the question before the Chair.",22
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is a new ruling. I have never heard before that one may not, on the second reading of a Bill , discuss whether the measure should be introduced for discussi-ou at the time. I should like to know whether debate on those lines is not pertinent and relative to the Bill ; because I am now protesting against being compelled to discuss this Bill at the present time. As I have already said, honourable members opposite gave a definite",22
69,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have already told the honourable member that he must not follow that line of argument. If he disapproves of my ruling, he must take the proper course to dissent from it .",22
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As your rulings, Mr Speaker, are always given without reasons, and we cannot make anything of them, I must leave the point. I should like to know what is the matter with the honourable member for Barrier? I never rise to speak but he begins mumbling and chuckling like a bear with a sore head. The Bill is of sufficient portance to be discussed calmly and at length, and, if need be, at leisure. The interposition of hilarity and jocularity when we are discussing one of the biggest financial propositions ever submitted in the chamber does no credit to honourable members. I hope I am in order inasking whether the Bill has been before Caucus; because I should like to know whether honourable ' members approve of the underlying principles of the measure and of the Commonwealth Bank, and whether honourable members supporting the Government approve of the autocratic system of government which is introduced all his life. and emphasized once more in this Bill . They say that they are Democrats, that they do not believe in one-man rule. They have always preached the doctrine that one-man rule means tyranny and oppression. Therefore, I would like to know whether Caucus has discussed the advisability of giving to one man the conof twenty millions without let or hindrance, or question of any sort as to anything he may do? The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank already controls ten millions, and this Bill will give him control of another ten millions.",22
71,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is wrong.,22
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Governor of the Bauk already controls ten millions/ at least, so I read the Bank's balance sheet; at any rate, he has liabilities to the extent of ten millions, though we know nothing about them. I suppose that a good proportion of the ten millions is in bricks and mortar, which the Governor of the Bank has purchased on his own account. I am not speaking of ordinary banking business, such as mortgages and that kind of thing. I am speaking of absolute purchases of property by the Governor of the Bank. I challenge contradiction when I say that no other Parliament in the world would permit any man to do what this gentleman is doing every day. What might happen if he were not the upright, straightforward, and honest man I believe him to be, I do not know.  him a Czar at the last elections.",22
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I still call him a Czar. I doubt if the Czar of Russia has as much power over financial im- matters as has the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Saying this is no reflection upon the man, but is a reflection upon the so-called Democrats opposite, who clothe the Governor of the Bank with absolute autocratic power to do as he pleases behind the back of Parliament, and, indeed, to flout Parliament if any question be asked of him, as we have seen him do on many and many an occasion.",22
74,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is that your only objection to the Bill?,22

89,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The right honourable member knows that all interjections are disorderly, and that it is impossible for the presiding officer to anticipate them; - but a member is not in order in replying of a Bill , to interjections.",23
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know of no rule of debate that is more honoured than that a reply may be made to an interjection. There could be no debate if that, The outstanding feature of the present situation is the absolute inability of the Commonwealth to give any substantial relief. know that the Governor of the a ruling Bank wishes to do his best, but he does not possess the necessary resources. He does not control the note issue, and cannot come to the rescue of any one. As to the general nnancial situation, he has been able to do but little except in regard to ordinary current transactions. As a buttress to the financial position of the country, the Bank is useless. I shall therefore welcome any reasonable attempt to increase the Bank's powers and prestige, and to give it the status which it must possess before it can fulfil in the remotest degree the functions of a national bank. Some things have happened during these trying days that are of almost priceless value. The logic of events has driven the truth of home to the Prime Minister, and to leaders of the Labour party in the States. The right honourable member signed and distributed throughout Australia a famous manifesto, containing the astounding statement tJiat the Australian note issue had given enough money to be loaned to the States by the Commonwealth to enable them to maintain their public works policy, and thus to prevent a huge army of unemployed from being thrown on the streets. The manifesto also stated that, without the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue, we should be faced at this juncture with a general collapse of industry, trade, and finance. Do lionorable members believe that the Commonwealth Bank has had anything to do with overcoming our difficulties? The Bank has absolutely no capital, and it is mere effrontery to say that it has prevented the collapse of the trade and finance of Australia. It is a good thing that the crisis has brought home to the minds of responsible Labour leaders the fact that it is foolish to think that paper money can maintain the credit of Australia and preserve its industries from collapse. Let me read what Mr . Holman said recently on the subject. He is one of the Labour leaders, and is certainly one of the cleverest of themJit is suggested that we should finance works by the simple and easy expedient of rowing bank notes from the Federal Governbelieve ment and paying our workmen and contractors with them. One has hardly the patience to Conservative view. deal with proposals of that kind with the sideration they really deserve-or , rather, those who make them deserve-becaus e they no doubt made as the resnlt of genuine ing in certain cases. But I ask honourable members to follow what would happen if that done. If we were to borrow now £2.000.000, €3.000,000, or £5,000.000 of paper inoney pay our workmen witli them, tliese notes would, througli the medium of the stores, soon find their way into the banks, and the banks would be left with the alternative of holding those notes themselves, which would be equivalent to advancing us a loan, which they cannot afford to make at the present moment, or do what they naturally would do, return them to the Treasury in Melbourne and demand gold. There is another alternative. If there were an over-issue of paper money, the banks would naturally get r i d of their gold and keep the notes for their reserves. Then the Treasury in Melbourne would be in the position either of refusing payment, which would precipitate the crisis which every responsible-minded man in Australia is endeavouring to avert, or of paying out until it reached the legal maximum, when, 1 take it, matters refusal would be inevitable. . . . I am convinced .that the moment has arrived when it is better to speak, and speak plainly, and say to misguided people who aro urging this resource that it is no resource whatever, and that while no doubt a note issue can be expanded legitimately, and ought to be expanded legitimately, at a time like this by the united efforts of the Government and the banks throughout the State, to put as large a body of funds into circulation as possible, and while I am prepared as Treasurer to do nil in my power to help, that is a different thing to treating paper currency as an inexhaustible supply of capital. That is one of the prize delusions of tliose who know nothing about the questions involved. That is rough on honourable members opposite. Mr Holman says that this is one of the prize delusions of those who know nothing about the questions involved.",23
91,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the right honourable member going to connect the quotation with the Bill before the House?,24
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am. I take it that the question of the Bank and its resources affects the whole financial situation of the country. But I will have done with this quotation, since it seems to b© unpalatable to some people. Mr . Holman. in one fell swoop, heaves overboard all the foolish notions of honourable members opposite. He practically says they are simpletons, who know nothing about the question, otherwise they would those not hug these delusions to their breasts. borThafc is his characterization of those who in any such thing. His is the old Mr Holman has confallen into line with the old Conservative which financiers on this side, who have been exare pressing the same opinion for many years. sufferI t has taken the present war and the were existing crisis to bring him round to that old. safe, sound view of national finance and and away from that which has been preached from the housetops by those who, in"" his own language, know nothing about the question.",24
93,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think the right honourable member has described Mr Holman as the most extravagant Labour man in the Commonwealth, so far as finance is concerned.",25
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And is it because he is the most extravagant member of the Labour party that honourable members opposite barrack for him at election time? They characterize him now as the most extravagant member of the party,25
95,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No . It was the honourable member who said that of him.,25
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It . was most touching to see Mr Holman on the platform with that other great authority-the Prime Minister-at the recent elections. Then they were on each other's necks, but now that the election is over, and honourable members opposite are in power, they speak in this way of the man who helped them so much and so well. This aspect of the matter is worth placing; on record, and I propose to make the following quotation from the Labour manifesto of 1914Tlie Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue had created the very instruments by which credit could be supported and the wheels of industry kept moving even in this great crisis. Mr FrsHER - Hear , hear! Mr JOSE PH COOK - If that be so, why is the right honourable gentleman obtaining from other sources money for the assistance of the States?",25

100,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the right honourable gentleman objects to my ruling, then the proper and honourable course for him to pursue is to move that it be disagreed with. If he does, I promise him that his motion will be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. If he does not, then he must abide by my ruling, otherwise I shall have to take some other course.",25
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have no deLabour sire to disagree with your ruling, but I wish you to permit me to make a quotaright tion bearing on the subject of the Commonwealth Bank. If responsible statements of Ministers when before the country may not be quoted in this House as financial bearing upon the legislation which they are proposing, it seems to me that parliamentary discussion is at an end. In this manifesto we had the statement that the Commonwealth Bank would be the buttress of the industries of Australia, and that it would help us over the present crisis.",25
102,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The right honourable member will be perfectly in order in following that line of discussion, but the quotation that he read a few moments ago went much further.",25
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not know how we can separate the note issue from the general financial question.,25
104,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The general financial situation is not under discussion.,25
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I desire to argue that the Bank should have the control of the note issue; but it seems to me that I cannot reach the point I want to make. I think, Mr Speaker, you might allow me to state my point before you interrupt me. My point is that the Commonwealth Bank should be placed in a position of greater power and responsibility with a better directorate and a better control; that the management having been put right, it should then be clothed with greater responsibilities, in cluding the note issue and everything else relating to the finances of the CommonI must ask wealth. I am entitled, I think, to make this quotation, because, as we know to our cosfc, it did good service all over Australia. In it we have the statement thatEnough money is to be loaned to the Statesby the Commonwealth to enable them to mainto tain tlieir public works policy and thus prevent a luige army of unemployed being thrown upon the streets. Had it not been for the Commonwealth Bank andThe reference is to the note issue, to which, under your ruling, Mr Speaker, I may not referthe private banks would have been compelled in sheer defence to restrict creditThat is an absolutely indefensible statement for which there is not a tittle of justificationoverdrafts would have had to be reduced so that enterprises affected by the war would have shrunk almost to nothing. Money would have been very dearHere we come to the Attorney-General's rhetoricunemployment and trade crises would have come upon us like a flood submerging everything. Instead of which, money is very cheap, employment is encouraged, traders should not be called ou to reduce overdrafts or harassed by dread of complete ruin. The wheels of industry move, and trade becomes possible. The Conunonwealth Bank, andsomething again to which I may not refer, under your ruling, Mr SPEAKER without which, at this juncture, we should be faced with a general collapse of industry, trade, and finance, are due to the Labour party alone. All that the Commonwealth Bank has ever done throughout this crisis has been to act as an agent. It cannot act as a principal, because it has no capital. has acted purely as an agent, and whatever the Treasurer is going to do now with regard to certain loans to the States will be effected through the Commonwealth Bank acting only as an agent. The Bank is not finding the £18,000,000 which the States are to receive. Nothing has more strongly emphasized the need of a National bank with large resources and skilled management as the crisis through which we have been passing. I , therefore, am glad in one sense that it is proposed to clothe this Bank with greater powers and privileges than it has. But what does the Bill provide? In the very forefront of it we have a proposal to take over other banks. Is it not remarkable that the Prime Minister should tell the House, "" We want power to take over other banks, but we do not know that we are going to take over any?"" Ifc seems to me that the right honourable gentleman is playing with the House. Either the Governor has a bank in view or he has not. If he has not, that is the best of all reasons why this provision should be eliminated from the Bill . Why should it be emphasized in the form of a special clause ? If , as the Treasurer says, he has no other bank in his mind, and does not know that the power is going to be exercised, that is a reason why the clause should be rejected rather than passed. And that leads me to another point. I understand that in connection with the taking over of these banks, and the exercise of this power, Parliament is to be absolutely ignored. The power is to be exercised with the consent of the Treasurer. If the Governor of the Bank wishes to get £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 within his control, he will say to the Treasurer, "" Come in and help me to get it . "" But having once obtained it , he will show the Treasurer the door, and will have no more to do with him. There is nothing fair about a provision of this kind. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - But it is good Socialism.",25
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is pure, unadulterated, logical Socialism. It is, in deed, the very essence of bureaucracy. I protest against the Parliament being treated in this way. This provision may involve a matter of some £5,000,000, £10,000,000, or - £20,000,000, and surely in regard to something which It so profoundly affects the finances and resources of the Commonwealth this House should at least be consulted. But, uo! The Treasurer and the Governor of the Bank are to deal with it . This Parliament is not considered to be worthy of the compliment of consultation. If the Labour party were on this side of the House and some other party brought down this proposal how they would scarify and "" stone-wall "" it .",26
107,Mr BURNS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We should be "" gagged "" if honourable members opposite were in power.",26
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And honourable members opposite would have to be "" gagged "" if we were trying to pass such a Bill , otherwise we should never get it through. The fact is that the Bill is simply a proposal to nationalize, by administration, and not by legislation; and, in this, the Government are going even further than under the referenda proposal. Under the latter, when it is proposed to nationalize any industry or corporation it is lef t to Parliament to decide; but in the present instance, the Governor of the Bank and the Treasurer may do as they think f it .",26
109,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member himself was once i u favour of nationalrequire ization.,27
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is one of those statements that come very glibly from the honourable member; I never lieved in this sort of nationalization. T r u ly every honourable member opposite regards himself as a financial genius, can conduct banks or any other class business. The measure proposes to give power to take over any other bank or banks, to increase the capital of the Bank, to insure the priority of the over other corporations, and to clothe with privileges which are possessed by no other institution of the kind, and which, in their very essence, put all competitors at a disadvantage.",27
111,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is the same in the case of the Bank of England.,27
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When the know honourable member speaks of the Bank England he ought to speak of it as whole-tak e it as a balanced in its resources and management, and then his interjection might be logical. My objection is to giving these great powers to one man away from the advice and control of any directorate whatever. The Bill further provides for the openit ing of savings banks oversea, and for clothing the Bank with the power to deal with trust funds. The point is, that we are proposing to give the Bank more function of a National bank. capital and further financial resources; and, while I have no quarrel with that proposal, I should like to know what is to be done with regard to the £9,000,000 of extra debentures. Are they to be floated, or is the £10,000,000 still to be a reserve?",27
113,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They will not be called up unless they are necessary.,27
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Has the Prime Minister any idea whether that will be - necessary ?,27
115,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It may be. givfd the Governor no power of coercion. in the direction and management.,27
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What does the Prime Minister mean? I am asking whether the debentures are to be put on the market and used, for instance, in purchase of some other bank. Has the Prime Minister any object in K s mind in asking for the power to issue these debentures?

That is not necessarily the There is a clear line of demarcation always to be drawn between a National bank doing national business, and private institutions which are assisting the industrial enterprises of the country. There is plenty of national work for a National bank without competing with private banks. The late Government, some time ago, arranged with the Premiers of the States to draw that line of demarcation, making it a sharp one, with the idea of the big banking transactions with the States being undertaken by the Bank, and the The Bill State authorities being given a voico If the present Government would take a similar course there would be no necessity to go into competition with the private in the stitutions.

But apparently it is not the desire of honourable gentlemen opposite support at this stage the measure which their leaders have brought in. I rise to oppose the passage of the Bill, and I have not the slightest hesitation in unreservedly the argument by the Leader of the Opposithe tion, namely, that it ought to be the duty of the party for which he speaks to oppose the extension of this institution until its two chief defects, according to judgment, are removed. Those two defects have been enunciated by him, the firstlv. the Savings Bank features which brought the authorities of the Commonwealth and States into violent collision, and, secondly, the absence of State parti t nership in the control and profits of the institution. It does appear to me that the Bill is an admission that the Bank which was founded two and a quarter years ago has failed, or, to be more just, has not succeeded in fulfillin g the purposes of its creators. The Leader of the Opposition has drawn attention to the nature of its failure. A f t e r two and a quarter years of operafciou, there ought to bo sufficient experience aud funds under the control of the Governor to permit him to co-operate with the Government, even without control of the note issue, to help us over any troublous financial crisis. The Governor of the Bank has done nothing. I do not blame him one bit, bufc surely we are sound and above party when we say that you cannot put your finger on a solitary substantial act that the Governor has done to relieve the tension of the banking aud business community at this stage. Mr An.cHiBA.LP - Do you know all has done ?",28
128,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No : but I am judging by the indications in financial circles what the bank has done. It is not the fault of the Governor that he is unable to produce some cure; he possesses neither the power nor the money to do so. The £9,000,000 odd which he controls acsider cording to his last balance-sheet issued in September, half in the Savings Bank institutions and half in the ordinary branches of the bank, is all at the Leader of the Government knows full well that, in normal times, you must keep a certain amount of till-money, which must be vastly increased if you would be safe in abnormal times. In addition the till-money, you must keep your second line of reserve funds, and when you have done that, a vast percentage of your money is locked up. You can only deal with the comparatively small balance at a time of crisis. Hence it is that this must have one or two sources of supply if it is to be useful, as the Bank of England is useful, in times of crisis. must have either control of the note issue or control of a capital issue. And it necessary that both these things should be full y considered by the Government, and adequate provision made, if the Bank is to act as we desire it to do in time emergency. Notwithstanding the manicome festo issued by its creators, the Bank has been abortive so far as concerns helping the financial institutions and the business and governmental powers of Australia the present time. I desire to say plainly that I hope honourable members will not because endeavour to class me as an opponent of a National bank.",29

133,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Nobod y said that it was.,29
134,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that if the honourable member wil l read the debates that took place whenever the representatives of to the Commonwealth and States met to debate this question, h© will see that the in variable attitude which the gentleman at present presiding over the destinies of the Government took up was that the constitution of the Bank could not be altered. Bank When we talked about partnership in profit and control to the present Prime Minister, the right honourable gentleman Ifc ridiculed the suggestion ab more than one Conference of Premiers. I venture to say is that, even after the Act was passed, had there been a decent spirit of conciliation shown by the party then in control of the Commonwealth, the States could afc of that time have been easily induced to into partnership, with advantage to the directorship, to which I referred, and the risks of profit and loss. I was about to say that the cardinal blunder appears at to have been that the Commonwealth set out upon this enterprise without capital, as this Bill itself admits a capital of £1,000,000 is wholly insufficient for a big national bank to do business with in six capital cities and other subordinate cities in Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is not capital, but an obligation.",29
135,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is an obligation to pay, and the debentures are endorsed by the Government. It was foreseen that even if the debentures were issued they would be an insufficient capital for the requirements of even the smallest State in the nation if the business of the Bank was to beeome general. In consequence, the Governor, with the consent and approval of the then Government, said, "" We must get m o n e y , and an easy means of getting it was to endeavour to secure the existing Savings Bank deposits of the States. That at once drove into irreconcilable conflict with the Commonwealth the six Governments of the States, and that conflict occurred irrespective of party, as the right honourable the Prime Minister will well remember. When the B i ll was before us originally, a Conference of State Treasurers and Premiers, hurriedly summoned by Mr MCGowan, the then Premier of New South Wales, met in Sydney to consider the effect of Part 5 of the Bill existing institutions of the States, and the whole of the six Governments - tw o Labour and four joined in a memorial to the right honourable gentleman who is now, and was then, Prime Minister, asking him to modify his proposals, and to consult with the States before their institutions were attacked in that way. The only courtesy which the Prime Minister paid to that memorial was to read it in the House, and to throw it - into the waste-paper basket, and we have never been able to get into effective consultation with the Federal authorities until the present Leader of the Opposition met us in March last.",30
136,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did not the Prime M i nistor meet the Premiers ?,30
137,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes ; but I will show how utterly unsatisfactory the attitude of the Commouwealth to the States was. My point is that the States never had a consultation with the Federal authorities on the vital points of this issue until we were met in March last by the then Prime Minister.,30
138,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I attended your Conferences and answered every question put to me.,30
139,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable gentleman answered the questions in characteristic fashion, if he will permit me to say so without affront. He will remember the soft answer that turneth away wrath, which he gave to the representatives of the six Governments when he was asked for a partnership in the Bank; and when the Premiers would not consent to take the risks of loss and the possibilities of profit without some share in the government; the right honourable gentleman said "" There can be no partnership in the government of the Bank."" No real partnership was possible, unless it was in the control, as well as in the profits and risks of the institution.",30
140,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The real trouble was that the chairman would be a Federal appointee, and, in consequence, there would be Commonwealth control of the Bank.",30
141,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think that was the trouble. I am now taking a somewhat critical course, but I desire to state later on what I should suggest. So far I have been associated only with the State end of this business. But I have endeavoured also to study the Federal end, and to arrive at some arrangement, irrespective of party, that will serve the people of on the Australia and its component States.",30
142,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the honourable gentleman sure of his facts when he states that Liberal- I made no suggestion of partnership both in profits and in management?,30
143,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am sure of my facts. When I saw a statement that had been made by the right honourable gentleman during the recent election, that he had at the Conference offered the States a partnership in the control and profits, I looked up the report of the proceedings at the Conference, and found that the right honourable gentleman was in error. I know that it is very easy for an honourable member who has been leading the strenuous life, as the Prime Minister has been doing during the last few years, to forget facts, but I have refreshed my mind by reference to the reports only a month or two ago. I know that I , and, I think, Mr Holman, Mr Denham, and Mr . Barnes, of Queensland, adopted the same attitude in standing out for this partnership in control and in profits, but all our efforts merely led up the road to f u t i l it y , and that portion of the Conference was absolutely fruitless. This Bill comes to us as a measure of second thought. Ifc is clear that the present Government, while they may claim some measure of success for the Bank with its limited powers and possibilities, now desire Parliament to give the institution a wider life and a wider scope. This Bill may be called an "" extension Bill , "" and the Leader of the Opposition was surely right in saying that the measure should be something more than that. It should be a reconstruction Bill .",30

145,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A comparison of this * bank with the Bank of England is somewhat impertinent. The Bank of England is not a governmental institution.,31
146,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But the Bank of land had to make a small beginning, and it had to fight for its life against the same sort of opposition.",31
147,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So have I , and otlier orphans, had to fight for our lives. So has the tame tiger in our Zoo; the tiger is now tame, but, at one time, it had to fight for its existence. However, I am not fighting the Commonwealth Bank, but am endeavouring to draw attention to the fact that, after some years of close attention to the governmental side of the problem, I believe that a giant blunder has been committed. I believe that it is not too late to retrieve the blunder, and this is a stage, created by the very act of the Government, as this is a Bill which seeks to alter the constitution and powers of the Bank, when we can ask ""Does the Bill strike at basic principles, and does it insure the future of the Bank?"" I say that it does not, but I am one of those who is willing to make it so, if the Government will allow us to do so by seeing the institution in the light in which we are endeavouring to show it . This Bank ought not to be a party institution. The Government ought to be able to lift ib completely out of the ruck of party, and, by fair concessions, and a consideration of the views which hitherto have been neglected, make it something better than a party bank. Let us look at the attitude which the right honourable the Prime Minister took. I ask him to place himself in the position of a State Treasurer, perhaps the Treasurer of a State Labour Government. There were State institutions holding in the aggregate some £70,000,000 of money-al l of it the people's money, and deposited in small amounts. The operations of some of these institutions stretched back over three-quarters of a century. The bank in the mother State of New South Wales has a history of something like eighty years; the bank in Victoria, fifty or sixty years. During all that time the Savings Banks have been gathering up the people's money, being a common medium of transfer to those who needed it most, and with one uninthe Bank not terrupted career of success to both the Governments and the depositors. The money fchey covered was used, as honourable members well know, to serve great social purposes-in Western Australia, for the extension of land development; in Victoria, for the reduction of interest Eng- rates to farmers through a credit foncier system, and in the purchase of homes by workers and shopkeepers on very liberal terms, and we put an equitable condition into the money market which prevented the small borrower being raked afc any time by the somewhat rapacious methods of the money lenders. These institutions in general, also lent this money to the Governments of Australia before the Commonwealth came into existence. Oufc of about £22,000,000 in the Victorian Savings Bauks, over £10,000,000 have been lent to the Government by authority of Parliament, for the purpose of building railways, for water propositions, land settlement, and other reproductive schemes. For the past three or four years every Government in Australia had been leaninsr heavily on the trustees or governors of Savings Banks for help for their local loans, and in support of their loans overseas, and they felt that this step on the part of the Commonwealth Government not only took from them the prestigewhicli, of course, is not very much to ROnsider-of running these institution""?, but that it also rendered extremely difficult and doubtful their future financial position. The States were tryin g to develop the commercial enterprises of Australia, and to help forward the growth of population, and were doing in detail the same work that the National Government were undertaking; and they felt that the National Government were dragging them to their knees and weakening their chances of a successful coritinuai.ee of those endeavours. When the Act was passed, and the Commonwealth Government were inconsiderate enough to say that their first business would be to take away from the States their Savings Bank ' branches, the States had either to surrender the business of these branches to the new competitor which the Parliament of Australia had brought into existence or fight for the existence of their own institutions. I ask any honourable member what he would have done in the circumstances. ",31
148,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member ing the States. is full of fight; his appearance shows it ; . his record is full of fight; but less nacious gentlemen in both parties in the States said, ' ' We have a solemn responness sibility on us to run these concerns and find money for them, and now that their existence is threatened, we must fight f their maintenance and even for their tension.""",32

153,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is it fair to say the Commonwealth Bank has been fightrisks ing the State Savings Banks?,32
154,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The first step the monwealtli took was to kick the Victorian Savings Bank branches-out of the postwithout offices, and the second step was to do same thing in Queensland. Thi3 action, however, did not affect the Victorian ings Bank, because when the position was analyzed a startling fact was disclosed. The State Savings Bank had seventy branches of its own, and five times seventy post-office agencies; but before it was kicked out it was only receiving 7J per cent, of its receipts from the multitude of post-office agencies. Therefore, when it was given notice to leave, it realized that, as a result, it might only lose 1 \ per cent, of its takings.",32

The exStates realized the inevitability of the position. They acknowledged that it was on within the power of the Commonwealth to dismiss them from the tenancy of the post-offices, and they set to work to get",32
157,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But you cannot call,32
158,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not suppose that the Commonwealth fought their best, because it was theoretically Possible for the inteis rest rate to be raised to 3£ or even 4 per the cent., while still keeping a margin of reprofit after providing for the cost of management; but the Commonwealth of Savings Bank has £5.000,000 , the bulk of which, under other circumstances, if not If time the whole of it , would have gone to the State Savings Banks cash boxes. That not the worse of the position. The Gofightvernment Savings Banks all the world I over trade on the narrowest margins of They do not seek to give dividends to shareholders. American, B r i tish, and Australian institutions all keep the cost of management as low as possible, and pay as high a rate as possible to their l l depositors. In Victoria the cost of management is not 10s. per cent., and 3s. or that 4s. above that is the total margin for of every kind on an institution that has over £20,000,000 in hand. I h other Comwords, the Victorian Savings Bank recognises the depositors as shareholders, and, bleeding the borrowers, it practithe cally transfers as much as possible of the receipts from borrowers into the hands of Savthe lenders by keeping the charges low. These institutions effect a useful and substantial social service, and sliould not have been attacked. They are the most highly socialistic institutions in Australia, the most successful of all the with which I am acquainted. and bad times alike, before the discovery of gold and afterwards, and in those alternating periods of prosperity pression that every part tralia has known, especially south-east corner of the the State Savings Banks have stood right up, and the most that has had to be done for them was when, during the 1893 crisis, the Governmenb of Victoria stepped in and said, "" We guarantee the depositors and debenture holders of this But for fifty years, in many cases, the depositors and debenture holders did not have that guarantee. There is room in Australia for a great national bank which will do service for the nation, and which may, in a time of crisis, have the opportunity of transferring, either in specie or notes, enough money to stop runs and restore credit and keep currency and trade going normally. If we lay down the foundations of a National bank which will grow with the strength of the nation, we are doing the right thing; but when, as part of that project, we attack an institution that has been doing most essential service for the people, it is a cardinal blunder that musfc stand to the eternal condemnation-not honour-of the men responsible for the step. Robbery, robbery, instead of the provision of capital, has been the result of that method of doing business. The States have been driven to financial expedients which have not been creditable to the reputation of Australia. In some cases they have been unable to get the money for a large number of public works without going cap in hand too often to the London Such a state of affairs should be altered. There is au easy way oufc of the difficulty. If we could consent to look at the matter without any consideration for the dignities of parties or persons, lieve that the position could be altered. I would to God I could strike a lighfc in the mind of the Leader of the Government, and illuminate it on this question, because whenever I have talked it over with him he has always had in his mind the conviction that a National bank, unless it had Savings Bank business, would bo fco that extent imperfect.

Surely when we find Mr Watt. otlier national institutions, although goand verned by separate parts of the nation, institutions already achieving that business, if it is In good our desire fco serve the nation, and not a party, we can disregard theories of that kind, and say, "" Let us leave this necesand de- sarily restricted area for the time being of Ausfco the forces that are discharging the in the functions properly, and take on other continent, business where nobody else is doing a national service."" That is what the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues should do. If we are to look at the main facts of this matter, and improve the situation, we must consider two great institution."" schemes-on e produced on the other side of the House, and one partly produced ou this side, which can be blended, if blending is necessary. The honourable member for Darwin is responsible for a scheme ordered by this House to be printed in 1908I t is practically the authorized Labour party's scheme for the Commonwealth Bank and State debts questions. I believe it represents the Brisbane Conference resolutions in definite shape. Ifc stands to the great credit of the honourable member that he has been able, in a party whose members necessarily do not claim to have expert banking knowledge, fco have had adopted by that party, ancl kept for five or six years as its policy, a proposition with effects so far-reaching aud daring, and so thoroughly in accord daylight in its design and operation. Its essential portion iy a partnership between the Governments of Australia. It is a shareholding proposition, true to the term and type of its author, without bnodle. He proposed a capital at the time-h e would probably enlarge it now-of £1,200,000, made up of 12,000 shares of £ 1 0 0 each, 6,000 of which were to be allocated autolender. matically to the Commonwealth, and the other 6,000 to be available for the States, with the one limitation that no State should own more than 1,000. Equality of share-holding was possible so long as I be- there were six States, and therefore still is. There was to be a Board of Management for the bank, consisting of the Comptroller-General, who, changing terms, may be the Governor of the bank today, representing the Commonwealth, and one representative from each of Ihe subscribing States. Why did not the right honourable gentleman, when he passed the Bill in 1912, take, as he was in honour bound to take, a, scheme which his party had already authoritatively in dorsed? This was not done, although I believed at the time that the honourable member for Darwin, with the persuasive unction of which he is the conspicuous possessor, would have succeeded in getting it done.",32
159,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The States would not accept it .,34
160,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is in error, because I can assure him, as intents and purposes a substantial one actively identified with all the States for the bank. in this matter at the time, that, while some timid States-let us call them the other business that we could smaller States-di d not want to embark Was not that a proposition that upon the risk of loss, the States whole were in favour of it , but would not consent to take all the risk of loss or profit without a voice in the control, the Prime Minister then suggested. That scheme is the same, although expressed in any conditions. a different way, as the one produced by th© Leader of the Opposition in the recent contest, and I make bold to say it would have found almost unanimous support at the Melbourne Conference, where we worked out the basis of the other branches of this matter in March and of this year. If honourable members are interested in this subject, they will from the records of the Conference what a fair proposition we had worked out the Commonwealth. We made a condiare. tion-the only way we could see fair play for the States-that there - should surrender by the Commonwealth to the States of savings bank operations; something far more than a quid irro quo governing the affairs of Australia. was to be provided by the States, which were to enter into partnership with the Commonwealth.

There is a feeling in this House that the Governor of the Bank is, as it were, sacrosanct. I hav© no feeling of that kind. I have met him. the and found him very human. I do not he is qualified for the large powers which th© Government that appointed him gave him. He is an ideal technical arbanker, and came from technical banking we into a wider area, the half of which he had never surveyed and never imagined. of He knows nothing about the politics of bank in its relation to the sentio u ments of the people and the governmental institutions of Australia, as he has repeatedly shown in the fruitless negotiations which he instituted to acquire and swallow the State Savings Banks. I have no hesitation, and never shall have, in criticising the governor or controllergeneral or directorate of a bank when I think they are driven by false considerations fco a policy of wrong actions. I believe Mr Miller has on more than one occasion made gross blunders that have to a large extent prevented the establishment of that feeling of reconciliation which some of us hoped to promote. Let us take illustrations. The Bill empowers the Governor to bank in England. Bu the is banking there now, ancl was banking there in 1913. I had occasion to ask, for the Government of Victoria, through its Agent-General, that a circular which the Government had issued in London, describing the bauk as the State Bank of Australia, might be cancelled. There was .in that description the affectation or pnetence that the bank was the institution of the State whose borrowings were so well known in the Old Country.",34
163,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Commonwealth referred to as a State.,35
164,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,All nations and empires are in a sense States; but why was not the bank described as the Commonwealth Bank ?,35
165,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The occurrence took place while my predecessor was in office, and the description was withdrawn immediately attention was drawn to it.",35
166,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The error was admitted immediately, but only when the Government of Victoria had drawn attention to it. The Governor is banking in London, although he has no statutory authority to do so.",35
167,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , he has.",35
168,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then , why is it necessary to give him authority in the Bill ?",35
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He has no power fco do it.,35
170,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But he does do it . He is like the man who was told he could not be sick on the bridge, but was sick nevertheless. I have here figures showing the increases of the accounts in the Commonwealth Savings Bank since it opened. While in Victoria the accounts increased in a given quarter by 2,993, in London they increased by only 68. The figures are positively laughable. In the biggest city in the world, where fchere is a population of 7,000,000 persons, the Commonwealth is prepared to take the savings of the British workman, and to use them for Australian purposes, and yet during the quarter ended June, 1913, fchere were only 85 new accounts opened; in the next quarter, 97; and in the next quarter, 68. The business would be small for the most remote town in the Mallee.",35
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And this, notwithstanding the fact that a higher rate of interest is offered.",35
172,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . I agree with the right honourable gentleman that it is not ethically right, either in times of peace or in times of war, for the Commonwealth to go to London and say, "" We want the savings of the people of England."" The honourable member who propounded the scheme never proposed that we should search countries across the seas for the convenience and advantage of the people of this State. In Victoria we have gone so far in our sense of localization as to provide that not only is our Savings Bank to confine the raising of money to Victorian depositors, is bufc also that the money must be spent within our borders. H ad all the States acted in the same way, we should not have had the New South Wales Treasurer going to the Savings Bank of Adelaide to take up debentures. He could not get money from Victoria, because the Victorian Savings Banks Commissioners are not allowed to lend out of the State.",35
173,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Ye t the honourable member calls himself an Australian!,35
174,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am more Australian than is the Prime Minister. I was born here, and I am going to die here. Everything I ever got or had is Australian.",35
175,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What the honourable member said previously was very smallminded.,35
176,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My honourable friend from New South Wales will never understand Victoria. We read in the Scriptures of the wise men coming from the east. The honourable member represents East Sydney, but apparently things have changed since biblical times; or he is called West to mark an exception.",35
177,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have never run away from a constituency.,35
178,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No r have I . The principle should apply in regard to the Commonwealth Savings Bank that applies in regard to the Savings Bank of Victoria. The institution should be for the benefit of our own people, and its money should be raised in Australia and spent in Australia for Australian purposes. I should hesitate to go to the people of any other country and ask them to lend us their money in dribs and drabs. The savings banks of the Old World do good business for the people in England. They are the soundest institutions in the world. We do not need to enter into competition with them, and by doing so will put ourselves in a wrong light before our parents and kinsfolk in the Old World. It may be that the Governor of the Bank can claim that he has done what he has done with the full authority of the present Administration ; but, nevertheless, it is wrong. I hope that when new powers are given to him we shall correct matters. We are proposing to allow the Governor to acquire State institutions-smal l savings banks. But that has already been done. Some of the Tasmanian institutions have been acquired, and I think some of the Western Australian institutions, without statutory authority. Y o u beget liability to blundering and the exceeding of power when you put a Kaiser in charge of the Bank. So long as Mr . Miller has his present powers, he can flout Parliament.",35
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He told us that he did not agree with tlio opinion of the Attorney-General.,36
180,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He is able to say to a Treasurer or to a group of Ministers, "" Leave me alone. Parliament has seated me on a throne of authority, and I shall not answer the questions of prying members or of the press.""",36
181,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is a good thing that he could not be interfered with during the past twelve months.,36
182,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What difference would it have made beyond preventing the Broken Hill people from getting their money? No member of Parliament would wish to interfere with questions of overdraft, advances, discounts, and exchanges. But when the Governor of the Bank makes a departure involving a new principle i u the development of our institutions, we have a right to speak. It was pointed out by the honourable member for Eden Monaro that this institution was promised to the people for the making of small advances to farmers and others, to enable them to do the settlement and developmental work which means so much to both country and town. Instead of making such advances the Governor of the Bank says, when a big corporation comes along and asks it to underwrite a certain quantity of debentures, taking all the risks and accepting a commission by way of compensation, "" Certainly. Let the big corporations come along and I will do their underwriting.""",36
183,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member say that the Bank took up these debentures?,36
184,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It underwrote them for a compensating commission.,36
185,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member object to that?,36
186,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If there be an overflowing cash-box at the Bank, and the small borrowers have what they want, and if there be a wholesome business which he has the means of accomplishing, by all means let him bring the profits to the Treasury of Australia. But if he is not able to meet the demands for money of the.small settlers, I hold that he should turn a deaf ear to the tempting propositions of large mining corporations.",36
187,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The question is : "" Is he permitted to underwrite and to make a .profit for the Bank?",36
188,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Prime Minister surely recognises the responsibilities of underwriting. It is not merely a transaction by a broker, who is the go-between as between the borrower and the lender.",36
189,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Miller underwrote it, and raised the inoney in Australia, and he has been hounded for having done so ever since.",36
190,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not hounding him at all. I am merely saying that that is a function which should be secondary to the primary functions of the Bank. I admit that this is an arguable part of the proposition. There may be some who will say, "" Come one, come all, this Bank will do anything that is profitable."" But I think that a National bank should be treated as the great railway enterprises of the States are treated. In other words, it sliould be used primaril y for the development of the country, and to help our people.",36
191,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It sbould largely advance inoney on land?,37
192,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not necessarily.,37
193,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then how is it going to help the farmers?,37
194,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the men who launched this Bill had their way, the competition between the Savings Bank institutions would grow apace, and it is plain that before long those institutions would theu go out of business. There is only one other argument that I would like to put before sitting down. It relates to the proposal to increase the capital of the bank from £1,000,000 to £10,000,000, the object being, according to the declaration of the clauses, that we should buy up certain banking institutions as the opportunity occurs. There are two weaknesses in that, proposal, apart from those which have been alluded to. One is that we are invited to buy a "" pig in a poke "" so far as the nation is concerned. Whatever institutions were purchased this Parliament would have no voice in tlieir purchase. It would not know whether their liabilities were correctly stated or whether their assets were correctly valued and verified. Tliere are two ways out of that difficulty, and I think it sbould be left to the Ministry to take one of them. Mr J. H . OATTS - Canno t we inquire into those matters?",37
195,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"How can we, seeing that the matter will rest with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the Treasurer ?",37
196,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Surely we could direct the Treasurer?,37
197,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , if the honourable member and his party are prepared to back up their direction by defeating the Ministry. The weakness of the scheme is that the Governor of the Bank and the Treasurer might agree to purchase an institution, say the A. B. Company, with, perhaps, £9,000,000 worth of assets and £9,000,000 worth of liabilities, and this Parliament, which would have to back every debenture, would know nothing whatever about the value of those assets. I l would have no voice in the ratification of the conditional agreement. Tf the nation were to buy a tramway system or a great sugar enterprise, the only way in which it could be successfully done would be by the Government taking upon themselves the responsibility of drawing a conditional agreement with the seller, which should be liable to ratification by the shareholders or proprietors on the one side, and by Parliament and the people on the other. If the State purchased the tramways, that is the only way in which it could be done. Everybody desires to see that misjudgment does not lead us into a loss of millions sterling. There is still another aspect, and apparently the Prime Minister has not thought of it. It may be said at once that a financial corporation would not consent to have, at risk of rejection, the whole of its affairs laid bare on the table of the House, because that might mean ruin if rejection followed. I admit that that is so, although we saw the same sort of thing done in connection with two great insurance companies in Australia. The whole Gf the affairs of those companies were laid upon the table, they were debated in the press before the amalgamation took place, and in one case rejection, and in the other acceptance, resulted. But eventually no injury was done to either of these institutions. At the same time, we must recollect that financial institutions are delicate things, which might easily be killed or injured by such methods. Surely the Government will not ask this Parliament to give unfettered control in matters of this kind to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank or to the Treasurer without certification by the nation. Surely it should be necessary that certain valuators should be appointed to privately value and privately certify either to the Government or to Parliament, and it ought also to be necessary for the Auditor General to report upon the securities which are intangible. The proposal of the Government, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, may easily mean an increase of £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 in the purchasing power of the bank. If it be true that this institution, without any capital, has already developed a purchasing power of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000, how strong will its deposits and till nionej bo when its capital is r £10,000,000? Obviously £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 might be the measure of its deposits and its capital, and it might embark on huge purchases of the kind projected. I cannot think that the Governor of the Bank can purchase an organization whose operations cover Australia, unless its purchase runs into double or treble j£10i000,000. He might purchase a Bank which does business in one or two States, but that would not satisfy the whole of the States. He would naturally look to an organization which will cover the Commonwealth, and spread the advantages of its operations over all parts of Australia. The cost of that purchase will be a great deal more than is contemplated in this Bill. All things considered-and I am grateful to honourable members for the patient hearing which they have accorded me at a lime when I know they are anxious to catch their trains- I would recommend to the Prime Minister the reconsideration of two important phases in connection with this Bank.",37
198,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before the honourable member closes, will he refresh his memory by looking at the marked portions of the report of the Premiers' Conference of 1912 ? He will then see that I am not in error, and that he himself is. Mr ""WATT - This is the portion of the right honourable gentleman's speech to which he has directed my attentionI shall sav this, however, that, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, I shall be happy indeed, if this Bcheme is acceptable to you and to us, and is approved by the Parliaments of the States and the Commonwealth, to meet the Treasurers of the States to discuss matters of financial importance to both of us, so that we could gel a lead as regards any amendment of the Act from time to time, or receive suggestions for the better management of the Bank in the interests of the people generally.",38
199,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the honourable member be good enough now to read the marked passage on page 73 of that report?,38
200,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before doing so, let me pause, because it is not very easy to say whether or not this portion of the report has been unwittingly torn from its context. I might requireto read the whole of the report, in order to show the definite refusals of partnership which are contained in it.",38
201,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then , in view of the hour, I ask the honourable member not to make the quotation now, but to do so at a later stage.",38
202,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Ver y well; at a later stage I undertake to prove my case with regard to the actual partnership offered and refused. It was not the kind of partnership of which I was speaking when amendment. the right honourable gentleman inter[27] rupted me. I do not desire to do him an injustice. I know that his mind runs along perfectly, rigid lines with regard to this Bank, and my own has not changed very much with respect to it I have a fairly good memory, and it has been re' cently refreshed. My proposition for partnership was one for control of the government of this institution, and not for periodic consultations, such as we now undertake, as between the Commonwealth and the States, in regard to theories of the Bank and suggestions for its better conduct. I shall, however, discuss that question at a more opportune time. I was about to say, when interrupted, that I am not qualified, as a private member, to make any offer to the right honourable gentleman.. But, as this debate proceeds-and I trust it will be carried on from both sides without prejudice or. paseion- I am quite sure that the desire will grow to see this second birth of the Commonwealth Bank owned by both the Commonwealth and the States. We cannot ask the States into partnership as long as we declare war against them, and there is still a state of war. We had hopes that, if the late Government were returned with a majority at the last general election, the agreement which is proclaimed as the policy of the Liberal party would be. adopted. As a matter of fact, it was not only a Liberal party proposition. It was adopted just as swiftly and energetically by my honourable friend, the Premier of New South Wales, as it was by any of the other State Premiers. The Government of New South Wales feel the pinch of this competition even more than we do in Victoria, and it will be an act of statesmanship which will redound to their lasting credit, if the Prime Minister and his colleagues are able, before the Bill passes, to put upon it the impress of union and companionship aud co-operation wilh the States. If that he done, we shall he able to build up an institution which will be of lasting service to the people of Australia. Debate (on motion by Sir WIIXIA M IRVINE) adjourned.
