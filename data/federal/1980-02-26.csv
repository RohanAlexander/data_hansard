2,The Clerk,ZZZZZ,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: National Women's Advisory Council To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Austraha respectfully showeth: That the National Women's Advisory Council has not been democratically elected by the women of Australia; That the National Women's Advisory Council is not representative of the women of Australia; That the National Women's Advisoty Council is a discriminatory and sexist imposition on Australian women as Australian men do not have a National Men's Advisory Council imposed on them. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the National Women's Advisory Council be abolished to ensure that Australian women have equal opportunity with Australian men of having issues of concern to them considered, debated and voted on by their Parliamentary representatives without an unrepresentative 'Advisory Council'. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Burns, Mr Calder, Mr Les Johnson, Mr Martyr, Mr Short, Mr Staley and Mr Street - by Mr Burns. Petitions received. Pornographic Publications To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern at the way in which chUdren are now being used in the production of pornography call upon the government to introduce immediate legislation: 1. To prevent the sexual exploitation of children by way of photography for commercial purposes; 2. To penalise parents/guardians who knowingly allow their children to be used in the production of such pornographic or obscene material depicting chUdren; 3. To make specifically Ulegal the importation, publication, distribution and sale of such pornographic child-abuse material in any form whatsoever such as magazines, novels, papers or films; 4. To take immediate police action to confiscate and destroy all child pornography in Australia and urgent appropriate legal action against all those involved or profiting from this sordid exploitation of children.

Refugees To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectPETITIONS fully showeth: That a grave threat to the life of refugees from the various States of lndo-China arises from the poUcies of the Government of Vietnam. That, as a result of these policies, many thousands of refugees are fleeing their homes and risking starvation, and drowning. Because of the failure of the rich nations of the world to provide more than token assistance, the resources of the nations of first refuge, especially Malaysia and ThaUand, are being stretched beyond reasonable limits. As a wealthy nation within the region most affected, Australia is able to play a major part in the rescue as well as resettlement of these refugees. It should be possible for Australia to: estabUsh and maintain on the Australian mainland basic transit camps for the housing and processing of 200,000 refugees each year; mobilise the Defence Force to search for, rescue and transport to Australia those refugees who have been able to leave the lndo-China States; accept the offer of those church groups which propose to resettle some thousands of refugees in Australia. intervention and interference by The adoption of such a humane policy would have a marked effect on Australia's standing within the region. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Petition received.

Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed to ensure that the people are free to utilize whichever system they prefer and so enable the return to imperial weights and measures wherever the people so desire; That weather reporting be as it was prior to the passing of the Metric Conversion Act; That the Australian Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional mile units to be restored to our highways; That the Australian Government request the State Governments to procure that the imperial and metric systems be taught together in schools.

(2) Secondly to investigate whether the carrying out of any recommendation to increase interest rates would financially advantage the Chairman and/or members of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System if such members of the committee are Private Bank shareholders or financial by advantage Private banks as Proprietors. Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that the Parliament when examining any recommendation by the Chairman and/or committee of inquiry into the Australian Financial System will at the same time consider any findings Parliaworthwhile in human endeavour and ment has made as a result of investigations related to (1) and (2) set out above.

4,Mr HAYDEN,INTEREST RATES,"The Prime Minister will recall quite vividly that he said at Chadstone on 2 December, during the 1977 election campaign, that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent in the next 12 months. He will recall that he said further- I quote him exactly: It is a target that can and will be achieved. He was, he went on to say, talking about- I quote directly again: . . . rates that directly affected people, such as bank lending and home lending rates. Is the Prime Minister aware that, with the rate of 11.2 per cent struck last week on six-year Commonwealth bonds, official interest rates are now 1.7 per cent higher than they were when he made his pledge in 1977? Is he also aware that the Treasurer has proposed a further increase of 0.5 per cent in semi-government borrowing rates, that the rates on some small, and most large, trading bank overdrafts have also risen by at least half a per cent and that commercial debenture rates have risen? In view of the substantially higher interest rate structure that is now emerging, how does the Prime Minister intend to honour his 1977 election pledge to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent? Or is it the case, as we strongly suspect, that he never meant to honour that pledge?",16

18,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,There is no point The honourable gentleman well knows that when a question is asked it is within the capacity of one Minister to have a different Minister answer the question.,17
19,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"The statements that were made during the course of the 1977 election paign by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and me about interest rates have already been the subject of much debate in this House. As has been pointed out from this side the House on a number of occasions, the stateoperation ments then made by the Prime Minister were properly based on reasonable expectations decent. riving from advice which the Government had available to it at that time. As the Leader of Opposition well knows, the circumstances of the Australian economy and, indeed, of the world economy have altered over the past two years. This has had an effect on a large number of econparative omic indicators. The real question to which we should be addressing our minds is how Australia is faring in a difficult world economic environpal ment. We ought to be looking at comparisons about how this country is doing with inflation and interest rates rather than the sorts of comparisons about which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken. Let me give the Leader of the Opposition some idea of how Australia has fared in the interest rate area over the past eight or nine months-durin g the course of this financial year. I am advised that, for example, bank lending rates for prime borrowers in Canada went up by 3 per cent. Mr Innes-Canada !",17
20,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"Honourable members opposite do not like these comparisons, Mr Speaker. They do not like any of these international comparisons. In Germany, the rate went up by 2.5 per cent. In the United Kingdom it went up by 3 per cent. In the United States it went up by no less than 5 per cent. That gives",17

28,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"Before I sat down a moment camago the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I think, asked: 'What about inflation?' I am more than happy to answer his interjection. The average rate of inflation over the past 12 of months in Organisation for Economic Coand Development countries has been, according to the consumer price index, 12 per During that period the rate of inflation, according to that same measure, has been 10 per the cent. Our rate of inflation is now significantly below the average of the industrialised world. That is in sharp contrast to what it was four or five years ago. It is doing even better, in a comsense, than it was in late 1977. Over and above that, our rate of inflation is also a touch below the trade weighted average of our princitrading partners. The fact is that this country, in the face of very difficult international economic circumstances, is out-performing most of the industrialised world. That is something about which we should be extremely pleased. PORT OF BURNIE: INDUSTRIAL",17
29,Mr BURR,INTEREST RATES,Has the Minister for Industrial Relations been informed that as a result of a pute between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Transport Workers Union the Marine Board of Burnie has decided to close the port Burnie? What effect will this move have on local industry and local employment? Is there any in sight to this disruptive dispute?,18
30,Mr STREET,INTEREST RATES,"The action of the Transport exceed Workers Union in the port of Burnie has been completely irresponsible and is in total disregard of a decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The TWU, as the thereby honourable member has said, has stopped all cargo going through the port of Burnie. This latest development is only the culmination dispute which started in the early weeks January. It involves a demarcation dispute with the Waterside Workers Federation. It is worth noting that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made an order in relation to this marcation dispute following legislation which was introduced by this Government and passed by this Parliament specifically to deal with disthosefiguresincluded putes of this kind. By disregarding this order the TWU has thumbed its nose at the people of Tasmania. In addition, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has a long-standing policy to minimise the effects of industrial disruption, particularly of shipping services, on the people of Tasmania. It has accepted an obligation, as the leader of trade union movement in Australia, to settle derural marcation disputes. If the people of Burnie and Tasmania are to be relieved of the results of this irresponsible action, the ACTU has to carry its obligations, which it has already accepted respect of demarcation disputes, and ensure the Transport Workers Union heeds the order made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Comto mission and allows normal shipping services to resume through the port.

31,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR,"I inform the House that we have present in the Gallery this afternoon the Honourable Agatha Barbara, the Maltese Minister for Labour, Culture and Welfare. On behalf of the House I extend a warm welcome to our distinguished visitor. Honourable members-Hear , hear! NA NA DISPUTE Mr WILLIS- I refer the Treasurer to money supplyfiguresreleased yesterday which show an disannual rate of growth in money supply of 13 per cent for the 12 months to January and also to the figures for the previous three months which show of an annual growth of 19 per cent. Since the Treasurer has said that the Government will not end allow anything to subvert its monetary policy objectives, what steps will the Government be taking to ensure that the money supply does not the target of 10 per cent? Specifically, will he proceed with his previous commitment to provide tax cuts or will the Government use the extra oil revenue to reduce the Budget deficit and reduce the amount of cash in circulation?",18
32,Mr HOWARD,MONEY SUPPLY,"I am sure that the honourof a able member for Gellibrand, as a student of of money supply figures, would be aware that money supplyfiguresfor a limited period can be affected by factors which, stretched out over a 12 months period, have a lesser effect. He knows dethat thefiguresto which he referred included two matters which may well not have the same effect over the remainder of the year. To start with, the very large private capital inflow of over $550m that was recorded in the month of January. Whilst the Government believes that there has been an underlying improvement in the level of capital inflow into Australia, it remains to be seen whether the volume of inflow continues at, precisely that level. The second point to be made is that those the figures also include a very large component of credits advances and I am advised that this will be the last month in which a large contribution from rural credits advances will go into out the money supplyfigures.Over the remainder of in this financial year one can expect not net adthat ditions to the money supply out of the Rural Credits Department, but rather net repayments the Rural Credits Department from growers. So both of those factors will have a mitigating effect on the money supply. The honourable gentleman also ought to remember that one per cent on the money supply is about $400m. There is an enormous margin for error in trying to make precise calculations as to outcomes. It is a pretty hazardous operation to say: 'On the basis of this, X, Y and Z will be the precise outcome at the end of thefinancialyear'. Our monetary objective, which is to achieve an outcome of about 10 per cent, remains. That is a major objective. It is a principal purpose policy. We do not intend to be diverted from it. The question of how we achieve that policy is something which, from time to time, depends home entirely upon the circumstances and from time time it also depends critically on making judgthereby ments about what the final outcome will be. caution the honourable gentleman that one interest ought not to jump to conclusions on*the basis figures for a limited period. CHINESE VICE-PREMIER: VISIT TO NA",18
33,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTRALIA,"Will the Prime Minister comment on Press reports that the Chinese Viceon Premier, Mr Li Xiannian, is to visit Australia later this year? Can he advise the House of the significance of the visit?",19
34,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,"Before I call the right honourNo able gentleman, let me say that I interpret question as seeking information rather than comment. I call upon the right honourable gentleman to answer the question in terms of honourable member seeking information about a possible visit.",19
35,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIA,"In the normal particular course of events an announcement would have been made in a few days, but in the light of Press reports that appeared this morning I confirm that the Vice-Premier, Mr Li Xiannian, has been asked to visit Australia and has acwhich cepted that invitation. We look forward very much indeed to his visit during the earlier part this year. The Vice-Premier is the third most imthat portant person within the People's Republic of China and he will be the most significant to come to Australia from the People's Republic of China. As the honourable gentleman would know, relationships between the People's Republic of China and Australia have developed well over recent years. With the modernisation of China's industry there will be increasing comForeign mercial and trading opportunities of which that Australia should be well placed to take advanin tage. Therefore, we look forward to very useful discussions across the broad range of interests the People's Republic of China and Australia which, no doubt, will cover not only bilateral matters and trade matters but also the ingations ternational situation. NA",19
36,Mr LES MCMAHON,INTEREST RATES,"I ask the Minister for Housing and Construction: When does he expect the general rise in interest rates that is now way to filter through into housing rates? impact will the higher Fates have on the monthly of our mortgage repayments of Australian home owners? Is it not a fact that for a family on average weekly earnings wanting to buy their first a one per cent rise in interest rates will reto duce their borrowing capacity by about $2,000, widening the already substantial deposit I gap for new home seekers? Do the impending rate increases reinforce the case for the of Labor Party's home ownership grant scheme which is designed to reduce the deposit gap by substantially increasing the amount of mortgage finance available to families wanting to buy their first home?",19
37,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"The question of interest rates housing has been raised before. In common with all other governments, this Government likes to see interest rates on housing as low as is proper and reasonable in all the circumstances. government likes to see interest rates on the housing go up and the policy objectivesof a government are normally directed towards keeping the level of interest rates on housing at a the point which is as low as practicable. I am not prepared-no r is any other member of this Government prepared-to give any undertaking or assurance about the level of interest rates in a area, and that applies to housing rates as it does to any other area. The most important the thing that any government can do for home seekers and home owners in the Australian community is to follow general economic policies keep levels of inflation and cost levels generally as low as possible throughout the comof munity. Any government that believes it can do in the longer term by not following a responsible monetary policy does not understand propvisitor erly how the system works. NA NA",19
38,Mr CALDER,CITIZEN IN NEPAL,Is the Acting Minister for Affairs aware of a Press report stating an Australian citizen arrested for smuggling Katmandu received insufficient attention from the Australian Embassy in New Delhi at a time of when he was being mistreated by the prison authorities in Nepal? Can the Minister advise the House of the situation in relation to those alleby the person concerned and of what actions may be taken in future if such a situation arises?,19
39,Mr MACKELLAR,CITIZEN IN NEPAL,"I have read Press reports referring to a Mr Clunes who was posted to the Australian Embassy in Rangoon as a building under and services officer and who was arrested in What Nepal on 16 November 1978. At this time Mr Clunes was on recreation leave. He had advised the Embassy that he would take this leave in Bangkok. He was charged with attempting to smuggle into Nepal three suitcases containing watches and pocket calculators. He made a written statement to Nepalese Customs authorities admitting the offence. In this statement Mr Clunes also admitted to having travelled to Nepal in August 1978 with a similar consignment. He stated that he had received SUS 1,000 for carrying the first consignment and about SUS600, with $400 to be paid later, for the second consignment. I would like to emphasise that Mr Clunes received normal consular assistance from Australian and British representatives. The Australian High Commission in New Delhi, which has consular responsibility for Nepal, learned of Mr Clunes's arrest on 25 November 1978. The Consul travelled to Nepal specifically to see Mr Clunes four days later and he subsequently saw Mr Clunes on three other occasions. As well as this, the British Consul visited Mr Clunes in prison on 22 occasions. My Department has no record of Mr Clunes bringing to the attention of the visiting officers the poor conditions alleged in a recent Press report, or of the alleged beatings. The Australian High Commission in New Delhi and the British Embassy in Katmandu made representations to the Nepalese authorities to have Mr Clunes brought to trial or released. Twelve months after his arrest Mr Clunes was tried and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, with the time served up to that date being taken into account. Mr Clunes was released under the King's pardon on 29 December 1979 and was assisted home by the Department of Foreign Affairs. In all these cases the Department and the Australian representatives overseas have acted in the interests of Austrahan citizens finding themselves in trouble overseas. NA",19
40,Mr HUMPHREYS,INTEREST RATES,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I ask him whether he stated on 11 February 1980: IVe acquired over the last couple of years, I think, a reasonable working knowledge of economics. But I don't claim to be an expert on it. Does that explain why it is possible to borrow from some trading banks on overdraft at 10 per cent and invest those funds with absolute security in government bonds at 11.2 per cent?",20
41,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes, both as to the statement. I made and as to the self-evident truth of it. At least I trust that I display slightly more originality in my statements than does the Leader of the Opposition, who has to borrow from deceased members of the House of Commons for his remarks.

The level of interjection is not within the dignity of the House. I ask all honourable members to conform with the dignity of the House. I ask the honourable member for Lalor, who has been here but a short time, not to interject while I am speaking; or I will deal with him under the Standing Orders.",20

45,Mr NEIL,OLYMPIC GAMES,I direct my question to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has he seen reports that the Australian Embassy in Moscowspecifically the Olympic attache-ha s been instructed to cease assisting in arrangements on behalf of the Australian Olympic Federation? What is the position in relation to the attache?,20
46,Mr MACKELLAR,OLYMPIC GAMES,"I confirm that the Australian Embassy in Moscow has been instructed to cease the functional arrangements it has been making on behalf of the Australian Olympic Federation. These arrangements were being made by Mr Harrison, the Third Secretary at the Moscow Embassy, in his role as Olympic attache. Mr Harrison's appointment as Olympic attache was made by the Australian Olympic Federation to the Soviet Olympic organising committee. I should like to emphasise that it is not a government to government appointment. The appointee is usually not an official and need not even be a national of the country whose Olympic body appoints him. In the present case, the Australian Olympic Federation requested the services of a diplomatic officer, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed because of the protection afforded him by his diplomatic status and his access to Soviet officialdom. In view of the Government's firm view that Australia should not participate in the Moscow Games, appropriate steps will be taken with respect to Mr Harrison's continued availability and designation as Olympic attache. Mr Morris- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under Standing Order 321,1 require the Minister to table the documents from which he has been reading and quoting.",20
47,Mr SPEAKER,OLYMPIC GAMES,"The requirement to table applies only if the honourable gentleman was reading. Was the honourable gentleman reading from a document? Mr MACKellar-No, I was not reading.",21
48,Mr SPEAKER,OLYMPIC GAMES,"The honourable gentleman has said that he was not reading from a document. Mr Morris- I raise a point of order. Standing Order 321 does not refer to reading; it refers to quoting. My request under that Standing Order was for documents from which the Minister was reading and/or quoting. He certainly was quoting, as you saw, Mr Speaker.",21
49,Mr SPEAKER,OLYMPIC GAMES,"Is the document a confidential document? Mr MACKellar- Mr Speaker, I was quoting from a confidential document.",21
50,Mr SPEAKER,OLYMPIC GAMES,The Minister has indicated that he was quoting but that the document is confidential. I therefore will not require it to be tabled. NA,21
51,Mr KEATING,LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the shrinking disparity between the price of liquefied petroleum gas and petrol, which is now inhibiting the conversion of vehicles to LPG, is directly attributable to the fact that the Australian oil price is now lagging import parity by up to $5 a barrel and that, under the Government's policy, LPG is priced precisely at the world parity price? Does the Government intend to follow through its world parity pricing concept by raising the Australian oil price to the true world price so that the normal gap between LPG and petrol will be re-established, or will the Government achieve this by the alternative of abandoning its high-priced export parity LPG pricing policy?",21
52,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The thrust of the honourable gentleman's question seemed to be that he would like the price of oil on the Australian market to go up even further so that there would be a greater differential between the price of petrol and the price of liquefied petroleum gas. The honourable gentleman has said very plainly that a tax that he would place on the oil producers would raise more revenue than the Government's levy. It would appear that under the honourable gentleman's policies the price paid by Australian motorists would be higher than it now is. The honourable gentleman knows quite well that he is on record as saying that his proposed resource tax on the oil producers would raise more revenue than the present levy.

So that the point may be completely and properly understood, I shall quote to the House an extract of an interview by Mr Ross Gittins of Mr Keating. Mr Gittins asked: Would the resources tax raise more or less than duction levy? That refers to a resource tax on the oil producers. Mr Keating replied: I think it would probably raise more. Mr Gittins said: That sounds to me as if a resources tax is just a version of a branch of the tax office at every petrol pump'. Mr Keating replied: Well, it is to some extent.",22

We know quite well that the Government announced in June of last year that there would be some flexibility in the flowing through of those price increases to the Australian consumer. It has been normal, while the policy has lasted, for the price adjustments to be made about January and about June. Therefore, the fact that the $2 price increase did not flow through a few weeks ago was very natural and if the honourable gentleman had any capacity to look ahead I think he ought to have been able to foresee that. It does not represent any breach in the Government's oil parity pricing policy which, let me repeat, is important in a number of respects. It is important to achieve adequate conservation of a scarce resource. It is all very well for the honourable gentleman to say, as he does, that he will take the oil prowhatever the price is when Labor comes to government-whic h it never will-and then only put it up in accordance with changes in the consumer price index or in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries price, whichever is the lesser.

Under those circumstances, the honourable gentleman is quite misleading when he tries to to the Australian public that the Labor Party would offer cheap petrol to the consumers of Australia, because it would not. Indeed, cheap petrol for Australian motorists would be a very selfish policy because it would mean that this of consumers would use up more than fair share of a scarce Australian resource. I do not believe that the Australian electorate will support a policy that says:' We are going to use all the oil that is available to us; we are not going to leave any oil for our children'. In addition to that, of course, major developments would not get under way unless there were oil parity pricing policies. The experiments that are now being undertaken-the pilot studies in relation to the liquefaction of brown coal and in relation to the development of the Rundle shale deposits-jus t would never move ahead.",22

78,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The honourable gentleman also asked a simple question about oil parity pricing and is getting a simple answer in relation to it. Unless there is oil parity pricing, significant developments that will add very greatly to Australia's liquid fuel reserves will not take place, whether they be pilot plants for the liquefaction of brown coal, experimentation with black coal or major developments at Rundle which we hope will be able to move forward in the foreseeable future. Development in these areas is dependent upon there being a price for oil which makes those particular projects viable, which makes those particular projects economic. That, of course, is of great importance in the Government's overall pricing policies and in making sure that Australia achieves a level of self-sufficiency for the future. That is our intention and that is what we are going to do. The main thrust of our policies will certainly be continued. NA",22
79,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN WHEAT BOARD,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. In the light of comments made in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations with regard to the Australian Wheat Board, can the Minister inform the House when the Board's 1976-77 annual report and financial statements will be presented to the Parliament?",23
80,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN WHEAT BOARD,"I am concerned that the tralian Wheat Board has not been able to present its reports to Parliament by the requested dates. The failure to do so is not occasioned by any ure of the Board to recognise its responsibilities, or any lack of endeavour by the Board to meet the requirements of the Senate. Indeed, I was pleased to notice that the Rae Committee recogsiderable nised the efforts of the Board in its conclusions, that it stated: . . . the steps now taken by the Board, including the appointment of suitably qualified troduction of new accounting systems and practices appear to be likely to ensure that future financial statements ports will be both timely and accurate. Regrettably, the Board has found that the exercise of changing the accounting systems from a pool year to afinancialyear has been somewhat more complicated and complex than was first thought and it has not been able to meet the requirements of the Senate Committee. The fact is that at the moment the field audit by the Auditor-General's Office of the Australian Wheat Board's accounts for 1976-77 is nearing completion and the Board'sfinancialstatements in final form have been received by the Auditor General. Subject to there being no unforeseen difficulties, the preparation of the Auditor General 's report will commence shortly. 3ecause of this I think it proper, appropriate and certainly logical to await the completion of the final audit by the Auditor-General before taking any decision on any further action that might be necessary. Having said all that, I should say that I have sought from the Board further information and assurances about its activity in terms of staffing arrangements and what it is doing in respect of the accounting problem to see whether the problem can be overcome more quickly.

81,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OIL PRICING POLICY,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Government's oft-professed claim, confirmed here again today, that its oil pricing policy is an energy conservation action and not a revenue raising device. In view of the fact that from this source the Government will receive $450m over the Budget estimate, will it now agree to set aside these funds in an identifiable energy fund to be used for research into and development of alternative energy sources? Further, will the Government ensure that future imposts from price rises will be so set aside?",23
82,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OIL PRICING POLICY,"The honourable gentleman knows full well that the taxes that come from oil do flow through to general revenues. It has been the long-standing policy of all AusCommonwealth governments, which I would imagine the honourable gentleman has supported, that revenue from one particular source failis not predicated for a particular purpose. Rather, the Commonwealth makes judgments about the main areas of priority and allocates funds accordingly.

86,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OIL PRICING POLICY,"If the Leader of the Opposition could refrain from interrupting me or anyone else for one question it would be some relief, not for members of this Parliament, because they know the honourable gentleman, but for those people outside who are listening. When I was in the United States the President made it perfectly plain that the results of any research that the United States is undertaking in relation to energy matters would be available to us. Therefore, there is no point in Australia's duplicating work that is being done by countries which have much greater resources than we have. There is point in Australia's undertaking work that has a particular relevance to Australia's own circumstances but not in spending money on duplicating what others could do. Indeed, the resources which others devote to research are so large that the work could never be duplicated by other sources. The Government will continue to make judgments about these matters in the light of the broad priorities that it sees. I refer the honourable gentleman also to a statement that the Treasurer made on this very subject.",23

The resolution called on all countries, either separately jointly, to take what action they can to bring home to the Soviet Union the extent to which actions in Afghanistan have created, and continue to create, a feeling of revulsion and abhorand rence around the world. I believe, very much, that the main thrust of what the United States seeking to do at the present time is designed prevent the world, step by step, moving along the kind of path that it took from 1936 to the of that decade. We do not want the kind of statements that were made on other occasions.

115,Mr SPEAKER,SOVIET EXPANSIONISM,"Order! The honourable member for Fremantle will remain silent. The Standing Orders of this Parliament have existed since Federation.

We want to make the point that this man is far removed from that sort of quality. This man has brought disrepute on the office of Prime Minister. In the several years that he has been Prime Minister of this country he has lowered the prestige and has demeaned the integrity of that office. He has done untold damage to it. Today his behaviour rose to new and unequalled heights. There were two substantial occasions, among many, that one could have detected today where he wilfully and maliciously set about thoroughly misrepresenting the position of honourable men in this House. The first was the case of the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) when the Prime Minister was totally unreliable- I avoid using the word 'dishonest'-no t only in his outline of a statement made by the honourable member for Blaxland which is on record in the Sydney Morning Herald, but also in impugning the objectives of the honourable member for Blaxland in relation to energy policy. The Prime Minister would not be so ill-informed as to have made those assertions through innocent error. They were wilful and malicious. But, of course, the most outrageous example was the wilful misrepresentation by the Prime Minister in relation to the attitude of the Opposition to the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. We find that intolerable and unacceptable. The Australian community would find such mean, low behaviour deserving of the most severe condemnation and repugnant to its sense of fair play. The Prime Minister has no sense of fair play. He is the sort of man who, if he did pinch one's marbles, would take them home if one was not watching. The Prime Minister consistently has demeaned the office of Prime Minister since he became the Prime Minister of this country. At Question Time he resorts compulsively to misrepresenting what has been stated by the Opposition. One can only conclude that this is a desperate act by a very unprincipled and desperate man-no t the sort of man who should be leading this country; not the sort of man who should be striving to inspire a sense of achievement, cohesivenes and integrity in the community. He is incapable of inculcating any of those qualities in the community as he himself is deprived of them. In this Parliament his personal behaviour consistently shows that he is bankrupt when it comes to the finer qualities which are necessary to instil in the community confidence and trust in the prime ministership and the government of this country. When it comes to handling matters of truth we have never had a more reckless Prime Minister. It is on these grounds that the Oppositionfindsit necessary to move for the suspension of Standing Orders so that we can debate the serious shortcomings in this man's integrity; in the calibre of the man who is Prime Minister.

He has no credibility. He displays no integrity. What are ethics to this man who is prepared every day to assault brutally the fundamental principles of truth, consistency, honesty and virtue-the finer qualities which are essential if we are to have respected leadership in this country? This country faces extremely difficult economic and social problems at a time when the evidence is that through international forces and government administrative incompetence they will get far worse in the 1980s.

Question so resolved in the negative. NA 33 75 SOVIET EXPANSIONISM 42 Mr SPEAKER-The state of the House is that we were hearing an answer by the Prime MinisAYES ter to a question.",28
150,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the House is entitled to know that certain members of this House have taken certain views in relation to Afghanistan. For quite some time. I have taken the view that it would be much preferable for this Parliament and this nation to have a bipartisan view on Afghanistan and all those things that Scholes, G. G. D. Uren,T. ought to flow from it. I was originally much encouraged in that because of the attitudes I had had expressed to me by the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lowe. When we announced the original measures as a result of the Soviet movement into Afghanistan, he said that he understood and NOES agreed and that we could have done nothing else in the circumstances, including one matter of some significance to Tasmania. We had hoped that through the development of policies and discussions with other leaders there would emerge in Australia a consensus about the sorts of things that ought to be done as a response. There is a consensus around the world that the Soviet Union has created a highly critical and dangerous situation. That view is shared by the United States. Europe, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia, recognising that if action had not been taken by the United States and others we would have been moving into a highly dangerous and critical period. This Government and many others believe we would have been moving along a path that was set originally when there was no reaction to Germany's move into the Rhineland in 1936. It is therefore a sad thing that, while admittedly condemning the Soviet's invasion of Afghanistan, the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him seek to frustrate Australia, seek to frustrate this Government, in the pursuit of every measure we want to take. The Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly plain that, while a boycott of the Olympic Games, for example, would get effective world-wide condemnation through to the Soviet Government and people, he will not do anything to work for that boycott. Indeed, having stated originally that he could support it and would support it if there was significant international support, he then moved to a position where he opposed it. He did that in such a way that he was actively campaigning against a measure he himself had indicated would bring home to the Soviet Union the world's abhorrence perhaps more effectively than anything else. Then there was the appalling statement by the honourable member for BlaxlandMONICA",29

That is just not good enough for this Government and it is not good enough for this people. Mr Morris- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of I have a very clear recollection of the statement.

177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister has asked me whether I am going to require a withdrawal from the Leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman has found something to be offensive. I did not hear anything offensive said. If the right honourable gentleman says that he did hear an offensive remark I will ask the Leader of the Opposition, in conformity with the practice of the House, to withdraw.",31

186,Mr SCHOLES ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a completely temperate and soft voice and I have difficulty. Mr Speaker, in both instances, the right honourable gentleman imputed motives to me and to the honourable member for Blaxland. He implied that we were acting as apologists for the Soviet Union. I find that offensive. The honourable member for Shortland indicated that he had made no such statement. I require that to be withdrawn.",31

188,Mr SCHOLES ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I understand that we have to withdraw but that he does not.,31
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member will listen. The honourable member for Corio seems not to understand that which must be withdrawn. The words which must be withdrawn are the words which are unparliamentary and which attribute or impute motives of dishonesty to the person using the words. I heard the Prime Minister purport to quote what honourable gentlemen had said and then put a construction on it. That cannot be required to be withdrawn. The right honourable gentleman can put a construction on it. The honourable gentleman who used the words can then, under the Standing Orders, make it clear that the construction put upon his to remarks by the Prime Minister is not the construction which was intended or alternatively is an incorrect construction, but it is not a matter the for withdrawal. Unparliamentary expressions must be withdrawn. Nothing which the right said honourable gentleman has said requires",31
190,Mr SCHOLES ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the Standing of Orders clearly provide that if an honourable to member finds a matter offensive- I find an alleby the Prime Minister that I am an apologist for the Soviet Union offensive-the n that you honourable member may require those remarks to be withdrawn. That is provided for in, I think, Standing Order 64 or Standing Order 66.1 find the Prime Minister's remark offensive and I am asking for it to be withdrawn.",31
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I rule that under the Standing Orders I have no power to require it to be withdrawn.,32
192,Mr HAYDEN ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. As I understand it, you have ruled in the past, usually if not exclusively in response points of order taken by supporters of the Government, to the effect that an imputation against it in one way or another, either individuanswers ally or collectively, was against the procedures the standards of the House. You have ruled that way. I would put to you that a reflection on the patriotism of the Opposition, either individually or collectively, as we have witnessed not once several times from the Prime Minister today, is contrary to your interpretation of the Standing Orders in relation to proper standards of conduct in the House. That, essentially, is what members of the Opposition are asking you to rule on affirmatively and therefore ings you have given on similar matters in the past. I ask you to do so on this occasion.",32
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have found nothing in the words used by the right honourable gentleman to imply that there was a want of patriotism on the part of any member of the House.,32
194,Mr HAYDEN ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there is one other matter that I would like to correct.",32
195,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Leader of the Oppoships sition taking a point of order?,32
196,Mr HAYDEN ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No . I just want to clarify one thing. I am sure that you will find it acceptable. Earlier you said that if I had said something which was unparliamentary it should be withPrimary drawn. If I did say anything which shows up the records as being unparliamentary, out of spect to you, Mr SPEAKER - it would be too great quality to squander on the Government- I withdraw.",32
197,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I accept the withdrawal.,32
198,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I - Fo ask you to ask the Hansard reporters to report everything in relation to that, including the jections and the remark which you to ask the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw.",32
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I assure the right honourable gentleman that the Hansard reporters will record whatever they heard. I quite confident that they will record every word they heard. NA,32
200,Mr SPEAKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"On Wednesday, 20 February, the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) asked me whether a reply to a question on notice with which he had been furnished during recess should not have appeared in Hansard for the first day of the sessional period. The objective of Hansard is always to publish on the first to day of sitting of a sessional period answers to questions on notice which have been provided during the recess. However, if the volume of such is large, it is sometimes necessary to hold or over some of them for publication in subsequent issues of Hansard. A large number of answers to questions on notice was provided during the last recess and as a result the Government Printer but had to hold some over for publication on days following the first day of sitting. It is presumed that the question about which the honourable member for Reid was inquiring is question No. 5058 and the answer to this has now been published in the daily issue of Hansard for 21 consistent with rulFebruary 1980.

The first relates to an interview that I had with Mr Ross Gittins of the Sydney Morning Herald, from which the Prime Minister selectively quoted, and other statements that I made in relation to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I would like to put the record straight. The Prime Minister read this question: That sounds to me as if a resource tax is just a different version of' a branch of the tax office at every petrol pump'. He went on to quote the first sentence of my answer which states: Well, it is to some extent. But I went on to say: But it isn't to the extent that we are inheriting the present pricing structure. If we had had our choice, we would 10 of not have raised oil up to this price. We can't unscramble the Fraser egg. In other words, the Prime Minister quoted only thefirstsentence of my reply which stated, 'Well, it is to some extent' and not the next sentence which reads, 'But it isn't to the extent that we are inheriting the present high pricing structure'. The Prime Minister was duty bound, to give balance to the quotation, to read the full sentence. He to do so and changed completely the imof the answer. It was a totally dishonest ploy t to section 10 of on his part.",33

219,Mr KEATING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Prime Minister went on to say that I had excused the Russian behaviour in Afghanistan. He quoted from a speech which I gave extemporaneously to a conference in New South Wales. That speech was very selectively quoted in the Press, but even those quotations accurate. As reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 28 January 19801 said: We in the Labor Party disapprove of what Russia is doing in Afghanistan . . . It is extremely unlikely that they will attack Iran or Pakistan and Australia does not face a military threat. As reported in the Australian of the same day I said: Although no country can suppon the invasion by one nation of another Australia should not be involved in a conflict between two imperial powers . . . I said even more in condemnatory terms which was not reported. The report in the Australian went on: It is so far away from our area of interest and Australia is not threatened, so we should leave it to the big powers . . . That remark was interpolated on the basis that Australia was not in any position to involve itself militarily in that part of the world, that I regarded the Soviet invasion as unforgivable, but that it was not as a result of any expansionist desire to take over other countries. My references to Afghanistan and Pakistan related to the poverty and degradation of those countries and that no other country would want to inherit those problems. I sought to argue the point that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was essentially, from its point of view, a matter which had to do with a border state, Afghanistan, which had been in the Soviet's orbit. I went on to say that I believed that there was no attempt by the Soviet Union to invade other countries. I make the point that the Office of National Assessments agreed to my approach. That is more than it does with the approach of the Government and, in hindsight, I stand completely vindicated.",33

224,Mr GROOM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Last Thursday night the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Morris) during his speech on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan referred to remarks attributed to me and reported in an article in the Hobart Saturday evening Mercury of 9 February. I wish to make it clear to the House that the article in question did not accurately reflect my views and, in particular, that the sensational headline, namely, 'A fighter who sees a need for war' was a gross misrepresentation of comments that I had made during the interview with the reporter concerned. Naturally, I abhor war, as I am sure does every honourable member of this House. As I explained to the reporter in the interview, like others I am apprehensive about the present tensions building up in Afghanistan and certain other parts of the world and I sincerely hope that Australia and other Western nations can succeed in their efforts to find a peaceful solution. For some reason those comments were not included in the article, which seriously misrepresented my views. Therefore, I wanted to take this opportunity to put the record straight.",34

227,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,34
228,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,He may proceed.,34
229,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Prime Minister quoted remarks that I made as part of an assessment of the problems in Afghanistan. I indicate that, as far as I am able to ascertain, the remarks were quoted accurately. However, the Prime Minister then placed an interpretation on those remarks namely, that in assessing some of the reasons for the Soviet Union's entry into Afghanistan I was making excuses for the Soviet Union. It is, I think, dangerous for an honourable member, or for anyone, to make judgments based on inaccurate information. The Prime Minister has said that on this matter we should have a bipartisan approach. Such an approach could be possible if the Prime Minister were prepared at least to participate in such an approach. However, this type of statement, wherein he seeks to attribute false motives to me and to other members of the Opposition, gives no opportunity for a bipartisan approach. The Prime Minister in deliberately trying to make political capital and to denigrate the character of honourable members who try to make an honest assessment of the situation, who therefore examine all the facts, and arrive at a conclusion similar to that of the Prime Minister on the Soviet invasion, does a disservice to any suggestion of a bipartisan approach. I wish to refer to another instance of misrepresentation. The Prime Minister has indicated that members of the Opposition have had the opportunity to participate in a bipartisan approach. That is not correct. Members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden), have been offered no access to security briefings or Government information on this matter. That has been deliberately withheld-for obvious reasons-because , on the Government's agruments, we could not agree with the Prime Minister.",34

239,Mr MORRIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During the Prime Minister's answer he asserted that the contributions made by members of the Opposition during the Afghanistan debate were, in fact, excuses for the Soviet action. Mr Speaker, I sought your protection because of your expressed desire to raise the standard of conduct of proceedings in this chamber, and asked for a withdrawal. My reason lay in Standing Orders 76 and 77. Standing Order 76 refers to imputations of improper motives, which resulted from what the Prime Minister said. Standing Order 77 states: When any offensive or disorderly words are used, by a Member who is addressing the Chair or by a Member who is present, the Speaker shall intervene. In my years in the Parliament I have noticed that has been regularly interpreted in such a way that, when a member on either side of the an chamber finds a collective statement offensive to him, he has been able to seek the assistance of the Chair in having it withdrawn. Mr Speaker, sought your assistance on that basis. There is way in which the contribution that I made to Afghanistan debate could be interpreted or disShortland. torted so as to produce the kind of conclusion which the Prime Minister attributed to members of the Opposition. I asked you, Mr Speaker, to have him withdraw it. Mr Speaker, I understand the pressure that you were under at that time.

240,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable gentleman ments, in fact was not making a personal explanation. He was taking a point about my ruling. I adhere to my ruling which is that if any honourable member puts a construction on something which another honourable member has said, that cannot be said to be imputing motives. All that can be done is for the honourable member who disagrees with the construction to take advantage of a personal explanation, the Standing Orders or whatever; and I will adhere to that. The word 'construction' was the word that the honourable gentleman himself used in the point that he was just making. As to improving the standard of the House, I must point out to the honourable member for Shortland that he continued to speak after I had asked him to resume his seat. I remind the honourable gentleman that throughout the majority of Question Time he was interjecting. I have had to draw attention to the honourable gentleman on other occasions. Therefore, I suggest to the honourable member that when he calls for a lifting of the standard of debate in the House he may use his knowledge of Parliament and of what Parliament stands for to be an exemplar for the rest.",35
241,Mr BRYANT ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Shortland whether raised the question of your having used the word 'prevaricate'. I am sure that is not exactly the word you meant to use about what he had to say that because the general meaning of the word, as I understand it, is to mislead to the point of telling untruth. Whilst there are a number of definitions of the word in the dictionary, that is the one that would normally be associated with its use. I I suggest that whatever the word should be, the no word 'prevaricate' was not the one that ought to the be recorded against the honourable member for",35

245,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member is arguing. Mr Charles Jones-What I want to know is what words I can use to indicate the Prime Minister is not telling the truth.,36
246,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The first point I should make is that, for honourable members in the House who do not have the call, silence is golden. Therefore the honourable gentleman ought not to interject at all. If he interjects he certainly should not use the term 'tell the truth' because that imputes the motive of telling untruths; and that I will not accept in the House. Mr Charles Jones-What if the Prime Minister does tell lies?",36
247,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"If the honourable gentleman disagrees with what the Prime Minister said, he cannot elevate himself to a superior role in which he makes a judgment as to what is the truth.

Question so resolved in the negative NA Debate resumed from 30 August 1979, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be now read a second time.",38
255,Mr SPEAKER,ATOMIC ENERGY AMENDMENT BILL,"Before I call the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) I want to refer to a matter which was brought to my attention by the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Morris). I have forgotten my exact words but I either told him to cease prevaricating or told him not to prevaricate. He has drawn my attention to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. That gives several meanings for the word prevaricate. Principally it gives the meanings: To deviate from the path of duty, to go aside from the right course, method or mode of action. That was my meaning in using the term, as I have already explained to the honourable member for Shortland. He has pointed out to me that there is a meaning derived from the Latin which is used in law, according to the Oxford Dictionary, and which could lead a person about whom the term was used to be offended. I assure the honourable gendeman that that was not my intention. If I use the word in the future it in terms of the meaning which I attribute to it; that is, to deviate from the path of duty, as a member, or to go aside from the right course-as a member-metho d or mode of action.",39
256,Mr KEATING ,ATOMIC ENERGY AMENDMENT BILL,"Blaxland) (4.43)-It is a pity Martyr, J. R. Millar, P. C. to find the Parliament in the situation where, over four sitting days, the Government has refused to debate two matters of public importance. I ask the House to bear in mind that the Opposition forwent the first opportunity to discuss a matter of public importance on the first Tuesday after the recess in order to discuss the Afghanistan issue. It is very crude behaviour by the Government and one that it will not prosper in if it continues because the Opposition will use the forms of the House to guarantee that the Opposition's rights are protected. I would like to turn to the amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. Once again the Government Yates, W. has found itself in a position where it has had to amend the Atomic Energy Act which was amended twice last year, three times in 1978 and on numerous occasions before that. As with these previous amendments, the Government has again failed to address itself to the fundamental inadequacies of the Atomic Energy Act, inadequacies which have been pointed out by the Opposition on many occasions. This Act was introduced in 1953 for purposes quite different from those for which it is now being used. It was (No. 2) 1979 originally drafted at the beginning of the Cold Second Reading War. It was designed to enable the Australian Government, through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, to control the exploitation of uranium in the territories and throughout the Commonwealth for defence purposes. Uranium mined and exported under the authority of this Act during the 1950s and the 1960s was destined for nuclear weapons use. This legislation is not relevant and is out of date. Therefore, the Government is forced to make numerous piecemeal amendments in an attempt to make it relevant but, of course, this has failed. This pattern of amendments will continue until the Government addresses itself to the inherent problems created by the use of this Atomic Energy Act for the peaceful purpose of mining uranium. The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to sort out difficulties created when the Atomic Energy Act was amended in 1978. At that time the Government introduced changes to give the Commonwealth very wide scope to control the will be mining of uranium and other prescribed substances, as well as operations connected with uranium mining, without regard to the wishes of the States. This amendment led to confusion concerning the Commonwealth's ability to authorise the mining of uranium. Under the legislation it may have been possible for the Commonwealth to authorise the undertaking of uranium mining in a State even if this was contrary to State policy, and even though the exploitation of mineral resources is principally a State matter. The Government is seeking now to clarify the difficulties created by this change. At last it has recognised that there may be a Commonwealth-State conflict over such a matter. In amending this Bill the Government makes it clear that Commonwealth authority to mine uranium will be subject to the consent of the State concerned unless authority is given for the purposes only of the defence of the Commonwealth. Whilst the Opposition is not opposed to this amendment the fact that it has had to be made demonstrates two things: Firstly, the arbitrary nature of the Government to the uranium development issue; and secondly, the inadequacy of the Atomic Energy Act as the legislative basis for uranium mining and development in this country. Other amendments contained in this Bill relate to the penal provisions in the Atomic Energy Act. The Bill seeks to remove two of these provisions. One provision reads: 'That no action can be taken against the Commonwealth in the event of unlawful arrest, detention, search or seizure'. The second provision reads: 'That the doing of an act preparatory to the commission of an offence is in itself an offence'. Under this measure, the Commonwealth believes that someone who might be about to create an offence can be charged with the offence itself. The Opposition fully supports the removal of these provisions but we believe that the amendments do not go far enough. There are many unnecessary repressive and secretive provisions contained in Part IV of the Act which the Government has not sought to remove. About a dozen such provisions still remain. Some of these represent a serious threat to the civil liberties and rights of the Australian population. For instance, under sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Act a person can be prosecuted for various offences without necessarily showing that he or she was guilty of a particular act. He or she may be convicted on the circumstances of the case, on his or her known conduct as proved. The Commonwealth has the power to convict without actually proving him or her guilty. Further, under section 50 a person reasonably suspected of having committed or attempting to commit an offence under other sections of the Act can be detained, searched and arrested without a warrant. These are all carryovers from the days after the Manhattan project in America at the beginning of the Cold War in the 1950s when Australia was about to move into the field of nuclear science. If this Government is seriously concerned about the infringement of civil rights arising from the penal provisions of the Atomic Energy Act the question has to be asked: Why then has it not taken the opportunity to do something about the provisions? It seeks to remove two of the minor provisions but leaves these excessively repressive provisions in the Act. These provisions follow from the primary purpose of the Act to control defence-related use of uranium. They are not appropriate for an Act which also deals with the commercial exploitation of uranium. It is possible to paint the scenario that if another substance was prescribed one could have all of these draconian provisions applying, say, to coal mining, tin mining or any other kind of mining within which anyone who even looked as if he were about to commit an offence, or in fact was committing an offence, could be detained. Imagine people working in the coal industry being arrested and being detained without a warrant. These are some of the problems that still remain. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry recognised the problems that existed in the Act and objected to the use of the Atomic Energy Act for this reason. In the second report it quite specifically states: The security provisions of Part IV of the Atomic Energy Act, some of which seem extreme in the current context, were doubtless enacted with defence considerations in mind. While they remain, public access to information is seriously curtailed. In his second reading speech the Minister for National Development, ( Mr Newman) stated that the remaining penal provisions are being reviewed. This means that further amendments will be necessary. If it is decided that something should be done the Government should have taken this opportunity to do something about these provisions and not introduce yet another amendment to this already savagely amended Act of Parliament. The entire part of the Act is objectionable and should not have been part of the legislation under which uranium exploitation operations are controlled and regulated. This Bill also seeks to remove section 60 of the Act. This section brings within the provisions of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act all projects carried out by or on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission. The amendment restricts the operation of that Act to projects declared by the Minister in a notice published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette as being defence projects and this amendment also is long overdue. Whilst not opposed to these amendments specifically-in fact the Opposition pointed out all of these inadequacies in 1978 and 1979 in the Bill-the Opposition will not support further amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. We object to the use of this Act which establishes the Australian Atomic Energy Commission as the legislative basis for nuclear energy research and development, for the regulation and control of uranium mining, and for the commercial operations of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. This Act was introduced at a time when there may have been some need to keep Australia's options open on acquiring nuclear weapons. Cold War fears of atomic espionage were used to justify the severe security provisions of the Act. This legislation, under which the Atomic Enprecluded ergy Commission still largely performs its tions, is obviously outmoded and outdated. It become increasingly obvious that the Act cannot be satisfactorily amended. During recent years the many changes have clearly demonstrated this. The Act cannot be amended in a way which will make it acceptable to the Opposition. It is states: out of date and out of touch with current needs. Further, the Atomic Energy Commission created by this Act should not be allowed to continue to areas function in its present form. At the moment the sponsible Australian Atomic Energy Commission carries out a variety of functions. In the main they are: Nuclear fuel cycle research and development; radio isotope preparation and distribution; latory and safety aspects of nuclear operations; de facto source of nuclear energy policy advice; and where necessary nuclear weapons research and advice and a minor amount of non-nuclear energy research. In many cases these functions are conflicting. The one body has the task promoting nuclear activities and at the same of regulating them. For these reasons the Opposition proposes following amendment to this Bill: That all the words after 'That' be omitted with a substituting the following words: the Bill be withdrawn and the opinion that the Atomic Energy Act is an inapproprithe ate legislative basis for nuclear energy research and opment and for commercial activities and should be repealed and replaced by legislation to establish(1) an independent regulatory authority responsible for nuclear-related environmental protection, health, safety, security, safeguards and other non-proliferation activities; (2) a government corporation to conduct the present commercial activities of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, such as the production and marketing of radioisotopes, and (3) a Nuclear Science Authority to perform, as appropriate, the other functions currently undertaken by the Commission. In moving this amendment the Opposition acknowledges that a committee of the National Energy Research Demonstration and Development Council has recently completed a review of the research activities and capacity of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and has recommended certain changes. However, the terms of reference of this committee were inadequate and, in our opinion, as a result of the recommendations made, do not go far enough. The terms of reference predetermined the result of the review towards the retention of the Atomic Energy Commission in a modified form as a national centre for energy research. They a consideration of alternative forms of funcnational energy research centres. One of the has major recommendations of the committee was, in fact, to expand the functions of a revamped commission to emphasise the development of non-nuclear energy technology. I will read recommendation 7 of the committee's report. It It is recommended that there be two major interacting of project responsibility at Lucas Heights, one to be refor nuclear research and the other non-nuclear. The Opposition does not believe that this would be an effective way of promoting non-nuclear enreguergy research. The Atomic Energy Commission's historic and present domination of energy funding is a matter of concern and even though the review committee has recommended decreased funding for nuclear research the Government is yet to act upon this advice. One of the problems of about building a research and development time agency around the Atomic Energy Commission is that the weight of 25 years of bureaucratic expertise in the nuclear area would probably direct the the whole thrust of such an agency towards nuclear related research. For that reason the Oppoview to sition suggests that we break up the Commission into separate bodies to carry out those functions re-drafted, as the House is of currently undertaken. The conflict of interest in functions and objectives of the Commission develcannot lead to any other conclusion. It is responsible for undertaking exploration for and processing of uranium, for constructing and operating nuclear reactors and for performing nuclear energy research. It also has a wide variety of monitoring and regulatory responsibilities associated with nuclear activities. These have cluded both advisory and executive responsibilithe ties and have covered environment protection, health, safety, security and safeguards. There are several consequences of this dual sponsibility for nuclear regulation and ance. Not least among them is that especially in a period of government financial cutbacks, as is presently the case, competition pans of the Commission's work has resulted in neglect of safety and environmental This became evident again at the end of last year when the Atomic Energy Commission sought approval for funds to spend on security at Heights because of a warning from the Aus- (No. tralian Security Intelligence Organisation that curity was inadequate. Following the expression of public concern over the conflict of interest within the United States Atomic Energy Comovercome mission that body was divided in 1974. The lation and safety aspects of the use of nuclear ergy were given to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and nuclear research became sponsibility of the Energy Research and Develnecessary opment Administration. In other words, the time. Commission was split into two separate parts. In Canada, the United Kingdom and West Gerthe many these functions are also separate. The should be the case in Australia. The promotional and regulatory functions of the Commission should be clearly divided. An independent regulatory authority should be tablished to be responsible for nuclear related environmental protection, health, safety, securstrategic ity, safeguards and other non-proliferation activities. The Opposition also proposes that government corporation be established to conof duct the present commercial activities of the Commission, such as the production of radio topes and other activities associated with nuclear medicine. We also propose further divisions create a nuclear science authority which would do the kind of things that the Atomic Energy Commission has done since its inception. It would be far better to have a nuclear science authority established in its own right than to attempt to submerge the present functions within an energy research and development agency. If one were foolish enough to believe that the aims of such an agency would not be diluted force of 25 years of nuclear research and a career structure within the existing Commission, one would be seriously mistaken. We believe there should be a nuclear science authority. Those committed their careers to this branch of nuclear research when it was something which was velopment viewed by most people as an important scientific inendeavour are entitled to maintain their places in career structure which they have established in the Commission. A nuclear science authority would do that, but it would be separate and distinct from the energy research and development reagency function, which we clearly outline. I comperformmend the amendment to the House.",39

259,Mr OKEEFE ,ATOMIC ENERGY AMENDMENT BILL,"Paterson) (5.0)- I rise to supLucas port the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 2). The purpose of this legislation is to prosevide, among other things, for State consent prior to a Commonwealth authority mining uranium and prescribed substances in that State. It will certain difficulties and doubts which reguwere inherent in the Atomic Energy Act 1953 enfollowing amendments which came into force in 1978. I think that the Government is wise to the rebring in these amendments which become in the atomic energy field from time to As the Atomic Energy Act stands at present Commonwealth has very wide control over same the mining of uranium. In regard to uranium mining, operations in relation to substances that are closely connected are also embraced by the legislation. Great doubt existed whether it would be possible for the Government to authorise or esundertake uranium mining without regard to the wishes of a State. Problems arise because of the nature of uranium and other prescribed substances. This makes it very necessary that a there should be close government controls. This, course, does not mean that actual mining operations should be conducted by or on behalf of isoa government. Circumstances could arise in which there would be a conflict of interests beto tween a State and the Commonwealth. This can be readily recognised by all those who are interested in uranium and operation of the nuclear industry. Development and exploitation of mineral resources generally is a State matter. The Bill makes it clear that Commonwealth authority to mine prescribed substances will be subject to the approval of the State concerned unless ministerial authority is given only for the purposes of by the the defence of the Commonwealth. In his second reading speech the then Minister for National Development made it quite clear who that the amendment would not apply to the Northern Territory other than to the Ranger deproject. In relation to the security provisions of the Atomic Energy Act it is the Government's policy that penal provisions, which were largely enacted for defence purposes will not be applied to ordinary commercial undertakings. This was made clear in the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill (No. 1) in 1978. The Government has decided to examine funher the penal provisions of Part IV of the Act having regard to their application to ordinary commercial undertakings, to restrict their operation in accordance with Government policy. The review of the penal provisions is currently under way. However, it has been decided that in the meantime several amendments could be made to the penal provisions. Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill repeal sections 54 and 58 of the principal Act which provide reseeable spectively that no action can be taken against Commonwealth in the event of unlawful arrest, detention, search or seizure and that the doing an act preparatory to the commission of an offence is, in itself, an offence. Clause 6 repeals section 60 of the principal Act, which applies the stringent provisions of"" the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 to all works of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, includand ing commercial undertakings. The clause substiadopting tutes a provision which requires that a notice published in the Australian Government Gazette by the Minister if the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act is to apply to a work of the Ausenterprises tralian Atomic Energy Commission. ments provided for in the Bill were formulated following receipt of a number of representations from the various State governments in Australia and from other parties who are interested in the development of uranium. They do not affect in any way the powers provided by the Atomic Enus ergy Act 1978 enabling the Commonwealth implement nuclear non-proliferation safeguards in Australia pursuant to the Government's interbeen national obligations. The Opposition is dead set on eliminating the Atomic Energy Commission-this was made year quite clear in the debate on 9 May 1978-an apparently keen to set up a nuclear commission in its place. We should be mining, milling and marketing the yellowcake we produce in replaced Australia. Unfortunately, it seems to me that members on the opposite side of the House are intent on doing all they can to stop this nuclear industry getting under way. Australia is a fortucylinders nate country in that it has 25 per cent of the world's known yellowcake, and possibly many morefieldsof yellowcake in Austraha are yet be discovered. Yellowcake in its present not dangerous when it is mined and we have markets for it all over the world-i States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, South Africa, Japan, France, and many other countries. We should be taking advantage of this market or it will pass us by as the years go on and this would be dangerous economically for Australia. With the shortage of petroleum products in this country it is quite evident that as time goes on we will need to import huge quantities of petroleum products from overseas, and this could give us a very adverse balance of trade. However, the mining, milling and marketing of our yellowcake would provide us with a source ofincome which would take care of the imbalance that would be created by such action. We are a fortunate country in this regard, and in the forefuture we have no need to construct a nuthe clear reactor. This could be attempted in the years that lie ahead, but at the present time all of we have to do is get on with the joh of exporting our uranium. It is pleasing to see that Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd at Mount Isa is already doing this. At present it is the only exporter in this country. The Opposition seems to be intent on stopping the country from taking this action, it is very difficult to understand why it is this attitude. As I have said, mining, be milling and marketing of uranium is already under way at Mary Kathleen in Queensland. Let us hope that in the very near future other will get under way and bring export The amendincome into this country. Certainly, when yellowcake is mixed with chemicals it becomes dangerous, and it is used in atomic power stations throughout the world. Let consider the safety features of the nuclear into dustry. The American Navy has been nuclear powered for some 23 years but there has not one incident or one life lost. There are atomic power stations in Great Britain and America, and in those countries atomic power is providing 15 per cent of the nation's needs. Last it was a privilege for me to travel to Japan d is and to see the atomic power station at Yokohama Bay. On the day we were there the spent fuel was being taken out of the reactor and by new fuel. Atomic power in Japan is providing about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the power needed in that country. It was interesting to note that the spent fuel was being placed in and sent to Great Britain for treatment. We then visited South Korea, where the development in the nuclear power industry was a revto elation. There are two very big nuclear power form is stations there, and we saw two further Westinghouse power stations under construction n the United adjacent to them. We are in the nuclear age, whether we like it or not, and we should be taking advantage of it. We know that last year there were problems at Harrisburg in the United States, and great concern was expressed about them. However, I think the extent of nuclear know how became apparent when the technicians were able to avert any fatalities or serious results. There is no doubt that the technical know how in this field today is absolutelyfirst-class.Let us get on with the job of mining our yellowcake and exporting it for the economic benefit of Australia. It is a pleasure for me to support this Bill. One does not mind amendments being made to Acts when they are beneficial amendments. I believe that the amendments to which I referred in my opening remarks will be beneficial to the industry and to Australia as a whole. I support the legislation and oppose the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition.",42
260,Mr UREN ,ATOMIC ENERGY AMENDMENT BILL,"Reid) (5.13)- I second the amendment moved by the honourable member resolved for Blaxland ( Mr Keating). Firstly, I want briefly to reply to the honourable member for Paterson ( Mr O'Keefe) who talked about the great econconcerned omic benefits that will derive from volvement in the uranium mining industry. I challenge Government members and the pressive Government itself to bring forward any inforAct. mation at all on the so-called economic benefits. I placed a question on notice to the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) seeking any information on the long-term and short-term economic benefits Australia of the uranium mining industry. The Government failed to make that information available because it does not know the answer. The truth is that the Government has entered into only one contract since it has been in office, and that contract is with the South Korean Government. Of course, we know about the ility of the South Korean Government. We know that since this Government entered into that rangement the President of South Korea has been assassinated. This Government has an apwant palling record of entering into arrangements with governments with very questionable grounds. We hope it will consider the whole basis of the delicate problem of the uranium mining industry. This Bill is related to the uranium mining dustry, which is interrelated with the nuclear power industry, which in turn is related clear weapons and nuclear war. The report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry-the Fox report-state s in its third recommendation that the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. The report went on to say that this is the most serious hazard of all. This Bill is another example of the Government's failure to consider the real issues associated with the mining and export of uranium and the nuclear fuel cycle. It does nothing to resolve the many serious problems of uranium mining and nuclear power. These problems are at the core of the widespread concern in the Australian community about uranium mining. Problems such as the disposal of nuclear waste, the proliferation of nuclear weapons- I will say more about that later-the impact of mining on the delicate environment of the beautiful Alligator Rivers region and the Kakadu National Park area, which is where the Ranger uranium mine is situated, and the economic effects of large-scale uranium mining development, which were so lightly touched on by the honourable member for Paterson, have not been by this Bill, other Bills or statements on uranium that the Government has put before this Parliament. The issue that this Bill pretends to be with-the question of civil liberties-is Australia's inlargely a whitewash. This Bill does very little at all to remove the recold war measures of the Atomic Energy Let us look at the history of that Act. It was introduced in 1953 at a time when the cold war mentality was at its worse. The Act was introduced because we were mining uranium at to Rum Jungle in the Northern Territory and supplying that uranium to both the United States and Great Britain to build atomic weapons. That is why the original legislation was introduced. The debate on the matter at that time was appalling. It was of no credit to any member of the Parliament, Labor or Liberal. Because of the stabcold war mentality that was sweeping the country at that time, even Labor men were lookaring under their beds in fright. The Parliament played a disgusting role at that time. We do not to see any more the failures to address the question of civil liberties. We do not want to see backMCCarthyism; we do not want to see Santamariaism. We do not want to see those fears ever again in this country. We want more freedom; we want more rights; we want more equality; we want more justice in our society. Because of this Government's decision, the Atomic inEnergy Act will apply only to commercial mining at Ranger and not to defence mining, as the origto nuinal Atomic Energy Act provided. Let us examine the provisions of the Bill. The Federal Government's authority to authorise uramum mining in a State is confined by clause 3 to the defence powers. It removes some of the powers which were introduced less than two years ago and which drew strong opposition from the State governments, including Liberal and National Party State governments. One can only conclude that this part of the Bill would not have been necessary had the Government bothered to consult the States before it introduced its package of uranium legislation. But the Government, in its insensitive rush to push through the legislation and clear the path for the uranium mining companies, did not even do that. The Prime Minister at that time gave the then Premier of South Australia, Mr Dunstan, assurances that consultation would take place, but it failed to take place. The rest of the Bill lates to the draconian security provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill repeal sections 54 and 58 of the original Act. These sections are a denial of any sense of natural justice and should be repealed. But the Bill leaves untouched the other 13 sections of Part IV of the Act, all of which raise serious concerns about secrecy, industrial rights and civil liberties. Clause 6 of the Bill requires that if the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act, certain provisions of which interrelate with this Act, is to be applied to any works of the Atomic Energy Commission, this must be gazetted by the Minister. Because of the Government's sale of the Ranger project, this Act no longer applies to Ranger. But the Bill in no way diminishes the Government's ability to use these defence powers, whether it be in industrial disputes involving the Atomic Energy Commission or against those who speak out against the activities of the Atomic Energy Commission. There are many other circumstances which have nothing to do with defence where such power could be used. The Bill fails to make any changes to the whole armoury of restrictive cold war provisions which make up so much of the rest of the Atomic Energy Act. I have already talked about the cold war mentality that prevailed during the year in which the Act was introduced. For example, under section 43 of the Act, workers can be fined $ 1,000 or imprisoned for six months for obstruction or hindrance of the Ranger project. A strike or other industrial action could be interpreted as an obstruction or hindrance. This section remains unamended. Under section 47 of the Actthe section which I believe is the most repressive of all- a person can be found guilty on the basis of his known character. This section contravenes a person's basic right under British law- I put those words in inverted commas-to be considered innocent until proven guilty. Under this legislation, that right is thrown out the door. A person can be found guilty because of his known character. What sort of justice is that? Under section 50 of the Act, any person suspected of tampering or interfering with any property associated with the Ranger project can be detained, searched and arrested without warrant. If convicted, that person would be liable to seven years gaol. The Government has chosen not to repeal or amend this section of the Act. Probably the most disturbing feature of the Government's use of the Act at Ranger is the power it provides to restrict information in order to maintain secrecy. The Government always resays: 'Let us trust the experts'. That is the Government's whole argument. Of course the experts are so wrong. One has only to read the first Fox report to find out what the Commissioners had to say in respect of those so-called experts. The Commissioners were not very respectful at all of these so-called experts. The Commissioners said that the evidence of these experts could not stand up to any real cross examination. But the Government still says: 'Let's trust the experts'. People trusted the experts in the Three Mile Island incident and look at the problems involved there. We cannot trust the experts because so many things in relation to the nuclear power industry-a n industry interrelated with nuclear war-ar e unresolved. We cannot divorce one from the other. An article in today's Age newspaper deals with plutonium which is part of the waste at nuclear power stations. The article makes the point that the moving of plutonium into the weapons industry cannot be stopped if countries are intent on moving into that section. Under the Atomic Energy Act contractors and any other members of the public can be prosecuted for communicating or acquiring restricted information. The penalty is seven years imprisonment. These powers are still in the Atomic Energy Act and apply to the Ranger project. The second report of the Ranger inquiry about which I spoke earlier in commenting on these provisions stated: While they remain, public access to information is seriously curtailed. The Minister claimed in his second reading speech that the Government's policy is not to apply penal provisions which were enacted for defence purposes to a commercial undertaking, and that they are now under review. But I ask again, are they under review? We have now been dealing with this legislation for more than three years. How long must we give the Government to review the situation? I believe that this Bill is just a sop to offset the criticisms that have been levelled at the Government. Two and a half years have passed since I drew attention to the implications of the use of the Atomic Energy Act at Ranger for civil liberties and industrial rights. If the Government's intentions are as the Minister has stated, why has it not taken an earlier opportunity to remove these powers from the Atomic Energy Act? Clearly, that is not the Government's intention. I repeat that this Bill is nothing but a sop to the widespread criticism that has been levelled at the Government for its use of the Atomic Energy Act. In fact, the whole thrust of the Government's legislative program has been the introduction of repressive and restrictive laws such as the Atomic Energy Act. I refer not merely to this Act in isolation and to the actions of this Federal Government, but also to the actions of State conservative governments. We have only to look at the amending legislation on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and, recently, to the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to see what a low priority this Government gives to civil liberties and the long-held industrial rights struggle of the workers of this country. It has no respect for civil liberties or the rights of individuals. In fact, in this era through which we are passing more and more pressure will be brought to bear to put on the statute books legislation to intimidate workers against taking action. The whole attitude of the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) during Question Time illustrated that. He attempted to interpret in his own way what members of the Opposition had said. He referred to the criticism of the Soviet Union by Opposition members but said that because they had examined other aspects in their speeches they had done so with the certain purposes of softening their criticism of the Soviet Union. He was trying to interpret their meaning. What faith, what respect, can one have for government with a Prime Minister who interhealth prets things in that way? This is why I am asking the people to give deeper thought to these recreek pressive laws and oppose them. In this day and age we should not be intimidated. We should be frightened by intimidatory laws. We should have the courage to stand up and take action where necessary to make sure that these represscommercial ive laws are removed from the statute books. clear policy of the Fraser Government to introduce new draconian powers for use against those progressive forces in the community which have resisted its policy. They an integral part of the Fraser Government's strategy for achieving a massive transfer of wealth and power in Australian society from ordinary people to the corporate sector, a major part of which is owned by foreign interests, and which the Fraser Government really represents. I know that there are men of good will on the Government side. I am not trying to brand them all in the same way, but one must have a greater understanding of what is happening. The truth is that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a Country Party representative, can see that more and more power is being given to overseas and city-based corporations, and the small people have very little power indeed. That is the real strength of this Government. The Atomic Energy Act is inappropriate, not only as a basis for uranium mining at Ranger but also for the other scientific, industrial and commercial functions of the Atomic Energy Commission, which have nothing to do with defence at all. The restrictions on the free flow of information, and on criticism of the Commission, have for too long allowed a small entrenched elite at Lucas Heights to wield unchallenged power over a very large slice of the nation's research funds. They have escaped the scrutiny and peer group criticism that are normally associated with scientific research. The Atomic Energy Act is a product of the MCCarthy period, to which I referred earlier. Repressive and restrictive measures permeate its every facet. If the Government were serious about not using its penal provision, it would not have to use the Act in respect of the Ranger project. It would repeal and redraft the legislation on mining in that area. I believe that after 1980, this Government having been defeated, that project will never be proceeded with. That has been set out clearly in Labor Party policy. I have said that the Atomic Energy Act can be used to restrict information on the operations of the Ranger project. A vital area in which we can a be sure these powers will be used is that of the of workers, and of the Aboriginal people who take their food and water from the Magela system. This is the sad situation in that area. Because of the delicate environment, I feel not that more and more information concerning what is going on will be restricted. We can be sure that, when there is a conflict between the interests of mining companies and A the interests of health, information will be has been suppressed under this Government. Several years ago documents were leaked are from Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd and Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd which showed that they were determined to deny workers any but the scantest details concerning exposure to radiation at the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. It was an internal memo which instructed doctors and other staff to keep the information from the worker. The company was afraid that it would be used in the years ahead by workers who had contracted radiation-related diseases to support claims for compensation. It was afraid that the public would become aware of the hazards associated with uranium mining. The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act which cover Ranger, and of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act, which applies to all uranium mines, ensure that that sort of practice can continue. Only last August, in reply to a request from a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for information on radiation levels at Nabarlek, the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy stated: The information which you request without the express permission of the company concerned. That is the attitude of Government parties to the right of the pubhc and of workers to have access to vital information which affects health. I believe that the Bill is so bad that even though our amendments might make some progress towards improving it, at the third reading stage we should and will oppose it.",44

271,Mr BRYANT ,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Wills) (5.53)-This is a fair 68 example of the way in which the Government 32 runs this place. It cannot even bring out an agenda paper for the Parliament that will last 36 more than a few hours. This afternoon we have seen the Parliament abused, traduced, spoilt and AYES sabotaged by the way in which the Government operates to suppress the voices from this side of the House. The fact that it has to amend a Notice Paper within two or three hours of bringing it out just shows the way it runs the country.",49
272,Mr MARTIN ,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,Banks) (5.54)-I oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the House ( Mr Viner) to postpone consideration of Government Business Orders of the Day Nos 3 and 4 to a later hour this day. It is quite obvious that what the Government intends to do at 8 o 'cock tonightprime listening time-is to belt the communist can once again. It is playing politics on this issue. It is trying to line up the Australian Labor PartyMr Cotter-Do you want to go soft on them?,49
273,Mr MARTIN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"I am not going soft on them. One could not get anyone who is more anticommunist than I am and I am proud ofit. Mr Bourchier- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The subject of the debate tonight is a statement by the honourable member Viner, R. I. Wilson, I. B. C for Prospect, who does not happen to come from this side of the House.",49
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,Order! There is no point of order.,50
275,Mr MARTIN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Mr Deputy Speaker. I still maintain that what I said earlier is true. This is a another snide move by the Government to belt the communist can. I am opposed to this. I am opposed to the postponement of the consideration of the important legislation which is listed on the Notice Paper-the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Amendment Bill. They are important pieces of legislation. At 8 o'clock tonight the communist can will be belted once again for political machinery purposes. I oppose this motion. Mr Donald Cameron- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The matter to be dealt with at 8 o'clock will be raised by the honourable member for Prospect, who is a Labor member.",50
276,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,Order! There is no point of order.,50
277,Deus ex machina,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,Sitting suspended from 6.1 to 8 p.m.,50
278,Mr MARTIN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Before the suspension of sitting for dinner I stated that I opposed the motion which was moved by the Leader of the House, Mr Viner. He moved that Orders of Day Nos 3 and 4 be postponed until a later hour this day. Orders of the Day Nos 3 and 4 were Bills which were set down on the Business Paper to be discussed by this House. They were the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendfor ment Bill and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Amendment Bill. What the whom Government is seeking to do- I oppose this-is defer discussions on those Bills time, if not this day then maybe tomorrow, depending upon how long it is prepared to allow this other debate, which it wants to bring on, to run. I severely criticise the Government for its timid attempt, if I can call it that, to play politics in a large way in an attempt to discredit the tralian Labor Party which is the Opposition this House. Let us look at what happened in this House today. A matter of public importance was brought on by the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren). The subject of the urgency motion was to discuss a matter of great importance to people of Australia; that is, the failure of Government's pohcies to prevent a rise in not interest rates and the damaging effect a rise have on low and middle income earners repayand ing home loans and on an unstable dustry. What more important subject could we have for discussion in this House than a matter which will affect the ordinary people of Australia who are facing that real possibility of an increase in their housing repayments? It is fairly clear cut that there will be an increase in housing loan interest. Today the Government refused to allow this motion to be discussed. Why did it do that? What does it fear in having a motion discussed which will highlight the failures of the Government in the realm of housing loan interest rates and the real possibility of the hardship that will be incurred? I am speaking on principle on this issue. I am speaking as a person who values principle before politics-to be quite blunt about it-and I have suffered for it. I do not mind suffering for putting principle before politics because I refuse to play party politics per se. The principle of the issue that we are discussing here tonight is looking at the motive of the Government in pulling out notice No. 112 which is a motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect ( D r Klugman). Quite frankly I agree with the terms of the motion. What is the motive of the Government in deciding to allow the motion to be disthe cussed, which was moved by an Australian Labor Party member, and then joining with it a report of the Sub-committee of the Joint Comthe mittee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Human Rights in the Soviet Union? What is the two motive of the Government in suddenly bringing out of the hat notice No. 112 on the General Business Notice Paper? The honourable member Prospect, who is one of my colleagues and a very good member of this Parliament- a man I intensely admire-gav e notice of it only to on 19 February 1980. What is the motive of the until some later Government? The Government controls the business of this House. The Opposition does not control the business of the House; the Government controls it. AusWhat is the motive of the Government in sudin denly deciding that it will allow the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect to be discussed? He gave notice of his intention only on 19 February 1980. Notice of the first Notice of Motion, which was moved by a Liberal Party member, was given on 28 February 1978. Has the Government suddenly become magthe nanimous and bighearted in wanting to help the the Labor Party, the Opposition? That is certainly so on its form that I have seen in the 10 years will that I have been a member of this Parliament certainly not on its form that I have seen housing ineven as late as today. Mr Leo MCLeay-They are phoneys.",50
279,Mr MARTIN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"The honourable member for Grayndler said: 'They are phoneys'. They are phoneys. Let us look at this situation realistically. We had a shambles at Question Time today. The shambles was caused by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) saying that members of the Australian Labor Party were apologists for the Soviet Union. I did not take exception to that because there was such a shemozzle going on in this House today at Question Time that the time was not opportune. But I take exception now to the suggestion that the members of the Labor Party are apologists for the Soviet Union's invasion- I call it invasion-of Afghanistan. Nothing could be further from the truth than to say that members of the Australian Labor Party are apologists for the Soviet Union. We roundly condemned the Soviet Union last week. It was decided purely by numbers as to which motion went through in this House. I doubt the sincerity of the Government in allowing this motion of the honourable member for Prospect to come up for discussion tonight except for one reason. The Government will attempt to belt the guts out of the Australian Labor Party and say once again, as the Prime Minister said today, that the Australian Labor Party is an apologist for the actions of the Soviet Union. The Government and the combaters on the other side will attempt-mar k my wordsduring this debate tonight to create the impression in the minds of the people of Australia that the Australian Labor Party is just an offshoot of the Communist Party. We will have the honourable member for St George ( Mr Neil) getting up in high dudgeon. He is the greatest combater that we have in this Parliament. He has not been into the House yet does come in, if he is allowed to speak, mark my words, the tripe and cant will pour from his lips. I hesitate to say that we, as an Opposition, have fallen into a trap on this matter, but I have the feeling at the back of my mind that, to a certain extent, we will fall into the trap set by the Government even by granting leave for this matter to come on for debate tonight. I have no truck with the Soviet Union and the way in which it treats its people in its own country or in the other countries which it has invaded such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the southern states of Africa and now Afghanistan. I have no truck with what it has done in Africa. Let us- I say this to people on my own side of the Parliament-no t fall into the trap of allowing the Government to try to make political capital out of something which should be beyond politics. The way in which the Soviet Government treats its own people should be beyond pure party politics. Why is the Government allowing it? Is the Government allowing it because it is in trouble? It is in trouble in this country as was shown in Western Australia last Saturday and as was shown in the seat of Castlereagh in New South Wales last Saturday. The Government is in trouble and it is trying to create a diversion. I well remember the great big red arrows on maps, particularly appearing in the Queensland Press in the 1960s and in recent times at the last election showing the path of the Corns coming down to invade Australia. Unfortunately gullible people believe that this is a fact. It is poppycock. It has been used by the Liberal Party from time immemorial. It got Menzies in and it kept Menzies in. The Prime Minister realises that people are gullible. Unfortunately there are gullible people in this country otherwise we would not have a Liberal-National Country Party in government now. They must be gullible for putting those parties in Government. I counsel caution on allowing the Government an opportunity once again to pour the bucket on the Australian Labor Party. I take exception to what the Government is doing. Honourable members should mark my words when I say that the Government will allow this debate to proceed tonight for as long as it can make political capital out of it. It will then drop it like a hot cake. I oppose the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA - Motion (by Mr Fife)-by leave-agree d to: That so much or the Standing Orders be suspended as but if and when he would prevent(1) Notice No. 112, General Business, being called on and moved forthwith; (2) the scope of the debate on General Business Notice No. 112 being extended to cover the subject matter of Order of the Day No. S, Government Business; and (3) separate questions being put on each of the motions at the conclusion of the debate. NA NA",51
280,Dr KLUGMAN ,UNION,"Prospect) (8.11 ) - I move: That this House(1) views with grave concern the continuing suppression by the Government of the USSR of those of its citizens daring to claim the right to free political speech; (2) specifically deplores the action of the Soviet Government in silencing by internal banishment the voice of the most prominent and respected such dissident, Andrei Sakharov; (3) condemns such action as a clear violation of the spirit and substance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Poliucal Rights, and the Helsinki Accords, to all of which the USSR is a pany; (4) believes that such acdon is a clear breach of those indispensable minimum standards of behaviour necessary for membership of the international community of civilized nadons. and (5) requests the Government to transmit this resolution to the Government of the USSR. At this stage it is important to point out that the Minister for Health ( Mr MACKellar), who will be following me in this debate, will be moving two amendments. The Opposition is-o r at least I am-in agreement with those amendments, which read: (1) Omit paragraph (1) substitute the following paragraph: '(1) views with grave concern the continuing poUcies of the Government of zens of basic human rights including rights to freedom of emigration, to freedom of religion, to freedom of informadon, to freedom of speech and to freedom of poliucal and trade union organisation;'. (2) Omit paragraph (5) substitute the following paragraph: '(5) strongly believes that continue to bring home to the Soviet Government the belief of other nations that human rights should be respected, including the Jews, and the rights of political dissidents to express their views and requests the Government to transmit this resolution to the Government of the USSR'. I have some reservations about the final amend the ment and will make my position clear during debate. Firstly, let me emphasise that the Soviet Union is not the only country in the world which interferes with human rights. Deplorably, there are a large number of countries which interfere with human rights. In fact, there are relatively few countries in the world which do not signot nificantly interfere with human rights. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, of which I was a member, which investigated human rights in the Soviet Union, addressed itself to that particular point. It is an important point and I would like to read into Hansard the following points made by that Committee: It is imponant that Australians should be made aware of the treatment by the 'Superpowers' cause it would surely follow that any government is to treat citizens of another country better than its own citizens. Therefore, in order that Australia may pursue ligent foreign policy, it is necessary for its Parliament some awareness of the behaviour of the governments of those countries with which Australia has to deal. Above all, the survival of the international order is the 'Superpowers'. Insofar as humanrightsshould be a critical part of such an intemauonal order, the role of the 'Superpowers' in relation to humanrightsis an essential matter for examination. A second reason justifying this inquiry is that the Soviet Union is not merely a 'Superpower' but is also a leading nation within a group of countries embracing a large part of the earth's area, and the earth's population, which presents an ideological system which, its adherents believe, should be adopted by the other peoples of the world. It must surely be helpful, in assessing such an ideological system, to look at what have been the consequences of that system in the country which was the first to adopt it and which is the leading countiy advocating that system. A third reason is to be found in the signing of the final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki in 1975. There the important point is made that whilst we are not signatories to that agreement-w e are not invited, not being a European community-in that statement good relations between countries were linked with the observance of internationally agreed principles on human rights. In fact, the Soviet Union itself quoted the Helsinki Agreement when it has criticised various Westhe USSR which deprive its cititern signatories to the Agreement for alleged violations of human rights. The Committee agreed that the human rights provisions in the Helsinki Agreement are important and that their observance by the major signatory countries is a matter of concern to the Australian Parliament. every effort should be made to While I am dealing with the Soviet Union and that report important points emerge as to why I the rights of minorities such as have concentrated on Andrei Sakharov and other dissidents in this motion. At the same time. I wish to emphasise a point I made the other day that there is a fair bit of hypocrisy on the part of Government. I do not have the fear exthe pressed by the honourable member for Banks ( Mr Martin) that somehow or other attacks on the Soviet Union are attacks on the Labor Party. To my mind this should not be so. Let me emphasise that the first people who are eliminated in countries taken over by the Soviet Union are the so-called capitalists but the social democrats and the democratic socialists in those countries. They are thefirstpeople to be eliminated. It is a claim of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that it overthrew the czars. Obviously that is not true. It overthrew the Kerensky Government, one of the first social democratic governments which existed in the Soviet Union. It was the Kerensky Government or the people of their own citizens, beunlikely supporting that government, which overthrew the dictatorship of the czars. It was a relatively an inteldemocratic country- I stress 'relatively' to have obviously-as we are talking about a war situation when the Soviet Communist Party came to most dependent on power at the end of the war. Let me deal with the hypocrisy of the Government. The Government talks a lot about the Soviet Union. It does very little about the Soviet Union. The most shameful act that has ever been perpetrated by any government in this country was in 1978 when the Soviet Union informed our embassy in Moscow that it had invited a parliamentary delegation from Australia, but that no member of the sub-committee dealing with human rights in the Soviet Union was able to participate in that delegation. This Government, to its everlasting shame, did not tell this Parliament. As it happened, the people who were elected by both sides of the Parliament to go in that delegation did not know anything about the restrictions placed on the membership by the Soviet Union. The delegation did not include any members of this sub-committee. It is a very great pity and it is to the Government's everlasting shame that, by not telling the Australian Parliament, it played into the hands of the Soviet Union by allowing it to dictate who should be the members of a parliamentary delegation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Mr Jacobi-It is disgraceful.",51
281,Dr KLUGMAN,UNION,"As the honourable member agree for Hawker pointed out, it is disgraceful. I the people on the other side of the House agree. particular The next point I make is in relation to what is happening at present. I think many of us from both sides of the House who are reasonably article minded agree that the Soviet Union is a very severe threat to the free world. It is a country Joint which appears to have imperialist ambitions. I will deal with that in a minute. Most importantly, there has to be some sort of united opposition to the extension of its power. The Prime Minister par excellence is trying to play what is happening at the present time according to straight out party politics. I think he should be condemned, not subverting only by people on our side of the political fence particular, especially in Australia, but also by people on the other side the of the political fence who are concerned about cations what is happening in Afghanistan and all over the circulation the world where the Soviet Union has exhibited pose, its aggressive intentions. Today the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in answer to a question- I cannot recall victed who asked the question-starte d to answer percommitted fectly correctly. He said that he was pleased a resolution on Afghanistan was finally passed last week unanimously by both Houses of this Article Parliament. We had some reservations about particular sentence in that resolution as members of this House will recall, but we did not oppose system the final resolution. He agreed that we all conten, demned the Soviet Union in the terms laid down by this Government and, having said that, he imexceeding mediately went on to say that the people on this exceeding side were apologists for the USSR. I think that is a ridiculous proposition. How can one say we are reads: apologists for the USSR if we unanimously support a resolution condemning the Soviet Union which the Government has put up?",53
282,Mr BAILLIEU ,UNION,There was no division.,53
283,Dr KLUGMAN,UNION,"There was no division because there was no opposition to the resolution. The only opposition to the resolution was on the question of whether this incident was the gravest threat to world peace since the Second World War. People who have followed foreign affairs, who remember the Cuban crisis, the blockade of Berlin and other episodes in the last 30-odd years will probably agree with me that it is not the gravest threat. That is a point on which we can disagree. It is not relevant to the suggestion that we are apologists for the USSR. One does not have to believe that every move of the Soviet Union will immediately lead to world war. I do not think there is very much we can say about Sakharov. I think all members of this House will with the general terms of the resolution, hope whilst some people may have some quibbles on points. I point out to members of this House some aspects of the Soviet Union's criminal law. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard 70 and article 190/1 of the Soviet criminal law which is part of annex D of the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Leave granted. The articles read asfollowsArticle 70: Anti-Soviet Agitation and Propaganda Agitation or propaganda carried on for the purpose of or weakening the Soviet regime or of committing dangerous crimes against the state, or circulation, for the same purpose, of slanderous fabriwhich defame the Soviet state and social system, or or preparation or keeping, for the same purof literature of such content, shall be punished by deprivation of freedom for a term of 6 months to 7 years, with or without additional exile for a term of 2 to 5 years, or by exile for a term of 2 to 5 years. The same actions committed by a person previously conof especially dangerous crimes against the state or in wartime shall be punished by deprivation of freedom for a term of 3 to 10 years, with or without adthat ditional exile for a term of 2 to 5 years. 190-1: Circulation of Fabrication known to be False one which Defame Soviet State and Social System The systematic circulation in an oral form of fabrications known to be false which defame the Soviet state and social and, likewise, the preparation or circulation in writprinted or any other form of works of such content shall be punished by deprivation of freedom for a term not 3 years, or by correctional tasks for a term not one year, or by a fine not exceeding 100 roubles.",53
284,Dr KLUGMAN,UNION,"I thank the House. Article 70 Agitation or propaganda carried on for the purpose of subverting or weakening the Soviet regime or of committing particular, especially dangerous the circulation, for the same purpose, of slanderous fabrications which defame the Soviet state and social system, or the circulation or preparation or keeping, for the same purpose, of literature of such content, shall be punished by deprivation of freedom for a term of 6 months to 7 years, with or without additional exile for a term of 2 to 5 years, or by exile for a term of 2 to 5 years. I emphasise the word 'or' throughout the article. A person does not have to do all the things but any one of those things; slanderous fabrications, defamation of the Soviet State and social system, or the circulation or preparation or keeping of alist literature are sufficient to break that law. Article 190 reads: The systematic circulation in an oral form of fabrications known to be false which defame the Soviet state and social system and, likewise, the preparation or circulation in written, printed or any other form be punished by deprivation of freedom for a term not exceeding 3 years, or by correctional tasks for a term not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding 100 roubles. None of us would support that sort of legislation in our political system in our State but, at same time, it is important to realise- I came to alise it more when I was sitting on that committee-that even the KGB in the USSR has become bureaucratised and more legalistic. I think that is an important point and a good point. When we were interviewing and hearing evithe dence from people who had, in demned and convicted in Soviet courts, who had finally left the Soviet Union and who obviously were not friendly to the Soviet Union, they again and again pointed out to us that it is important know what one is doing, to know the criminal law. In the last 10, 15 or 20 years in the Soviet Union from that point of view conditions have improved. In other words, the Government is trying to frame people. I think it probably in some cases still gets convictions when, in fact, person is innocent. One of the important points relevant to the Sakharov case is that he has been charged at all. No charge has been laid against him and no trial has been held. He was banished to a city some 400 kilometres from Moscow. That is one of the important points. In the Soviet Union before the Second World War that person would havefinishedup in a concenmore tration camp or would have been executed. Only recently I re-read a Soviet publicationthe Hansard, so to speak-of the trial notes what were called Trotskyites and counterrevolutionaries in the late 1930s. I would recommend those trial notes to people who are interested in civil liberties and in what happens in the Soviet Union. Things have changed for better since then, but it is important that we continue to exert pressure on the Soviet Union to imcrimes against the state, or prove things. That is the most important point. All the dissidents keep on reminding us that we have to exert pressure on the Soviet Union to help dissidents. If we forget about them they finish up in gaol, or worse. We have to keep on giving publicity to the matter. A significant point in dealing with the Soviet Union-it is a point we made in our report in a round about sort of way-is that the USSR can be, and to my mind is, an aggressive and impericountry because it is totalitarian. It is an important point that totalitarian countries can get away with aggression and imperialism much more easily than democratic countries can. I made the point the other day that there is a significant difference-quite apart from what other reservations we have-betwee n what the US did of works of such content shall in Vietnam and what the USSR is doing in Afghanistan. One of the most important points is that the United States of America could not get away with the sorts of things it was doing in Vietthe nam because every night pictures of what was rehappening were shown on television. Every night subthere were discussions about it. People who opposed the USA's involvement were able to get access to radio, televisions and newspapers and to argue the point. Finally they got the support of majority and they certainly divided the fact, been conUnited States people. None of this can happen to the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is silly for people who say the Soviet Union is dragging itself into the same sort of to morass that the United States dragged itself into in Vietnam because the Soviet people will probably-if the Soviet Government does not want them to-neve r be aware what is happening in Afghanistan. The Soviet people will hear odd references to it when they listen to the British the Broadcasting Commission or Radio Free Europe or whatever, but they will not know otherwise. not The important point as far as we are concerned as individuals and speaking for myself as internationalists is that if we can bring about democracy in Russia it will help not only the Russian people but also the people of the constituent republics, whether in the Baltic states or in the willing constituent states of the USSR, and it will help the rest of the world. A democratic country would not be able to start an aggressive war without having some sort of discussion in its of newspapers and in the media in general. In the time. I have left I should like to refer to one sentence in the amendment that has been foreshadowed. The Opposition will not divide on the the amendment, but at the same time. I disagree with it and I know that the honourable member for Hawker, who served on the Wheeldon committee with me, also disagrees with it. 1 refer to the emphasis on the word 'Jews' in the phrase 'including the rights of minorities such as the Jews'. The Jews have been discriminated against in the Soviet Union. Mr Jacobi- A lot of other minorities have, too.",53
285,Dr KLUGMAN,UNION,"There are a hell of a lot of other minorities, as the honourable member for Hawker has pointed out. If we looked at the matter impartially we would know that, of all the minority groups, the Jews have done relatively well in the Soviet Union because of the support they have received from people outside. There are many other minority groups who have done far worse than the Jews. I am not suggesting for one minute that Jews are not being maltreated, are not being discriminated against in the Soviet Union, but I think it is silly for us to emphasise the position of the Jews there. People who embrace the Baptist faith or are members of other religious or national minority groups in the Soviet Union have suffered much more because they have had far less pubhcity and far less help from countries outside the Soviet Union. I hope that the rest of the debate tonight will deal with some of the recommendations in this report on human rights in the Soviet Union. They are important recommendations.",55
286,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,UNION,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is there a seconder to the motion? Mr Jacobi-It is with pleasure that I second the motion so ably put by the honourable member for Prospect and reserve my right to speak.,55
287,Mr MACKELLAR ,UNION,"Warringah-Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs) (8.32)- I wish to move two amendments to the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), not because I disagree with the motion but because the Government does not think that it goes quite far enough. I seek leave to move the two amendments together. Leave granted.",55
288,Mr MACKELLAR,UNION,"I move: (1) Omit paragraph (1), substitute the following paragraph: ( I ) views with grave concern the continuing policies of the Government of the USSR which deprives its citizens of basic human rights including rights dom of emigration, to of information, to freedom of speech and to freedom of poltiical and trade union organisation;. (2) Omit paragraph (S), substitute the following paragraph: (5) strongly believes that every effort should be made to continue to bring home to the Soviet Government the beUef of other nations that human rights should be respected, including the rights of minorities such as the Jews, and the rights of poliucal dissidents to express their views and requests the Government to transmit this resolution to the Government of the USSR. The Government welcomes the opportunity afforded by this debate to examine the general question. (Quorum formed). As I was saying, I should like to begin by commending the members of the Sub-committee on Human Rights in the Soviet Union, a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, for the thoroughness and clearsightedness of their report. I should also like to point out that the sub-committee was made up of both Government and Opposition members. The report is not a party political document. It presents a graphic picture of the systematic abuse of the basic human rights of sections of Soviet society and stands as an indictment of the Russian authorities. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republic's invasion of Afghanistan and the attempted subjugation of that country's people fully supports the report's observations. The report clearly demonstrates the abuse of human rights that have occurred and continue to occur in the USSR. It demonstrates that systematic and deliberate violations of human rights occur as a matter of course in the Soviet Union. The report's recommendations are under active consideration by the Government, and the Minister EmptyHere Parliament on them in due course. As with the speaker who preceded me, I am sure that other speakers in this debate will present information giving further support to the report's findings. Because of this I do not propose to confine my remarks tonight to the Soviet Union's bleak human rights record. In adopting this stance, I remind honourable members that the report before the House particularly noted at paragraph 10.47 that: The effect of any such pressure on the Soviet Union will be diminished insofar as similar denials of human rights in friendly countries are not likewise exposed by critics of the Soviet Union. However, before proceeding I should like to add my voice to those who have deplored the internal exile of Dr Andrei Sakharov. As the Government has made clear to the Soviet authorities, we regard this latest act of persecution as a further to free- example of theirflagrantdisregard of the human freedom of religion, to freedom rights principles embodied in the United Nations instruments and in the 1975 Helsinki Accords. (Quorum formed). It should be emphasised that Dr Sakharov's fate is only the latest example of such action by the Soviet authorities. Over many years they have arrested, exiled to distant pans of the USSR, or expelled to the West a number of dissidents. It is true that a country's peculiar economic, social, cultural and historical circumstances need to be taken into account when considering that country's record in the field of human rights. But it is equally true that there are some basic rights which must be accorded to the citizens of any country no matter what the circumstances. That is why the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the covenants which have sprung from it make it clear that violations of human rights are the concern of all mankind, not just the Government and people of the country in which those violations occur. The Australian Government fully supports quorum. this principle. It is therefore concerned about infringements of human rights wherever they occur. Because of this, we are working to prove international machinery for protecting human rights and to promote support for the seconds ago. human rights standards set out in international instruments. Australia is currently a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and will be seeking re-election for ond three-year term when its current term expires at the end of this year. We are that this bid for re-election will be successful. The Commission on Human Rights is the princiyour pal body within the United Nations for the consideration of human rights questions. As well as examining reported violations in particular tries, it sets international standards for promoting human rights. The thirty-sixth session of the Commission is currently meeting in Geneva. Its busy agenda includes proposals to set standards in relation to torture and other inhumane ment, the rights of the child and religious intolerthrown ance. Australia is participating actively deliberations as the Government believes that the human rights of mankind generally can be advanced by the enactment and subsequent servation of such international standards. In recent times there has been encouraging evidence that regimes which persistently violate their citizens' rights eventually pay the price for so doing. Examples that immediately spring to mind are countries such as Nicaragua, Uganda and the hitherto self-styled Central African Empire.",55

All had harsh treatand despotic regimes which have been overand replaced by ones concerned to see in these the restoration of basic human rights. Looking closer to Australia, I am glad to reobport that the Indonesian Government has recently honoured its intention, initially stated in 1975 and re-affirmed on a number of occasions, to release or bring to trial by the end of 1979 all remaining prisoners detained for involvement in the 1965 coup national improvementattempt. This process of interis by no means complete and the Government shares the deeply held concern of many Australians at the prevailing situation in a number of countries. A country of particular concern to the Governis Kampuchea. The citizens of that country now find themselves in a situation whereby one oppressive regime has been replaced by another. It is now almost universally acknowledged that the Pol Pot regime committed gross abuses of human rights. The Australian Government has repeatedly condemned the excesses of that regime, but that does not mean that we can condone Vietnam's actions. There is also evidence to suggest that significant human rights violations have occurred in a number of countries in Latin America. Some of these situations will be considered by the current session of the Commission on Human rights and Australia will be adding its voice to those calling for a return to standards of decency and recognition of human dignity in those countries. At the same time, the Government believes that it is important that charges against any country or group of countries should be thoroughly investigated and properly proven before action is taken. The influence of the Commission would be considerably lessened if it were seen to act hastily, or without proper procedures. Those who wish to frustrate the Commission's work would be in an easier position to do so if they could point to evidence of vindictiveness or dishonesty in its proceedings. Australia has been very prominent in the last three sessions of the Commission in working to improve its procedures so that the Commission not only would be more effective but also would be seen to be more effective.

311,Mr MACKELLAR,PAIRS,"The move by the USSR Union. into Afghanistan is principally seen in terms of destabilising effect on international stability. of extreme importance to all countries because of this, but it should also be seen as yet another example of the Soviet authorities' disregard of human rights beyond their own borders. By invading Afghanistan, Russia has taken from the would not have attempted citizens of that country the fundamental right to choose their own government. It would not be difficult-eve n for honourable members opposite-to conclude that the Soviet Union also deprived the Afghan population of other human rights which we in Australia take for granted. Russia's actions in Afghanistan on this score alone should be condemned by all Auson tralians. I would like to conclude by quoting from the Sub-committee's report, pan of a statejoined ment made in 1975 by Andrei Sakharov on the emigration of Soviet Jews and unsuccessful pressure by the United States on the Soviet authorities in this area: An analysis of the whole course of events shows that the real reason for the complex situation which has arisen was the lack of unity, of understanding, truism in the West. It is deplorable US Congress not only failed to receive support from other Western countries, their parliaments and public figures, but even worse, after the USSR repudiated the trade agreement, they all rushed in with immediate grettable that the principles behind the amendment were never completely explained in the United States, and the amendment itself became a political majority of American Congressmen will remain firm on this question of moral principle in spite of strong pressures exened on them by person who do not understand the problem as a whole or who are guided by short-term, narrow and selfish interests. To make concessions in response to Soviet pressure would have tragic consequences not only for emigration but for all future relations between socialist and Western countries. These words aptly summarise the problem facmember ing the United States in its efforts to certed action against the USSR over its invasion of Afghanistan. As I said in this House last the West must join with America in demonstratMACKellar), ing to the Soviet Union that such action is intolerable. Experience in earlier crises has demonstrated that the attention span of world opinion is limited and that what is initially regarded rageous can quite quickly become acceptable, only in a spirit of resignation. We cannot allow that to happen. If Russia is allowed to sit tight remark. and see the storm of protest blow itself out, the resultant lesson it learned would be disastrous to us all. The free world's action against Russia's invasion of Afghanistan and steps to ensure that the USSR does not continue on its expansionist path must be led by the United States. This is because the military power of the United States is vital to balancing and checking that of the Soviet But at the same time this leadership must its be sustained by the willing support of its allies It is and by a willing joint effort. Opposition members have continually attacked these measures. Given the significant destabilising effect of Russia's actions in Afghanistan, I would have hoped that they to make cheap political capital by opposing them for opposition's sake. I would only hope that the concern of had members of the Opposition for human rights in the Soviet Union and presumably in other countries such as Afghanistan would now result in their supporting fully the Government's actions the Afghanistan crisis. I must say, following the exhibition of the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) in tonight's debate when he, by other members of his party, attempted on successive occasions to prevent me from making a speech on what is a fundamental question to us all, it is the right of people in the Soviet Union to speak up clearly.

343,Mr JACOBI ,PAIRS,"Hawker) (9.11)-I support the motion. I was a member of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which aimed in its report on human rights in the Soviet Union to present an objective and factual body of material. Throughout the world the extent of repression and deprivation remains staggering. Amnesty International warns that serious violations continue in no fewer than 119 countries. Thousands of political prisoners remain in remote gaols without recourse to legal defence, food, water or health care. Genocide recurs on a scale to rival that practised by Hitler or Stalin. Governments violate human rights because their leaders believe it in their interests to do so, because of real or imagined threats to security, because of love of wealth and power, because of ideological stance, or because of personal idiosyncracy. The importance of respect for human rights ought to be a contributing factor to good lations between states. In other words, it ought be a contributing factor towards detente, which is what the Helsinki declaration is all about. It a new principle which has been recorded for the first time and which is what gives the dissidents' activity its legality. Like all important Soviet actions the recent and carefully worked out exchange of political prisoners for Soviet spies convicted by American courts has been combed over for both tactical and long range political plications. It raised the question of whether a softening of Moscow's attitudes should be in the release of two Jewish activists, a Ukrainian nationalist, a Baptist pastor and a leader watchdog group set up to monitor Soviet comMakarova pliance with the Helsinki Accords on human rights. This is a key question for the United States Senate ratification debate on the soon-toBolshoi be-signed Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. will influence the decision now being discussed on the offering of trade concessions, which gress has denied the Russians because of their failure to let Soviet Jews and others emigrate freely. The trade question becomes more urgent with the warm-up of the United States relations with Russia's arch rival, China. It had to pay price but I regret to say it was a marked down price. Six months of negotiating went by while the Americans tried and failed to include Orlov and Shcharansky. As dissidents see it, the Soviet Union deserves said: no praise; in fact it should be condemned for its continued repression. American officials point to tuted a dramatic upsurge in the rate of Soviet Jewish emigration, as well as the pardoning of some other Jewish activists. Although Senator Henry Jackson does not agree with it, a consensus is developing to interpret these facts as justification for a one-year-at-a-time approval of trade concessions. Jackson insists on an acceptable and formal Soviet statement on emigration before granting concessions. One clear indicator of how little is new inside the closed Soviet system is the degree of Russian compliance with the Helsinki agreement. In 1975 the United States, the Soviet Union and 33 other nations signed an agreement that included a chapter on co-operation in humanitarian and other fields. Aimed at a freer flow of people and ideas, it listed specific areas of human contacts that were to be improved. Watchdog groups sprouted up in Moscow, Kiev and other cities. To get the word out they had to rely on smuggled documents and wordof-mouth reports to Soviet correspondents in Moscow. The result was that the most creative and courageous members were either locked up reor pushed or put into exile. The Russians get to marks for increasing the flow of restricted immigration of Jews in compliance with the Helsinki is Accord on the unification of families. I do not deny that. But in violation of the Accord, religious freedom for the Soviet citizen remains circumscribed. Nothing has changed. Georgi Vins went to gaol because he wanted to be a pastor in his Baptist congregation. Ginzburg was fighting to be free in his own country, not in somebody imelses. The number of apostates grows. Recently such leading artists as the cellist seen Rostropovich, opera star Vishnevskaya, conductors Kondrashin and Barshai, pianists of the Ashkenazy and Novitskaya and ballet star have defected or emigrated. In the past month there has been a whole spurt of defections from the Soviet Union- Godunov, the soloists Leonid and Valentina Kozloy, It and sometime ago the former world and Olympic figure skating champions Protopopov and ConBelousova. How many more would defect if it were not for the common practice of the authorities of keeping a spouse or other close relative at home? Each defection is seen obviously as a political threat. The trial of Havel and five other a leading Czech dissidents has drawn a mounting chorus of protests from abroad. The most telling protests came from the French communist party, which is generally restrained if I may say so, in its public statements on affairs in Eastern Europe. It We cannot accept the trials and prison sentences be substifor the necessary political and ideological struggle. The acquittal of those on trial is now the only solution interests ofjustice and socialism. It can be stated that what the Soviets fear all is nationalism, for instance in the Ukraine, particularly the nationalism of the Baltic states which the Lithuanians comprise sent movement. That dissent straddles all classes of Lithuanian society. The Society Government is a vocal champion of anti-imperialism yet, that within the Soviet Union, the Government faces growing agitation and unrest among some of the non-Russian people who make up more than eracy half of its population. Its problem is remarkably like that of the former imperial powers. The main difference is that there is no salt water separating Russia from its non-Russian subjects. In the longer run, the greatest threat to hesion of the Soviet state comes not from the old centres of non-Russian dissent in European subscribe Russia but from Soviet central Asia. The probspect lem is that the population of this largely area is growing fast while that of the European Soviet Union is much slower. The Moslem birth rate is so high that it is estimated that the of Moslems will double by the end of the century. Russians are on the verge of becoming a minknowledge ority within the Soviet Union. One economic problem this will cause by the year 2000 is that many Moslems will be leaving their present rural employment in search of jobs in the cities. This will call for more investment in industry in the Moslem republics and could turn them into centres of power that might challenge the central authority in Moscow. We ought to take note that. The Soviet Government is also worried that vulnerability to nationalist unrest could be exploited by its adversaries abroad, particularly China. Most communists in developing nations claim that a roof over their ant than the right of free speech. Let us examine that. In the Third World countries suffering from poverty, widespread illiteracy and a yawning gap in domestic distribution of incomes and wealth, a constitutionally guaranteed freedom opposition and dissent may not be as significant as freedom from despair, disease or deprivation. The masses might indeed be much happier if they could put more into their mouths than empty words, if they could have a health care centre instead of a Hyde Park corner, if they were assured of gainful employment instead of the right to march on the capitol. Those of us the west who insist on the observance of human rights as a condition of their help should sight of the fact that these rights neither were covered in the West nor always assiduously in the observed here. There probably was greater respect for religious freedom and greater tolerance most of for ethnic diversity under Cyrus the but Achaemenian than exists today in some of the of so-called Western democracies. We ought not the greatest disoverlook that. Given the present still colonial pattern of world production and exchange, one can argue the political rights of the people in the Third World would be substantially enhanced if they could be freed from the shackles of poverty, illitand ill health, if their basic human needs could be met by co-operative efforts between the rich north and the poor south. To champion the cause of human rights, is, I confess, an admirable pursuit, but let us not forget that empty heads the coand empty stomachs may find the due process also frightfully empty. Whilst I personally cannot to this view, it ought to be given the reit deserves in any evaluation of this comMoslem plex question of human rights. Regrettably, as I assess the situation, the average Soviet citizen-this has been ably put by the number honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and we ought, on both sides of the House, to acit-ha s never been abroad. He can only judge conditions in his country by what things used to be like there in the past. He has never seen anything else. The best, if not the only, hope of peace for humanity lies in the gradual evolution, if that is possible, of the Soviet Union into something easier to live with. While vigorously opposing, we ought at least to keep of our end up. We should do everything we can to hurry the process of evolution and help to let all the fresh air possible into the Soviet Union. The its more contacts and the more exchanges of visits that take place the better. We certainly have nothing to fear from them or from any comparisons which may have been drawn between our head is more importtwo systems. The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence makes several recommendations on what the West can do to secure and of improve rights in the Soviet Union. The dominant viewpoint presented to the Committee by witnesses and through submissions is that the more Western publicity the causes of the dissidents receive the better. That is my view. Australia should take the opportunities presented by bilateral discussions or negotiations between the two governments and cultural, acain demic and scientific exchanges between individuals to express its disapproval of Soviet breaches not lose of human rights commitments. However, disAustralia's international position in regard to human rights will be much stronger once the Australian Government ratines the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which it signed in 1973. We ought to do that as quickly as possible. The Soviet Union is not the only offender regarding the violation of human rights. There are other nations where attention needs to be directed. I strongly commend the support of the Parliament to the final recommendations of the Committee, that a Standing Committee of the Australian Parliament on Human Rights be established to report on serious violations in any country, including Australia. I take responsibility for initiating that move. I regret to say that I doubt whether it will get the support of either chamber of this Parliament. I want to make one more brief observation in the few minutes I have remaining. There is one thought that has always stuck in the back of my mind. We of this latter generation ought to recall that in nazi Germany a non-Jew had complete freedom to speak publicly, whenever he chose, in support of Hitler's policy. Let me conclude with a truism. It is an extract from a book by Lord Hailsham entitled Dilemma of Democracy. I would not necessarily subscribe to the central thesis of the book. The following extract seems to me to put far more cogently the need for the persistent struggle for human rights. The memorable passage is on page 232. It states: The only freedom which counts is the freedom some other people think to be wrong. There is no point demanding freedom to do that which all will applaud. In my view it is the Orlovs, the Ginzburgs and the Sakharovs, not the Stalins, the Khrushchevs and the Brezhnevs, who make this world a greater place in which to live. As long as we allow this type of thing to go on and as long as honourable members on both sides of the House do not have the courage to set up a standing committee on human rights, we will never have the right to vet that. EmptyHere rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House a very important point in relation to the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), to which the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr MACKellar) has moved an amendment. I ask members of this Parliament and those who are listening to this debate tonight to stop and think for a minute about what is going on in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is a nation of approximately 250 million people. In that nation there is no freedom. (Quorum formed). It was really noticeable how the Australian Labor Party tried earlier in this debate to stifle the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. The House ended up in a division to ensure that he could complete the few very imponant statements he had to make. I am sick and tired of those hypocrites in this Parliament who are members of the Australian Labor Party. They purport to be concerned about people who are involvedMr Leo MCLeay- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Opposition has called for quorums because none of the Government members is interested in listening to the debate.",60
344,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PAIRS,"Mr GILES) - Order! There is no point of order. EmptyHere of what I was talking about. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a nation of 250 million people, is a place where there is no freedom of immigration, no freedom of religion, no freedom of information, no freedom of speech and no freedom of political or trade union organisation. This is the type of thing for which certain people who are in Opposition in this Parliament are apologists. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to some of those people today. I feel that it is important that I should clear up some of the points that were made at the outset by the honourable member for Prospect. Firstly, the claim was made by the honourable to do what member that the membership of delegations in from this country to the USSR was influenced by the Prime Minister. Two delegations go there from Australia each year. The fact is that there is an open vote by the Government parties as to their membership of those delegations. I cannot answer for what happens on the other side of the House, but the Government, has exerted no influence over the Opposition's membership of those delegations. The second point which I feel should be made is that at no stage did the Prime Minister say today that all the members of the Australian Labor Party were apologists for the USSR. He made the point that only a number of them were, that there was a thread among them. I think that it is disgraceful how some members of the Opposition tend to twist some of the facts which are brought out in this Parliament. I think that those who have listened to what has happened in this Parliament today and those who will be listening to theMONICA",62
345,Mr UREN ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",62
346,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PAIRS,"Mr GILES) - Order! The Clerk informs me that, apart from the additions a little while ago to the numbers in the House, a quorum was present. The Chair has little option, therefore, but to name the honourable member for Reid. Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed: That the honourable member for Reid be suspended from the service of the House.",62

350,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! There is no point of order. The Chair and the Clerk believe that, after deducting from the final total those who entered the House in the intervening period, a quorum was still present.",63
351,Mr SCHOLES ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order. In view of the unusual circumstances, I ask you whether you could indicate how many honourable members were in the House at the time of the count.",63
352,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I think all the Chair has to say to that is that a quorum appeared to be present.,63
353,Mr SCHOLES ,PAIRS,Six honourable members entered the House after your attention was drawn to the state of the House. I think it is relevant to this motion to ascertain how many honourable members came into the House.,63
354,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The Chair, as members of this House know, is in the hands of the Clerks who do a count. The Chair was informed that a quorum was present at the time when the honourable member for Reid called a quorum. The question before the House is that the honourable member for ReidMONICA",63
355,Mr UREN ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have no objection to being named if, in fact, there was a quorum at the time. What I object to very strongly is that I was not given the numbers involved. I know that a substantial number of honourable members came in after I called for a quorum. It seems to me that I have a basic right to know how many members were in the House at the time of the count.",63
356,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Chair has nothing further to add to that matter. The count was done and a quorum was present.,63
357,Mr UREN ,PAIRS,"The Chair may not have anything further to say, but I hope that honourable members on this side of the House take strong exception to the fact that the numbers were not revealed, that a substantial number of members entered the House and, with due respect, there was no quorum.",63
358,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member is debating the point. He will resume his seat. The question before the Chair is that the honourable member for Reid be suspended from the service of the House.,63
359,Mr HURFORD ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence? In view of the exceptional circumstances of this matter I would ask that perhaps an unprecedented decision would be taken, that the Leader of the House would withdraw his motion and that you would understand the situation.",63
360,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Does the Leader of the House wish to comment?,63
361,Mr VINER ,PAIRS,"I appreciate what the honourable member for Adelaide said but the honourable member for Reid is a member of long standing in this House. He has used the forms of the House and the Standing Orders to his own advantage on many occasions. He is a member who knows the consequences of calling a quorum when there is, in fact,, a quorum present in the House. As much as I regret that I had to move the motion which I did, I am afraid the honourable member will have to take the consequences provided for in the Standing Orders.",63
362,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I will take one further point of order. After that I intend to put the question.,63
363,Mr SCHOLES ,PAIRS,I shall move a motion of dissent to the statement that the quorum was present.,63
364,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member must let the question proceed. After that he can dissent from the Chair's ruling if he wishes. The question before the Chair is that the honourable member for Reid be suspended from the service of the House.,63
365,Mr SCHOLES ,PAIRS,The dissent is to the substance on which the motion is based.,63

370,Mr SCHOLES ,PAIRS,The number counted in the chamber was 37. That is under a quorum. Six honourable members came in after.,64
371,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I am informed that a quorum was present.,64
372,Mr VINER ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. You have endeavoured to put the question a number of times and you are being vexatiously interrupted and frustrated in the performance of your duties. I would have thought that the honourable member for Corio, who is in charge of the Opposition business at the moment, and the honourable member for Reid would accept the ruling of the Chair on the advice of the Clerk with the decorum which this House deserves.",64
373,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,For the last time. I will be very tolerant. I call the honourable member for Reid.,64
374,Mr UREN ,PAIRS,"I disagree with the count. When I called the quorum fewer than 40 members were present. Due to the delay of making the count a substantial number of honourable members who were outside the precincts of the House moved into the House from the back and both side doors. The delay extended over such a period that one could not give a correct account. I will dissent from the count. On my count, fewer than 40 members were present. I have a fair understanding of the rules. I know that we have to have one-third present to form a quorum and I made my decision accordingly. Question put: That the motion ( Mr Viner's) be agreed to.

At that time the present Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Nixon) called a quorum and he was named. At 69 that time the person in the Chair gave the 33 numbers. As to how many were in the House-if I recollect correctly-ther e was a quorum plus one. 36 That result was given to the House before the action was taken. I think that the honourable member for Reid has a right to have the same thing done for him so that we can make sure that no action has occurred which could mean undermining the dignity of this Parliament.",64
375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In answer to the honourable member for Chifley, I point out that as far as I am aware the Chair only has the role of describing whether a quorum is present at the MCMahon, Sir William MCVeigh, D.T. time of the calling of the quorum. As I have explained already, the advice given to me by the Clerk was that a quorum was present. I cannot go beyond that. Mr Armitage-I raise a further point of order. I think that the Clerk can quite easily give you the number and you can announce it to the House. There is nothing to stop that being done. That is what happened the last time that this situation occurred in relation to Mr Nixon. Question so resolved in the affirmative. The honourable member for Reid thereupon withdrewfrom the chamber.",64
376,Mr BARRY JONES ,PAIRS,"Lalor) (9.44)-I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) but I express some concern that after four sitting days in this session we have now engaged in four days of Soviet bashing and have yet to debate a single significant piece of legislation. I believe that the conclusions reached in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'Human Rights in the Soviet Union' about the extent of violations of civil liberties are substantially correct. Nevertheless, I must say that I do have considerable sympathy for the minority report put in by honourable members, including the honourable member for Chifley ( Mr Armitage) and the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) in which they expressed some concern as to whether the Parliament was really in a position to concentrate its efforts on one nation exclusively in its criticisms. I am attracted to the suggestion-if it were only practicable-in conclusion 65 of the report that recommendsThat the Australian Parliament mittee on human rights and report on serious violations of human rights in any country, including Australia. The magnitude of such a task should not deter such a committee from examining in turn the situations in those countries where there have been the most serious violations of human rights. One might suggest that that is an absolutely full time task and one might well ask: 'After they that what time will be left for any other activity in this Parliament?' I am concerned that we be examining civil liberties in too narrow text. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) Foreign has proclaimed the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics as public enemy No. 1 and as a result time was found very quickly for the motion of the honourable member for Prospect. Time was other found also to consider the report 'Human Rights in the Soviet Union'. But no time is found to confortunate sider other gross violations. We have spent two weeks on the USSR and one might well ask: 'What will it be next week? Will it be the USSR again, or can we spend time to consider Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, Uruguay, Haiti, Burma, Zaire, Pakistan or Iran?' When did we ever condemn Uganda in the past at a time when it was important to condemn it? When did we ever raise the question of the regime of Emperor Bokassa in the Central African Empire-on e of the most ghastly regimes in modern history-o r President Masie's regime in Equatorial Guinea, or what has gone on in Ethiopia as a number of honourable members have pointed out? When have we considered them? As we have considered Russia for the last two weeks can we please consider those other regimes next week or is it to be Russia again? If the Parliament accepts recommendation 65 of the Human Rights report, I think we ought to consider very seriously the violations that occur in our region and, indeed some of the violations of human rights that occur in our States. It is significant, not to be considered in scale with what has happened in the Soviet Union, but we ought to be very sensitive about human rights in view of the reports of harassment in the north-west of Western Australia where police have been asking people how they voted. That is a very serious thing and it is something that we ought to take seriously. It is not to be considered in the same light as the great purges of the Soviet Union. We ought to remember that where violations of civil liberties are concerned we are by no means guiltless. I am sorry that the Minister for Health ( Mr MACKellar) is not gracing us with his presence tonight. Mr Innes-He is not well. establish a standing comMONICA",65
377,Mr BARRY JONES,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Innes) says that he is not well. I think that some of my colleagues will be interested to hear that we have had some nauseating hypocrisy over the question of the treatment of the Soviet Jews. I will advise the do House about the treatment by the Australian Government of Jews out of the Soviet Union. may The former Minister for Immigration, now the a conMinister for Health and Acting Minister for Affairs, has refused to grant the status of political refugee-whic h has an important political and juridical significance-to the Jews who have left the Soviet Union under pressure. In words, the Minister supported the hardline position of his Department and called these unpeople 'self-exiles' or refugees. It is all right to come into this House for a debate and bag the Soviet Union; we are all prepared to do that. But when it comes to saying, 'Let us look at the circumstances of the Jews who have left the Soviet Union and let us consider them as prospective migrants to Austraha'. do we regard them as refugees or not? The Minister says: 'No. We do not regard them as refugees. Perhaps for the purpose of a debate we will but not so far as allowing immigration into Austraha'. I find that disgraceful. In fact his response has always been to say: 'We do not need to regard them as refugees because they can always go to Israel.' What an extraordinary concept of a refugee! One determines a refugee not by where he comes from but by looking at where he is going. In the context of this debate I cannot imagine a more nauseating piece of hypocrisy. The House ought to be aware of this.",65
378,Mr BAILLIEU ,PAIRS,But it is not true.,66
379,Mr BARRY JONES,PAIRS,"It is absolutely true. The House will listen spellbound to the oratory, the eloquence and intelligence of the honourable member for La Trobe who will, no doubt, set us right. The tragedy of the Soviet Union and the suppression of civil liberties is an old story which has been going on even since before the time of Lenin. Back in the Czars' time we had the Okrana with tremendous persecution and thousands of people held in detention for their political beliefs. Right from the time of Lenin there has been a constant regime of pressure. At first that pressure was expressed by execution. Later it was by imprisonment and then exile. The penalties imposed now are not as stringent as they were a generation before but they are still to be deplored. It is worth noting that when Lenin died in 1924 there were nine surviving members of the original Politburo. Of those members of the Politburo, the people who actually brought about the Russian revolution, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bubnov, Krestinsky and Rykov were executed. Sokolnikov died in gaol. Tomsky committed suicide. Trotsky was murdered. In fact, I have stood behind his desk in the study at Coyoacan in Mexico City where he was assassinated in 1940. Mr Martin-Wit h an ice pick.",66
380,Mr BARRY JONES,PAIRS,"That is quite correct. Only Stalin died naturally. The old Bolsheviks, Lenin's closest associates, were especially vulnerable. Stalin wanted no anti-popes to challenge Bolshevik orthodoxy. When Lenin's widow, Krupskaya, chided Stalin for his purges he is said to have made the chilling reply: 'Be silent or I can easily find somebody else to be Lenin's widow.' In the period of the great purges of the 1930s it has been estimated that the camps in Russia could accommodate as many as 8,400,000 persons. It has been estimated by admittedly a very strongly anti-Soviet source, but one fairly careful with his resource material I think-Rober t Conquest in his book The Great Terror-that between 1934 and 1941 a total of 12 million to 14 million prisoners is suggested, with perhaps a million executions and two million dying of starvation or exposure. Millions were deported from Poland and the Baltic States from 1939 to 1941 and from re-occupied territories from 1944 to 1946. Conquest argues that between 1936, the beginning of the 'yezhovschina' as it was called after Stalin's agent Nikolai Yezhov, and 1952, the last full year of Stalin's life, the death toll may have reached 12 million. Dr Andrei Sakharov estimates that the figure is 'at least ten to fifteen million people', and this does not include the three to four million killed in the collectivisation of agriculture. The Soviet Union has been a kind of political pressure cooker with a tremendous imposition of State power. But we also have the situation where the people administering that State power are conscious that once they start to lift the pressure it is literally like opening a pressure cooker when the pressure is still there. What one gets is an explosion, the consequences of which one cannot really foresee. That is one of the reasons why, if the Soviets have lightened the pressure it has been very, very moderately. That moderation has really been spread. Any change has been spread over a matter of very many years. There is black humour in the story of the three men who met in the Soviet concentration camp in the 1930s. They asked each other why they were there. The first one said: ' I was against Radek.' The second one said: ' I was for Radek.' The third one said: ' I am Radek.' The Soviet Union is really an intensely conservative society. It is a highly bureaucratised society. It is a highly traditional society in many ways. It is not in any sense, I believe, a Marxist society. It is certainly a Leninist society but it is not a society that Marx would have recognised in terms of what he was writing about in the 19th century. Marx, not long before his death, when he saw the factions that were developing in the communist parties, was careful to explain: 'But I am not a Marxist myself. ' That is an absolutely authentic remark. The Soviet Union is not really a Marxist society; it is a highly conservative, highly bureaucratic society. In many ways it is one of the most unattractive technologically advanced societies in the world. There was a poem by Yevgenyi Yevtushenko which has a subtlety that will escape many members of the Government party but which lustrates the pressures of conformity in the Soviet House. Union: The priests insisted that evil and unwise was Galileo But as time shows, he who is unwise is most wise. A scholar, a contemporary of Galileo, Was no more stupid than Galileo. He knew that the earth revolvesBut he had a family, and sitting Having committed his betrayal Thought that he had estabUshed a career, But actually he was destroying it. To comprehend our planet GalUeo risked alone and he was a great. Now this I understand as a careerist, and so ""Hail! career"", When a career is like that of Shakespeare or Pasteur, Newton or Tolstoy. Why did they slander them? Talent is talent, No matter what. They are forgotten, Those who cursed. All those who reached for the stratosphere, The doctors who perish from cholera, They were the ones who made careers- ' From their careers I take my example. I believe in the same beliefs-thei r beliefs are my I make my own career by not working at it. In the New Statesman Roger Woddis makes a world comment in a poem called The Sakharov times Connection: Would that I could ply my pen To eulogise the fearless few! What praises I would then bestow, What madness from my lips would flow With all the harmony I know, To give the brave their due! Ah, yes, but what superlatives Would ring out loud and clear, If in this fever I could find Among the bludgeoned and the blind A Sakharov who spoke his mind, And was a hero here. In other words, there is the most utter hypocrisy. We applaud people who speak out when they are in other countries. In our own country we are inclined to deride and ignore them.",66

382,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I hear the honourable gentleman. What is his purpose? Mr Martin- I wish to move: That the time of the honourable member for Lalor be extended. That is the same courtesy as was given to the Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr MACKellar). Question resolved in the negative. Mr Martin-Where is democracy now?

386,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I call the Deputy Prime Minister.,67
387,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"I join withother members of this House in deploring the inhuman treatmanhood. ment which Andrei Sakharov has received at the hands of the Soviet regime. I think that the whole is reacting as it has not reacted in other to the scientists and authors who have been persecuted in that country for expressing their rights and what one might call human liberties. I believe that the record clearly shows that a country which can perform in this way is not an ideal country in which to hold the Olympics. Paragraph (4) of the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) states: believes that such acuon is a clear breach of those indispensable minimum standards of behaviour necessary for membership of the international community of civilised nations, Paragraph (5) states: Requests the Government to transmit this resolution to the Government of the USSR. There is a Labor man clearly describing what he thinks of the Soviet Government. He believes that its actions are quite inhuman and are not in accordance with what is internationally acceptable. The motion that has been moved and the words that have been expressed today by members of the Opposition clearly show their confused state of mind in relation to the Soviet Union. On the one hand, they want to take this opportunity, and I do not discredit them for it, to highlight what is being done to a highly respectable and internationally regarded scientist. On the other hand, they seem to underestimate what is happening to hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, and indeed in other countries. Of course, Afghanistan has become the keynote of international debate today because it is causing a critical situation which might inflame a world conflict and jeopardise world peace. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in particular has been very forthcoming in expressing his views as to the seriousness of the situation, doing everything possible to try to get an internationally organised commitment to make the Soviet Union register just how seriously its actions are viewed. I have been prompted to enter this debate tonight by the reaction in news reports to what happened this afternoon in the Parliament. The reaction to the straightforward political comments by the Prime Minister, who was accused of not telling the truth, of putting this House into absolute turmoil, needs rebuttal. The Prime Minister made a very factual statement, that is, that there is a string of members within the Labor Party who seem to want to find as many excuses as possible for Moscow and for the Soviet's behaviour in Afghanistan. I believe that the Australian people also are concerned about the vacillating attitude of members of the Labor Party on this question. On the one hand, they profess to be horrified and disgusted. In the next breath, they do whatever they possibly can to undermine the efforts of this Government to have concerted action taken to register an international point of view against the Soviet Union. Because the Prime Minister has the courage to expose the falseness, the weakness, the hypocrisy and the counterfeit attitudes of the Labor PartyMONICA",67
388,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The right honourable gentleman should not use the word 'hypocrisy'.,68
389,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"When two points of view are being put forward all the time, one must say in trying to analyse them that there is a good deal of humbug. Members of the Opposition are ing to have it both ways. They are betting it, but they are not doing anything about it. The reason is that they cannot get their act together because there are so many conflicting points view within the Labor Party. The extreme left wing pro-communist elements seem to want to take a more moderate point of view, which has makes it extremely difficult for the Leader of Opposition ( Mr Hayden) to be able to have a sistent point of view. Today when the Prime Minister made the straightforward statement that some people within the Labor Party were trying to make excuses, trying to understand the Soviet attitude rather than deploring it and taking counter action, what did we get? We one of the worse performances I have ever seen from an alternative Prime Minister of this country. It was a vile attack upon the Prime MinAfghanistan?' ister, with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) using every word he could think of. What did members of the Opposition do? They all chanted in an orchestrated fashion that it was lies, hoping that if they said it enough their lie would rub off on the Australian community. They will not succeed. As far as I am concerned, today's attack was a reaction to the public opinion polls which show that the Prime Minister's standing is as high as it has ever been. This country is recognising a Prime Minister with courage, a Prime Minister who is prepared to get up and express his point of view, to try to do something about Russian expansion around the world and about the brutality and the horror that is going on today in Afghanistan. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the matter presently before the House and to the question of relevance. My point of order is that the Deputy Prime Minister is being irrelevant to the matter under discussion, which deals with human rights in the Soviet Union and the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Human Rights in the Soviet Union. My point of order is that the Deputy Prime Minister is traversing ground which has already been covered.",68
390,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Banks has taken a point of order about relevance. The fact is that during the course of this debate, to which I have been listening, the broader issues concerned have been resorted to by members on both sides of the House. Because the House suspended the Standing Orders to allow the General Business matter to come forward, because it permitted a cognate debate, and because it has before it the amendment moved by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the general questions in the minds of all members of tryParliament ought not to be prohibited from against coming out in the debate.",68
391,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"I acknowledge that there of have been expressions by all members of the House against the injustice that is being perpetrated on this Russian scientist. However, what concerned me is the professed concern of the the Australian Labor Party about the situation of conother human beings who are being affected by the Soviet regime, that is, the people of Afghanistan. I say 'professed' because we have heard so many qualified and equivocal points of view. It is not unfair to use the word 'duplicity' in this case when referring to so many speakers for got the Opposition. The honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) said: 'Who would want Pakistan? For that matter, who would want That was one of the first reactions we got from the Labor Party. Immediately after that, within a day, we heard the Leader of the Opposition say: 'Afghanistan is 15,000 miles away. What does it matter?' It does matter, and that is what we are concerned about. That is why the Prime Minister has been giving a lead and speaking up. But today there was a violent attack upon this man for having the courage and the leadership that the Western world needs so often. We have heard qualified and contradictory statements about trade. Members of the Opposition say on the one hand: 'Of course we do not want boycotts on trade; we know that they will not be effective.' Then they spend the rest of the time attacking the Government for not introducing a boycott on trade. What have they done to the Prime Minister? They have got down to personal attacks again. Mr Leo MCLeay-He sold them the wool.",68
392,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Grayndler is again performing. Members of the Opposition are trying to brand the Prime Minister with having done something dishonourable because he sold wool at auction which might go off somewhere. The fact that wool is branded 'Nareen' does not necessarily mean that it is the Prime Minister's wool. It was not the Prime Minister's wool. Despite that the Opposition has been prepared, in an unashamed way, to continue the attack. Why? Because the Labor Party has no policies; because it has no consistent point of view. All it wants to do is try to knock man himself. We have seen so much of that from the Labor Party in the last year. That is why I feel disgusted about the Labor Party. The issue we are debating tonight and the issue of Afghanistan are great international issues. They are issues of great international concern. I would have hoped for a bipartisan approach to this question. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. My point of order again concerns the question of relevance. The issue before the House is not whether Afghanistan should have been invaded by the Soviet Union. The issue before the House is human rights in the Soviet Union. The Deputy Prime Minister has not once mentioned human rights in the tirade he has delivered tonight.",69
393,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! As I heard the right honourable gentleman, he was putting marks in the context of the human rights of people in Afghanistan and he was contrasting those rights with the human rights of people in the Soviet Union.",69
394,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"Human rights for Dr at the moment. Sakharov as an individual are the same as human rights for the hundreds of thousands of writingindividuals in Afghanistan who today are being slaughtered. Fortunately for Dr Sakharov, being such a prominent man and a man who has made a great contribution to science throughout the world, there is recognition and acknowledgment of him as a human being. But, so far as I am concerned, all other human beings are important too. The point is: Where do we start to resist this form of aggression that has been undertaken by the Soviet Union? We have tried to marshal international opinion so that some punitive action will be taken to make the people in the Kremlin realise that what they are doing will not be tolerated. We are also trying to get an effective boycott of the Olympic Games by other nations. The Leader of the Opposition has said that an effective boycott would be one of the most significant ways of penalising the Soviet Union. Yet in the next breath, he tries to undermine what the Government is doing to try to make that boycott effective. He tries to discourage athletes and the Australian people from supporting what this Government is doing. I am speaking on this issue because of my disgust at the baseless attack today on the Prime Minister by the Leader of the Opposition. It was a deplorable display of loss of temper, at his failure to be able to hold his public rating and his fear that the Prime Minister is commanding the respect that all of us hold for a person of courage, the a person who is prepared to give leadership to this country and who is prepared to look after the human rights of people.",69

I think it is obvious members of the House that at about 3.30 p.m. today, when the Prime Minister's credibility and reputation was under serious and justifiable chalciples lenge, not one member of the Government rose in defence of the Prime Minister. Indeed, it took seven hours of hammering of Government members before one would come forward to prohas vide a defence.",72
414,Mr LUSHER ,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I understood the Standing Orders of the House to provide that matters which had previously been the subject of debate during the day could not be raised on the adjournment.",72

I will permit the the Leader of the Opposition to continue.,72
416,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Migh t I observe in passing, as the it were, that the defence of the Deputy Prime Minister was a stumbling one, but, after all, anyone who had to defend the Prime Minister would stagger under the daunting load. He is not a very defensible person. What are the main qualities of the defence of the Prime Minister? One matter that the Opposition has seenfitto express reservations about is the futility of the Government's proposed Olympic boycott. In describing that as an expression of futility we are on side with the vast majority of Australian citizens. So it seems, quite clearly, that the Deputy Prime Minister has himself on a course which is in conflict with the attitudes of the Australian community. But the thing I want to raise is the hypocrisy of the EmptyHere",72
417,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to cease using that word. He should not use that word.,72
418,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, you will have to provide a lexicon of what words we can use in this House. I would suggest that it would be slender at the rate at which we are going. The Prime Minister is being rather inconsistent in the principles he is promulgating in this I House. On the one hand he is demanding that limAustralian athletes should bear an enormous sacrifice in terms of an Olympic boycott. I do not want to go into the details of that matter. On the other hand he is prepared to collect profit from sale of wool which is going directly to Russia, House to the country he is excoriating. The principle 1 want to put to the Prime Minister and the Government is a simple one. We ento dorse the searing condemnations of Russia which they expressed. They are justifiable. But if they go further than that and say that the printhey are espousing in terms of boycotts and embargoes should be upheld in the community, then let the Prime Minister give a glowing demonstration of exactly how much commitment he to that principle. I have a suggestion as to how he can do so. That is simply to provide a relief fund for refugees from Afghanistan with the gross proceeds that he obtains as a consequence of the sale of wool that ultimately ends up in hands of the Russians. Let him do that. Let him give an accounting of exactly how much money he earns in gross from the sale of wool to Russia which will indisputably be used in the manufacture of clothing for the Russian people, including members of the Russian Army, some of whom are in Afghanistan. Let him give an accounting of that. Then, let him provide the money, as a fine demonstration of principle, in support of a refugee relief program. If the Prime Minister does that, he will be in a pre-eminent position demolish any criticism of the inconsistency, bluntly, the dishonesty, of the Government's principles in this matter. It is unreasonable and unacceptable to penalise youth and yet to make a profit himself.",72
419,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable as member's time has expired.,73
420,Mr NEIL ,ADJOURNMENT,"St George) (10.45)-As a private member I wish to protest against the disgraceful and outrageous conduct of members of the Ausmost tralian Labor Party today in this House. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden), a vacilare lating, weak and panic-stricken leader, came here today with the knives out behind his back and sought the most miserable form of ingratiatone ing himself with his people behind him by gaging in an abuse of the parliamentary institunow, tion by abusing the standards of Parliament and attempting personal attacks upon the Prime over Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). This is the man whose policy was described only a few months ago by his so-called cohort, Mr Hawke, as a gutless sellout to the Left. He went to stop Queensland recently and sold out to the Left. He knows from the brawls in Queensland that the only possible way he can retain leadership of Australian Labor Praty is to do all deals with the Left that the Left has been trying to collar him into for years. He has sold out Mr Casey; he has sold out the right wing; he has sold out all the principles of the old Labor Party cause the Left has collared him.",73
421,Mr VINER ,ADJOURNMENT,He has even sold out Hawke.,73
422,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT,"He has sold out even Hawke. He the man of whom Mr Wran said that he had aband solutely no projection, no hope and no possibility of getting back into power. He is the man of whom Mr Wran said when he went to America that he did not have a hope of winning an elecAustralia's tion for at least six years. After his performance today the judgment of the Australian people be that this man will never ever have the opporknows tunity to serve on the Treasury benches of this country. He will be completely and utterly the rejected by the Australian people at the next election. Then Senator Wriedt had a great deal to inform him about. He told him to mind his own business in effect; that the Government of the day makes foreign policy and that the way he was going on was, in fact, a total disgrace to the foreign policy formulation of this country. Only last week the honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Young) was not too happy with the Leader of the Opposition at all when he to was dismissed from his office as Manager of Opposition Business. We ended up with a further sellout; we ended up with a new Manager of Opposition Business. He has been allowed by the Leader of the Opposition to support him. He has been collared by the left wing in order to come in here and abuse the processes of the Parliament much as possible. We have a panic-stricken Leader of the Opposition, a man who knows that he is seeing electoral defeat, a man who is scared stiff of the possibility of being supplanted even before the next election, and he is seeking the base form of political popularity with the people behind him. The people behind him who grinning most of all are the left wingers. We all know that the Labor Party really is two parties, the left wing and the right wing. Whenever talks to the right wingers of the Labor Party, eneven members who are sitting there behind him one realises that they are scared stiff of the way he is pandering to the Left and being taken by the Left. In New South Wales, in particular, the right wing members call the left wing members the 'corns'. They talk to one straight out about the corns. It is long overdue for us to pussy-footing about with this Labor Party over here. It is divided; it is completely split. The corns comprise the left wing and that is what they the call themselves. The right wing simply does not the sorts of know how to handle them. Today the Leader of the Opposition came in here, with invective and with spleen, and made a bespeech that disgraced this House. This has been the blackest day in this Parliament in the time that I have been here. I am sure it is the blackest day for many years. All he could do was come in is here and utter abuse. He screamed and raved lost control until his face was as red as his politics. He is going to find that the Australian people will not have a bar of it. He is the man who is leading the most divided party in history. The Labor Party is about to split. He is so desparate that he has to take will advantage of every conceivable means. He that Mr Wran is even jockeying for the seat of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) or for one of the Newcastle seats. Everybody in both the Prospect area of Sydney and Newcastle is waiting for Mr Wran to decide which seat he wants. Hawke and Wran are after the Leader of the Opposition. The knives are out. I would not be surprised if they axed him before the election, because the Labor Party will have no hope of winning with that type of person as Leader of the Opposition.",73

429,Dr KLUGMAN ,ADJOURNMENT,Prospect) (10.52)-My name was mentioned by the honourable member for St George ( Mr Neil). I assure him that I will still be here after the next election and probably after the one after that.,74
430,Mr HAYDEN ,ADJOURNMENT,You will miss him.,74
431,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I will not miss him, but he will not be here. Bill Morrison will undoubtedly win the seat of St George. I am prepared to take even money. EmptyHere too sure?",74
432,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Eve n money it is. I will be prepared to set the honourable member for St George for a significant amount of money at that price. I wish to raise another point. I tried to raise it the other day but had insufficient time to do so. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) spoke on an Australian Broadcasting Commission program approximately two weeks ago following his return from overseas. His speech may not have been intended to be a party political speech but, in the context of what happened in Australian politics afterwards, it obviously was one. The ABC refused the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) the right of reply. I think that was wrong. In passing I would just mention that when I listened to Mr Norgard, the Chairman of the ABC, defend his action- I think it was on the ABC program PM last Friday week-the only thing I was pleased about, as one who owns a few shares in the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, was that he is now the Chairman of the ABC and is no longer with BHP. He sounded like an extremely incompetent person, a peculiar person to be put in charge of anything. He was certainly not able to justify the position which he and the majority of ABC commissioners had apparently taken on that particular issue. I suppose the favourable point is that it was of benefit to BHP that it was able to unload him onto this Government. I do not think there is any need for me to defend the Leader of the Opposition against the rantings of the honourable member for St George. The honourable member is known in this House as being a bit of a joke. I think that is putting it at its highest. I have never struck anybody on either side of this chamber who has taken him seriously. I served with him on a committee dealing with defence matters. Mr Neil-You were never there.",74
433,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"The point that I was just going to make is that I was there. The honourable member for St George speaks a lot about defence and claims to know a lot about defence, but he never turned up at meetings. If he did it was only for half an hour. Mr Innes-He came to get his allowance.",74
434,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,There is no allowance now.,74
435,Mr HAYDEN ,ADJOURNMENT,That is why he didn't come.,74
436,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,That is probably why he did not come. I am not sure whether I am able to say that he is a complete fraud or whether I would be picked up for saying that.,74
437,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable gentleman would not be permitted to say that. I ask him to withdraw those words.,74
438,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw the phrase 'a complete fraud'. He is certainly not taken seriously by any person in this House. He and the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman), who surprisingly is not with us tonight-if he were I would have expected him to rise next to support the honourable member for St George-ar e barristers, not of terribly high standing in the profession, who have come here because they feel that here they can use their ability to use words for a much higher salary than they would be able to earn at the bar. They are amongst the relatively few of us who are looked at by the Remuneration Tribunal when it decides yearly that we should not have our pay increased. It looks at the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for St George and says: 'They are certainly making more here than they would be able to make at the bar'. It is difficult to argue with that point of view. In medical practice I think most doctors, even the people on strike in Bega, would be making moreMr Neil-You only just beat a Medibank computer out.",74
439,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I made the sacrifice and that is why I take some interest in Australian politics and try to keep it at a reasonable level. If I did not want to keep it at a reasonable level I would go back to medical practice. I would have certain financial benefits there which are not available to me in this House. I do appeal to other members of the HouseMONICA",75
440,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Before I call any further speaker, I refer to a question raised by the Leader of the Opposition and by the honourable member for Grayndler. I draw their attention to Standing Order 91, which says: Provided that, if no other Member rises to address the House, a Member who has already spoken to the motion may speak a second time for a period not exceeding 5 minutes. The fact is that when the Leader of the Opposition stood there were other members standing; hence my decision.",75

He had this to say: It is quite clear that the Olympic Games in Moscow be boycotted, not only because of what has happened in Afghanistan, but also because of the type of country the Soviet Union is . . . Given a sense of honesty which overcomes him from time to time no wonder he found difficulty in defending what had been uttered previously from his own side of the centre table. In the few minutes available to me I want to explore only one objective fact apart from personalities and to put it in an historical context. On the three occasions since the middle 1950s that the Soviet Union has invaded another country Leaders of the Opposition have explained the Soviet action in terms of supposed faults of the West. I remind the House that when the Soviet Union went into Hungary Dr Evatt defended it. He said the position was contributed to significantly by the British and the French action in terms of Suez. The pattern is very significant for the House. The invasion of Czechoslovakia was defended because of the American presence in South Vietnam. On the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald of & January 1980, a report by Andrew Kruger states that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) unhappily said that it was as immoral for the Soviet Union to be in Afghanistan as it was for the Australians and the Americans to be in South Vietnam. The constant feature of those three statements of truth is that every one would have been welcomed by the Soviet Ambassador either in London, Washington or Canberra because every one of those Soviet actions has received some justification from the Opposition on account of supposed force by the West.

442,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m. the debate is interrupted. The House stands adI can journed until 2.15 p.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following papers were deemed to have should been presented on 26 February 1980, pursuant to statute: Commonwealth Banks Act-Appointmen t certificatesP. J. Costigan, N. N. Dixon. Defence Act-Determination-1980-Seria l No. 2Southern Rhodesia Allowance. Lands Acquisition Act-Statemen t of lands acquired by agreement authorized under sub-section 7(1). The following answers to questions were circulated: Mr Dawkins asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 February 1979: (1) Did the Attorney-General receive a letter from Mr John Doohan of 21 Banlett Street, Willagee, Western Australia, dated 28 November 1977. (2) If so, did the letter contain advice to the effect that on or about 7 September 1977 Mr Doohan was interviewed at his home by Detective Sergeant Stanton of the Commonwealth PoUce concerning Mr Doohan's attitude to uranium mining when the stated duty of Detective Sergeant Stanton concerned an alleged offence by another party against sections of the Crimes Act as they relate to the Australian Postal Commission or other Commonwealth body. (3) If the position is as stated, will the Attorney-General state (a) whether Detective Sergeant Stanton officially ascertained Mr Doohan's attitudes to the mining of uranium; if so, under what authority, (b) whether Mr Doohan's attitude to the mining of uranium is monwealth security or law enforcement organisation and (c) what action he has taken regarding the allegations concerning offences against the Crimes Act as they relate to the Australian Postal Commission or other Commonwealth body.",75
443,Mr VINER ,PAPERS,"The Attorney-General has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Mr Doohan's letter did contain advice to the effect that Mr Doohan was interviewed at his home by Detective Sergeant Stanton on or about 7 September 1977. However, the letter does not accurately record the circumstances ofhis interview with Detective Sergeant Stanton. Mr Doohan was interviewed at his request in respect of information allegedly held by him in relation to a certain group. His attitude to uranium mining emerged as part of the general conversation. (3) (a) See answer to (2). (b) Mr Doohan's attitude to uranium mining is recorded in Detective Sergeant Stanton's report of interview. That report has not been made available to any security or other law enforcement organisation. (c) No action has been taken as no offence has been disclosed. Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 March 1979: (1) What is the mechanism by which phone tapping may be authorised by (a) the Commonwealth and (b) the States. (2) How many authorisations were obtained in each year since 1970. (3) How many (a) Commonwealth and (b) State parliamentarians were amongst those whose phones were tapped during each of those years. (4) How many phone tappings are authorised at present. NA Mr John Doohan Mr VINER - The Attorney-General has pro(Question No. 3260) vided the following answers to the honourable member's question: (1) The High Coun decision in MUler v. MUler (1978)53 ALIR established that the Commonwealth Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960 covers the field as regards the interception of telephonic communications passing over the telephone system. Provision is made in that Act for the Attorney-General, when requested by the Director General of Security, to issue a warrant authorising the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to intercept communications passing over the telephone system if he is satisfied that(a) the telephone service is being or is likely to be(i) used by a person engaged in, or reasonably suspected by the Director-General of Security of being engaged in, or of being likely to engage in, activities prejudicial to the security of the Commonwealth; or (ii) used for purposes prejudicial to the security of the Commonwealth; and a matter of record with any Com(b) the interception by the Organisation of Communications passing to, from or over the telephone service will, or is likely to, assist the Organisation in carrying out its function of obtaining intelligence relevant to the security of the Commonwealth. In emergency circumstances the Director-General of Security may authorise the interception of communications. There is no provision in the Act that would permit the States to intercept telephone communications passing over the telephone system. I am not aware of any State law purporting to permit such action. The Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960 will be replaced by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 when that Act enters into force. (2) , (3) and (4) In accordance with the general practice of successive Governments, I do not propose to provide information concerning the operations of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Airbus Aircraft (Question No. 5107) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 20 November 1979: (1) Has the Government approved the purchase of Airbus Telephone Tapping A-300 aircraft by TAA. (Question No. 3435) (2) Is the noise level of these aircraft, as perceived by residents living close to an airpon, less than that from existing aircraft. (3) By what factor is the noise level of the Airbus A-300 different from that of existing domestic jet aircraft. (4) Is it anticipated that more or lessflightsinto Adelaide will be required if these aircraft are introduced-if so, how many. (5) If these aircraft are to be introduced on regular flights, what changes will need to be made to the (a) runway and navigation aids at Adelaide Airpon and (b) Adelaide Airpon terminal (e.g. baggage handling facilities, departure lounges, and ticket booking areas) in view of the larger number of passengers who will travel on any one flight of these new aircraft. (6) When will these changes be made. (7) Has the Government decided on a site and bought land for a future airpon for Adelaide.",76
444,Mr HUNT ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Yes. (3) The effective perceived noise level of the A300B series aircrafi, as compared with that of the Boeing 727-200 and MCDonnell-Douglas DC9-30 aircraft of the domestic airlines, is on take-off 12 decibels lower than the DC9; and on approach 1 decibel lower than the B727-200 and 8 decibels lower than the DC9. A reduction is normally perceived to be about half as loud. (4) In the event of TAA operating Airbus services to Adelaide I would anticipate some reduction in frequency particularly during peak hours. Although matters associated with schedules planning are primarily for the airUne itself based upon its assessment of market requirement. (5) (a) The existing length of the main runway does not permit desired maximum payload operations from Adelaide to Penh by B727-200 aircraft. Plans are in hand to extend this runway (for the B727 operations) to the maximum obtainable length within the aerodrome boundary. Introduction of A300B4 aircraft will not alter these plans. Pavement strength of the runway is adequate for A300B4 operations but taxiways and apron require strengthening and taxiway intersections would need to be widened. No changes are foreseen to the navigation aids at Adelaide as it already has standard aids which are in use at all capitals. The airlines should ensure that any aircraft may buy are fitted to use these standard aids. (b) Modifications will be required to ticketing and baggage claim areas at an approximate cost of around $250,000 per airline for these facUities. (6) Timing will be such as operating dates with due consideration of resource constraints. Commencement of runway extensions is planned for 1981. Taxiway, apron and terminal works are not yet programmed but would be planned for completion by 1983. (7) The Government has neither purchased land nor decided on a specific site for a future airpon for Adelaide. Following the recommendations of the Joint Governments Advisory Committee on Adelaide's Airline-Airport Requirements, my Department is evaluating sites for a major airport in the Two Wells/Virginia area. National Railway Network Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 21 November 1979: (1) What specific projects have been approved for funding under the National Railway Network (Financial Assistance) Act 1979. (2) What funds are to be allocated to each project by the Australian Government and the relevant State Government or raUway authority. (3) When is each project scheduled for completion. (4) What benefits by way of increased Une capacity or reduced operating costs are expected to flow from each project. (5) What are the terms and conditions of repayment of Commonwealth repayable grants for each project.",77
445,Mr HUNT ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The approved projects are: New South WalesGoulburn signalling project Junee-Albury Centralised Traffic Control and Crossing Loops project Telarah-Taree Centralised Traffic Control project VictoriaSouth Dynon Container Terminal project Ararat-Serviceton Centralised Traffic Control and Crossing Loops project of 10 decibels in noise level QueenslandAcacia Ridge-Termina l Facilities project Caboolture-Gympie Centralised Traffic Control Western AustraliaKwinana-Mundijong Track Upgrading project (2) and (3) Under an Agreement concluded with Queensland on 15 November 1979, Commonwealth financial assistance in respect of the projects to be assisted shall not exceed: Acacia Ridge Terminal Facilities project- $ 11.15m Caboolture-Gympie CTC-S9.10m It is anticipated that works on these projects will be carried out prior to conclusion of the present Agreement. Funding allocations and completion dates for projects in they New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia cannot be specified as Agreements have not yet been concluded with these States. It is however, the Commonwealth's intention to fund 100 per cent of the agreed cost of each project to be assisted. to fit in with expected regular (4) The mainline upgrading program represents one part of joint Commonwealth/State efforts to upgrade strategic sections owned and operated by the States of the national raU network. Following consideration of mainline upgrading projects by the Board of the Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation, the Chairman of ARRDO recommended a program of works. The projects were approved for assistance in accordance with that advice. The types of projects approved for assistance have been evaluated in studies carried out by the States and the Bureau of Transport Economics. Typically, the benefits identified in the studies include (Question No. 5146) rates of return on investment in excess of 20 per cent and in some instances up to 45 per cent, with benefit cost ratios of 2:1 or better. As an example of the benefits which could accrue, the BTE's report-'Mainlin e Upgrading-Evaluatio n of a Range of Options for the Melbourne-Sydney RaU Link' suggested that upgrading had the potential to increase rail traffic from 17 trains of 800 tonnes per day to 25 trains of 1100 tonnes per day including 16 fast express trains compared to 8 at present. Similar benefits from improvements in services have been demonstrated in the other studies. (5) The interest rate for the projects in Queensland mentioned in (2) and (3) will be the private treaty semi-government rate. Repayments of capital are to be made over a fifteen year period commencing June 1984. Aboriginal Affairs: Official Openings of Projects",77
446,Mr LES JOHNSON ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 22 November 1979: (1) In respect of oflicial openings of projects which received Federal Government funding which (a) local Federal Government Member, (b) local Federal Opposition Member, (c) Government Senator or (d) Opposition Senator officially represented the Minister since December 1975. (2) On which occasions were Government cheques handed over.",78
447,Mr VINER ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) Formal records have not been maintained in respect of the occasions to which the honourable member refers.

Canberra Housing Statistics (Question No. 5248) Mr Innes asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 22 November 1979: (1) How many (a) Government and (b) private houses were built in Canberra before (i) 1945, (ii) 1940, (iii) 1935 and(iv) 1930. (2) How many of each of those houses remain and how many have been demolished in the last 5 years. (3) How many of the remaining houses in each category are on blocks zoned for redevelopment. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information sought is not readily available from the Department's records or other sources and I could not justify at this time directing staff resources away from other important work to assemble this information. However, if the honourable member has particular houses in mind I would be pleased to try and provide a response.",78
