3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF LORD CASEY," Mr Speaker, Richard Gardiner Casey died on 17 June. In the history of our country few men have attracted, or earned, the respect due and paid to Lord Casey. Not only was his public contribution one of great distinction and lasting value; he was also a man of integrity and enormous common sense. He was the kind of man who imparted stature to the institutions he served. The Australian people can count themselves immensely fortunate to have had him as a servant over such a long period. When I became a member of this Parliament in 1955 I found that Dick Casey was always prepared to Usten and to help. One of his great qualities was that he was always prepared to assist younger people and to share his experience with them. I first came to know R. G. Casey through my family. He and my father were close friends over many years. They grew up together and they went to school and university together. I recall that they were both interested in automobiles, a part of history that might not be widely known. Lord Casey was an engineer by training, and proud ofit. He wanted to understand how things worked and why. He always believed that the more engineers in Parliament the better it would be. At one stage my father and he became interested in a new engine designed by A. G. M. Michell. I am advised that at the time there were discussions about the engine with 2 major American firms but unfortunately, even though apparently the engine went very close to being sold to one of those firms, the sale did not quite come off. The Depression hit immediately afterwards, and that was the end of a radical new design motor. It was typical of Lord Casey that he would try to help someone with a good idea. They attempted to promote the engine. They were unsuccessful. One of Lord Casey's most impressive characteristics was his immense capacity fbr work. His industry was remarkable, and it was this extraordinary application that enabled him to undertake so many careers in the course ofhis lifetime. He was, at one time or another, a soldier, an administrator, a politician, a diplomat and a ViceRegal personage. In all of these careers he served with conspicuous success. In 1914 he volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force and served with distinction at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. He was mentioned in dispatches, and for his valour he won the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross. From 1924 to 1931 he served his country in the External Affairs Department as Australian political liaison officer in London. His political career commenced in 1931 when he became a member of this House for the seat of Corio, a seat he held until his first resignation from the Parliament in 1940. During the period of the great Depression he served in several portfolios. He was Assistant Federal Treasurer from 1933 to 1935 and Federal Treasurer from 1935 to 1939. As Treasurer he took an active role in the development of a national insurance scheme which, for reasons beyond his control, was never implemented. From 1937 to 1939 he was Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-a n association he continued after the war and through his retirement and one of great lasting benefit to that organisation and to the nation. Lord Casey was a Liberal in the full sense. He was a man of progressive instincts, not fearful of change. He welcomed the challenge of a new circumstance, a new job. He was often ahead ofhis time and keen to play a part in defining a new role for his country. He represented Australia to the world in a critical period of our history. In 1940 Lord Casey resigned from the Parliament to become the first Australian Minister to Washington. He used his great energies in making sure that Australia's position was well known to the American Administration and the President of the time, Mr Roosevelt. In 1942 at the request of the British Prime Minister, the late Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Casey assumed the position of Minister of State for the Middle East and had the rank of Cabinet Minister in the British War Cabinet. Speaking in the early part of this decade about the controversy that surrounded his acceptance of such a post, he remarked that such an appointment in the Middle East was far more important than the post he had left in Washington. He appreciated the need for Australia to recognise that its security depended on events in a number of areas of the world. In 1943 he took up his first Vice-Regal position as Governor of Bengal. During his time there from 1943 to 1946 he experienced at first hand contacts with leaders of the Indian nation which would stand him in good stead when he assumed responsibility for Australia's foreign policy. In 1949, in that vital election for Australia's future, Lord Casey returned to active pohtics as the representative for the seat of La Trobe. He held the seat until his retirement from politics in 1960. In 2 tasks which he undertook following the 1949 election he showed again the importance he placed on looking to the future and his concern that Australia should develop into a strong outward looking and tolerant nadon. Immediately after the elecuon he became Minister for Works and Housmg and continued his involvement with the CSIRO, being Minister in charge from 1950 to 1960. It was in 1951 that he became Minister for External Affairs and he held the post until his retirement. Looking ahead as always, he worked to establish a new set of relationships with the countries of our region. His permanent head at the time has recently recorded that Lord Casey's statements during his visit to Japan in 1951 marked thefirstreal movement from enmity to close co-operation between Australia and Japan. He appreciated the great significance of Australia's locadon close to the new states emerging in Asia and moved rapidly to expand our representation in the region. Earlier than most, he foresaw the importance of bringing China into the internauonal community. He was always a realist about the world and never feared to see facts as they were. His advice was wise, his judgment sound. Lord Casey's career showed that deep patriotism could be combined with an outward-looking and humane international perspective. In 1965 he assumed a post for which he was superbly equipped-the Governor-Generalship. He had much of value to say. He used the position to dignify Australia and to symbolise the standards of public and private behaviour we all should strive to achieve. In his life he was assisted at all umes by his wife, Lady Casey- a remarkable woman in her own right. She was to him, in all of his careers, a great comfort and a point of courage. This was exemplified by her devoted action of daily attendance at his hospital bed after his serious motor accident in 1974. Richard Gardiner Casey upheld the highest standards of pubhc life and in his private life was unfailingly generous and kindly. What he achieved he earned by his industry, his courage, his integrity and his humanity. He loved Australia, and because of his life we have a better sense of ourselves and what we can become. To Lady Casey and to her son and daughter I extend, on behalf of the Government, my deepest sympathy at the loss of a husband and a father. Australia has lost a devoted servant. I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the 17 June 1976 of the Right Honourable Lord Casey, Baron Berwick, Victoria, and of the City of Westminster, England, K.G., P.C, G.C.M.G., C.H., D.S.O., M.C, ICSU., a Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia 1965 to 1969, a member of this House from 1931 to 1940 and from 1949 to 1960, and a Minister of the Crown 1935 to 1940 and from 1949 to 1960; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, I support the motion. Lord Casey was a man of the greatest distinction and the highest distinctions. He was the most far-sighted and accomplished Liberal Foreign Minister Australia has produced in the post-war era and one of the most eminent Australians ofhis generation. He had a greater international reputation than many British contemporaries. He was better known in imperial and global councils than many fellow Australians who were toriseto higher office in his own country. In 1969 the Queen made him a Knight of the Garter, the highest honour she can award on her own initiative and the most ancient secular honour still awarded in the world. He was the 936th knight in over 6 centuries. He was a man of unquestionable integrity, high principle, singular urbanity and personal charm, with valuable gifts as a diplomat and politician. No criticism one could make of him, even on this occasion, can alter our judgment of him as a great Australian. Indeed, it would do sUght service to the memory of a man of such attainment if the shortcomings of his career or any Umitations in his vision or judgment were glossed over in perfunctory tributes. His career had 3 main phases-that of the war and post-war years, then as Foreign Minister and finally as Governor General. The first prepared him for the second, and the third was a reward for the other two. His 4 years as Treasurer, his membership of the British War Cabinet and his war service as Governor of Bengal equipped him with an all-round experience of political and administrative office which was probably unrivalled in this country. If he seemed a trifle out of touch and a trifle out of place in the Australian Parliament, there was no denying his capacity or experience. He was one of the first Australian statesmen to recognise the importance of Asia to Australia. His great achievement during his 9 years as Foreign Minister from 1951 to 1960 was to establish deep and lasting goodwill between Australia and Asian countries- a foundation of death on friendship which was happUy to survive the of stresses placed upon it throughout the 1960s and even, one fears, beyond. He had a regard, almost former a love, for Asians which was free of sentimenfrom taUty and rooted in a knowledge of their history from and the diverse cultures of the region. He was the most creative and far-sighted of the Liberals who have been responsible for in foreign affairs. Even in the Cold War atmosphere of the 1950s, when the post of Foreign Minister ought to have brought out the worse maintained a characteristic dignity and restraint. He at least shook hands with Chou En-lai at Geneva. He foresaw and strongly opposed the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. He was years ahead of his fellow Australian conservamaybe tives in urging recognition of China. One's chief regret must be that, for all the correctness and enlightenment ofhis views, there was something lacking in his ability to carry them through and embody them in national policy. The acute sense of lost opportunity one feels on reading his ies was due perhaps to the realities of party tics in his day and the ascendancy of other more determined men around him. We must wonder what influence he might have brought to bear on the course of events and the tragic policy decareer cisions that were to follow his departure from government. Looking back, it is astonishing that not 1965 could the Liberals bring themselves appoint an Austrahan to the nation's highest titular office. Lord Casey was the appointed Governor General by the non-Labor parties. Labor governments had already appointed two, both of whom had filled the post with rectitude and distinction. When the Liberals did get around to choosing an Australian they opted for a party man. Lord Casey, like his cessor, was transferred direct from a Liberal sustained. Cabinet to Yarralumla. But any misgivings this might have occasioned were rapidly removed by the qualities he brought to the office. He filled post admirably. He received me manytimesas Leader of the Opposition. I was grateful for courtesies he showed me then and I am grateful for the notes he sent me in succeeding years. He was a man singularly punctilious and courteous. had been asked to write a review of his diaries. Some of my comments were somewhat sharp, tinguished but I received a handwritten note from him aclicly knowledging many of the points and thanking me for the care with which I had reviewed his book. He enjoyed the respect and affection of the whole community. For all that, however, his noon, term as Governor General was not entirely free of controversy. The choice of a successor to soldier, Prime Minister Holt in 1967 was a considerable test of his vice-regal judgment. The last person he called to Yarralumla was the Deputy Leader of the senior coahtion partner. It is the only example of questionable vice-regal all this country for which a precedent can be found the actions of the monarch herself, for in 1963 the Queen chose Sir Alec Douglas-Home to succeed Mr Harold Macmillan when she might have in a man, he chosen Mr R. A. Butler. Lord Casey's death removes one of the most colourful and distinguished Australians in our experience. He was one of the few engineersthe only engineer-to be elected to this Parliament. He retained to the end of his life an expert acquaintance with and interest in all engineering, scientific and technical matters. There were manyfirststo his credit-th efirstAustralian overseas diplomat, Uaison officer to London, diarMinister to Washington; the first Australian to poliserve as Minister in a British government; the first Australian to be a colonial governor; the first Commonwealth Ufe peer. He had fought at Gallipoli. He became an audacious flyer. It is a not likely to be repeated in ourtimefor it belongs essentially to another age. Yet the best things about Lord Casey would be valued in any age and his achievements will be of lasting until importance. He was above aU and in the best to sense of the word a man of fundamental and first Australian abiding decency. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I extend to Lady Casey-hersel f a figure of public distinction and high personal qualities-and to the members of her family our deep sympathy in sucthe loss which they and the nation have",23
4,Mr SINCLAIR,DEATH OF LORD CASEY,"On behalf of the National Country Party I should Uke to associate the the members of that Party in the motion of condolence to the Lady Casey and to the family of the late Lord Casey. In his many distinctions and deI grees, the contributions which the late Lord Casey made throughout his long and discareer were very effectively and pubacknowledged. There were three particular Ufe phases which those of us who knew him well saw and respected. The first was of course his career. In the career outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) this afterthere is an array of distinctions which fe.w in Australia have attained-as an engineer, as a as a poUtician, as a diplomat, as a Minister, as Governor of Bengal and finally, as Governor General of Australia. He, of course, represented not just Australia but ordinary people in a way that few other Australians have conduct in been able to do. But it was not just in his career that he achieved such distinction. I think that all of us who knew him as a citizen respected him as one who had a continuing interest in the community around him. In his correspondence with those of us with whom he was associated even in the slightest way, he demonstrated a continuing interest in the world around him even in retirement. He was a man who retained not only a personal interest but one which was significant in the depth of its understanding. So often, having made a statement or a commitment on behalf of the Government, I found-and I know many of my colleagues found-that we would receive a letter from the late Lord Casey commenting upon that decision, sometimes asking for the reasons for it or explaining that he had some alternative point of view, and perhaps presenting it for consideration. I tliink it was the extent to which he, unlike so many others, maintained a diary that provided an opportunity to see something of that very important period of development of Australia at an intimate level. I certainly admired the way in which he recorded for posterity some of the events in which he was a principal party. He wrote of those events with a measure of personal insight and understanding that few others enjoy. It is of course through his diaries that so many others are able to share in something of the achievement ofhis own personal life. Sofirsdyin his career and then as a citizen he achieved great distinction. Finally and most importantly I think we all remember him as a man. He and the Lady Maie represented one of thefinestfamilies with which I have personally been associated. They were very close to each other and whatever their activities, whether it was flying aeroplanes or driving fast cars or in the more personal and deeper things in their association in public life, they retained a companionship that I think is something upon which all of us might reflect which might well serve as a continuing example to so many future generations of Australians. He was a man admired by all who knew him. They, normal as a couple-the Lady Maie and the late Lord tribute to Casey-se t afineexample. It is with a deep feelParUamentLord ing of humility that I , personally and on behalf of represent part ofan electorate the National Country Party, should extend to the Lady Maie and her family our tribelectorate I found that there wasI went ute to a great Australian and one whose loss be sadly felt.",25
5,Mr SCHOLES,DEATH OF LORD CASEY,"Briefly, I should like to associate myself and the electorate I represent with the resolution moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Lord Casey entered this ParUamentfirstas the member for Corio in 1931, having defeated Arthur Lewis whose death preceded that of Lord Casey by about 12 months. He served the electorate of Corio well and I know that he is well thought of by those who remember his period as member for that electorate. He resigned in 1940 to take a diplomatic post and was succeeded by John Dedman who also died about 12 months ago. He was the first representative of the electorate of Corio to hold ministerial rank in this Parliament. The 2 members who succeeded him also rose to similar rank. His career was one at which most people would look in wonderment. In different circumstances he almost certainly would have served as Prime Minister. That he left the Parliament when he did most likely changed the course of Australia's poltiical history. I think it is fair to say that had he stayed he almost certainly would have been Prime Minister and in all probability the change of government in 1941 would not have taken place. I associate myself with this motion. I think that in any era there are men who serve their nation in a manner which is unique and Lord Casey was one of those men.",26
6,Mr YATES,DEATH OF LORD CASEY," Mr Speaker, Lord Casey, Baron of Berwick, Uved in the electorate of Holt, which I represent, and he too served 2 governments and 2 parUaments. He also served in the War Cabinet. I realise that the electors of Holt would like me to say on their behalf today that the loss of Lord Casey to the Australian Parliament, to this nation and to world affairs has been a tragedy. He was perhaps one of the greatest statesmen, ahead ofhis time, that the world has ever seen, and we were very fortunate, both here and in Westminster, to have a man with such foresight so shortly after the war. As he Uved in the electorate of Holt, on behalf of the people of that electorate I would like to express to Lady Casey and her family our sense of loss and our and respect for one of Australia's finest and most famous men and certainly a world diplomat.",26
7,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF LORD CASEY,"I am going to transgress the forms of the House to pay a personal Casey. I became a member of in 19SS, after a redistribution, to which Dick Casey like to had formerly represented. When into the an immense will feeling of personal warmth for the man. I remember that soon after I was elected I said to him: ' Sir, what shall I call you?' He said to me: 'Billy, when you feel comfortable to do so you will call me Dick'. It was not long before I did so because of the warmth of the man. He was a great Australian, but he was also a tremendous man. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",26
8,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF LORD CASEY,I thank the House. NA,27
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATHS OF FORMER SENATORS AND," Mr Speaker, honourable members will be saddened to know of the recent deaths of Thomas Louis Bull, OBE., a former Senator for the State of New South Wales, William Edward Aylett, a former Senator for the State of Tasmania, George Irvine Whiteside, a former Senator for the State of Queensland, and Laurence John Failes, a former member of this House for the electorate of Lawson. Senator Bull had a deep personal understanding of the problems of the people who live in rural Australia. Through this understanding he was able to make a contribution of great value, not only to his work in this place, but also to the organisations and bodies on which he served. In the Senate Senator Bull was an active member of committees, joining the Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes in 1967 and serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee from 1965 to 1971. He became Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade. Senator Bull had a considerable knowledge of the workings of the Parliament and after serving as a Temporary Chairman of Committees for some time in 1969 he was elected Chairman of Committees and Deputy President of the Senate. Senator Bull left the Senate in 1971, but this in no way ended his involvement iri public Ufe. In 1973 he became Chairman of the Riverina Advisory Council and in 1974 Chairman of the New South Wales Pastures Protection Board Committee of Inquiry. Senator BuU is survived by his wife Jessie and 2 sons and 2 daughters. I am sure that all members will join me in extending sympathy to his family. Senator WilUam Edward Aylett was born in Tasmama in 1900. He died on 10 August this year. He left school in 1916 to work at Mount Bischoff tin mine on the west coast of Tasmama to help to support his family. Later he worked in the coal mining and timber industries in Victoria. He returned to Tasmania in 1925 where he became a farmer and became actively involved in the Labor movement. He was elected to the Senate in 1937. Senator Aylett served for many years as a Temporary Chairman of Committees. He was a member of the Joint House Committee, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the ParUamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. After leaving the Senate in 1965 he continued in public Ufe, becoming President of the United Council of Progress Associations of the Gold Coast City from 1969 to 1970. MEMBER Former Senator Whiteside, who died on 27 July, was chosen by the Parliament of Queensland to represent that State in the Senate on 9 October 1962. He remained in the Senate until 29 November 1963. Before entering the Senate, former Senator Whiteside had a long record of service to the union movement and to the Australian Labor Party. His Party posts included the presidency of the Queensland Central Australian Labor Party Executive. He was a Queensland delegate to the Federal Australian Labor Party Executive and Chairman of the Labor Broadcasting Station Pty Ltd. In addition he was secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association. Laurence John Failes was elected to this chamber in 1949 as member for Lawson. I know that honourable members will be greatly saddened to hear of his death on 7 July. Like Senator BuU, he had a deep knowledge of rural affairs which he used to good effect during his long term in this House, retiring in 1969. During his time as a member of this House he served on the Joint ParUamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, was a member of the House Committee and was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from 18 February 1959. I am sure that all honourable members will join with me in extending sympathy to his family. I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the deaths of Thomas Louis Bull, OBE., a former senator for the State of New South Wales; WilUam Edward Aylett, a former senator for the State of Tasmania; George Irvine Whiteside, a former senator for the State of Queensland; and Mr Laurence John Failes, a former member of this House for the electorate of Lawson; places on record its appreciauon of their long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to their famUies in their bereavement. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- I support the motion. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has already given the detaUs of the parliamentary service of our four former colleagues and also an indication of the range of interests which they had before they came into the Parliament, during their service and afterwards. He has thereby indicated the qualifications which made each of them in his way a valuable member of this Parliament. Very many people here would not have known some of the men concerned, because at the time Senators Aylett and Whiteside left the Parliament only one in seven of the present members of the Senate and only one in five of the present members of the House of Representatives were in the Parliament. Senator Aylett served for 2 7 years, which is a very long period parliamentary terms. Only the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) and Senator O'Byrne of the present members of this Parliament have served longer. Of the people mentioned in the motion, some were known well to honourable members; some were known only for a short time. I first met Laurie Failes, for instance, during the war at Gove-Nhulunbu y as it now is-whe n we were both serving in the Air Force. On subsequent occasions, ofcourse, I was able to meet him in electorate of Lawson, for which he was the first and only member. The electorate was created him; it expired when he retired. Senator Aylett was first elected to the Parliarepresented ment in 1938. It was a remarkable year. Labor won five of the 6 Australian States in and Senator Aylett, it will be recalled, entered the Parliament together with Senators Amour, Armstrong, Arthur and Ashley and others whose names began with letters lower in the alphabet. Senator Whiteside was here for the shortest period-barel y a year. He was appointed by the Parliament of Queensland to succeed a deceased Labor senator at a time when it was customary fill casual Senate vacancies with persons of same political party as that of the former senator. All our former colleagues served not only in the Parliament but also outside. My own colleagues have told me of the way they appreciated Senawas tor Bull's term, his actions and his conduct Chairman of Committees and Deputy President of the Senate and as chairman of 2 committees and a colleague on other Senate committees. sentiments which the Prime Minister has exfarmer. pressed on behalf of the House to the relatives our former colleagues I am certain are supported by all members. Many of us were associated with them outside the Parliament. Some few of us, minority, were associated with all of them. mourn them and we sympathise with their relafamily. tives in their loss.",27
10,Mr SINCLAIR,DEATHS OF FORMER SENATORS AND," I should like to associate members of the National Country Party of Whiteside. Australia with the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). particular I should like to express to the families of the late Senator Bull and the former member for Lawson, the late Mr Laurie Failes, my own personal sympathy. Both of these men, in their association with my Party, had a long and continuing connection with the rural industries. Tom Bull championed a cause which I think in this Parliament is best known and expressed by the in honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly). Indeed, while a senator within the Parliament on many occasions he found himself in some opposition to the former Leader of my Party, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Mmister for Trade and Industry, whose policies on tariff matters tended to be somewhat contrary to those which the late Senator Bull preferred. Senator Bull in fact, in his association with the grazing industry, first expressed concern about the extent to which there was a change in the structure of the Australian economy which expon industries and his those associated with them might find it hard to survive. Of course, on many occasions in the Parfor liament he gave voice to those concerns and in his attitudes and in his practice always upheld strongly support for the cause which he and in which he believed so strongly. To both his widow and his family I should like to the Senate extend my own personal sympathy. Laurie Failes, the former member for Lawson-and the only member for Lawson, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has stated-wa s another whose connection with the rural industries began his interest in politics. to Through the war years he served with the Royal the Australian Air Force. On coming out of the Air Force he felt concern at the direction of the economic policies of the government of the day. I am interested to hear that the electorate of Lawson created for him. Of course, it was created by as a Labor government and won by a member of the Country Party, Laurie Failes, and held by him throughout thetimethat that seat remained. The Laurie Failes was a sheep farmer and wheat He was associated with the development of of a part of our rural sector which again has come under some pressure in recent years. He was a forceful and vocal exponent of the cause of those a he represented. On behalf of the members of my We Party I extend deep sympathy to his widow and Similarly, on behalf of the members of my Party I extend sympathy to the families of the the former Senator Aylett and former Senator They were 2 men who, in their association with the Australian Labor Party and with In the Parliament, represented effectively the causes in which they believed. During the term when they were members of this Parliament they spoke, of course, about those issues with which they were associated. To their families I extend my deepest sympathy and also express an understanding of the traumas that parliamentary life imposes on the families of all members of this place, irrespective of the parties to which they belong. I think that motions of this sort give us an opportunity to say to those who, outside the Parliament, so often in our absence assist in meeting our electorate commitments how much we appreciate the way in which they carry that burden. In offering our condolences to the families of these former members of this Parliament, I think it is worth remembering those responsibilities, the way they are borne and, of course, the loneliness of frequent separation. In extending our condolences to the families of those who were former members, I think it is also worth expressing thanks to those of our own families who also bear those burdens.",28
11,Mr SULLIVAN,DEATHS OF FORMER SENATORS AND,"I should very much like to associate my electorate of Riverina with this motion and to be associated with it personally. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Sinclair) in the fine tributes that have been made about the former senator, the late Tom Bull. I find difficulty in expressing adequately my thoughts as I have lost a special friend. In the circumstances, words will not properly convey my real feelings. Tom Bull was a man of unquestioned integrity. He was a country man and knew the country extremely well. He loved the country and he loved his country. He was a man of God. He was a man who accepted responsibility and he was a man of principle. He was a man who contributed in countless ways to the community. He was, indeed, a leader in every sense of the word. I remember him and I thank him for his friendship, for his wise counsel and for his personal help. He nominated me for preselection by the National Country Party for the seat of Riverina. He was my campaign manager during the recent December 1975 election. I am thericherfor having known him and I am indebted to him but, sadly, it is a debt that must now remain unpaid. Tom Bull and I joked many times about the fact that we had both begun our formal education in a little country, one-teacher, 14-pupil school at a place called Gobbagaula. The school has long since been closed and demolished but I often think that if such schools could produce men like Tom Bull they must have been grand institutions. Tom Bull was always a devoted husband and father. In a world of changing values his family was and is a shining example of all those good things we speak about whenever we refer to the family as the basic unit of society. He was happiest when home with his wife, his sons, his daughters and his beautiful grandchildren. It is because of this wonderful family unity and spirit that I know how much he will be missed by his loved ones. Narrandera, the Riverina and Australia have lost a great man. We are all poorer for his passing. I join with other honourable members in expressing sincere sympathy to his wife and family.

15,Mr LYNCH,DEATHS OF FORMER SENATORS AND,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1976-77. When this Government was elected on 13 December last, Australia was in bad shape. Inflation was out of hand, economic activity was falling again and unemployment had risen to record levels. The Government immediately set about the enormous task of repairing the damage and restoring confidence. Recovery is now getting under way. The private sector is growing again and confidence is gradually returning. This Budget will aid that recovery and rebuild confidence further. It will do so in part by putting an end to permissiveness in government spending and turning back the recent trend towards bigger and bigger government. At the same time it will build further on the social reforms of 20 May so as to assist the most needy in our community. It is a Budget for confidence; it is also a Budget for reform. NA When this Government came to office, Australia was still locked in its most serious postwar recession. That quite unnecessary calamity was the product of three years ofLabor Government. The major distortions which that Government imparted to the economy in 1974 and 1975 had become deep-rooted obstacles to a return to full employment. The economy had been shaken to its foundations. The unfolding of economic conditions over the past eighteen months or so is detailed in Statement No. 2 attached to this Speech. Here I mention only a few facts. They are facts which clearly bring out the huge gulf which had opened up, by the time we came to office, between conditions in the economy that all Australians are entitled to expect and conditions as we actually found them. At the end of 1975, the private sector was employing no more people than it had been three years earlier, although over that period the labour force had expanded by about 370 000. Unemployment had risen to a level unheard of in this country since the Depression of the 1930s. Gross non-farm product in the December quarter, seasonally adjusted and at constant prices, was still almost 5 per cent below its peak level recorded two years earlier. The farm sector was in a state of collapse. The share of company profits in national income-on e of the flywheels of our whole economic system-remaine d depressed at around three-quarters of its long-run norm. Real business fixed investment fell in the December quarter to its lowest level for almost three years. The Consumer Price Index in the December quarter was 14.0 per cent above a year earher. Above all, inflation showed no real prospect of a sustained move down. This was the economic legacy which we inherited. The human reflection of these dry economic facts was to be seen in the devastation of the lives of ordinary people which those events had wrought. I mention as one instance the catastrophic impact which the careering inflauon of those three years has had upon the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who had thought that savings accumulated by the thrift and industry of their working lives would help to protect thenlater years; and who now find the real value of those savings cut toribbonsby the great inflauon which the Government of that day induced and over which it so wantonly presided. I mention also the personal tragedies of school-leavers and other young people, and of disadvantaged groups in the community such as Aborigines, who have been denied jobs by the policies of those three years. Given this economic legacy there could be no rapid return to normality. On the contrary, restoring the economy was certain to be a protracted task. Before the election we said it would take a full three-year term. The Government quickly put in hand a coherent strategy involving all the main arms of economic policy. Initial measures to control government expenditures were taken as early as December and followed up by further measures in February. Meanwhile, in January, major monetary measures were undertaken to drain off some part of the excessive Uquidity build-up of 1975. Since that time, especially during the seasonally tight June quarter, monetary policy has been operated flexibly-bu t always with a view to bearing down against current inflationary pressures while maintaining the capcacity of the financial system to underwrite recovery in the private sector. We had earlier made clear that, contrary to views in some quarters, we had no intention of depreciating the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. In February the Commonwealth sought to bring home to the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission that fuU wage indexation, by locking the economy into double digit inflation and a disaster level of business profitability, ran completely counter to hopes of a sustained economic recovery and a return to full employment. This fundamental truth was initially not widely understood. Since then, however, it has increasingly gained understanding and acceptance in the community. The full scale review of expenditures which, at the outset, we had put in hand culminated in my statement on Fiscal Policy Decisions of 20 May. In that statement. I announced a sharp reduction in the rate of growth of expenditures previously in prospect for 1976-77. At the same time. I announced the introduction of full personal tax indexation and significant improvements in the manner of assisting families and to Medibank. As we have stressed from the outset, we have made our first priority the absolute necessity to combat inflation. We have done so not merely because of the direct hardships that mflation obviously brings, but because unless we can brake inflation we shall not succeed in restoring full employment. Against that background, I come to the present situation. The economy is now showing signs of progress. Typical of the early recovery stage in the economic cycle, the areas of strength are still scattered. Much of the early impetus to recovery has come from a cessation of the stock rundown which had continued heavily throughout 1975, and from continued strengthening in exports. More recently, however, private consumption expenditure has begun to grow. In the business sector also there are early signs of confidence regenerating. Some healthy gains in capital spending on plant and equipment have already occurred. The key question hanging over the future course of the recovery is whether the main components of private demand-consumptio n and business investment-wil l firmly join stocks and exports in building a continuing recovery. If they do not, that recovery will falter and expire. Another key question concerns the extent to which the growth in demand will be met from imports and so not be translated into local production and local jobs. The recovery will be threatened if rising demand is associated with a too strongly rising tendency to import. The need to qualify answers to these questions indicates that the economy still lacks a fully assured foundation for recovery. When one asks, why should that be, there is a very simple answer. It is so because both the key questions I have mentioned depend for their outcome on the future of inflation in this country. Consumers will step up their spending and cut back on their savings only if they judge inflation to be declining. Businessmen will emerge further from their shell-holes and start buying plant, equipment and new buildings, re-stocking and taking on new workers only if the uncertainty wrought by runaway inflation can be removed from their calculations and profits again begin to represent a reasonable rate of return. The prospective threat to the recovery from import competition will only be banished if Australia's international competitiveness does not continue to be eroded for too much longer by cost escalation in excess of that of our trading partners. Each of these provisos points unequivocally to the fundamental needs to reduce inflation and, as an integral part of that process, to rectify the wage-profit distortion which the wages explosion of 1974 produced. These objectives are fundamental to recovery. There have been some favourable developments on the inflation front in recent months. The 5.6 per cent rise in the Consumer Price Index in the first half of 1976 represented some advance on the 6.4 per cent and the 7.2 per cent in the second and first halves, respectively, of 1975. The Arbitration Commission's decision of May and August in respect of wage adjustments for the Consumer Price Index movements in the first two quarters of 1976 hold out hopes for some further moderation of inflation in the remainder of the year. Meanwhile, the previously very depressed level-thoug h not yet the share-of aggregate profits has begun to pick up. In these two respects we are moving in the right direction. But we need to go much further-and we need to do so faster. Time is of the essence for two reasons. First, the sooner wages and profits return to a more normal relativity, the sooner job prospects will improve. On the more pessimistic assumption, the downward adjustment in the wage share that is now required would occur slowly via an unacceptably high level of unemployment persisting for a long period. The same adjustment can take place much more quickly, and with much less cost in terms of idle resources and production foregone, if the determinations of wage fixing authorities continue to eschew the full indexation of wages fbr past price increases and wage moderation prevails. This is the course the Government has been urging before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The second reason why we need to get inflation down more quickly is in order to stop exporting jobs. In short, when we come to examine each of our current economic problems we find that all of them have their genesis in the inflationary experience of recent years. There is no way in which those problems can be solved other than by dealing with inflation itself. That is the key to it all. NA Consistent with that view, this Budget is therefore an essential element in our anti-inflationary strategy. First, the Budget takes its place in the on-going ment. process of imposing more effective control on Commonwealth outlays generally. Restraint on Budget outlays and on the size of the public sector is necessary to allow and to foster that expansion of the private sector to which we are committed. Secondly, through the full indexation of personal income taxation which I announced on 20 May, we are putting in place some of our proposed reforms. What these will mean is that the revenue side of fiscal policy will also be working to reinforce wage restraint, to strengthen company profitability and to boost business confidence. Thirdly, the substantial reduction in the magnitude of the deficit since we came to office, and of which this Budget constitutes a further step, will help to moderate the flow of liquidity into the economy. That is basic to achieving the monetary environment that is necessary if inflation is to be reduced. I shall indicate later the monetary conditions which might be expected in 1976-77, given the Budget outcome and other relevant influences. Of course, the very need for public sector restraint and tight control of the Budget deficitthe basic thrust of the Government's fiscal and monetary pohcies-ha s been disputed by some. Yet all the evidence-in Australia and overseas-is that, under the kind of inflationary conditions which we have been and are still experiencing,fiscaland monetary policies of what used to be known as the 'pump-priming' kind no longer prime the pump but serve only to turn off theflowof jobs even further. The reason is to be found in what I have already said. It is inflation that is at the heart of the problem. Tbis Government yields to none in its concern for the genuinely unemployed.",29
16,Mr SCHOLES,ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND THE,You are putting more out of work every day.,32
17,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND THE,The honourable gentleman's government put more people out of work in this country than any other government in BUDGET Australia's history. Honourable members opposite should not talk about unemployment in this debate. Mr Armitage-You are creating unemploy,32
18,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND THE,"The honourable gentleman might be unemployed even sooner than he thinks. But, whether they know it or not, those who, in the name of reducing unemployment, call for higher government spending, or bigger deficits, or full wage indexation, or devaluation of the Australian dollar, are calling for higher-no t lower-unemploymen t in this country. The overwhelming weight of evidence is against such courses. They have been tried both here and abroad; and they have failed. Let me just mention here-for the case has been fully detailed elsewhere-that experience abroad strongly reinforces our conviction in these respects. At this year's Ministerial Council Meeting of the OECD, which I attended for Australia, main industrialised nations of the nonhas Communist world agreed on an economic strategy which had as its basic premise the view that: '. . . the steady economic growth needed to restore full employment and satisfy rising economic and social ations will not prove sustainable unless make funher progress towards eradicating And I repeat, eradicating inflauon.' Consistent with that premise, OECD Ministers underlined the need for caution expansionary policies and for firm use of fiscal and monetary policies to achieve the general economic climate required for non-inflationary growth. As the Communiqufe says: '. . . because of the virulence perience, there is a danger could revive quite strongly if the pace of the recovery is too fast.' Within that general context it was further agreed that: '. . . because of inadequate investment in past years in some countries and in certain basic industries, there is a risk of supply bottlenecks at a comparatively early stage of the recovery . . . In most countries, policies should be directed more towards promoting investment rather than consumption. In many cases, this will require an appropriate recovery of profits from the On that basis, acdon was seen as being required both to stimulate investment and to restrain the rise in public expenditure. There could be no clearer demonstration of the appropriateness of the Government's economic strategy. I repeat-the speed with which we can restore full employment in Australia and 'get Australia moving again' on a sustainable basis will be directly related to the speed with which, in the words of the OECD Communique, we as a nation can 'progress towards eradicating inflation'. It follows that Australia would stand aloneand against the background of its internationally unfavourable inflation rate would be all the more noticeable for doing so-if we were once again to begin applying a clearly inappropriate ' pump-priming' policy. Whatever the virtues of such a policy may have been under conditions of stable prices, low unemployment and a smaller public sector, they have entirely evaporated under conditions of high inflation, high unemployment and a public sector already bloated beyond belief. Having consistently rejected the 'pumpthe priming' expedient, however, the Government not moved to the other extreme of trying to balance the Budget overnight. Rather, this Budget applies the maximum degree of restraint judged to be consistent with proaspirmoting confidence and maintaing a steady path all Member countries towards economic recovery. By careful choice of the taxation measures to be announced tonight and those of 20 May, we have matched restraint in our own spending with confidence-strengthening measures to boost the in the pursuit of private sector. The way in which the various elements of the Budget slot into the anti-inflationary strategy highlights the importance of looking at all our policies-fisca l policy, monetary policy, wages policy and external pohcy-as a unified and coof recent inflationary exherent whole. that inflationary expectations No single component of the strategy can fail without putting the basic objective under threat. For example, a less firm fiscal stance would undermine the necessary degree of monetary control; or, alternatively, require a return to the kind of overly restrictive monetary policy which would inhibit recovery and the rebuilding of confidence. depressed levels of recent years.' A lax monetary environment would endanger wage and price deceleration. A too stubborn adherence to the existing excessive level of real wages-for example, through full wage mdexation-woul d continue to hold inflation high, depress consumer and business spending, hold back the creation of new jobs and prevent unemployment from falling. Examples could be multiplied; but I simply say that our strategy is a coherent one. All of its separate elements involve difficult decisions. But the Government and all sections of the community must persist with the fundamental task. In doing so, we can take comfort from two things. First, we know that the alternatives have been tried and found wanting. Secondly, although they are still limited, we are already beginning to see some positive results. Budget oudays in 1976-77 are estimated to total $24,32 lm, an increase of 11.3 per cent over actual oudays in 1975-76. In 1975-76 the increase was almost 23 per cent and in the year before that it was almost 46 per cent. This marked slowing in the prospective rate of growth of Budget oudays in 1976-77 accords with the key role of expenditure restraint in the Government's overall economic strategy to which I have referred. Many of the provisions included in the Budget estimates flow from decisions announced in my comprehensive statement to the House on 20 May. The references to individual provisions which follow are confined mainly to major items. Full details are set out in Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget Speech. Where appropriate, additional information will be announced by the Ministers concerned. The decisions reflected in these expenditure E rovisions are in line with the Government's road priorities. They reflect, for example, this Government's philosophy that so far as possible responsibility for .spending decisions should remain with private individuals and businesses, and not be assumed by governments. More and more Australians are coming to understand that, one way or another, they must pay for the things they want. This Government believes that Australians should have more scope to decide what they want At the same dme, these expenditure decisions reflect the Government's main objectives to: promote confidence in the business sector; institute just social reforms in areas of need; and increase real levels of expenditure in those areas to which it gives priority. NA For example, although the proposed increases schemes. in spending on education are less than some would like, this is an area where, notwithstandunder ing our overall budgetary constraints, we have provided for increases in real levels of expendirespect ture and restored triennial programs on a rolling basis. OUTLAYS In short, education for this Government is a high priority area. In all, Commonwealth expenditure on education in 1976-77 is estimated at $2,204m, an increase of 15.3 per cent compared with 1975-76. Grants to universities, colleges of advanced education, technical colleges and government and non-government schools by the respective education Commissions account for $ 1,751m, or nearly 80 per cent of the total allocation for 1976-77. In each case the budgetary provision represents a significant increase in real terms. The Government has given to the education Commissions, for planning guidance only, minimum expenditure levels for 1978 and 1979 which will involve further increases in real terms. As announced in my statement of 20 May, this planning guidance is: for universities, colleges and schools, 2 per cent growth in real terms per annum; and for technical and further education institutions, 5 per cent growth in real terms per annum. The Budget also provides $2m for the Curriculum Development Centre and $ 1.1 m for research by the Education Research and Development Committee. In addition the Commonwealth extends substantial assistance directly to students. This Budget includes a total of $155m in 1976-77 for a range of student assistance schemes, including the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and programs of assistance for isolated children and Aboriginal children. The Government is aware that many of these allowances have not been increased for some time; meanwhile, inflation has been proceeding. Large numbers of students are involved. It is not clear to us, however, that existing schemes are the most cost-effective, in terms of directing the substantial sums involved to the most needy and deserving students. We have therefore initiated an urgent investigation into the adequacy of existing rates of benefit and the possible rationalisation of the It will be recalled that full-time allowances the National Employment and Training System were reviewed in February; payments in of in-plant and part-time training under that System are also now being similarly reviewed. With respect to student assistance schemes, the Government's decisions will be announced in October and implemented from the beginning of the 1977 academic year. The investigation will also cover the question of the reintroduction of tertiary education fees for those classes of students mentioned in my statement of 20 May. This does not of course involve reintroducing fees for Australian students undertaking their first degrees. NA Another area in which this Budget provides for a large real increase in expenditures is Social Security and Welfare. This is indeed the largest single component of Budget outlays. In 1975-76 it amounted to over $5,000m or 23 per cent of total outlays. The 1976-77 Budget provides for expenditure of $6,187m, or about 25 per cent of total oudays. The Government has already initiated major reforms in this area; some further reforms will be announced tonight. Family Allowances The new scheme of family allowances-on e of this country's most significant social reforms-is now in operation. Under the new arrangements, rates of family allowances have been substantially increased and the tax rebates for dependent children abolished. The new arrangements will benefit, in particular, large families with low incomes: those in most need will derive most benefit. Some 300 000 low income families-wit h 800 000 children-wit h incomes such that they previously derived no benefit-o r less than full benefit-fro m the dependent children's rebates, will benefit most. This accords with the Government's sense of priorities. We are committed to protect pensions against inflation. We will continue to honour that commitment. In line with it we propose to introduce legislation to tie future pension and benefit adjustments automatically to movements in the Consumer Price Index. The next two six-monthly increases, in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index, will come into effect in November 1976 and May 1977. Effective from the first payday in November the standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased by $2.25 to $43.50 a week. This reflects the movement in the Consumer Price Index between the December 1975 quarter and the June 1976 quarter. The increase will apply in respect of age, invalid and repatriation service pensions, widows' pensions and supporting mothers' benefits. The combined married rate will rise by $4.00 to $72.50 a week. Similar increases will apply to unemployment, sickness and special benefits, sheltered employment allowances and tuberculosis allowances. In line with the practice initiated by our predecessors, there will be no increase in single unemployment and sickness benefits payable to persons under the age of 18 years. The increases are estimated to cost $190 million in 1976-77 and $508 million in a full year. I come now to another significant reform. Following a recommendation by the Income Security Review Committee, the Government has decided, with effect on pension payments after 11 November 1976, to abolish the separate property component in the means test for pensions. Those pensions that are now subject to a means test based on a combination of income and property will in future be subject to a test on income only, including income from property. It will be both simpler and more equitable to take into account for pension purposes the actual income received by a pensioner. Many people will gain from this overdue Pensions reform. It has been clearly inequitable that pensioners should have been means-tested on the basis of a notional return on property, even though in many cases their actual income from such property fell well short of that notional return. We believe therefore that this measure will be welcomed by all. Transitional arrangements will ensure that existing pensioner will suffer a reduction in sion as a result of the change; these arrangefunds ments are estimated to cost about 1976-77. Repatriation Benefits The main Repatriation pensions also will increased in November 1976 and May 1977 line with increases in the Consumer Price Index. people. The increases are estimated to cost $ 15.8m in 1976-77 and $38.8m in a full year. Along with the proposed changes to the Social Security legislation, we will be introducing lation to increase automatically the patriation pensions. The Minister for Repatriation will be nouncing further details. Assistance to Handicapped People The Government attaches high priority to the provision of adequate facilities and care for handicapped people. Under the Handicapped Persons Assistance program funds are provided to help voluntary organisations establish and operate sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and training centres, and to provide accommodation handicapped children and adults. We propose to increase expenditure on this 21 These program substantially over the next three years. This Budget provides a total of $30m purposes.",32
19,Mr YOUNG,SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE,The same as last year.,36
20,Mr LYNCH,SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE,The honourable gentleman should wait until I have read another paragraph or two. He might be better edified. The $30m comprises $27m for continuing and $3m for new projects. In 1977-78 the total amount will be increased so as to provide not only for continuing commitment ments but also $ 10m for new projects. In 1978-79 the planned provision for new projects will be doubled to $20m in addition providing for continuing commitments. DrKlugman-What about 1984?,36
21,Mr LYNCH,SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE,"I will talk to the gentleman about that later. I will be able to talk about 1984, which is more than he will be able do in this Parliament. In all, over these three years we shall be providing a total of $ 12 lm under this program. Arrangements will also be made so that Paper, selected organisations will be able to commence no the planning and construction of approved projpenects now, in the firm knowledge that government will be forthcoming at nominated dates $7m in over the next three years. These arrangements paraUel those already announced for aged persons homes and hostels under which up to $225m is to be made available be over the next three years to provide urgently in needed accommodation for about 15 000 aged Handicapped Children We have decided to increase substantially legisboth the handicapped child's allowance and the main Rehandicapped children's benefit. In recognition of the special financial probanlems that are involved in the care of handicapped children, the relative increase in benefits in this area outstrips that of any other area of the Budget. We have demonstrated our concern for this real area of underprivilege by raising benefits sharply. The handicapped child's allowance will be increased from $ 10 to $ 15 a week and the handicapped children's benefit, payable in respect of handicapped children in institutions, will be for increased from $3.50 to $5.00 a day. increases, which will benefit about 000 children in these categories, will take effect from November and are estimated to cost for these an additional $3.8m in 1976-77. Senior Citizens' Centres We shall provide an amount of $4m for grants to approved senior citizens' centres in 1976-77, and the same amount in each of the two succeedcommitments ingfinancialyears. NA Notwithstanding the need to contain governspending, we are proposing to increase outlays from the Budget on overseas aid, excluding defence co-operation, to $400m in 1976-77; that to is, by 14.6 per cent on 1975-76. Of this total, $228.lm is allocated to Papua New Guinea, which continues to be the major rehonourable cipient of Australian aid. An estimated $26m will flow to Indonesia into 1976-77, being the first year of the new three year aid program of $86m to that country. Full details of Australia's overseas aid programs are set out in the accompanying Budget 'Australia's Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries 1976-77'. In these uncertain times, the highest priority of any responsible Government must be national security. Total outlays on defence activities in are estimated at $2,178m, an increase of over per cent compared with last year. The present Government is determined to restore and maintain an adequate Australian fence capability. This will require increases in defence ture over the years ahead, particularly more adequate equipment of the Defence Force. A White Paper on Defence is to be issued ing this Session and at that time the Minister for Defence will make a comprehensive statement research, on the Government's defence policies. The cost to the taxpayer of health care in Australia has rocketed in recent years. Last year Commonwealth expenditure on vice health services amounted to about $2,953m, 1976-77. including $ 1,637m on Medibank. At $1,612m the Budget provision for Medibank in 1976-77 is slightly less than last year. When allowance is made for the prepayment of $216m to the States at the end of June for hospital operating costs in the September quarter, the cost of Medibank this year is $407m greater. But for the modifications we have made, the increase in cost this year would have been much greater still. Levy proceeds to be collected under the modified arrangements to come into effect on 1 October are estimated to offset the costs of Medibank by$250min 1976-77. As part of the reform of Medibank, the Government will provide $37.5m in 1976-77 have towards the deficits incurred by tal insurance organisations-includin g Medibank Private Insurance-fro m the payment of benefits to highriskand chronically ill members. In addition, $12m has been provided subsidy to registered hospital insurance organisations to reduce the cost for those Medibank levy payers who choose to take out basic hospital1975-76, only insurance cover. The subsidy is intended to ensure that the cost of such insurance generally will not be more than $2.60 a week for family cover. DEFENCE The Government has also decided to make an advance of $ 10m in 1976-77 to Medibank Private Insurance for establishment purposes. In line with the undertaking given by the previous Government we have provided $108m for 1976-77 payments to the States in 1976-77 for the 17 development of public hospitals and related health care facilities. A further $70m-compared with $54.3m last deyear-ha s been provided for payment of grants to States, local government authorities and other expendieligible organisations under the Community for the Health Program. We have also made a number of increases in durother items of health expenditures. Commonwealth expenditure on medical including the special grants to the Hall and Florey Institutes, is estimated at $ 10.1m in HEALTH 1976-77; expenditure in 1975-76 was $6.2m. New arrangements forfinancialassistance to the Red Cross Society's Blood Transfusion Serwill result in an increase of $330,000 in the Commonwealth's subsidy to the Service in The provision for the Royal Flying Doctor Service in 1976-77 is increased by a special grant of $800,000 to $2m. NA The Government is mindful of its election undertakings and is committed to promoting the about welfare and well-being of Aboriginals. Unlike our predecessors, however, we do not see the achievement of that objective as being simply a matter of injecting ever-increasing amounts of money into an ever-increasing complexity of insufficiently considered programs. An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated the need to re-assess the efficacy of some of the approaches of the past. In this re-assessment the Government will the benefit of the recent Hay Report on the registered hospiprograms involved. Meanwhile, and pending its consideration of that Report, the Government is providing in this Budget no less than $153m for programs of difor a rect assistance to Aboriginals. Although this is $33m less than expenditure in spending on many programs is being maintained at about the same levels as last year. Mr Annitage-Shame !",36

29,Mr LYNCH,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"In the case of some programssuch as grants to Aboriginal Housing Associations-the provisions in the Budget are to cover outstanding firm commitments, pending further reviews of the objectives, priorities and past administration of those programs. In the light of those reviews additional will be provided. NA NA Welfare Housing As announced previously, advances totalling $375m- $ 10.4m more than was provided in 1975-76-wil l be available to the fare housing in 1976-77. The Government has decided in principle to undertake a housing allowance voucher experestimated iment; $75,000 is provided in the first phase of this initiative. Should the experiment prove successful, implementation of such a program would give for low income families thefinancialmeans their own rental accommodation on the open market. It would provide a new mechanism to make welfare housing sensitive to the needs of users rather than those of the planners. It takes into account the view mission of Inquiry into Poverty that thefirstprinciple in the provision of assistance to low income people is that assistance must be linked to the person and not to the house. Growth Centres The Government has under way a comprehensive review of all major urban and regional development programs, including growth centres and decentralisation, land commissions, sewerage and urban rehabilitation. Pending review of the appropriate role for the in relation to growth centres, the Budget provides sufficient funds to preserve the Commonwealth's options in regard to Alburyserved Wodonga (for which $15m is provided), that Bathurst-Orange ($2m) and Macarthur ($2m). Other Programs Other community development programs provided fbr in the Budget include: $50m for the National Sewerage Program; $ 15.1 m for land commissions; $ 10.3m for the acquisition of property, planning and site development in the Woolloomooloo Basin in Sydney; and $9.4m to assist with the construction of water treatment plants in the Adelaide area. NA A total of $133m has been provided for the Australian Broadcasting Commission; this comfunds pares with $ 137m last year. In his statement of 3 June the Prime Minister emphasised that the Government would seek to eliminate unnecessary expenditure on the arts in 1976-77, but maintain important and worthwhile programs. The Australia Council has been allocated $23m this year, about the same amount as was States for welprovided in 1975-76. Expenditure on construction and running costs of the National Gallery, and on acquisitions, is at $9.3m in 1976-77 compared with Budget for the $4.6m in 1975-76. To meet existing commitments, about $ l l m has been provided by way of capital assistance leisure facilities in the States, $5m more than to select was spent in 1975-76. The Commonwealth's role in youth, sport and recreation programs is one of the matters to be examined by the Task Force that has been set up the to examine welfare services and communitybased programs in the health-welfareof the Comcommunity development area. Pending the Government's consideration of the Task Force report, the 1976-77 Budget provisions for youth, sport and recreation are being maintained at the amount-almos t $ 1.2m-that is required to meet existing commitments. NA Postal and Telecommunications Services The Australian Telecommunications Commission will undertake a capital program in 1976-77 which will require funds of $415m additional to those available from its own internal resources. As already announced, $215m of this will be provided from the Budget; the Commission will seek the balance of $200m by borrowing on the local capital market. Last year an amount of $392m was advanced to the Commission from the Budget. The Australian Postal Commission's operations in 1975-76 yielded a surplus estimated at about $30m. The Commission therefore expects to be able not only to finance its 1976-77 capital program entirely from internal sources but also to repay $3m advanced to it by the Commonwealth in 1975-76. With effect from 1 September 1976, the fees payable by the licensees of commercial television stations are to be brought into line with the which, since 1973, has applied to commercial broadcasting stations. The new fees are estimated to yield additional revenue of $624,000 in 1976-77 and make total revenue from fees sumcient to cover the annual operational and capital costs of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Radiocommunication licences are also to be increased for some classes of users from their present level of $ 12 a year to $20 a year. The Minister will announce the details; I mention, however, that there will be no increases in fees payable by voluntary bodies such as life saving organisations and rural nre brigades. These new fees will operate from 1 October and are estimated to increase revenue by $1.2m in 1976-77 and $ 1.6m in a full year. Air Transport The Government is concerned at the continuBass ing high cost to the general public airport and airways facilities. The gap between revenue and expenditure this area was about $77m in 1975-76. To help reduce this gap, and as already announced, air navigation charges are increased by 15 per cent with effect from 1 Tasmama. December 1976. The increase is expected to yield an additional $4m in revenue in 1976-77 and $8m in year. We are also implementing economies which, without adverse effects on safety standards, will result in expenditure on civil aviation facilities and services in 1976-77 being lower, in real terms, than in 1975-76. Rail Transport An amount of $60.8m is being provided to subsidise expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission. These losses, which greatly concern Government, are being generated primarily by the Tasmanian and non-metropolitan South Australian railway systems transferred to the Commonwealth under the previous Government. A further $36.lm is included to finance the capital program of the Australian National Railways Commission. This amount includes provision to continue the construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs. It also includes funds for essential capital scale works on the Tasmanian railway system pending completion of the inquiry into that system that was announced in my statement of 20 May. The separate provision of $2m for the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge railway project will meet current commitments, pending the findings uf the independent committee of inquiry that will be reporting on that project. Sea Transport The Australian Shipping Commission's capital expenditure program for 1976-77 requires provision of $63.4m from the Budget. This program relates essentially to the provision of terminals and the acquisition of vessels and seaborne equipment by the Australian National Line for use in coastal and overseas trades. The subsidy for the operation of 'Empress of Australia' by the Australian National Line in its Strait passenger service will be increased by of providing $lm,to$2m,in 1976-77. An amount of $ 16m is provided to meet the in estimated cost in 1976-77 of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme that has been introduced following the report of the Royal to be Commission into Transport to and from The Government is increasing its nnancial assistance to the Australian Shippers' Council from a full $90,000 to $120,000 for 1976-77. Light dues levied on shipping to recover the cost of providing coastal navigation aids are to be increased from 31 cents per net registered ton per quarter to 35 cents from 1 October 1976. This increase is expected to yield an additional $ 1.7m in 1976-77. A separate levy on shipping of 1 cent per net registered ton per quarter has been coUected to cover the cost of the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. An adequate working reserve has been built up and the Government has therefore decided to reduce this levy to 0.8 cents from 1 October 1976. Urban PubUc Transport The Budget estimates include almost $65m in assistance to the States for urban pubUc transport projects. This amount includes $20m for payments which may be required in 1976-77 to meet the Commonwealth's share of approved cost increases in respect of previously approved projects. An amount of $433.5m will be made available to the States for roads in 1976-77. This includes $35.8m which will be made avaUable in addition to the amounts appropriated under existing legislation. An amount of $8m is to be provided to the States in 1976-77 for expenditure on approved planning and research projects in relation to roads and urban pubUc transport. The Government has accepted the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation to continue for a further year the joint Commonwealth/State Government scheme for the provision of concessional carry-on finance to beef producers. The Commonwealth will match State approvals in 1976-77 on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a limit of $ 15m on the Commonwealth Government contribution. The Government has considered the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which recto ommended that the subsidy of $78.74 per on the nitrogen content of nitrogenous fertilisers be phased out over three years. The Government agrees in principle that this subsidy should be phased out and has decided that the rate should be reduced to $60 per tonne on 1 January 1977. The subsidy is estimated to cost $12m in 1976-77. Rural Reconstruction The Rural Reconstruction Scheme, which expired on 30 June 1976, will be extended to 31 December 1976 pending finalisation of the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report. Of the total of $2 7m provided for the Scheme in 1976-77, $10m relates to the proposed extension to 31 December 1976; the remainder relates to commitments under appUcations approved prior to 30 June 1976. Dairy Industry An amount of $ 13.5m has been included to meet the Commonwealth's estimated UabUity in respect of the Dairy Adjustment Program in 1976-77. This is additional to other assistance the Government has offered to the dairy industry by way of underwriting of producers' returns from Roads skim milk powder, casein, butter and cheese, details of which have already been announced by the Minister for Primary Industry. Wool The Commonwealth has authorised the Australian Wool Corporation to increase the level of support provided under its minimum reserve price scheme to 234 cents per kilo clean on a whole cUp average basis. This is equivalent to 275 cents per kilo clean Beef on the previous 21 micron basis. Notwithstanding this increased level of support, it is expected that the Corporation will be able to repay in 1976-77 $245m of advances made by the Commonwealth to the Corporation in previous years. Water Resources Assessment Program The Government has decided to continue its support for the Commonwealth/State Water Resources Assessment Program for another three years; the provision for 1976-77 is $6.7m. Fertilisers Productivity Improvement Programs The Government is increasing, from $66,000 $ 177,000, its support for programs designed to tonne improve productivity at plant level. NA An amount of $20m (including $3.7m for legal aid for the Aboriginal community) is included in the Budget for legal aid, compared with expenditure of $ 16.3m in 1975-76. The Attorney-General is negotiating with the States with the object, of bringing all forms of legal aid under the control of statutory Legal Aid Commissions and thereby effecting savings in the administration of legal aid. Pending completion of the negotiations, the Government is maintaining legal aid activities at their present level. To help offset the sharp rise in costs of legal aid to the Commonwealth over recent years, new and increased fees will be levied in Federal Courts; these fees are estimated to yield $2.5m this year and $3.5m in a full year. NA NA One of the topics to which, since taking office, the Government has accorded a very high priority is that of the financial relations between the Commonwealth, State and local governments. The tax sharing scheme-the central element in our program of reform-is to a large extent now settled with the States. Under Stage 1 of the scheme, the States will be entitled to 33.6 per cent of the Commonwealth's personal income tax collections, excluding any special surcharges or rebates. On present estimates, which are necessarily subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty, this puts the States' entitlement for 1976-77 at $3,716m. This would represent an increase of $643m, or about 21 per cent, over the comparable grants in 1975-76, and is presendy estimated to be $89m more than the States would have received under the old formula. The State Governments' Loan Council programs for 1976-77 will total $l,356m, an increase of 5 per cent compared with 1975-76. Local government also will have an annual entitlement to a share of personal income tax. An amount of $140m is to be provided in 1976-77-a n increase of 75 per cent over last year. In recent years specific purpose payments to States and local government authorities have grown very fast; in 1974-75 the increase was no less than 92 per cent and in 1975-76 it was a further 34 per cent. After adjustment for the hospital prepayments to the States in late June, specific purpose payments are presently estimated to increase by about 9 per cent in 1976-77. Lumped together, net payments to States and local goverament authorities in 1976-77 are estimated to total $9,077m-a n increase of 13 per cent after adjustment for the hospital prepayments. If allowance is made also for the non-recurring payments made for unemployment relief in 1975-76, the increase in 1976-77 becomes 15 per cent. This represents a significant increase in real terms and is a slightly faster increase than is in prospect for all other Budget outlays. The greater part of the funds we are providing to the States is untied and can be used by the States in ways of their own choosing: The States have always said they want greater freedom to make their own decisions and determine their own priorities. That is why we have increased our provision to them of untied fundsrelativelymore than funds for specific purposes. The States now have the capacity to spend these untied funds in ways of their own choosing-be it welfare housing, or sewerage programs, or whatever it is to which they choose to give priority. The State Governments, along with the Commonwealth, must play their part in the battle against inflation. At a dme when there are complaints about the level of funding of State Government programs the Commonwealthfindsit particularly strange to find some State Governments actually supporting the even higher increases in their cost levels which full indexation of wages would bring. There is a need for restraint in the expenditures of State Governments as well as m the expenditures of this Government. ThefiguresI have just given clearly show that the States are not being asked to bear any undue share of the task. NA The Budget includes an amount of $26m for relief payments in 1976-77 following natural disasters. This amount comprises continuing payments following floods and cyclones during 1975-76 and recently announced droughtreliefassistance to Western Australia. The Government has also undertaken to support, in accordance with the natural disaster assistance arrangements with the States, expenditures by the Victorian Government on certain drought relief measures. NA We have approved a total program of $293m for new works to be committed to construction in 1976-77. A total cash allocation of $410m has been set for expenditure during the year on new and already committed projects; this compares with actual expenditure of $425m in 1975-76. For the Darwin Reconstruction Commission a new works program of $50m and an expenditure figure of $140m have been detennined; actual expenditure in 1975-76 was $ 110m. The approved new works program for the National Capital Development Commission is $153m, with a cash allocation of $195m compared with $ 188m in 1975-76. For the remainder of the works program the limit on new works is $90m, including $50m for the Northern Territorv, and the cash allocation is $75m; actual expenditure last year amounted to $127m. The Minister for the Capital Territory has already announced details of increases in general municipal rates and in water and sewerage rates in the Australian Capital Territory. Action is in hand to limit the subsidy to the Canbena bus service to $5.4m in 1976-77. There will be increased revenue from bus fares and paid parking spaces in Canbena. The Minister will be issuing details. Soon after taking office the present Government introduced new staff ceilings which were mainly responsible for reducing Commonwealth employment in the area covered by staff ceilings by 2.8 per cent in 1975-76. This compares with a growth in Commonwealth employment in the area concerned of about 4 per cent per annum in the three years to 1974-75. On 14 June the Prime Minister announced a further overall reduction of 1.2 per cent in these staff ceilings to be achieved by 30 June 1977. This comprised a 1.6 per cent reduction in the ceilings for Public Service Act employees and a 0.9 per cent reduction in the ceilings for cenain Commonwealth Government authorities. These lower ceilings have been reflected in detailed Budget estimates. The Prime Minister indicated at the time that Civil Works the 1976-77 ceilings set in June were provisional, being subject to funher review and possible adjustment in the light particularly of the Government's Budget decisions. Following funher consideration in the Budget context, the Government has decided upon an objective of achieving a funher reduction of 2 per cent in staff ceilings for Public Service Act employees during 1976-77, making the objective in this area a 3.7 per cent reduction in all. This funher reduction is estimated to produce a saving to the Budget of about $22m in 1976-77. Accompanying-thoug h lesser-reduction s in the staff ceilings for cenain Commonwealth Government authorities will mean that, after allowance for the reduction previously announced, the total reduction in ceilings now being aimed at during the course of 1976-77 amounts to 2.5 per cent. The Government reaffirms its intention to achieve these reductions without sacking anyone and without creating personal hardship. Canbena Continuing Expenditure Control FoUowing the change of Government we were able to keep total Budget outlays for 1975-76 within the original Budget estimates for the first time since 1968-69. We aim to repeat that performance again in 1976-77. We will not let up in our efforts to achieve savings and eliminate waste and inefficiencies wherever they occur. Staff Ceilings Because so much expenditure tends to be committed before the year starts, effective expenditure control must begin at the stage of commitment. To this end, new administrative arrangements have been developed for the regulation of forward expenditure commitments by depanments and authorities which depend on the Budget for the whole or pan of their finance. Limits within which departments and relevant authorities may make commitments during the currentfinancialyear-bu t which are to be financed from appropriations in future years-were determined as pan of the Budget process. These Umits can be increased only by specific Government decisions. We see the development of these new adminthe istrative arrangements as making a major contribution to the improvement of overall nnancial management in the area of Commonwealth administration. I turn now to the receipts side of the Budget. Government spending cannot be massively increased as in recent years without also significantly increasing the overall tax burden. This remains true notwithstanding the enormous deficits which have been allowed to open up between the outlays and the receipts side of the Budget-and which in due course have to be closed. With that latter important qualification, it is also obvious that, by prudently reining in the rate of growth of goverament spending, it becomes possible not only to avoid further increases in tax burden but also to contemplate reducing it. In 1976-77, for the first time since the last Liberal-National Country Party Budget of August 1972, there will be no increases in the major indirect taxes. I contrast this with the 1975-76 Budget proposals for indirect tax increases which-eve n excluding the coal export duty-represente d additional levies totalling $602m in 1975-76 and $688minafullyear. Over the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76 the total of all the increases in taxation in this area lifted the annual level of taxation by over $ 1,000m. In this Budget, I repeat, there are no proposals to increase excise on cigarettes, or on beer, or on spirits, or on petrol. Moreover, because of our success to date in restraining expenditures, 1976-77 will see our first steps towards positively relieving the burden of taxation. The decisions involved-thos e already announced and those I am about to announceaccord with our basic philosophy that individuals and businesses should have more say in spending decisions which concern them, and governments less. At the same time they are intended to strengthen confidence among consumers and investors, and thereby advance the recovery of the economy. NA The most important step in relieving the burden of taxation-the indexing of personal income tax-ha s already been taken and has been in eration for pay-as-you-earn purposes since 1 July. It represents perhaps the most significant reform of the personal income tax system in our time, and certainly the most costly in terms of RECEIPTS revenue forgone. We have taken this step both in fulfilment of our objective of getting the Government's hands out of taxpayers' pockets, and for wage policy reasons. Individuals, rightly in our view, attach considerable importance to their own command over their incomes and their ability so far as possible to spend those incomes as they see fit. The indexation arrangements which are now part of the income tax law will prevent the automatic increase in effective tax rates which used to come about as rising money incomes resulting the purely from inflation took taxpayers further up the progressive rate scale. The law now provides for annual adjustments to prevent that. A change to the law will now be needed if a goverament seeks to increase effective real rates. This brake uponfinancialprofligacy is a major step towards 'keeping governments honest' with their taxpayers. The new arrangements are described in Statement No. 4 attached to this Speech. The cost of indexation and the changes associated with it is estimated to be $ 1,050m in 1976-77 and $ 1,210m in a full year. We gave a commitment for 3 years; we fulfilled it in just under 6 months. NA The Government made it quite clear in its election policy statements that it was not prepared to see inflation continue to add to the tax burdens of individuals and businesses. We allowed ourselves a period of three years to give full effect to the necessary remedial legislation. So far as personal income tax is concerned, we have already fulfilled our undertaking by indexing the system as from 1 July 1976. We have now considered relieving businesses also from the impact of inflation on their tax burdens. In the kind of highly inflationary situation which Australia has recently been experiencing, opfirms have serious problems infinancingthe rapidly growing costs of an adequate and appropriate level of trading stocks. They have problems, too, withfinancingthe soaring costs of replacing plant and equipment when depreciation allowances for taxation purposes are based on historical costs. Since coming to office the Government has given careful thought to the most effective ways of providing relief to firms beset with problems of these kinds arising from our recent high rates of inflation. In doing so it has had the benefit of the views originally stated by the Mathews Committee and, more recently, by Professor Mathews personally. It has also sought and received the views of leading representatives of the accountancy profession and of a wide sweep of industry interests. The Government has now decided to take a substantial step in relation to a system of trading stock valuation adjustments applying to taxable incomes earned in the 1976-77 income year. Meanwhile, we are continuing to examine the impact of inflation on depreciation allowances and other aspects of business financing and profitability, with a view to bringing in appropriate legislation within the Government's current term of office and having regard to the availability, in the meantime, of the investment allowance. The key features of the proposed system of trading stock valuation adjustments will be: The adjustments will reduce taxable incomes in respect of income year 1976-77. On practical grounds, the accent of the scheme will be, so far as possible, on simplicity. With that in mind, we propose the use of a general index for calculating the trading stock valuation adjustment. Specifically, the cost of a firm's trading stock as at 1 July 1976 will be revalued for income tax purposes by reference to the percentage increase in the 'goods' component of the Consumer Price Index between the June quarter of 1976 and the June quarter of 1977. It is not proposed to bring the adjustments back into assessable income in later years in the circumstances proposed by the Mathews Committee-the adjustments will reduce tax, not defer it; in terms of the jargon, will be no 'clawback"". It will be necessary to lay down some safeguards against misuse of the system to avoid tax that ought to be paid; the precise nature of these is at present under consideration. By way of illustration I mention that, had such a scheme been operating fully in the current year on the basis of 1975-76 incomes, it is estimated that the cost to revenue this year would have been of the order of $700m. What the full cost of thefinalscheme would be in 1977-78 cannot of course be foreseen at this stage. That would depend among other things upon the rate of increase in the index during the current year. We have said that the scheme would be phased in. At this point it is clearly not possible for us to say how far, by this time next year, we shall feel able to go. We shall go as far as we can. What we do now undertake is that 50 per cent of the full adjustment will be allowed next year as deductions from 1976-77 incomes. There are other aspects of the system of adjustments which require further study and which we are therefore not in a position to announce at present; these include, for example, the safeguards I have referred to and the categories of trading stocks to be included in the scheme. Legislation to be introduced in the next Autumn Sittings will provide full details. In settling those details, the Government will have discussions with professional and industry groups where appropriate. NA The Government has undertaken to ease the distribution requirements for private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In this regard we have had the needs of small businesses particularly in mind. We believe in small businesses: They are essentially Australian. We attach importance to the spirit of free enterprise which small business symbolises. For distributions in respect of taxable incomes of the year 1975-76 and subsequent years the retention allowance for trading or business there income will be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. This will increase by one-fifth the amount of after-tax income which a private company can retain without incurring Division 7 tax. No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there be no retention allowance for dividends that one private company receives from another. At the same time, the law will be amended to terminate the 'excess distribution' provisions of Division 7, which permit a company which makes more than the minimum distribution in one year to make less than a minimum distribution in a later year without incurring Division 7 tax. With the proposed increase in the retention allowances there will no longer be any practical need to retain these highly complex provisions, which have also been of some concern in connection with schemes of tax avoidance; they are accordingly to be withdrawn subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. The increase in the retention allowance is estimated to cost about $lm in 1976-77 and $30m in a full year. NA The Government has had under consideration the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the income tax arrangements applying to the mining and petroleum industries. In the light of that report it has decided on certain amendments to the law, bearing in mind both the Government's desire to see a healthy and efficient mining sector and the IAC's observations on the desirable relationships between the levels of tax on income from mining and on income from other business sources. The changes proposed are: Petroleum exploration expenditure and allowable capital expenditure on the mining of petroleum will be deductible against income from any source. Allowable capital expenditure of any mining company on the development of a mine or field will be deductible on a diminishing value basis, as at present, by reference to a maximum life of mine or field of 5 years, instead of 25 years as at present. Allowable capital expenditure on facilities used for the transportation of minerals, including petroleum, will now be deductible on a straight line basis over either 20 years, as at present, or 10 years, at the taxpayer's option to be exercised with thefirstclaim for the deduction. The categories of expenditure covered by the present provisions giving deductions for allowable capital expenditure on mineral transport facilities will be extended to cover expenditure, presently not deductible, on port development such as harbour surveys, initial dredging, navigational aids and breakwaters. The amendments will apply first to capital expenditures incurred after today. They have no cost in 1976-77 but the revenue to be forgone in the first full year is estimated at $60m. NA In the last Budget an excise of $2 per barrel was introduced on the production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas. Under existing policy any company discovering oil would receive import parity less the production excise. Many oil exploration companies have put to us that costs are so high today as to make commercial production from new oil discoveries of the size likely to be found in Australia unattractive at this level of return. The Government accepts that the levy represents a substantial deterrent to companies considering exploration for new fields. It has therefore decided that oil from discoveries after today will be free from the production excise. The result will be that all production of crude oil from future discoveries will receive full import parity at the nearest refinery port. The Government believes that this will significantly affect the level of activity within the oil exploraton industry. NA The coal export duty introduced in the last Budget applies at two rates-$ 6 per tonne for high quality coal and $2 per tonne for other coal, apart from certain lower grade coal which is exempt. The Government has always regarded this as an entirely inappropriate form of tax. The quality of deposits varies markedly, but within and between the two categories which are subject to duty the effects of the duty fall in a quite haphazard manner. Marginal fields pay the same rate of duty as economically more profitable fields, or in some cases more. The imposition of this levy has had undesirable effects both on existing producers and on potential developments. It is the intention of the Government to remove this particular levy, but for budgetary reasons which will, I think, be obvious it is not possible to remove it at one stroke. It will however be reduced immediately, in what the Government regards as a first step towards completely phasing out this particular tax within three years. The Government is taking these steps towards phasing out this levy to encourage the healthy development of the industry. If the States take advantage of this situation to increase their own royalties the Government will have to review its position. So far as immediate steps are concerned, the Government will remove the duty from noncoking coal and will reduce the rates on coking coals by 25 per cent-fro m $6 to $4.50 per tonne in the case of the higher rate of duty and from $2 to $ 1.50 per tonne in the case of the lower rate. These changes, to apply immediately, will cost an estimated $33m in 1976-77 and $37m in a full year. NA Legislation to introduce an investment allowance was passed in the Autumn Sittings of the Parliament. During those Sittings and since, representations were received on a number of aspects of the allowance on which changes in the law were sought. In the course of its deliberations on the Budget the Government has carefully considered all of these representations and having done so has decided that the present scope of the allowance should remain unchanged. NA The present level of the exemption from payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is to be increased to the level recently adopted by the States. The present exemption of $20,800 will become $41,600 per annum; above $41,600 the exemption will phase out by $2 for every $3 by which the annual payroll exceeds that amount. The new exemption will apply from 1 January 1977. The change does not have any significant effect on Budget revenue. NA The Government has now considered the IAC report on 'Rural Income Fluctuations-Certain Taxation Measures', which dealt with two broad questions: the averaging arrangements for primary producers, and a proposal for a scheme of income equalisation deposits for primary producers. The Government has decided to continue the averaging system in its present form, but will take up the proposal for a scheme of income equalisation deposits. Commencing with income year 1975-76, deposits lodged with the Government under the latter scheme will be deducted from the assessable income of the year of income in respect of which they are lodged, and included in assessable income of the year in which they are withdrawn. The scheme will enable primary producers to act themselves to even out the effects of fluctuating income on their tax liabilities over a period of years. Details of the scheme will be available when the legislation is introduced; the scheme will, however, include the following features: A minimum limit of $100 and a maximum limit of $ 100,000 is to be applied to the total value of a taxpayer's holdings. It will not be possible to withdraw deposits within the first 12 months after lodgement (other than in exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters, death, or financial stringency); however, there will be no maximum limit on the period for which an amount may be left on deposit. The scheme will apply to primary producers, but in determining taxable income' from which deposits may be purchased, no distinction will be drawn between income obtained by primary producers from farm or non-farm sources. Interest is to be paid on the deposits at a rate, initially 5 per cent per annum, to be prescribed by regulation. The present Drought Bonds Scheme is to be discontinued under appropriate transitional arrangments. Present holders of Drought Bonds will be offered the option of transferring to the new scheme. It is estimated that the revenue forgone in 1976-77 will be about $2m; the full-year cost of the scheme cannot be estimated at this stage. NA We undertook to increase the exemption from estate duty where the whole or part of the estate of a deceased person passes to a surviving spouse. This is an area of the law where personal tragedies abound. Even in current tight budgetary circumstances we have seen the need to pay special regard to rectifying the present situation. We shall therefore fulfil our undertaking in this Budget. We shall introduce a special deduction to apply where an interest in an estate passes to a surviving spouse. The deduction will be $50,000, or the entire net value of the spouse's interest in the estate if that is less than $50,000. The existing statutory exemptions, and the rebate of part of the duty in respect of a primary producer estate, will then apply as at present to the remainder of the estate. With the introduction of this special deduction, the deduction introduced in 1974 for an interest in the matrimonial home passing to a surviving spouse will be terminated. This was in any case an unsatisfactory provision, as it discriminated between different types of assets and was available in full only if the gross value of the interest in the home did not exceed $35,000. The new deduction will apply regardless of the nature of the assets and will not be reduced where the value of the relevant interest exceeds $50,000. In the case of an estate passing wholly to a viving spouse, no duty will now be payable on an estate up to $90,000 (or $98,000 for primary producer estates). About 20 per cent of presently dutiable estates will cease to be dutiable, and the impact of duty on larger estates will be considerably reduced. The new provisions will apply to estates of persons who die after today. The cost of this measure is estimated to be $2m in 1976-77 and $ 14m in a full year. NA In the aggregate, outlays in 1976-77 are estimated to increase by 11.3 per cent to $24,32 lm. Receipts are estimated to increase by 18.8 per cent to $21,713m. The overall deficit is therefore $2,608m. This is $977m less than the actual deficit of $3,585m in 1975-76. This latter figure would of course have been much greater had it not been for the actions taken by this Government immediately it came to office. When allowance is made for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit in 1976-77 is estimated at $l,879m; this is over $l,000m less than the domestic deficit of $2,905m last year. For all the reasons I have stated earlier this hauling in of the deficit this year is appropriate. But, over and beyond that, it can fairly be claimed that the deficit in prospect for 1976-77 differs in important respects from those of 1975-76 and 1974-75. The 'mix' of the prospective deficit this year is vitally different from those of the last two years. It is particularly striking, for example, that the lower deficit in prospect for 1976-77 is estimated to come about after forgoing revenue of no less than $ 1,250m on account of personal tax indexation and the investment allowance. Had we not chosen to make those desirable reductions in the burden of personal and corporate taxation the deficit would have been about $ 1,360m and the domestic deficit would have been down to around $630m. Not only is the reduction in the deficit appropriate to the evolving economic recovery but it is also being achieved after a major reduction in taxes which will play its own part in enhancing that recovery. More generally, this Budget reflects the surGovernment's determination to press on with the major social, economic and administrative reforms that were outlined by the Prime Minister last November. It continues the drive to restore to individuals the economic independence that was so markedly eroded by the policies of our predecessors. It puts people first. It points towards the re-enhancement of the role of the private sector and away from the threat of big government. It emphasises the importance of free enterprise. For the first time in recent years, it gives real incentive for individuals and compames to venture and to succeed. NA Against that background, I believe there will be general agreement that this Budget is above all afiscallyresponsible one. Among other things it represents another step towards a better 'mix' of fiscal and monetary policies than has existed in recent years. The joint thrust of this Government's fiscal and monetary policies to date has slowed the growth in the monetary aggregates in recent months from the grossly excessive rates of 1975. This Budget staysfirmlyon that track. The reduction we are effecting in the Budget deficit will reduce the Government's call on financing from the community. It thereby provides more scope for maintaining financial conditions appropriate to continuing recovery in the private sector while holding growth in the overall monetary aggregates at appropriate rates. Thus, the technical estimates at the moment suggest that with the monetary regulators at settings appropriate to continuing recovery in the private sector, a Budget outcome of the kind foreshadowed here, along with other factors affecting thefinancialsystem, could be consistent with growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the 10-12 per cent range during 1976-77. That range, which is subject to the usual hazards of forecasting, will no doubt change as circumstances unfold. Depending upon those circumstances it could also be necessary and appropriate for policy to be adjusted in the light of events as they develop. As of now, however, it gives a broad indication that growth in the monetary aggregates will be a notch or so lower than last year. The Government believes that, notwithstanding all the qualifications which necessarily attach to it, this broad indication of the monetary outlook will provide the private sector with a greater degree of certainty regarding that aspect of policy in the year ahead than it has previously enjoyed-particularl y in recent years. It should help, for example, to allay fears of either excessivefinancialtightnessor financial ease. Consistent with the aims of government policy, an outcome along these Unes would contribute to reducing inflation while ensuring adequate funds to underwrite economic recovery. Within that broad monetary framework, the decisions of the wage-fixing authorities will be crucial to the speed of the wind-down in inflation that, one way or another, must be achieved. Provided there is significantly less than full flow-on of price increases to wages, an improvement of several percentage points in price performance, and a somewhat greater deceleration in money wages, can be had in 1976-77 as a whole. By the end of the period, we should be down to single digit rates. With some productivity gains accruing in the upturn, a noticeable rise in the profit share would then be in prospect. With such a gradual winding-down of inflation and inflationary expectations, recovery in demand and activity would be unlikely to proceed at more than a modest pace. Under those circumstances, both private consumption expenditure and business investment should, during 1976-77, become estabUshed as sources of continuing growth in demand for domestic production. Over the year as a whole they should, on that basis, record moderate increases in real terms. Unhappily, seasonal conditions appear likely to permit little if any increase in farm production overall; however, developments along the Unes I have mentioned could reasonably be expected to result in gross non-farm product growing by about 4 per cent for the year as a whole. Given a more widespread recognition, on the part of all those principally concerned, of the central role which current rates of inflation are playing in holding back the recovery and keeping unemployment high, it is possible to envisage a more optimistic scenario. But until the evidence of that more widespread recognition comes up on the board-for example, in the determinations of the wage-fixing tribunals and in the co-operation with those decisions of the trade union leadership as a whole-w e cannot plan on that. Even the more gradual recovery prospects, however, would be consistent, after allowance for labour force and productivity growth, with some gradual reduction in unemployment during the course of 1976-77. It would be rash to predict any earlier reduction in unemployment; movements in the remainder of calendar year 1976 are unlikely to be great. But 1977, all going well, should see the start of a more concerted fall. NA This Budget embodies and advances the Government's overall economic and social strategy. The economy is now set on the right path and the combination of expenditure and tax measures in this Budget will help it along that path. For the first time in several years there are now good prospects of staying on a growth path we can sustain. Inflation-and therefore unemployment-wil l not be wiped out overnight, but even on a not over-optimistic view of things they will be steadily reduced by the budgetary and other policies to which this Government is adhering. After only eight months since, on coming to office, we confronted the full enormity of our inheritance, these policies are now beginning to produce results. At the same time the Budget also reflects the Government's priorities both as between private and public spending, and within the public sector itself. It is, as I said at the outset, both a Budget for confidence and a Budget for reform. As such, I commend the Budget to Honourable Members. Debate (on motion by Mr E. G. Whitlam) adjourned.

If consumption does grow but real risk of the re-emergence of sectoral capacity on at least some prices and/or spill-over in turn, on a number of factors. Crucial and inflationary expectations. An integral part economic environment was the increase during 1974 in particular. Running as it did far ahead of productivity, and shifting relationships previously obtaining in the out the recession and, as discussed above, onset and its prolongation. It is important Government policy starts from the standpoint of inflation is fundamental to the achievement The control of inflation is directed have commonly been associated with inflation: their incomes and savings, the distorting real resources, and so on. But even more the nexus whereby inflation has fostered large increases in the real wage and marked contribution to those developments in Australia. Unless and until the real wage is process of winding inflation rates back, the level of economic activity and to provide unemployment significantly. In the circumstances the increase or maintenance of real to increase or maintain them) are in effect, maintenance of unemployment at present high levels. As the Commonwealth has argued of recovery and return to high employment the longer the present real wage imbalance can take place much more quickly and with and production forgone, if money wages below the inherited rate of price change. As they appeared earlier this year tax rates which existed then, prospects deficit than in 1975-76. Such an outcome incompatible with the objectives of policy. would have been exacerbated, not only seen as failure by the Government to control the massive infusion of liquidity into Such a set back to the quelling of inflationary generally, would have further depressed spending. In addition, if other implications drawn, other components which could in such a situation are inventories and imports. and renewed uncertainty engendered, its stock levels. Again, with no further Australia's competitive position vis-a-vis deteriorated further; the inevitable strengthening resulted would also have dampened domestic production. In sum, under these conditions an expected. It was in the light of this outlook They incorporated expenditure restraint As a result of the 20 May package, deficit of $2608 million is now in prospect; million.

This is particularly economy is considerably removed from attempted, of course, to pinpoint some high level of unemployment continues increase which, while they showed some are still clearly destabilising. The following economy over 1976-77 may then, indeed hopefully, in the broad. This will be assumptions, which must be made in arriving Assumptions These assumptions include the following: o The general stance of monetary policy to meet the needs of the economy modating to inflationary demands; o Apart from the Budget proposals themselves, during 1976-77; o During 1976-77, no requirement for nomic policies will emerge, and the at a moderate rate; o Seasonal conditions will permit little o Some form of partial indexation of increases in other wages Of all these assumptions the most crucial extent of economic recovery in 1976-77 which the present real wage imbalance can of continuing partial indexation proves invalid-o wage increases and conditions of employment will be diminished, new jobs will not be present high levels of unemployment will be prolonged. Expenditure and Product On the basis of the foregoing, private shown some growth, is expected to continue should be increasingly spread across all growth of consumption will exceed that terms, implying a further decline in the only reasonably to be expected in the context and, at the worse, no renewed deterioration specifically that these assumptions imply some decline in real average Investment in dwellings grew very rapidly and prospective monetary conditions suggest a whole, although the early months of downturn in building society finance Anticipations and survey data to hand well begin to grow early in 1976-77.

This latter development is however of improvement on the inflationary front in the labour market. It may be noted a rise in real consumption notwithstanding wages (see Prices and Incomes below). over the course of 1975-76.

This outlook for domestic demand, imports given below, is consistent with of about 4 per cent in 1976-77.

At this stage it seems of about the same size as, and a current 1975-76.

In this way the classification nature of government activities, on the share and to facilitate assessment of the effectiveness Compared with the classification used functional classification has the added conventions. There is thus a consistent classification and the functional classification. confusion which existed in Budget documents different classifications were used-the national accounting classification. The conventions and principles used those set out in the publication A System York 1968. That classification is a widely classification of public expenditure by function. Economic Co-operation and Development nationally comparable statistics on the public sector. The Australian Bureau of Statistics principles in the documents it publishes functional headings adopted for Budget used by the Statistician in his publications, by the Bureau for Commonwealth Government outlays by Commonwealth Government authorities sector. They therefore differ somewhat the Budget Statements. Information on the the Budget sector is shown in the National Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities documents. Two further differences should assistance are shown in the Budget Statements levies and charges; these outlays are shown for the years prior to 1974-75, part of Government departments and instrumentalities classified by the Statistician as foreign the same functional heading in the Budget Australia. Supplementary information on available in the Bureau's publication The major functional headings are Brief descriptions of the contents of each are intended to convey the scope of the than to be a detailed listing of the contents function is provided in the body of Statement 1966-67 to 1975-76 are given in Statement No. 6. From an examination of the classification it will be evident that the functional classification On the whole it has not been possible, for of departments and to allocate them over functional heading. NA is to bring together outlays with like aims to present information on the of resources devoted to particular objectives of outlays in meeting objectives. in Budget Statements prior to 1973-74, the advantage of being based on national accounting conceptual basis underlying both the economic This removes a considerable source of prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually so-called 'conventional' classification and the NA in the functional classification are essentially of National Accounts, United Nations, New accepted international standard for the It is also used by the Organisation for as a basis for the development of interhas concurrently adopted these conventions and on public authority finance. While the major purposes are conceptually consistent with those it should be noted that thefigurespublished outlays cover both Budget outlays and which operate outside the Budget from the figures shown for the Budget sector in transactions of authorities operating outside Accounting Estimates of Receipts and which is published with the Budget be noted. First, outlays on primary industry 'net' of the relevant primary industry on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, the expenditure incurred by some Commonwealth operating in Papua New Guinea is aid. These outlays, however, are shown under Statements as similar outlays made within the functional allocation of these outlays is Public Authority Finance-Federal Authorities. NA shown in the summary table in Statement No. 3. function are given below. These descriptions outlays included under each heading rather of each category. Further detail on each No. 3. Historical data for the period structure set out in the Budget Statements is relatively aggregative in nature. example, to dissect the administrative outlays the particular sub-categories shown under each Outlays under each functional heading together into readily identifiable expenditure as a rule, purport to represent detailed rather, they are meant as recognisable to discussion and analysis. Nevertheless, purpose-oriented than was the case with the conventional classification used prior to 1973-74. Given the need to produce a continuing outlays and receipts which is consistent Budget Speech and documents, it has been central accounting records. These records Acts, which are the legal authority for ments. The figures presented, therefore, appropriation data, supplemented where of substantial appropriation It should be noted also that the functional with appropriation or departmental structures. figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. the control of a particular department one functional heading and it will not priation items in the Statements. The introduction ever, does not alter the structure of with the Appropriation Bills, such as of Estimated Expenditure. Although the basic aim of a functional purposes for which government outlays such a classification cannot always be often serve two or more distinct functions. to serve both a defence and an education classification scheme, however, requires which it is considered primarily to serve. is considered to be defence; this is It is not possible, in any single classification time on every outlay characteristic that public.

The proposals I have just tabled introduce the tariff charges on coal foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his Budget Speech earlier this evening. The changes reduce the export duty on high quality coking coal from $6 per tonne to $4.50 per tonne, reduce the export duty on coking coal other than high quality coking coal from $2 per tonne to $1.50 per tonne, and exempt from duty all exports of non-coking coal. These changes will be effective in relation to all exports after 8 o'clock this evening. I commend the proposals to the House.",212

36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I have received a letter from the President of the Senate advising that the Senate, by resolution on 3 June 1976, appointed Senators Brown, Button, Cavanagh, Greenwood, Webster and Withers to be members of the Commonwealth Parliament's delegation to attend the Australian Constitutional Convention. NA Sale of Toy Syringe-Rai d on Entebbe Airport-Transpor t Services to Tasmania-Gol d Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",213
37,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT," Iriseto warn the House of a toy-allegedl y a toy-that is on sale in Hurstville in Sydney and which may be on sale in the electorates of other honourable mem1976 bers. It is a toy syringe and is called Hypo-Phony. It is said to be capable of giving fake hypodermic shots. The brochure that comes with this so called toy says that you can pretend to give a shot to yourself, blood to an anaemic friend, hot blood to a cold girl, pep to a tired person or get blood out of a turnip, steak, roast, etc. The brochure then talks about endless fun possibilities and says that this thing is good for a million laughs. Two years ago this object was investigated by the former Minister for Customs and Excise, the then Senator Murphy, who ordered that a regulation be prepared to have the item banned from importation into Australia. Since that time apparently some attempt has been made to draw a regulation but no action has been completed. The so-called toy- I call it that because I do not want to dignify the product with a name of something that children would legitimately use-is still on sale. I understand that some were imported into this country within the past year or so. Last week when I found out about this I spoke to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) who is the Minister responsible for customs matters. He advised me that there was considerable concern about this. There is a degree of medical opinion that this item could be used as a real implement. There may be some doubt on that but it might be possgoodwill. ible to adapt the item. This, of course, could possibly cause infection or even death to some people. I think the House would agree that clearly something which is suggestive of the use of drugs, and in particular hard drugs, ought not to be available in the community especially if it sold as a toy, directed to young people, said good for laughs or capable of drawing blood, giving shots or the like. The brochure that goes with the item is quite irresponsible. It claims the product is sold throughout various parts the world and that various patents are pending. The product does not appear to originate in Australia. I do not know what the final new Minister will be on this matter, but there would seem to be 2 courses of action open to get something done about it. The first relates to item 18 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulaterrorists tions which refers to goods dangerous or a ace to the community. Perhaps the item could banned under that regulation. However that be too wide. I understand there have been some difficulties in the use of item 18. It may be that such a blanket provision would not necesscomplained arily be appropriate for use in this case. ondly, a new regulation could be drawn. If a new regulation were drawn it would need to be drawn with considerable precision. It is also, put to the House, necessary that warnings be given to the community generally and that the House and the Minister be advised of other plaintive places where this product might be on sale. Surely in the interests of the community an proach to retailers to refuse to sell these items would be warranted. No doubt the Minister, if chooses to proceed by way of one of the regulaof tions, as I certainly hope he will, will also municate to State Ministers who have control of consumer affairs the fact that this product being sold and perhaps request that they look into the matter. But the important question whether or not this type of item should be on sale and whether there should be a general information gathering process so that the item could, I hope, be banned from import and prevented from being on sale.",213
38,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT," I draw the attention of the House to a recent rescue operation that has now become known as the mission to Entebbe. It is my opinion that this epic sortie will be enshrined in the annals of military history as one of the truly great actions of all time. I am sure that the heroism, daring and conspicious gallantry of all those brave souls who took part have the admiration of all men of peace and I have not the slightest doubt that, but for them, innocent men and women would have been slaughtered in the cause of political fanaticism. Terrorism in the form of the hijacking of aircraft would be in its death throes if all the nations of the world spelt out in bold terms thenis refusal to give sanctuary to these gangsters and to be made it clear that terrorism or aggression in whatever form it may take will be condemned and that automatic sanctions will be placed on that transgressors. One could be pardoned for believof ing that a simple motion placed before the United Nations, condemning terrorism, would have been passed with enthusiasm and applause. I was staggered to read recently that this very motion, sponsored by responsible nations, had decision of the failed to pass. In retrospect there can be no question that the were aided and abetted in their infamy menby that madman and butcher of humanity, Idi be Amin of Uganda. One of the hostages was a lady may of some 75 years of age by the name of Dora Bloch. She was taken prisoner by the hijackers said and, whilst at Entebbe airport, apparently of food poisoning and was taken to a SecUgandan hospital. Apparently she was in hospital at the very time of the rescue operation. After the success of that venture the same woman was I seen by independent witnesses to be dragged from the hospital, screaming, with Ugandan soldiers forcing sponges down her throat to stop her cries. Wire service reports clearly indicate that the body of this unfortunate woman, apwhose only crime was to be an innocent tourist, was found charred and burnt beyond recognition he on the outskirts of Kampala. Despite the weight diplomatic protests and inquiries from Israel comand Great Britain, Amin of Uganda has washed his hands of the whole affair. So I believe that the is time has now come for the Federal Government to sever diplomatic relations with Uganda, and I is call upon the Government to do so.",214
39,Mr GROOM,ADJOURNMENT," I congratulate the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) and the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney) on raising such important subjects and speaking so sincerely about them. Shortly before the recent recess I spoke on the important Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme and I recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you were in the chair on that occasion. I made some mildly critical comments at that time about delays which had occurred in implementing this important scheme and I feel it is only proper that I should now compliment the Minister concerned and the Government on implementing the scheme so expeditiously. Mr Martyr-They are frightened of you.",215
40,Mr GROOM,ADJOURNMENT,"That might be so. The scheme commenced on 1 July. It is a most important reform for Tasmania and I believe it will ensure the future stability and prosperity of the Tasmanian economy. I think in early 1973 the previous Labor Administration made certain hollow promises about assisting Tasmania with its freight problem and, of course, that Administration was in office for 3 years and nothing was done. No action was taken. Now we see that a Government which has been in power for only 6 months has implemented the scheme. I concede that there are problems with the scheme. It is a unique scheme; it is a new scheme. Naturally there will be difficulties with it. There are probstates: lems in deterrnining the categories of goods which will be eligible for assistance. In my electorate of Braddon we have an important cheese industry but cheese is not included in the categories of goods. This is probably because of some misconception. However, representations have been made to the Government and the Minister and I trust that something will be done to include cheese in the scheme. There are other such commodities and one that comes to mind is potatoes. This is another important commodity produced on the north-west coast of Tasmama. At the moment the scheme does not operate as favourably for that industry as it might. I hope that the scheme will be implemented in such a way as to give the potato industry access to the important Sydney market. There are review provisions available in the scheme which will enable industries of all kinds to make application upon appropriate grounds for inclusion in the scheme. The point I want make tonight is that the Government and the Minister should be congratulated on ensuring its that the scheme operated within the time limit proposed. It was suggested originally that the scheme would commence operating on 1 July goes on to say: and that deadline was met. It is a complex scheme. The Minister and the Department had a difficult task but they did the job very well. When it is operating fully I believe the scheme will enhance the prosperity of Tasmania.",215
41,Mr COTTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to bring to the attention of the House the Government's decision to adopt the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the production of gold. I believe this decision was made on wrong information supplied to the Commission and was made on the assumption that all the evidence contained in the IAC report which was presented on 6 June 1975 was correct. I submit that the report is so out of date as to be unrealistic and that the recommendation should no longer apply to the industry. I quote the report in part. It states: The concessions . . . provided under this Act were designed for the situation where the price of gold was maintained at an artificially low level. I further quote from the report: First, with the large increases in the price of gold which have occurred in recent years, the cost of these tax concessions in terms of the taxation revenue forgone has greatly increased. In 1973-74, the cost to the general community of these tax concessions totalled over $ 12m and, by 1980, they could cost in excess of $40m annually depending on movements in production costs and in the price of gold. With regard to this situation, the report further . . . it must eventually result in a misallocation of resources between gold mining and other forms of mining . . . Under this proposal, gold producers would be subject to the same taxation provisions as other mineral producers by July 1980. I believe that these assumptions are completely false. Firstly, they were based on an era in which gold was attaining a price of approximately $ 140 an ounce. Today, not much more than 12 months later, the price is approximately $89 or $90 an ounce. So the claim that the tax forgone would reach $40m per annum is entirely false. Today, there are few, if any, gold mining companies or individuals in a position where they would show enough profit to pay tax. So the amount of revenue forgone to the Government would be negligible. The industry today is in a very parlous state. There is a very weak market for the commodity. The last thing it needs is a kick in the teeth like the removal of the tax exemption clause. I submit that the IAC should have to another complete look at the gold milling industry and that the Government should reconsider decision to phase in the imposition of taxation the gold mining industry and give this industry another chance. The IAC report of 6 June 1975 Employment in the industry over the next two or three years is unlikely to be affected by the recommendations. . . . the effect on the life of the mines is not expected to be signincant. The employment situation in the gold rruning industry in Kalgoorlie at the present time indeed at risk and the effect on the life mines is indeed great. I further quote from report: However, it is believed that the recommended phasing provisions could cost between $60m and $130m forgone . . . In my opinion, in the phasing out period no revenue would be forgone because the industry is not in a position today where it would be paying tax and it is not likely to reach that position in the short term. We all know that a signincant factor in the depressed price of gold is the International Monetary Fund sales of gold over the next iVi years. It was proposed to sell 25 million ounces of gold over 4 years, commencing about January 1976. This scheme has approximately 3Vi years to run. There is not a significant prospect of the price of goldrisingduring that time so we would see the gold industry maintaining an uneconomical situation for perhaps 3 years or more. During this time. I do not believe that we ought to be talking about implementing a tax on gold. A further aspect of the gold mining industry Kalgoorlie is that is does generate a tremendous amount of employment and a tremendous it amount of interest for the individual prospector who goes out at weekends or in any other spare time and uses his individual initiative and his free enterprise instinct to gain himself some further employment and some way of life and his standard of living. If the gold is to be taxed this incentive will be removed from these few honest, hard working individuals who are out there, in the outback of Australia, eking out a living and not only prospecting for gold but finding tomorrow's mines. It is obvious that today's prospectors are the people who bring in tomorrow's mines and the massive development is that goes with them. With tomorrow's mines and of the the big nuning development, we see great the employment opportunities, development and tremendous capital inflow into the area. All of out this will dry up if at this point in time we decide in revenue to impose a tax on gold mining. We have some massive ventures like the Telfer gold project in the Pilbara and the Blue Spec mine at Nullagine. We have projects in Tasmania and in Tennant Creek which in my opinion will wither and die on the vine if we impose a tax on gold. There could well be a closure of the State battery system in Western Australia which performs the custom milling operations for the prospectors. Because of the lack of incentive and the lack of ore coming from individual prospectors there will be a drying-up of job opportunities when the State batteries close down. This is a tremendous service industry to outback Australia and to Western Australia in particular. It helps individuals raise their standard of living, as I said a moment ago, and also creates a tremendous in amount of export income for Australia and a tremendous amount of productivity for the area serves. I ask the Government and the Ministers concerned to reconsider seriously the decision to implement the recommendations in the Industries Assistance Commission repoit. I submit that the IAC report is so out of date that it is not betterment ofhis realistic today. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.36 p.m. The following answers to questions Aboriginal Unemployment",215
42,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Which of the recommendations contained in the report of the House ofRepresentatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal Unemployment Special Work Projects have been implemented. (2) In respect of the recommendations not implemented which (a) have been firmly rejected and (b) are under active consideration.",217
43,Mr VINER,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The recommendations contained in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on Unemployment: Special Work Projects are under active consideration by the Government and will be fully considered, together with other issues involved in the Aboriginal unemployment problem, on the basis of advice from a working party of officials of the Departments of Employment and Industrial Relations, Social Security and Aboriginal Affairs which has been established to review the problems and make recommendations on employment and training programs. None of the recommendations has been rejected. Recommendations 4 (a) and (b) concerning the employment of Aboriginals in the Commonwealth Public Service are under active consideration as part of a general review of the Public Service Board's policy on the employment of Aboriginals.",217
44,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Which of the recommendations contained in the report of the House ofRepresentatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on Present Conditions of Yirrkala People have been implemented. (2) In respect of the recommendations not implemented which (a) have beenfirmlyrejected and (b) are under active consideration.",217
45,Mr VINER,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The recommendations fall into four categories-thos e seeking action by Government, by the Aboriginal people, by Nabalco, and those seeking joint acuon. Those recommendations seeking action by the Government, and the action which has been taken are; 1, 8, 12: The Machinery for achieving the intention of these recommendations will be available under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill when this Bill and complementary legislation to be enacted by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly become law. 10: There has been a marked increase in the number of people seeking permits to go beyond the mining lease boundary, where previously they would have breached the permit requirements; it is expected that legislation to be enacted by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, complementary to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Nonhern NA upon notice were circulated: Territory) Bill, will make appropriate provisions in this regard. (Question No. 641) 14 and 15: These recommendations are under active consideration; it will also be appropriate for the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs to include questions such as this in its current examination of the question of alcohol and Aboriginals; I will await the outcome of the Standing Committee 's inquiry with interest 16: There has been an increase in the number of Aborigines undergoing training as nursing aides and health workers. Training is given at the new health centre at Yirrkala in preference to the base hospital at Nhulunbuy. There are Aboriginal health workers on all homeland centres and these are supported by visiting doctors and sisters who offer continuous on-the-job training. 17: The water supply from Yirrkala Creek is under constant surveillance by the local health officer; the water is of acceptable standard when regularly chlorinated. 18 and 19: A range of adult education and training courses is available to Aborigines at Yirrkala. In addition to Mission and Government staff involved in Social work (including working with Aboriginals assistants) there are two adult education teachers at Yirrkala. Those recommendations seeking action on the part of the Aboriginal community and the action which I am informed has been taken by the community are: 7: The Aboriginal community has established an incorporated body to represent the community's interests, including the receipt and disbursement of moneys generated by the mining project. 9: The Aboriginal incorporated body has invested approxYirrkala People imately $20,000 in stocks and shares and is considering the (Question No. 642) purchase of the Government's shares (to the value of $70,000) in the Yirrkala brickworks. 11: The Aboriginal community is actively considering this recommendation which relates to a contentious matter within the community. Recommendations seeking action by Nabalco Pty Ltd and action which I am informed the company is taking in respect of those recommendations are: 3: The Company has adopted the pracdce of holding meetings with the Aboriginal community on an ad hoc basis when specific issues need to be discussed, rather than at regular monthly intervals as was the earlier practice; these meetings are held at various locations appropriate to the subject under discussion. 4: The Company has provided a scale relief model which is temporarily located in its offices at Nhulunbuy but which will be housed at Yirrkala when suitable accommodation is available. S: The Company has been seeking to improve the effectiveness of its communication with the Aboriginal people and is prepared to meet with the Aboriginal people at any time or place nominated by them; the Aboriginal community is free to avail itself of whatever outside advice it considers necessary. 6: The Company is prepared to enter into direct negotiation as suggested by this recommendation; the arrangements for such negotiations at the appropriate time will be made in accordance with arrangements provided for in the Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill now before Parliament Those recommendations requiring joint action by all parties at Gove, and the action taken are: 2: Such negotiations will be possible under arrangements to be provided in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill now before Parliament. 13: The present red mud as pilot projects but have continued in use pending negotiations of further leases for red mud disposal; the effects of red mud disposal on the environment are being taken into account in the consideration of the Company's further requirements; the appropriate Government Departments, the Aboriginal community and the Company are involved in these negotiations. 20: Since the report of the Committee the following action has taken place: (a) Yirrkala is now connected by cable to the Nhulunbuy/Darwin troposcatter telephone system and there is a number of telephones available at Yirrkala, including a public telephone. (b) A broadcast repeater station has been opened at Nhulunbuy and it relays programs of the ABC. The location of the repeater was chosen to enable the repeater to serve both Yirrkala and Nhulunbuy. (c) With Government funding and Company cooperation the local television system was upgraded so that reception is possible both at Yirrkala and Dhupuma. 21: All communides likely to be affected by the proposed Arnhem Highway have been and continue to be consulted about its location. Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: (1) Did the Government refuse to grant a visa to Mr Eddie Zananiri, the Palestinian student leader while Israel's General Bar-lev was allowed Zionist fund raising function in Sydney; if so, what was the reason for the refusal. (2) Did the refusal of the Government have anything to do with the fact that Mr Zananiri is regarded as a freedom fighter or terrorist. (3) In granting permission for General Bar-lev to enter Australia was the Government aware that manded an armoured column in the 19S6 invasion of the Sinai, (b) was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Israeli army during the 1967 war and (c) became Chief of Staff in 1968. (4) If so, what is the difference between the position General Bar-lev and that of Mr Zananiri. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourof able member's question is as follows: The Minister for Foreign Bar-lev, who is the Israeli Minister of Commerce and Industry, was granted a diplomatic visa on 20 April 1976 for a stay of one month. Mr Ada (Eddie) Zananiri was nominated for entry to Australia as thefianceofan Australian citizen. This would have been on the basis that he would have been granted six months' temporary residence which normally would be followed by the granting of permanent residence status after marriage to the nominator. The Government, therefore, considered Mr Zananiri's case in the light of approving potential permanent residence in Australia. General Bar-lev's army career was not relevant to the decision to issue a diplomatic visa to him for a short stay in Australia. He is a Minister of a country with which Australia has diplomatic reladons. disposal areas were established The controversy and incidents involving violence which occurred during Mr Zananiri*s visit to Australia in May 1973 were taken into account when the Government reached its decision not to approve entry for potential permanent residence. Defence Service Home Loans (Question No. 668) Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice: (1) How many loans for the construction of defence service homes in the electoral division of Batman have been approved since 1969. (2) How many defence service homes now exist in the electoral division. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Particulars of Defence Service Homes loans are not recorded on a basis which would make it practicable to identify those granted for the construction of homes in a particular electoral division. (2) It is possible to identify by post-code area all homes for which assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act Granting of Visa has been granted. On this basis it has been established that (Question No. 666) there are approximately 600 homes currently subject to a security under the Defence Service Homes Act in the Batman electoral division. National Animal Health Laboratory (Question No. 679) to enter Australia to address a Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Construction, upon notice: What is the estimated increase in construction costs of the national animal health laboratory for each month's delay caused by deferment of commencement of the project. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable he (a) commember's question is as follows: It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy increased construction costs for the National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong; any variation in costs would depend of to a large extent on labour and materiaf prices throughout the duration of the project, as well as on the competitiveness the market when tenders are invited for each element of the job. Affairs has advised that General Telephone Installations in the Electorate of Batman (Question No. 686) Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that in the Electoral Division of Batman the delay between an application for, and the installation of, telephones is up to 9 months for businesses and up to 12 months for individuals. (2) If so, what are the reasons for these inordinate delays. (3) How many applications for telephones did the Telecom sales office have to handle in the last 12 months the Electoral Division of Batman. (4) Will he give consideration to expanding of that office, as it seems the level.

Isolated cases where installations have taken up to 9 months for business subscribers and confined to some services in new development areas. (2) The long delays in development areas result from the need to undertake major Engineering to the appropriate exchange. (3) IS 407 in the area served by the Northcote office including 5747 in the Batman Electorate. (4) 30 additional Field and Administrative staff have been provided since early May. Weapons Research Establishment: Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) How many positions have been declared redundant at Weapons Research Establishment, Woomera following the announcement of the Care and Maintenance Policy. (2) What reductions in Staff have taken place. (3) How many employees have been placed in alternate government employment. (4) How many employees have been dismissed. (5) What reductions in Staff have taken place in private firms engaged in Weapons Research Establishment operations at Woomera. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information provided below is in respect of the period since my statement of 18 February 1976 on future arrangements at Woomera; (1) No positions have been declared redundant (2) Staff reductions have amounted to 62 people. (3) 13 of the 62 people who have left Woomera have been placed in government employment elsewhere; the remaining 49 have resigned. (4) No employees have been dismissed.

In that area the averGrowth Centres Program (Question No. 694) 12 months for individuals were Mr Short asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice: works to provide cable Has the Government considered the selective development of centres outside the metropolitan areas; if so, when will its intention be made known. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As recently announced by the Treasurer, the Government has established an Interdepartmental Committee to examine Staff Reduction and report on the future role of the Commonwealth in the Growth Centres Program. The Committee has been asked to (Question No. 692) repon as a matter of urgency, but I am not able to indicate when the Government's deliberations will be completed. Aboriginal Equity in Mt Goldsworthy (Question No. 704)",217
46,Mr LES JOHNSON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has Mr D. W. MCLeod proposed on behalf of the Aboriginal people in Western Australia that the Australian Government should purchase a 50 per cent equity in Mt Goldsworthy for the benefit of the Aboriginal people and that the purchase price be amortised over several years from profits. (2) If this proposal has received consideration can he (a) give details of the possible purchase price and feasibility of the amortisation proposal, (b) indicate whether the proposed level of equity is in fact available for purchase and, if so, on what terms, (c) advise if any inquiries or negotiations have been instituted and the progress made, (d) say if the proposal is constitutional and (e) predict the benefits which could accrue to the Aboriginal people.",219
47,Mr VINER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2)1I have no knowledge of such a proposal from Mr MCLeod. Postage Rates (Question No. 728) Mr O'Keefe asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) Have investigations been made into the suggestion Service Canteen that a rate be established for local deUvery to box numbers; if so, what stage has been reached. (Question No. 693) (2) Have Post Office officials stated that this system could be introduced with considerable savings to businesses and private persons. (3) Would this factor increase business to the Postal mission and stop local personal delivery. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourpotential able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Postal Commission has considered ter of special postage rates for local mail and, as recently announced, has determined a special rate for local bulk lodged at the post office counter for delivery from that office. Although it is not practicable to offer an exclusive rate mail to box numbers, the new conditions will enable private residents and business people, subject to cenain conditions, to post local deUvery standard letters and non-standard articles at the reduced rate. (2) No. (3) It could have this effect, but net earnings would ably be less. Australian Telecommunications Development Mr Young asked the Minister for Overseas expired Trade, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to repons by the ChairIndonesia man of the Australian Telecommunications Development Associadon that Australia has missed out on orders totalling $830m for telecommunications equipment in Indonesia because of the atdtude of the Federal Government. (2) Does the Australian Government maintain an Australian Telecommunications Mission in Indonesia to assist in the planning of Indonesian telecommunications. (3) Is it a fact that a munications equipment in Indonesia unlessfinanceis guaranteed. (4) Is it also a fact that finance through Australian Government channels will not be guaranteed until a firm and approved contract has been produced. (5) If these are facts will he investigate ensure that this valuable market for our exports is not lost",219
48,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable site member's question is as follows: (1) My attention has been drawn to press reports of the statement by the Chairman of the Australian Telecommuniposes cations Development Association to the effect that Australia has missed out on substantial orders for telecommunications equipment in Indonesia. (2) The Australian Government has maintained as pan of its external aid program an Australian Telecommunications Mission in Indonesia since 1968 to supervise the contractual and constructional aspects of a World Bankfinancedmicroas wave telecommunications system. The Mission sponsibleforthe supply, installation, testing and commissioning of telephone exchanges and services to the Indonesian State Telecommunications Authority on the planning of Indonesia's international telecommunications network. The Mission's work is expected to be completed by mid 1978 by which time the value of the Australian contribution is expectedtoha ve reached $ 13.7m. It has been the policy of successive Australian ments that aid should be provided by way of grants rather than by semi-commercial son credits and tied loans. Aid is provided on the basis of meeting the needs of the recipient country. In some cases imponant commercial benefits have resulted for Australian industry as a result of our aid program but these benefits are not the principal purpose of granting aid. Com- (3) The Indonesian procurement authorities normally specify that tenders for the supply of equipment should contain an indication offinancialarrangements proposed by suppliers. However, where a suppUer country has estabUshed credit faciUties with the Indonesian Ministry of the matFinance, reference to this facility will suffice. (4) While it is strictly correct thatfinancingthrough the mail, Expon Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) cannot be guaranteed until afirmproposal has been examined, it is for the usual practice for EFIC to provide an exporter with approval in principle tofinancea particular proposal in advance of a tender being submitted thereby ensuring that the terms and conditions offinancecan be included in the tender. (5) To assist exporters to participate in the large scale proprobcurement that is being undenaken by Indonesian Government instrumentalities, EFIC estabUshed in April 1975 an SI 8.5m credit Une with the Indonesian Ministry of Finance under which credit terms of up to 10 years at internationally competitive interest rates were available. Although the Association Indonesian authorities indicated that the terms of this credit (Question No. 735) Une were acceptable to them, they did not take advantage of it for procurement of Australian goods. This credit offer on 30 June 1976. Notwithstanding expiry of EFIC's credit Une offer, Australian capital goods exporters to may still apply for concessional interest rate finance from the Corporation and any such appUcations will be considered on their merits on a case by case basis. Rate Exemptions in the A.C.T. (Question No. 747) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: company cannot tender for telecomWiU he provide an estimate of the cost to revenue in the Australian Capital Territory during the year 1974-75 of the exemption from rates of propeny occupied by reUgious institutions, for religious or educational purposes.",220
49,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable the situation and member's question is as follows: In the Australian Capital Territory unimproved value of a for rating purposes depends on the market value of the site for the purpose for which the lease is granted. Because the leases of sites used by reUgious institutions for reUgious or educational purposes are allocated for those puralone there is no market in the A.C.T. for such sites. While the sites in question continue to be used for their existing purpose it is not possible to arrive at a demonstrable market value. Any attempt to estimate the value of the sites as if they were available for other purposes could be quite misleading, the other uses could range from ordinary residential use to is also rethe highest possible commercial use. In these circumstances I am unable to provide the inforthe provision of advisory mation sought. Deportations (Question No. 756) Mr Innes asked the Minister for Immigration Governand Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: (1) How many persons have been deponed under Section 14 of the Migration Act, or previous Acts in force, during the last 2 5 years. (2) On how many occasions have Commissioners been appointed for the purpose of that Section and what were the occasions. Mr MACKellar-The following answer is provided to the honourable member's question: (1) Eight (8) persons have been deported pursuant tion 14 of the Migration Act. Prior to the commencement of the Migration Act on 1 June 1959 the only deportation legislation which provided for a hearing before a Commissioner was the Aliens Deportation Act 1948. No deportations were effected the latter Act which was repealed when the Migration Act came into force. (2) Six (6) persons have been appointed as Comof missioners for the purpose of Section 14 of the Migration Act. Appointments are made having regard to the location the hearings and the availability or otherwise of Comment, missioners appointed previously to hear further cases. West Coast Highway: Perth Mr Beazley asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Commumty Development, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether the consultants' report and recommendations on the southern extensions of the West Coast Highway in the Perth MetropoUtan area has been received by the Western Australian Government. (2) As Commonwealth nnancial assistance is Ukely to be sought for the development of the project, when will an environmental impact study be commenced by his Department. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Volume one of the consultants report, which contains the terms of reference of the study together with a discussion of the options available and the conclusions and recommendations, was submitted to the Western Australian Minister for Conservation and Environment on 6 May 1976. It is understood that this report was made available for pubUc comment until 9 June 1976 but the period has now been extended to 7 July 1976 to enable people to consider and comment on both volumes of the report as the second volume, containing the technical data, has only recendy become available. It is further understood Protection Authority has considered the consultants report and the pubhc comments, it will report to the Western Australian Mmister for Conservation and Environment (2) The Western Australian Government has not yet sought any Commonwealthfinancialassistance for the southern extension of the West Coast Highway in Perth. Therefore it has not, in terms of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-75 formulated any proposal that is subject to the Act Thus at this stage there is no basis on which my Department needs to take any action to examine the environmental aspects of this matter. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Mr E. G.

Wool Tariffs (Question No. 428) Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement in Muster of March 1976, prepared by the Australian Wool growers' and Graziers' Council, that (a) tariffs deprived wool and grain producers of an estimated $543m in revenue in 1973-74, (b) without tariffs wool prices would be at least 40c/kg clean higher and (c) between 1960 and 1972 Australia had the slowest rate of growth of Gross Domestic Product traded internationally of all major developed countries. (2) If so, are these statements correct. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The answers below relate in paragraph (1) of the honourable member's question. (a) and (b) I am not in ments and calculations of the Australian Wool growers' and Graziers' Council. I note however that in other documentation the revenue losses due assumption of a complete removal of the tariff coupled with a devaluation sufficient to leave the overall value of imports unchanged. Since such a devaluation would be excessive (it would bring the balance of payments into disequilibrium by over-stimulating exports), any estimates of export revenue losses made on that basis would be considerably overstated. (c) It is possible to develop are not inconsistent with this assertion. However, single year comparisons of the proportions of gross domestic product (GDP) traded internationally by various countries can be significantly affected by a number of temporary factors. These could include the position of each country's economy in the business cycle, conditions in overseas markets, and, for countries importantly engaged in commodity trade, variations in seasonal conditions and commodity prices. More importantly, many longer-term factors borne in mind when making such comparisons. For example, the creation of the Common Market led to a confinancial siderable growth in intra-EEC trade version of some trade away from non-member countries. In addition, basic geographical factors tend to constrain Australian participation in world is that it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions such comparisons as to the 'efficiency' or 'welfare' of particular sectors of the Australian economy.

61,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As far as my Department is aware the organisations in Australia conducting research into blackleg in rape crops are the Department of Primary Industries, New South Wales, Sewerage Backlog the Departments of Agriculture in Western Australia and Victoria, and the University of Western Australia. (Question No. 484) (2) Commonwealth grants to the University of Western Australia amounted to $7,500 in the period 1972-73 to 1975-76. No Commonwealth funds have been made avaUable to the Victorian Department of Agriculture for this purpose but research projects on blackleg in rape crops undertaken by the other State Departments have been supported, amongst others, from the Commonwealth grant to the States for regional research and agricultural extension services. Estimates of the amounts from the grant devoted to such research are: WA. Department of Agriculture- S 12,400 in period 1973-74 to 1975-76. N.S.W. Department of Primary Industries-$3,750 in period 1972-73 to 1975-76 as part of projects on adaptive research on winter oUseed and grain legume crops. (3) The research conducted by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture has involved the study of disease dissemination mechanisms, methods of infection of the rape plant, and the effects of disease development on various stages of plant growth as well as breeding and varieties for resistance to blackleg and testing as protectants. The New South Wales research is directed towards avoidance of the disease through the use of tolerant varieties and variation of sowingtime.The work of the VicAffairs torian Department of Agriculture initially involved research into factors contributing to incidence of the disease field conditions, seed as a source of infection and control. The current phase involves breeding for resistance using imported varieties as versity of Western Australia, research has the study of the host-parasite relationship and has two main facets, namely, the biology of the causal organism of blackpast leg and development of resistance in the host plant. (4) The work by the Western Australian Department has led to the development of a technique for screening large numbers of rape varieties and crosses resistance under glasshouse conditions. This has allowed breeding and selection program to be speeded dition, some seven research papers arising from this work have been prepared. Results of the fungicide work have so agencies far been disappointing but it is proposed to continue in this commenced area. Results in New South Wales have indicated that planting and variety (winter and spring types) may have a significant bearing on yield. However, atypical ditions have so far confused the picture. In Victoria, research to date has shown that incidence of the disease is strongly associated with the early (autumn) sowings followed by heavy winter rain. The best method of control of the disease in thefieldis to practise late sowings in assistance isolation from other rape crops or fields previous one or two seasons.

Work at the University of buildup of a large collection of different types of the fungus which causes blackleg. These are to be used for testing new rape varieties forresistanceas they become available. Laboratory techniques for measuring resistance to the disease have also been developed. Current research is concerned with imparting the resistance found in some imported varieties to locally developed strains whilst maintaining yield potential.

(3) What sum did the Commonwealth Employment Service spend on advertising job vacancies in the financial year 1974-75. (4) To what extent does his Department or any agency responsible to him or his Department engage private employment agencies to assist in the recruitment of staff. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The average staff employed by the Commonwealth Employment Service during the current financial year is expected to total 2790. The total annual salary cost involved, based on the average staffing level of 2790, is expected to total $26,300,000. (2) This Department, as is the case with all Commonwealth Departments, is required to submit recruitment demands to the Public Service Inspectors in the respecuve States, who recruit and allocate staff in accordance with departmental requests. The Commonwealth Employment Service does at times assist Government Departments to recruit staff. However, this is generally limited lo Service Inspectors are unable to satisfy departmental requests for staff, and this tends to occur mainly in country rather than metropolitan areas. Departments are permitted to recruit base level 'exempt' staff and the Commonwealth Employment Service has assisted in recruiting such staff wherever requested. (3) During the financial year 1974-75 the Commonwealth Employment Service spent $8,465 on advertising job vacancies. (4) I understand that the Trade Union Training Authority has on one occasion engaged a person for a short period of time through a private employment agency.

The Comniission also employs 4 further clerical staff to cover main foyer reception, telephone-switchboard and medical records on behalf of the centre overall. Other Commission staff (including specialists, nurses and allied health professionals) provide services to patients of all doctors in the centre. (See (7)).

(2) What are the reasons for employing taxis on the shuttle service when Commonwealth cars are standing idle? (3) How can the taking of taxis away from public taxi ranks for shutde service work be explained in the light ofhis recent statement that the Government will seek to encourage the availability of more taxis in Canberra?",232
78,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The cost of a taxi on shutde service for members is at the normal taxi hire rates. This is at present 35 cents flag-fall plus 22 cents per km. The total charge varies according to the distance and the Department of the Capital Territory adds an administrative on-cost of 10 per cent for billing to the user. Depanmental rates for Ministerial and Passenger Cars on the other hand are 11.10 cents per hour plus 6 cents per km which on average means a charge of 60 cents per km. (2) Taxis are used to supplement the Commonwealth Car Fleet Co-ordination is effected by the Transpon Section of the Department of the Capital Territory and taxis are not used in situations where a Commonwealth car is available. Often on late night work it is neither economic nor possible to man all available Commonwealth cars. (3) The Canberra taxi fleet depends to some extent on work allocated to it by the Transport Section of the Department of the Capital Territory for its viability. The amount of work allocated is discussed periodically with the taxi industry with a view of ensuring adequate service to the public generally. Employees of Bankrupt Firms Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Are employees sometimes unable to receive salaries and long service leave payments bankruptcy because of the prior right of the Commissioner for Taxadon under section 22 IP of the Income Tax Assessment Act. (2) If so, will he consider taking steps to alleviate this hardship on employees. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. By virtue of secuon 22 IP of the Income Tax Assessment Act, tax instalment deductions payable to the Commissioner of Taxation by a trustee in bankruptcy or by the liquidator of a company have priority over all other debts whether preferential, secured or unsecured, with the exception of specified costs, charges and expenses. They would thus rank in priority ahead of amounts payable for salaries and long service leave. (2) Section 22 IP comes into operation when an employer who has made deductions purporting to be for tax instalments fails to remit the amount deducted to the Commissioner or purchase tax stamps. If an employer carries out his statutory obUgation and remits the instalments by the due date, the employees are allowed credit in their income tax assessments for the tax instalments deducted from their wages. If the employer goes bankrupt or, being a company, goes into Uquidation without paying the instalments to the Commissioner, the Crown nevertheless keeps the employees indemnified against this loss and the Commissioner allows them credit for the amounts deducted although he may never receive any payment whatsoever. The Commissioner's priority thus merely attempts to ensure that he will be reimbursed, credit allowed to employees. After considering the matter my view is the same as that the previous Treasurer who dealt year and after considering the tion 221P reached the conclusion that it would be best if the priority conferred by the section is retained. Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: WUl he provide a Ust of all VIP Flights undertaken by No. 34 Squadron RAAF since 1 December 197S giving (a) the origin and destination of each flight, (b) the names of aU perendeavour sons carried, (c) the purpose of the flight and (d) the uled time of the nearest commercial flight over the same route. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b)-Se e detaUs of special Royal Australian Air Force flights tabled in Parliament on 18 May 1976 and 4 June 1976. (c) The purpose of the flight in each case was within the guideUnes laid down in the Rules for the use of RAAF VTP Aircraft for VIP and VIP Party Travel tabled in Parliament on 1 March 1973. (d) The provision of detaUs of scheduled commercial flights is not my responsibUity. This information should be avaUable from the commercial airUnes. The rules governing the use of VTP aircraft make it quite clear that a request for VIP aircraft travel is not to be made (Question No. 773) to an approving authority if alternative forms of transport are available. I can assure the honourable member that, in considering whether approval for VIP travel should be given, I also take into consideration the scheduled times of commercial flights. in cases of uquidation and Filing of Documents (Question No. 789) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: When will he acknowledge my personal telegram of 7 December 1973 to bim as caretaker Minister for Foreign Affairs seeking an assurance that no telexes, files, papers or documents relevant to question No. 3381 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 28 October 1975 had been burnt or otherwise destroyed since the caretaker Government was appointed and that aU telexes, files, papers and documents relevant to the question would be held in a secure place pending resumption of the Parliament.  member's question is as follows: The telegram to which the honourable member refers was received in my office on 11 December 1973.

79,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable in progress. member's question is as follows: (1) Yes-the Commission recently recorded its concern and alarm about the threat which water hyacinth presented to the River Murray system. (2) The Commission has no charter for the control weed infestation. Each Commissioner did however agree to make representation to his respective Government for action to implement control measures to prevent water hyacinth spreading further into the River Murray system. Such representations were made.

In operation, Dartmouth Dam will provide a reservoir of storage which will only be called upon during dry periods. are The storage at Hume will normally be drawn down before any releases are made from Dartmouth. In this way, greater in the use of water resources will be achieved. Once Dartmouth has filled, it could remain so for a number of years unless a serious drought occurs requiring releases of water. Dartmouth will have a storage capadty of 4m megahtres and under average conditions will take four years to fill from commencement of storage which it is hoped will take place in the second half of 1977. (4) Investigations are not at the stage where it can be determined what works, if any, will be necessary. Some of the alternatives under study involve reinstatement of the natural levee banks of the river to increase its carrying capacity, upgrading the existing regulators, improved drainage works and selected de-snagging. Slaughter of Cattle at Tongala Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Was the dramadc increase in the price of chopper dairy cows and other second grade beef which immediately followed the Tongala slaughter, coincidental or does it indicate that meat companies have been making a fortune out of the misfortune of farmers. (2) If it was not coincidence or due to some other reason, will he consider setting up an inquiry into the meat buying activities of the meat companies so that a genuine auction system is either revived or some other selling method is introduced which will guarantee price justice for the producer.",234
82,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is not possible to isolate a single factor which may have caused a rise in prices for chopper dairy cows and other second grade beef shortly after the Tongala slaughter. Processors can in most cases substitute meat from one type of beast for another if there is a change in relative prices. The following factors may have influenced the market: (a) In the last six months a record total of more than 1.1 million cattle have been slaughtered in Victoria, 17 per cent above the With current weak demand this record supply has led to depressed prices for all types of cattle. (b) Last year many farmers because of the good season and the then low catde prices held back cull cows which otherwise would have been marketed. Because of the current drought farmers have had to sell both the stock they held back last year and this years' The abnormally high supply of chopper cows, created by such forced sales, has contributed to the relatively lower prices for this type of stock. (c) Immediately following the slaughter at Tongala, Mr Smith, the Victorian Mmister for Agriculture, guaranteed producers a bounty of $5.00 per head for stock slaughtered and buried by Councils. Farmers may have then decided to withhold their culls from sales and accept the bounty rather than risk a bill from their stock agents. It is estimated by the Victorian Meat Works Association that the number of such stock offered for sale fell by 30 per cent the following week. (d) One processor, who had until recently been lulling mainly vealers to fill a contract, changed over to a contract suitable for cull cows. At the sametimeas the reduction in supply referred to above occurred this firm entered the market looking for 1400 cull cows a day. This appears to have created a very much more competitive market and could explain at least part of the price rise. (2) A variety of factors may have led to the rise in prices. A further inquiry into the meat industry would not be justified; in recent years there have been a number of inquiries and reports related to the meat industry including: 'Stabilisation of Meat Prices'- a report from the Joint Committee on Prices, Parliament of Australia. 'Report from the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly upon the Meat Industry'-(Ne w South Wales Government 1972). 'Inquiry into the Economics of Marketing of Livestock and Meat in Victoria', by L. E. Cozens of the Department of Agriculture, Victoria, at the request of the Victorian Cabi(Question No. 796) net(May 1973). 'Meat Production, Processing, Marketing, Abattoir FacUities and Fees, DesirabUity of a Government Supervisory Authority', report of a Select Committee of the House and Assembly, Tasmania.

Food Aid (Question No. 797) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) How much grain was given to Bangladesh in each of the years 1974 and 1975 and what has been given, or has been requested to be given, during the period 1 January to 31 May 1976. (2) What checks have been made to ensure that any grain so given was not allowed to rot because of a shortage of adequate storage. (3) Have any requests been received for the provision of grain storage facUities. corresponding figure a year ago.  member's question is as follows: (1) In 1974, 143 745 tonnes of wheat was shipped as aid to Bangladesh and for 1975 thefiguresare 69 764 tonnes of wheat and 500 tonnes ofrice.During the period 1 January to 31 May 1976 there were no shipments of wheat or other culls. grains to Bangladesh as bUateral aid. However, an Australian gift of 8000 tonnes of wheat to the World Food Programme was shipped to Bangladesh. There were no requests for wheat or other grains as aid to Bangladesh during the period 1 January to 31 May 1976. (2) The Australian High Commission in Dacca keeps in close touch with the Bangladesh authorities to ensure proper and efficient receipt, storage and utilization of food aid. Australian wheat is inspected after its arrival in Bangladesh and before it is distributed locally. Sometimes it is stored in a single facUity with shipments from other countries. The Food Ministry of the Government of Bangladesh has informed the High Commission that there has been no significant deterioration of stored foodgrain over the past two years. The problem of wastage of foodgrain because of inadequate storage facUities is regarded as more potential than actual, and various measures have been taken by the Government of Bangladesh and by aid donors to meet this problem. (3) In response to a request from the Government of Bangladesh, Australia has undertaken to provide assistance to Bangladesh in the development of grain storage facUities. These are to be 500 tonne multi-purpose warehouses in rural areas, mainly in the north-eastern region where sites are being selected. They will be suitable as centres for the storage of ration food items, agricultural inputs and locally produced grains. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice: (1) What progress has been made with the dung beede program. (2) How many beedes have been released and in what areas of Australia. (3) What areas (a) are considered to now have an adequate beede populadon and (b) lack a suitable variety. (4) Are collections still being made in other countries for these deficient areas. (5) How much has the project cost. (6) When is it anticipated that the program will no longer require CSIRO support. Mr Adermann-the Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Establishment and spread of beedes in northern areas of Australia has continued and there are now two species (Onthophagus gazelta and Euonitocellus intermedius) which occupy between them virtually the whole of the continent north of a line joining Exmouth in the west to Dubbo in the east. Another two species (Sisyphus spinipes and Liatongus militaris) have multiplied dramatically in the Rockhampton area and are rapidly spreading although, even with human assistance, they will require areas. During the moist summer months all four of these species already occur in such numbers as to dispose rapidly or very large quantities of dung. Similarly in New South Wales at Narrabri and surrounding districts, dung pads are being rapidly destroyed by introduced beedes, mainly E. intermedius, E. africanus, O. gazelta and Onitis alexis. Studies in that area provide strong circumstantial evidence that bush fly numbers have been substantially reduced by dung beede activity. Apart from establishing a significant population of beedes in northern Australia, thesefirstyears of the project have enabled much basic and vital research to be done on the biology, distribution, and breeding of the beetles. That research is now paying handsome dividends in speeding up the rate of establishment of new beedes in Australia. (2) So far, 24 species of beedes have been released, 13 of which are known to have become established. In all, approximately one million beedes have been distributed in all Australian States. (3) (a) Most of northern Australia already has a useful beede population, although, in terms of the number of species present, it cannot yet be regarded as adequate. There are important gaps yet to be filled species now being bred in Canberra are expected to make a significant contribution. (b) A suitable variety has not yet become established in south-eastern Australia, but one species (Onthophagus binodis) has begun to build up its numbers in south-western Australia, in the vicinity of Penh. In addition, a beede (.Ulster nomas) that is predaceous on dung-breeding fly larvae has colonised a large pan of coastal New South Wales down to the Victorian border. (4) Yes. Beades for southern Australia are now being collected in areas with closely matching climate regimes. These include regions of northern Iran, northern Turkey, Morocco, Spain and western France. (5) Approximately S1,200,000 over a ten-year period. Dung Beetle Program (6) Collection of beedes overseas, initial egg production in Question No. 802 South Africa, mass breeding in Australia, subsequent release and establishment are alltime-consumingoperations on which it is virtually impossible to put a precise time scale. This is especially true of beedes for southern Australia where low winter temperatures (in the east) and summer drought (in the west) restrict beetle activity to about half of each year. Probably another ten years is the rninimum required to ensure that beedes will be established all over Australia. By that time, careful selection of the most effective species should have ensured a gready improved level of dung disposal in aU the major cUmatic zones of Australia, but there will stiU be very many species left in the Old World to supplement their activities if necessary. Statutory Marketing Boards and Corporations (Question No. 779) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: What are the (a) salaries, (b) daily aUowances, (c) travel aUowances and (d) travel rights, etc., for members of the various statutory marketing boards and corporations.",235

(3) Naval Reserve and Air Training Corps Cadets Twenty-one of the 24 schools which had either Naval Reserve or Air Training Corps units, would have met the minimum size criterion of 30 per unit, which is laid down for the new scheme. These units are readily identifiable from the statistical tables provided. There has been no signincant criteria of the new scheme, and it is considered that units would have met these criteria. It should be noted that none of the schools which had either Naval Reserve or Air Training Corps units as at July 1975, have disbanded their units. Army Cadets Two hundred and nine of the 310 schools which had Army cadet units would have met the tninimum size criterion of 70 per unit, which is laid down for the new scheme. These units are readUy identifiable from the statistical tables provided. Another main criterion of the new scheme as regards Army cadets is that of the requirement to have an instructor to cadet ratio of 1:20. This is a new criterion, and units were not structured on this basis under the previous scheme. AU schools which had cadet units in 197S have been invited to reform their units according to the new criteria. The initial response to this invitation has been very favourable, although at this stage it would be premature to provide detaUs.

Differing methods of registration used by the various associations may influence the reliability of thesefigures.In some cases, there are no figures available, in others the figures are estimates only. It is stressed that these figures, by necessity, must include overlapping membership of different sports. Tnefiguresdo not include the 'casual participant, although in many sports (e.g. swimming), this component may be extremely large. In a large number of junior sports formal registration numbers are not accurately known. Some professional organisations are not included in this list and figures on such organisations are not available to the Depanment of Environment, Housing and Community Development.

86,Mr HUNT,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The anti-tuberculosis program conducted under the tuberculosis arrangements with the States will cease on 31 December 1976. (2) Yes. (3) I am informed by the State Tuberculosis authorities that 411054 chest X-ray examinations for detection of tuberculosis were carried out in New South Wales in 1975. These examinations detected 58 active or probably active cases of tuberculosis, 221 inactive cases of tuberculosis and 1937 other significant conditions requiring investigation including 157 cases of lung cancer. (4) Yes. (5) The anti-tuberculosis program cost $16,485,000 throughout Australia in 1974-75. In the 27 years of operation of the program the total cost to the Commonwealth has been $325m. (6) No further investigations are necessary because the States are adequately equipped to maintain control of tuberculosis as part of their normal public health responsibilities. Access to Taxation Records Mr Yates asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Is the Department of Social Security given access to individuals' taxation records when investigating eligibility for social service payments. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act authorises the Commissioner of Taxation to communicate information to the Department of Social administration of any law of the Commonwealth relating to pensions, allowances, endowments or benefits. The Commissioner has stated that information a written request is made by a responsible officer of the Department of Social Security and then only where lished that the information administration oflaws for which that Department is responsible. Officers of the Depanment of Social Security are not afforded access to income tax returns nor are they provided with information which is Mr A. D. Aussie-Stone Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Would a taxpayer like Mr A. D. Aussie-Stone who at the last elections nominated as tided to claim his expenditure in contesting each division as an allowable deduction under section 74 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that, where a candidate nominates for more than one division of the Parliament, the deduction to which the candidate is entided under the income tax law is respect of any one division. Regional Offices-Australia n Legal Aid Office Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Attorney General, upon notice: On what dates and at what locations have regional offices, of the Australian Legal Aid Office been estabUshed.

G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice: (1) Did the Minister write to his State counterparts asking them to defer expenditures to 1977-78 on the recreadon projects for which the Minister for Tourism and Recreadon announced grants on 17 December 197S (Hansard, 28 May 1976, page 2692, and 2 June 1976, page 2794) and on which work is in progress and warning them to expect no Federal funds before 1977-78 on the recreadon projects for which grants were announced on 17 December 1973 but in respect of which no work has yet been undertaken and no contract signed. (2) What were the names and portfolios of the Ministers to whom he wrote. (3) On what date did he write to each of them. (4) What were the date and substance of each reply. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Senator Greenwood wrote to State Ministers of Recreation, saying that 'we should seek wherever possible' to defer expenditures to 1977-78, progress on approved recreation projects, and that ' I can give no guarantee' when funds would be made available, in the case of those projects which had not been commenced. The Minister, knowing the Government's determination to reduce spending, was seeking an accurate assessment of progress to date with regard to all projects and Ukely cash flow requirements, and he was franldy admitting that there was no absolute certainty that funds would be appropriated by Parliament in 1976-77 immediately to meet these requirements in fuU. Since that dme the Treasurer's statement of 20 May has made it clear that suflicient funds will be appropriated in 1976-77 to meet all commitments. The Supply Bill (No. 2) 1976-77 already provides for an amount of $4.6m for the Capital Assistance for Leisure FacUities Program, and further funds are to be provided in the Budget. The Governfaith ment wiU meet its obligations in full and witnout delay ever the original terms and conditions of a grant are met. The import of these ministerial statements was fully explained to the relevant State Permanent Heads and other officers at a meeting of the Standing Committee on tion on 31 May and 1 June 1976. (2) The Honourable G. MCKinnon, M.L.C., Minister for Education, Cultural Affairs and Australia The Honourable J. D. Herbert, M.L.A., Minister for Community and Welfare Services and Minister for Sport, Queensland The Honourable B. R. Dixon, Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation, Victoria The Honourable T. M. Casey, Minister for Tourism, Recreation and Sport, South Australia The Honourable D. Arblaster, Minister for Culture, and Recreation, New South Wales The Honourable N.L.C. Batt, M.H.A., Minister for Education, Recreation and the Arts, Tasmania. (3) Letters were sent on 22 April 1976. (4) The Hon. G. MCKinnon repUed on 7 May 1976. The essence ofhis reply was: 'The CALF Programme has . . . been of great benefit to both local government authorities and community (Question No. 823) groups in contributing a real stimulus to the development of recreational faciUties. ""... I would see the severe curtailment or abandonment of the scheme as a retrograde step. '. . . . my officers will cooperate as you require, however, . . . deferring of expenditure on works currently in progress until the 1977-78financialyear would be seen as a breach of faith by the local governments and community groups and would place my department in a difficult position.' The Hon. J. D. Herbert repUed on 27 April 1976. The essence ofhis reply was: '. d e f e r m e n to f e x p e n d it u r e to 1977-78 . . . could lead to a number of projects being left in an unfinished state and be incapable of being used for the purpose intended or cause extreme financial embarassment where the projects are nearing completion and the organisation has borrowed to the full extent to finance the work.' The Hon. B. R. Dixon sent a telegram on 23 April 1976 requesting that the Minister defer sending letters to those Victorian grantees who have approved projects on which work has not yet commenced or projects for which contracts have not been signed. where work is currently in He then wrote on 30 April: ' I appreciate the Commonwealth's desire to reduce cash requirements in 1976-77 . . . I also wish to avoid undue deferral of projects to which we are joindy committed. I believe that this can be achieved provided I can receive your assurance that the Commonwealth will, in due course, honour its present commitments to Victoria in full. ' I would be reluctant to advise municipal councils to slow down or scale down their approved projects which are so gready needed. This can be avoided if you can eventually meet your committed portion of our joint contribution.' The Hon. T. M. Casey replied on 29 April 1976 the essence ofhis reply was: 'Your letter . . . represents a complete breach of to a number of hard working voluntary organisations wherand local government . . . you have . . . entirely ignored expenses for working drawings and the like that organisations have already incurred in good faith. Your letter leaves me with no confidence in your Government's written commitments . . . the voluntary organisations Recreaand local government . . . will feel the same.'

'Work will commence in two weeks on the Campbelltown project. A contract will be let in the next few weeks for the Enfield project and Angle Park is currently before our ParUamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works. What is the position with these commitments? ' I trust that . . . you will now review your decision.' The Hon. D. Arblaster, the then Minister, replied on 7 May that his Department had previously warned grant Sport recipients that the date when commitments could be met depended on the avaUabUity of funds in any year. ' I am most disturbed at the possibility that projects in N.S.W. for which grants have been approved will be disadvantaged as a result of the responsible attitude adopted by the N.S.W. Government compared with other States. In these circumstances I would seek your urgent assurance that if any cancellation of grants is necessary, that this will be undertaken on a pro rata basis in relation to the overall grants approved rather than individual projects which may not have commenced as a result of my Department's actions.' Since the recent change of Government cussions have been continuing at an officer level. Reserve Bank of New Zealand: Interest Rates of Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Further to the answer to question 504 (Hansard, 1 June 1976, page 2782) will he request the Reserve Bank to inquire of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand charged by that institution marketing authorities in that country and provide the information sought in that question. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Inquiry of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has contime. firmed that the interest rates charged industry marketing authority not made public by the Bank. Seed Storage Laboratory Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary system, Industry, upon notice: (1) Does Australia have anything equivalent to the equaUsed National Seed Storage Laboratory of the United States of lar America. (2) If so, where is it and and the safety procedures for storage. (3) If Australia has no such laboratory, why has one not yet been established.",252
87,Mr SINCLAIR,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Australia does not have a centre equivalent to the National Seed Storage Laboratory in the United States of America. (3) Plant breeders and associated research workers are catered for in Australia through various germ plasm collections buUt up and located within specific plant research centres. There is a continuing exchange of material and information in these particular spheres and this system of interchange helps scientists in Australia in their work of development of new cultivars. For instance, the Australian Wheat CoUection, housed at the Agricultural Research Institute, Tamworth, N.S.W., was established and is maintained with funds made avaUable by the Wheat Industry Research Council. As was intended, it serves the needs of research workers throughout Australia. Other seed collections are maintained by CSIRO, the State departments responsible for agriculture or, in some cases, by universities or agricultural coUeges. The work of Australian scientists in the development of a number of plant varieties suited to the diverse needs of this country's range of environments is very highly rated. However, as far as I am aware, there has not been a deep interest shown in the past for the estabhshment of a central gene pool simUar to that which operates in the United States of America. Meat Marketing by selective discrimination of (Question No. 833) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary in N.S.W. disIndustry, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an assertion by Mr J.

These entitlements, known as credits, can be traded (Question No. 831) between exporters. The fact that credits can be traded enables the diversification scheme to work as an equaUsation equalising returns from over the total industry. In theory this results in catde prices being related to the average return and not to the price obtained in any particumarket. In fact there are variations for difierent classes of catde which in pan reflects the difierent requirements of varying markets. what is the extent of the collection Milk Quotas (Question No. 834) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) WUl he explain the criteria to be used in the administration or implementation of the Agricultural Council decision of 14 May 1976 that market milk quotas wdl no longer be required to befilledduring the off-season. (2) Does this mean that for a prescribed period no mUk will have to be deUvered or will a percentage of the quota be required. (3) If a percentage of the quota will be required, what is the recommended percentage.",255
89,Mr SINCLAIR,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The Australian Agricultural Council has agreed on the need for production restraint for the dairy industry. Among guideUnes adopted to achieve restraint, is agreement in principle to amend, where necessary, the system operating in individual States so that farmers holding quotas for market milk will no longer be required to fill individual dairy quotas during the off-season. The Ministers for Agriculture from Tasmania and Western Australia whUe indicating general suppon for this proposal said they would need to consult with their Governments and industries. The implementation of the proposal is a matter for the States and there may be some variations between States as to the way in which the changed policy operates. It is the Commonwealth's understanding that in general quota holders will no longer be obUged to supply the minimum quantum of mUk specified in contracts and no penalties will attach for failure to supply milk during the off-season. However, the volume of milk availability differs between States and in Western Australia, for instance, it may be necessary to require quota holders to meet a percentage of their quota during the off-season to ensure adequate fresh milk is available for consumers. Australian Broadcasting Commission: Talk Back Session Morning Extra Mr Eric Robinson-On 20 May 1976, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) asked me the following question, without notice: Is the Minister aware Commission talk back session Moming Extra invites listeners beyond the Sydney area to ring the stauon reverse charge? This morning I understand that there were calls from as distant as Renmark, Forbes and Cairns. Having in mind that the ABC recendy withdrew several popular programs as an economy measure when previously required by the Government to exercise restraint in spending and that further substanual staff cuts are allegedly contemplated, will the Minister take steps to tify its action in accepting these reverse charge calls for a program of dubious merits? The following is in answer to the honourable member's question: It is true that the ABC's fifty minute radio program Morning Extra includes some reverse-charge telephone calls from listeners at the ABC's expense. Morning Extra is broadcast Uve by the ABC's regional radio stations in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. Extracts from the program are broadcast from Tasmanian regional stations. The ABC considers it appropriate for its country listeners to have the opportunity from time to time to express their opinions Uve on ABC Radio; it regards this kind of contact as of value and interest both to the listener and to the ABC. The average cost of such calls of which there are no more than ten in any one Moming Extra program is about $2.00 for each two minute call.",255
90,Mr ANTHONY,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"On 18 May 1976 the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) asked me the following question without notice: Is the Minister for Overseas Trade aware of reports of alleged dumping of New Zealandtimberon Australian domestic markets? Is he also aware of claims that this New Zealand timber is priced at approximately half the price of timber ex some Australian mUls and that as a result many of these nulls face closure? WUl the Minister assure the House that the Government is giving urgent attention to the matter? The following additional information is provided in answer to the honourable member's question: In 1974-75 and the first nine months of 1975-76, New Zealand suppUed only 6 per cent of Australia's total impoits of sawn timber. Statistics for thefirstnine months of 1975-76 compared with the same period in 1974-75 show that the value of imports of sawn timber from aU sources decreased by over 5 per cent. During the first nine months of 1975-76, imports of sawn timber from New Zealand are running some 12 per cent higher in quantity terms and some 9 per cent higher in value terms compared with 1974-75. New Zealand thus appears to be improving its share of the Australian market at the expense of other supplying countries rather than by taking sales away from Australian mills. Should there be evidence that importation of New Zealand sawntimberis taking place under conditions which constitute dumping and which causes or may cause injury to Australian producers the appropriate action would be submission of a case to the Bureau of Customs, Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Pharmaceutical Services Committee (Question No. 839) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon that the Australian Broadcasting notice: (1) What was the composition of the Pharmaceutical Ser- vices Committees of Inquiry in each State.

(5) If so, is this sensible when the GuUd's goodwill is essential for the future operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",256
91,Mr HUNT,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The National Health Act provides that the Minister for Health may establish in each State a Pharmaceutical Services Committee of Inquiiy consisting of the Director of Health in the State, an officer of the Commonwealth Department of Health who is a pharmacist and four pharmaceutical chemists appointed by the Minister. Until recently it had been the practice for the Minister to appoint three pharmacists from a panel nominated by the Pharmacy GuUd of Australia and one pharmacist from a panel nominated by the Friendly Societies Dispensaries Association. Following representations from the Pharmaceutical AsNew Zealand Timber sociation of Australia and New Zealand, the then Minister for Health, Dr Everingham, in 1975 approved a change in the composition of the non-departmental membership of the Committees, which now comprises two pharmacists nominated by The Pharmacy GuUd, one nominated by the Friendly Societies Dispensaries Association and one nominated by the Pharmaceutical Society in the respective State. The Pharmaceutical Societies represent the professional practice of pharmacy and all pharmacists (whether employer or employee pharmacists) are eUgible to be members. This pohcy was followed when the non-departmental membership of these Committees was changed on 1 March 1976. (4) No. (5) See (4). Ship Inspection Work (Question No. 841) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) For what reasons is the ship inspection work at Fremantle in connection with the Grain (Export) Regulations to be performed by the Western Australian, Depanment of Agriculture instead of the Commonwealth Depanment ofHealth as from 1 July 1976. (2) Will the changes lead to addidonal Commonwealth costs; if so, how much. (3) What considerauon is being given to the transfer of similar funcuons at Victorian ports from the Commonwealth Department ofHealth. (4) If it is not being considered, what differences are there between Western Austraha and Victoria in this regard.",256
92,Mr SINCLAIR,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In Western AustraJia the inspection of ships in accordance with the requirements of the Exports (Grain) Regulations has been carried out on behalf of the Department of Primary Industry by the Commonwealth Department of Health at Fremande and by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture at Albany, Bunbury, Esperance and Geraldton. A new grain loading facility Kwinana later this year. In view of the proximity of this port to Fremande my Department initiated discussions with the Department ofHealth about inspection at Kwinana. The Department of Health indicated that the increasing workload associated with its quarantine responsibuities had already caused difficulty in coping with grain ship inspections at Fremande and would preclude it from taking on addidonal work at Kwinana without addidonal staff. In all the circumstances my Department requested the Western Australian Department of Agriculture to undertake the ship inspection work at Kwinana and Fremande as well as the four outports. This was agreed with effect from 1 July 1976. (2) At this stage it appears Department of Agriculture will engage one additional inspector to cope with ship inspection work. As stated in (1) however, the Depanment of Health could not have coped with the addidonal work without engaging addidonal quarantine staff. The opening of transfer of responsibiUties wiU lead to addidonal costs to the Commonwealth estimated at $ 11,000 for the year 1976-77. (3) None.

In Western Australia the cases, change means, as stated in (2), that all such ried out by one authority, the Western Australian Depanment of Agriculture. Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Was the Agios Nikolaos III delayed from loading grain in Geelong during May 1976; if so, why. (2) Is the claim, that the age of the grain residue on the ship indicated that some of the grain residue in the ship when it previously loaded grain in Australia correct. (3) At what Australian ports had the ship loaded grain previous voyages, and on what dates.",257
93,Mr SINCLAIR,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable kinds member's question is as follows: (1) MV Agios Nikolaos III was inspected at Geelong on 19 May 1976 in accordance with the requirements of the Exports (Grain) Regulations, as are all ships which are to load expon grain in Australia. It was found that cleaning and removal of infestable residues was necessary. This is not an unusual requirement. When the required work had been done the vessel was reinspected on 21 May 1976 and was found to be in a suitable condition to load grain. A Grain Loading Permit was issued following this reinspection. (2) I am unaware of such a claim, but if it has been made my Depanment is unable to confirm it. (3) According to Depanmental records this vessel has previously loaded grain in Australia on the following dates.

Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the terms of section 63 of the Broadcasting and Television Act the ABC is prohibited from broadcasting or televising advertisements. Urban and Regional Development: Western Mr Uren asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has the 'Agreement in relation to the provision of financial assistance to Western Australia for Urban and Regional Development 1975-76', proposed by the Labor Government and agreed to in principle by the Western Australian Government, been signed. (2) If not, have separate agreements covering the various categories of urban and regional development been signed to replace the proposed' UmbreUa Agreement'. (3) If the proposed Agreement referred to in part (1) has been signed, has it been altered in any way. (4) If so, what was the nature of these alterations, what were the reasons for these changes, and when will it be tabled.",257
94,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: An Urban and Regional Development Agreement with Western Australia has been signed and was tabled in the Parliament on 19 May 1976. The Agreement that was signed will operate in respect of the period from 1 July 1975 to the end of the Supply period. Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) How many persons are employed by his Department or by agenciesresponsibleto recruiting capacity and what amounts are chargeable to his Department or such agencies in respect of their annual salaries. (2) To what extent does his Department or any such agency engage private employment agencies to assist in the recruitment of staff. (3) What sum was spent by his Deparment or any such agency in engaging private employment agencies in the financial year 1974-75. (4) To what extent does his Depanment or any such agency engage or otherwise obtain assistance from the Commonwealth Employment Service in the recruitment of staff and what sum has been paid to the Commonwealth Employment Service inrespectof such assistance. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the Postal and Telecommunications Department, Australian Broadcasting Control Board and Australian Broadcasting Commission there are no staff engaged primarUy on recruitment functions. Telecom Australia employs a number of staff onrecruitment activities, many of whom are not exclusively engaged in such activities and, therefore, it has been necessary to make an assessment of the time and annual salaries expended full-time on recruitment. The assessed figures are 53 man years at an annual cost of $620,000 for salaries. The position in Australia Post is similar and the assessedfiguresare 30 man years at an annual cost of approximately $300,000. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission currently employs 4 officers for staff recruitment, the salaries of whom amount to $45,177 per annum. (2) The Postal and Telecommunications Depanment does not utilize the services of private employment agencies for Australia the recruitment of staff. Neither is it the practice for related (Question No. 469) statutory authorities to engage employment agencies although during the last twofinancialyears a few instances have occurred when their use has been necessary. The ABC.B. has obtained temporary typing assistance, through agencies, on shon terms of engagement to cope with special requirements. Australia Post engaged an agency only once, since 1 July 1975, in respect to the filling of several positions in its market services area. O.T.C., on one occasion in 1974, recruited an Assistant Programmer through a private agency. (3) ABC.B -$2080. O.T.C -$825. (4) The assistance of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) is not utiUzed by the Postal and Telecommunications Depanment or the ABC.B. Telecom Australia, Australia Post, ABC. and O.T.C. make fairly regular use of the CES for which no charge is made. Australia Post also makes occasional use of the Professional Employment Oflice of the CES in recruiting managerial and professional staff. Consequences of Government Expenditure (Question No. 664) Mr Garrick asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Staff Recruiting (1) Is it a fact that while reports are being issued in relation to cut-backs in social welfare and the public service an (Question No. 604) additional $660 miUion is to be spent on the Army during the next 5 years. (2) Are Liberal-National Country Party priorities weighted so that big business interests can prosper and feel safe behind solid defences. him or his Department in a staff (3) Does he share the concern that such priorities may lead to the sacking and under-payment of workers, the education of chUdren of migrants and poor people in slum-like schools, the near starvation of pensioners and the humUiation and economic hardship of the unemployed.",266
95,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) No. (3) It is the Labor Party's poUcies that established high unemployment levels in Australia. Torepairthe damage will not be quick or easy. Not enough attention was given by the Labor Government to Defence expenditure nor to assisting the under-privUeged and disadvantaged. The present Government's policies are directed to both these problems. Employment Conditions (Question No. 677) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) On how many occasions has the Government coordination committee on employment and industrial relations intervened in negotiations on employment conditions between unions and Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and the Postal Commission. (2) On how many occasions were the original agreements between the Commissions and the unions altered and in what manner. (3) Which of these agreements flowed on to other Government areas. (4) What industrial acuon resulted from the interventions. (3) What was the estimated financial cost to each Commission as a result of such industrial disputes. (6) Were the Commissions re-imbursed the losses caused by industrial disputes, created by Government interference in reladons between the Commissions and their employees. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the able member's question is as follows: (1) Since 13 December 1973 there have been no occasions on which the Government Co-ordination Committee on Employment and Industrial Reladons has intervened in negotiations between unions and the Commissions mentioned. However, all three Authorities maintain a liaison with the Committee on matters of mutual interest and frequently the Committee's views have been sought before management decisions have been finalised. (2) - (6) See answer to (1). Telephone Connections Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) Has he sought reasons phcations for new telephone connections to which he referred in his letter to me relating to staff reductions in Telecom Austraha. (2) When does he anticipate that the excessive delay in connections will be reduced substantially. (3) Is it good business practice to reduce staff before reducing the period of delay in making new telephone connections. Mr Eric Robinson-The anwer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The downturn in demand for telephone services referred to was previously set out in detail in the document 'Service and Business Outlook 1975-76' which was published in August 1973 by Telecom AustraJia. In this document it was forecast that new service demand in 1973-76 would be 325,000 compared with the actual level of 332,391 in 1974-75. New services connected in 1975-76 were greater than the demand for new services thus permitting the backlog at the commencement of the year to be reduced. (2) and (3) Generally apphcations for services are being met within one or two months. Telecom Australia advise that during 1975-76 the average connection time has been reduced by approximately 10 per cent. It is planned reduce waiting times further in cies pursued by Telecom Austraha are responsive to the need to maintain existing service standards and to improve rate of connection of new services. Destruction of Film by Australian Broadcastion Commission (Question No. 744) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) Has the ABC recently destroyed news films from its Library. (2) If so, what was the subject of each film destroyed and were films of the Petrov Royal Commission among those disposed of. (3) Are duplicate copies of these films held in the ABC Library. (4) Who requested the destruction of these films. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourhonourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) As a culling process from the many thousands of feet of film it shoots, the ABC daily destroys film which is judged to have no future use as program or archival material. A list of material destroyed is not kept, but items of any consequence of a political, social, scientific, economic or historical nature are retained. The ABC has not destroyed films of the Petrov Royal Commission. This Royal Commission occurred prior to the opening of the ABC Television Service and the ABC has never possessed film of it shot by its own staff, although some film of it was purchased by the ABC from Cinesound-Movietone for inclusion in a documentary on Dr H. V. Evatt. (Question No. 678) Copies of this documentary are held in the ABC's film Library. (4) No request for the destruction of thesefilmshas been made. for the fall in the number of apAustralian Broadcasting Commission Current Affairs Programs (Question No. 748) Mr Bourchier asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) What are the names and political affiliations of all speakers on ABC current affairs programs during the last 3 months. (2) What was the total time occupied by speakers known to have affiliations with (a) the Australian Labor Party, (b) the Liberal Party, (c) the National Country Party (d) Communist Parties and (e) Other Parties. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The ABC does not inquire as to the political affiliations of speakers who appear on its many current affairs programs in radio and television.

Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: See my answer to a similar Lloyd) appearing in the Hansard of 1 April 1976 (page 1330). Sanctions against Rhodesia: Aid Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) What was the date and form of the requests by the Commonwealth Secretary-General for assistance to Mozambique to which he referred nodce on 27 May 1976 (Hansard, page 2532)? (2) What was the date of Austraha's response? (3) What assistance is being given by Austraha? (4) Can he say what assistance is being given by other Commonwealth countries?  member's question is as follows: (1) In a circular letter of 4 March 1976, the Commonwealth Secretary-General transmitted to Commonwealth Heads of Government the statement issued at the conclusion of the Sanctions Committee meeung the same day. In brief, the Sanctions Committee, through the Secretary-General, recommended to Governments to react to the needs of Mozambique in accord with the agreement reached at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Kingston in May 1975. Before leaving on his investigatory visit to Mozambique the Secretary-General sent a telegram on 14 March 1976 to all Commonwealth Heads of Government requesting them to consider how to translate their Kingston agreement into effective measures. A further appeal was made in a circular letter of 21 April 1976, when the Commonwealth Secretary-General notified Governments that the Board of Representatives of the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC) approved in principle the establishment of a special technical assistance programme for Mozambique through CFTC. The Government decided to await the report of the Commonwealth Secretary-General and the report of the UN investigatory mission before deciding on Australia's contribution. (2) Apart from interim repUes to the above appeals, Austraha's official and positive response was announced on 3 June 1976. (3) The assistance to Mozambique given by Australia will consist of: (a) Food aid, including cost of freight, to the value of SAlm; (b) SUS 100,000 to a special fund estabUshed under the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation for technical assistance to Mozambique. (4) Most Commonwealth countries have pledged support for Mozambique, but not all have identified what form this support will take. Canada will give $C3m of food aid, the United Kingdom is committed to a £15m bilateral program, New Zealand will provide $NZ 120,000 of skim milk powder, and other countries have indicated they will be mounting bilateral programmes of assistance. Pledges to the Commonwealth Technical Assistance Fund for Mozambique as at 25 June 1976 were as follows: fstg Austraha 56,907 Canada 232,795 question (No 3, asked by Mr Ghana 5,690 India 56,907 Jamaica 31,900 Malta 9,000 Mauritius 11,295 to Mozambique New Zealand . . . . 13,909 (Question No. 784) Nigeria 85,360 Sierra Leone . . . . 15,365 United Kingdom . . . 300,000 In addition a number of other Governments have promised assistance but have not yet confirmed the precise amount of their pledges. in answer to my quesdon without Australian Broadcasting Control Board: Program Monitoring (Question No. 792) Mr Burr asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) What are the annual costs to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in respea of program monitoring of television and radio by its staff throughout Australia. (2) What are the annual costs of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in respect of technical inspections of television and radio stations throughout Australia. (3) As a large number of staff are involved, can these costs be calculated to include the cost of supplying administration office space, and all other overheads associated with the work. Mr Eric Robinson-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) $420,000. (2) $378,000. (3) The costs given in (1) and (2) are based on the annual salaries of the staff employed and overhead costs apportioned on a pro-rata basis. W o o l Price (Question No. 811) Mr Yates asked the Minister for Primary Industry the following questions, upon notice: (1) Is a 20 per cent increase possible in the floor price for wool. (2) Would the Australian Wool Corporation be able to support the market if a 20 per cent increase in the floor price of wool was granted, without getting additional finance. (3) How much has the Government lent to the Australian Wool Corporation in the last 2 years. (4) Does the Government regard the 21 micron indicator for wool as a reUable one, or will it be changed this year. (5) Will he give the figures for last season's wool selling showing the rate at which all combing wool microns between 19 and 30 sold compared to the floor price. (6) WUl the floor price for wool be increased for the 1976-77 season.",266
96,Mr SINCLAIR,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) The short answer is no. At the close of the 1975-76 season the auction price for 21 micron wool was 287 cents per kg clean which was less than 15 per cent above the floor price for this wool category. An increase of 20 per cent in floor price for 21 micron wool for the 1976-77 season have been difficult to sustain. Wool of 21 micron represents only a relatively small centage of the clip and its market behaviour is not necessgreater. arily representative of the whole clip. Accordingly, the Government decided that thefloorprice would be expressed as a 'whole clip average' for 1976-77. agefloorprice for 1976-77 has been estabhshed at 234 cents kg clean and this represents an increase in thefloorof 14 per cent over the dip average which apphed in 1975-76. The Government also dedded that thefloorprice pohcy would be continued during 1977-78 at a price not below the level of thefloordedded for this season. (2) The Australian Wool Corporation has substantial credit facUities avaUable and could sustain a much rate of buying without immediate need to seek additional sources of finance. The costs of interest and carrying charges are however substanual. Accordingly, on the newfloorprice basis, the Corporation expects to make substantial repayments of advances from the Budget during 1976-77.

Compensation for Wheat growers Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary number Industry, upon notice: (1) Has the Wheat Board or the Department of Primary Industry ever considered the introduction lar to the New Zealand Wheat growers' Compensation Scheme as a more effective form of disaster insurance. (2) If so, why has not such a scheme been introduced here. (3) If introduction of a simUar scheme has sidered, why is this so.",268
97,Mr SINCLAIR,SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER VESSELS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (2) & (3) I understand that the New Zealand Wheat growers' Compensation Scheme provides for a form of crop insurance which affords protection to wheat growers against losses from hail, flood and frost. It is a grower financed scheme and for the cover growers pay a levy of 15 cents per tonne of wheat into a compensation fund. The grower carries the first one third of the risk and the fund the other two thirds. the It should be noted that the Australian wheat industry is on would a very much larger scale than New Zealand's and the fluctuations in yield from one natural cause or another are very much greater. For these reasons alone these difficulties perin implementing a simUar scheme in Australia are infinitely An indication of the smallness of the scheme in New Zealand, from the Australian point of view, is seen in the fact that only six claims totalling $3,350 were paid on wheat from The whole dip averthe 1974 harvest. All-risk crop insurance has received consideration in Australia, principally by the Australian Wheat growers' Federation. The matter is a very complex one and the major deterrent probably has been the cost of implementation in the Australian situation where yields are so variable. The publication 'The Principles of Rural PoUcy in Australia: A Discussion Paper' (the so caUed 'Green Paper') gives a brief increased section (paras 4.79 to 4.90) on the topic. A pilot all-risks insurance scheme covering wheat grown in Western Australia was introduced in April 1974.1 understand however that it will not be continued in the future. The Government has already expressed its interest in natural disasters insurance schemes. The Insurance Industry Conference has been asked to report on the feasibility of a crop and livestock insurance scheme and in adfrom dition a study is currendy being undenaken into the possibUity of introdudng a more widely based natural disasters insurance scheme covering the major natural hazards such as earthquake, tropical cyclones,floodsand bushfires.
