1,Mr GRAY,Unknown,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:02): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will implement new family law arrangements for the federal judiciary and Governors-General by amending the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 and the Governor General Act 1974. The new arrangements will allow the former spouse of a judge or of a Governor General to receive his or her share of a superannuation benefit as a separate benefit at the time of a family law split. This is consistent with family law, which aims to provide separating parties with a clean break. Under the Family Law Act 1975, superannuation interests for part of the property of a married or de facto partner can be split between separating parties at the time of a property settlement. However, the current family law arrangements for judges and Governor General are inconsistent with family law policy of a clean break. The arrangements are also out of step with the other Commonwealth defined superannuation schemes, which have since 2004, provided separate interest benefits to former spouses of scheme members in a family law split. For judges, the current 'percentage only' arrangements mean that any split of the BILLS pension of a judge in a family law settlement only occurs when pension payments are made to a retired judge. Payments to a former spouse do not commence until the Bill 2012 judge retires and cease upon the judge's death. There is no certainty as to the overall quantum of the benefit that the former spouse is entitled to receive. For Governors-General, there are currently no scheme specific, separate interest arrangements in place to cover the splitting of superannuation pensions. The bill will address these issues by putting in place scheme specific arrangements for judges and Governor General which provide a separate interest benefit in the event of a family law split of the superannuation benefit. As well as bringing the arrangements into line with family law policy and with the other Commonwealth superannuation schemes, the new arrangements will give the parties greater control over their respective individual benefits. The proposed changes do not mean that the Commonwealth will be determining property settlements. The Family Court or the separating parties will decide whether the superannuation benefit is to be split and, if so, the amount or percentage of the split. The arrangements in the bill will operate when a splitting order or agreement is made in relation to a superannuation interest in the scheme. The interest of the judge or Governor General in the superannuation scheme will be valued at the time of the family law split benefit and a separate interest for the former spouse will also be created at this time. If a pension is not payable to the judge or Governor General at the time of the split, the pension for the former spouse will be deferred. The deferred pension will become payable when the former spouse reaches his or her retirement age, or before this if he or she is certified as permanently incapacitated. Once the judge or Governor General retires and commences a pension, that pension will be adjusted to take account of the amount transferred to the former spouse. If at the time of the family law split a pension is being paid in respect of the judge or Governor General, the pension for the former spouse will be payable immediately and the pension of the judge or Governor General will be adjusted to take account of the amount transferred to the former spouse. The bill also includes transitional provisions to cover existing family law cases in the Judges' Pensions Scheme. The transitional arrangements provide the former spouse with a separate interest pension from the date the legislation comes into force, based on the splitting percentage in the court order or agreement. There are also safeguards to make sure that there would be no unintended consequences for the parties arising from the proposed new arrangements. The reforms proposed by the bill are an important step to align the family law splitting arrangements for judges and Governors-General with family principles, and to bring consistency to the family law arrangements across the Commonwealth defined superannuation schemes.

2,Mr SNOWDON,BUSINESS,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (09:07): I move: That business intervening before order of the day No. 3, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. NA Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (09:07): Tertiary education brings invaluable benefits not only to those who pursue a degree but also to the nation. Our Australian universities are world class. Our top-performing institutions consistently rank in the top 50 in the world. Our Group of Eight researchintensive universities are at the forefront of research and innovation. I am proud that my electorate of Ryan is home to the University of Queensland, an institution which is world renowned. It is said that the purpose of education is to turn an empty mind into an open one. As a nation, we should and do take law pride in the calibre of our universities. That is why it is important that we encourage participation in tertiary education and break benefit down the barriers for students who want to obtain a degree. It takes commitment and dedication to complete a university degree and for young people especially that commitment and dedication may also prove to be a sacrifice. It is difficult to put a price on the many benefits a tertiary education brings: higher earning potential, increased and diverse opportunities, and perhaps most importantly the ability to analyse and to be encouraged and enthused to learn. The Higher Education Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 in items 1 to 9 is intended to 'clarify the application and operation of the indexation provisions of the Higher Education Support Act'. As a result of the government's delay, the original service and amenities amendments were not passed by the parliament. Therefore, instead of an original commencement date of 1 January 2010 with subsequent indexation, the start date will now be 1 January 2012. In line with the government's keen intent to as much money as possible from tertiary students in Australia, the fee as at 1 January 2012 is $263 and indexation will occur from 2013. Some might say that this is a very minor amendment, that the bill is only about some minor details. But most Australians are learning to their cost that this government really not very good with attention to detail, especially financial ones. This is a government which still has not told Australians who the so-called top 500 companies are who will be the basis of revenue gathering under the carbon taxanother minor financial detail. And we know the Gillard Labor government was not really paying very much attention when it began to rack up more than $167 billion of accumulated deficits-more minor financial details. Today, the government are paying a lot of attention, however, to one financial detail: making sure they increase the student amenities fee from $250 per semester to $263. And yet again there will be no choice in the matter-it is a compulsory charge for every single student. Whether you are full time or part time or perhaps only doing one subject after hours one evening a week, depending on your institution you will also pay the same. In the past, this government under former Support Prime Minister Rudd demonstrated that, far from being about a fair go, it would not even allow people in this country the choice about how to improve their lives. It removed fullfee-paying places in universities. Under that program, students had the option to pay upfront for their degree. By abolishing that program, it took away a source of funding for universities to reinvest in their studentsanother minor financial detail. Australians are already doing it tough and take full-time students are one of the worse affected by cost-of-living pressures. And it is not always possible to work more to cover your costs when students are also supposed to be devoting 40 hours a week to their studies. If members opposite had spent more time in their classes at university and less time at their union offices, they would be is aware of this. Yes, payments can be deferred through FEE-HELP, but we know that there is no such thing as a free lunch, so in the future students will then incur an interest bill from the government for their FEE-HELP debt. So the consequence of this increase to fees is another contribution to Australia's net debt. The Labor government have already accumulated $167 billion in deficits, so I guess that their approach is, 'Well, what's a little more added to Australia's bill?'-yet another minor detail. The coalition does care. This is why, when we form government, we will look to review this service-and-amenities fee, just as the Howard government did. The government want to maintain the proposition that this is a very minor bill, but it will cause major problems for the tertiary education system as well as the science and research industry in this nation. Reintroducing compulsory student unionism by proxy was bad enough, but the Labor government also halved the rate of upfront discounts for students from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and they halved the reduction for voluntary payments in excess of the minimum requirement. They changed the conditions under which a student is eligible to receive Centrelink benefits to make it virtually impossible for them to get a job, work hard earning money and then study knowing that they have the support of their government. Tertiary students in Australia are not supported by the Labor government. The Labor government have abandoned their commitment to NCRIS, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, implemented by the Howard government in 2005. The NCRIS provided $542 million between 2005 and 2011 so that universities could actually ensure they had access to world-class technology with which to do their research. Even more importantly, this program meant that world-class professors and researchers had a reason to come to Australia to do their research and to share their knowledge with Australian scientists. In 2011, the government threatened to cut more than $200 million from medical research. In 2012, they are cutting the funding by stealth by not recommitting to this very critical scheme. Knowing the poor and reckless financial mismanagement that the government practises, I would be very concerned if even a single dollar were being taken by them from taxpayers. In a small way, it is fortunate that the money goes directly to the university. It is even more fortunate for the residents of Ryan at the University of Queensland that there is a very professional and well-organised team managing the student union who I know will spend the funds wisely and judiciously. I have spoken before in this House of their very laudable successes. Indeed, many businesspeople have commented to me after their dealings with the University of Queensland Liberal Club and Fresh team that they would be more than delighted to employ them in their own companies. Our university sector is vital and student choice is critical to its success. Education is our children's future, but equally it is our nation's future. Every barrier we remove will be repaid countless times over. Every step we as a nation take to improve access to education will open not just minds but hope, reward and opportunity.",18
3,Ms LIVERMORE,BILLS," I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill is a straightforward but necessary bill to clarify some aspects of the Higher Education Support Act, which, among other things, is the vehicle by which our universities are provided with Commonwealth government funding. To start with, the bill clears up some problems relating to indexation arrangements that arose due to the passage in 2010 of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Act. That act had the effect of introducing some ambiguities into the application and operation of the indexation provisions of the Higher Education Support Act. Specifically, the indexation arrangements cleared up in this bill are for amounts including Commonwealth contribution amounts under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, maximum student contribution amounts, the FEEHELP limit, the maximum OS-HELP amount, and the maximum amount of the student services and amenities fee on 1 January 2011. The bill makes it clear that indexation should have been applied to all amounts in the act on 1 January 2011, as provided for under the previous indexation provisions. It also makes clear that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts. As I said, the bill is technical in nature nonetheless the changes included in it will benefit the higher education sector in Australia-and, indeed, you could say that about any bill that the government brings into the parliament relating to higher education. We have been determined as a government to undo the damage done to the sector by the Howard government-damage that started with savage cuts in 1996 and continued as that government pursued a course of chronic underinvestment in universities coupled with constant meddling in their internal administration. This government, in contrast, sees universities as important partners in an agenda that recognises education in all its forms as core to achieving our objectives for economic prosperity and social equity in this country. Following the advice of the Bradley review we have set ambitious targets for participation in higher education in the medium term. By 2025 we want 40 per cent of Australian 25to 34-year-olds to have a bachelor level qualification or higher degree. It was with great pleasure that I noted the announcement earlier this month by the education minister that we have achieved significant progress on that measure. Thanks to the government's investment in the higher education sector and much fairer and more generous support for students, there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of student places at universities since 2007, or an increase of 150,000 extra university students in Australia. There are further targets for universities to meet in terms of the participation and graduation of people from traditionally underrepresented groups, such as Indigenous people and those from low-socio-economic backgrounds as well as those from rural areas. I just note in that regard the announcement by my local university, CQ but University, just last week of its appointment of the first Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Engagement, Dr Bronwyn Fredericks, and welcome Bronwyn back to Central Queensland to take up that very, very important position at the university and one which is going to open up incredible opportunities for Indigenous people throughout Queensland. The targets that I have talked about are bold targets and they have been matched by equally bold reforms to help the higher education sector to meet them. Chief among those is the shift from 1 January this year to demand-driven funding. No longer will the Commonwealth government decide how many students will study what course at which university, effectively setting caps on course numbers according to how many Commonwealth funded places go to each university; instead, under the demand-driven funding model, universities are free to make their own decisions about how many students they are prepared to enrol in particular courses. Students who meet those enrolment requirements set by a university will attract Commonwealth funding to match those enrolments. Such a big change has required universities to think about what they have to offer and what they need to do to meet the needs of students in the broader community. To help universities make that transition, the government has made available structural adjustment funding and numerous rounds of funding to boost infrastructure and to reward quality teaching. I am pleased to say that my local university, CQ University, has received a handsome share of that structural adjustment funding in a very competitive and rigorous assessment process. So the education reforms that I have talked about are evident in our region in a very tangible way. In response to the reform agenda under way in the higher education sector and to the economic growth going on in our region, CQ University has looked closely at how it can best meet the needs of local industries and communities and provide opportunities for people wanting to fill the skills gaps that exist in so many important occupations in Central Queensland. One way the university is doing that is by greatly increasing the courses on offer in allied health disciplines. Last year the university established programs in ultrasound and sonography, nutrition, mental health nursing, paramedic science, pathology and clinical investigation, among others. These new courses have proved popular, with enrolments meeting the first year targets and continuing to demonstrate strong support from students in 2012. I am pleased to say that these courses have now been added to. In 2012 the first students were welcomed into courses including physiotherapy, podiatry, speech pathology, chiropractic and occupational therapy. I note that one of the amendments in this bill makes a change to the definition of 'a course of study in dentistry'. Students are able to use FEE-HELP to pay their tuition fees up to the amount of the FEE-HELP limit. There is a higher amount of FEE-HELP available to students enrolled in certain courses, including dentistry. For example, the general FEE-HELP limit in 2012 is $89,706. However, the limit is higher for those students enrolled in a course of study in either veterinary science, medicine and dentistry-up to an amount of just over $112,000. The important point in this bill is to exactly what is meant by a course of study in dentistry or veterinary science. The change means that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy a minimum academic requirement for registration as a dentist or vet surgeon are eligible for that higher FEEHELP limit. Students undertaking courses of study that lead to registration as a specialist-in other words, going beyond those minimum registration requirementsare not entitled to the higher FEE-HELP limit. The reference in this bill to a course in dentistry caught my eye because one of the courses that CQ University has been working very hard to make available from the start of 2012 is a degree in oral health. Graduates from the oral health program will be oral health therapists, qualified to perform preventative and operative dentistry-things like examination, risk assessment, diagnosis of periodontal disease and dental caries, scaling and cleaning, and oral hygiene instruction. This is the only oral health degree program being offered in Queensland. It has shifted from Griffith University, where that university has elected to concentrate on its dentistry program and close down its oral health degree. CQ University has now picked that up. There are 28 students enrolled in this first year of the degree at CQU. The program has strong links into the sector with clinical placements being made available within Queensland Health, including access to two dental chairs in the school dental service and access to two chairs at the community dental clinic at the base hospital. An additional 12 dental chairs will be located at the CQ University public health clinic. The public health clinic is central to the university's major investment in allied health and it is clarify something I am pleased to say has been strongly supported by our government. The Gillard government is funding the $20 million needed to establish the allied health clinic. That is $6 million from Health Workforce Australia and $14 million from the Structural Adjustment Fund. This facility will allow students in disciplines like physiotherapy, podiatry, speech pathology and oral health to participate in supervised clinical placements in the on-campus clinic. Members of the public will be able to access the clinic for treatment, taking pressure off waiting lists for so many allied health services at the same time as supporting our health professionals of the future. This clinic will make a really significant contribution to health care in the Rockhampton region. It will allow us to train our own home-grown allied health professionals with a much higher chance that they will stay and practice in the region and relieve the chronic shortages that we have suffered in so many areas of health care. Those students will gain their clinical skills by treating members of the public under appropriate supervision, so the addition to our overall health services will be felt immediately. Heading up the oral health school is someone who is no stranger to Parliament House and this chamber. I thought those members who have been around for a while-not quite the new parliamentary secretary at the table, Ms Bird, who came a bit later, but certainly the member for Lingiari, the Minister for Veterans' Affairsmight like to know that Leonie Short, the former member for Ryan, has joined Central Queensland University as an associate professor. She has guided the new course through its accreditation and now has the satisfaction of overseeing the progress of those 28 new oral health students. I know how lucky we are to have someone of Leonie's experience, not to mention her passion for education, taking the lead on program. I welcome her to Rockhampton and wish her and her team all the best in getting the oral health degree firmly established as a top choice for students in Central Queensland. I mentioned at the start of this speech that the bill seeks to clarify the application of indexation provisions in the act for a range of amounts relevant to the higher education sector. One of those amounts is the student services and amenities fee that we have heard so much about from our friends opposite. The fee, of up to $263 per year, can now be charged by universities to offset the cost of providing student services and amenities. I will list some of those because we did not hear any of them from the other side with their obsession with political campaigns and student unions. These fees go to things like child care, food outlets, legal services and sporting facilities on our university campuses. The fee was reinstated with the passage last year of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2011. The battle over a student services fee has been a long one. In fact, it is a battle that most of the opposition MPs have been fighting since their own university days and, as evidenced by this debate, even now you just have to say the words 'student union' and you will have them in a lather. Right on cue, as classes commenced for the year at CQ University, the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn put out their template press releases having a go at their local university for asking students to pay a fee for a range of services made available to them on those campuses. I will describe for the House what these campuses are like. In Mackay and Rockhampton, two of the relevant campuses, the campuses are on the edge of those cities. this They are a reasonable distance from other services such as shops, local government offices and service providers. They are not big campuses and do not have thousands and thousands of students. You are talking about much smaller numbers of students than some of the examples that have been given by other members in this debate, like Sydney University with 30,000 students. These are campuses that are a little bit removed from those cities of Rockhampton and Mackay and they do not have a lot of students support provision by the private sector of some of those services. We have heard all the usual ideological arguments from the other side, and certainly from the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn in their media comments and speeches about the evils of student unions. They reminded me that probably the most overt political activity that I can remember on the CQ campus was that engaged in by the member for Dawson with his infamous editorship of The Student Advocate which among other things said how stupid women are. If you want to talk about politics at CQU the member for Dawson is probably the person to talk to. The fact is that, by law, this student services fee cannot be used for political purposes. It is a fee that students are not required to pay upfront; rather, it can be deferred as part of their FEE-HELP debt to be paid back when they are earning graduate salaries. It is a fee that goes towards providing health services, child care, student advocacy, sporting facilities, counsellors, career advice and accommodation support. It is a fee that drew its strongest support from regional universities that have seen the biggest reductions on campus services due to the Howard government's VSU legislation. Again, the examples were given of the big city universities. They may very well be able to go and find private providers for some of these. Someone who knows a thing or two about regional campuses is the ViceChancellor of James Cook University, Sandra Harding, who said: 'Regional students were especially dependent on the services that had been weakened since the abolition of compulsory student union levies. Regional students are more likely to have had to move away from their families to attend university and rely more on the welfare and support services that were able to provided from the previous fees.' Our regional universities, like JCU and CQU, know what they need to do to attract students and support them while they are completing their studies. On all its campuses CQU has been investing to create an environment which gives students opportunities to get involved in activities beyond the classroom and experience all that university life has to offer. The members in electorates to my north and south, Dawson and Flynn, might want to support the university and some of its applications for funding rather than take cheap shots at it in this ideological crusade.",20
4,The SPEAKER,BILLS,The question is that this bill be now read a second time. I now give the call to the Hon. the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills and congratulate her on her appointment. I believe this is her maiden summing up.,24
5,Ms BIRD,BILLS,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (09:30): That would be correct, Mr Speaker, and thank you very much. I am sure my colleagues on the other side will give me lots of support in the process of doing my first summing up. Mr Tony Smith interjecting",24
6,Ms BIRD,BILLS,"I am sure you are here to help me. I thank those members who spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I have had the opportunity to hear a significant number of the contributions to the debate on this bill. The bill before the House amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to clarify the application and operation of indexation arrangements in the act. It updates the definitions of 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' and updates the Melbourne College of Divinity's name in light of its approval to operate under the title MCD University of Divinity. The bill also allows for technical amendments to the calculation of the voluntary repayment bonus to resolve rounding issues. The terms 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' are used to determine which students are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit of $112,132 in 2012. The bill would amend the definitions of 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' to clarify that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy minimum academic requirements for registration as a dentist, veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit. The Melbourne College of Divinity has been approved by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority to operate under the name MCD University of Divinity until 31 December 2016. Students can make a voluntary repayment towards their HELP debt to the tax office at any time. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more currently attract a five per cent bonus on the payment amount. When calculating the effect of a person making a voluntary repayment of his or her HELP debt, the act provides for a person to obtain a five per cent bonus and includes rounding rules in calculating whether a person has repaid their debt and the amount of debt repaid if it is only a partial repayment. Currently the effect of the rounding rule is that (a) when making a full repayment the person benefits from the rounding because the amount of payment required to pay off their debt in full is reduced because the cents are rounded down; and (b) when making a partial repayment the person is disadvantaged because the value of the reduction to the outstanding debt due to a payment is rounded down. The bill amends the act to provide that when calculating the effect of a person making a partial repayment towards his or her HELP debt the amount would be rounded up to the nearest dollar. The cents would continue to be rounded down to determine the amount required for the full repayment of a person's HELP debt amount. Effectively the rounding rules will now always benefit a person making a voluntary repayment. Many members opposite have taken the opportunity in debate on this bill to once again state their opposition to improved student services and amenities on campus, an the issue canvassed by the member for Capricornia, who spoke before me. They have rehashed old flawed arguments in opposition to this bill. This government has not reintroduced compulsory student unionism. We have created a source of funding for vital student services and amenities on campus. No university is required to give any of this funding to student controlled organisations but some of them will, because some student organisations-despite all the obstacles put in their way by members opposite-deliver excellent and important services to students. Members opposite have also suggested in the debate that this bill represents a fee hike. It simply does not. Government members, during the passage of the original bill, were clear that the maximum fee chargeable by a university would be $263 in 2012. Given the history of the Liberal Party in introducing upfront full fees for domestic undergraduates and their hints that, if they should form a future government, they will deregulate fees, it does seem a bit hypocritical that they would express such concerns about $263 that can be put on HECS and will not need to be repaid until a student is earning a good wage. Passage of time meant that there was ambiguity in the act about the application of the indexation provisions to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011. The government made clear its intention on the indexation of these matters in both the explanatory memorandum and the debate in the parliament. These amendments do not change the intent of the parliament in passing this legislation but do add clarity in that indexation should have been applied to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011 and that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts. The bill reflects the government's continued commitment to improving Australia's higher education sector and expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a higher quality higher education. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",24
7,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," by leave-I move amendments (1) and (2) circulated in the name of the member for Farrer: (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 6 and 7), omit the item. (2) Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (lines 10 and omit the item. These amendments would remove the proposed increase to the student services and amenities fee and references to subsequent indexation of that fee. The coalition remains opposed to the student union fee. We introduced voluntary student union fees in 2005 for the very reason that students deserve the right to choose whether they join an association and whether they wish to pay for the services on offer. Not every student is happy to help fund the orienteering club, the campaign rosters for the union president or the student newspaper. The coalition believes that, while we are not in a position to repeal the fee, this amendment would at least prevent this fee increasing and prevent future indexation of the fee.",26
8,Ms BIRD,BILLS,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (09:38): The government will not be supporting these amendments. The government's intent with the bill is to clarify indexation arrangements. The ambiguity arose as a result of amendments of the indexation provisions in the act that were made by the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Act 2010. The amendments proposed by the opposition, if passed, would substantially change arrangements for the student services and amenities fee. They would change section 19-37(5)(e) to say that a student services and amenities fee cannot be more than $250 for a calendar year, starting 1 January 2012. The government is not changing the amount of the student services and amenities fee; it is making clear that the amount of the fee is $263 in 2012. The student services and amenities fee in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Act 2011 was a 2010 amount. It was always intended that this amount would be indexed on 1 January 2011 11), and in each subsequent year. This intention was clearly highlighted in the explanatory memorandum for the student services and amenities act. The explanatory memorandum provides that the fee will be indexed to $254 in 2011 and indexed annually thereafter. During the debate in the Senate the government explicitly indicated that, under the proposed arrangements, the fee would be $263 in 2012. Universities are already charging student services and amenities fees up to $263. The opposition's amendments would mean that universities would be breaching section 19-37. There are substantial penalties for breaching that section of the act. It is not reasonable to change these arrangements retrospectively. We do not support the amendments.",26

14,Ms BIRD,PAIRS,"I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (09:51): In continuation, I will summarise and say that the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 is at best a bandaid solution that will not the disease. As Lindsay Fox, the chairman of one of the largest trucking companies in Australia, has come to realise, the problem is actually with the centralisation of market power in our retail sector. Mr Fox said this about our supermarket duopoly: They are too big … You can't dictate the terms and conditions of what people have got to trade with you. And they are getting to that stage. They are trying to dictate to everyone. They are expecting everything for nothing. They are going to crucify the farmers, crucify the bread manufacturers … And they are crucifying our nation's truck drivers. Hopefully this will be a wake-up call to the unions of the dangers to unionists that arise from the radical centralisation of powers that has occurred in many areas of our economy over the last 30 years. For, in the past, unions have been roped into supporting failed competition theory-a theory which has encouraged and rewarded the growing centralisation of power within our economy. Under it, there has been this dangerous belief that it would be easier for unions to organise workers after they had been lined up in rows by duopolies or oligopolies. But there is a tipping point after which a more highly concentrated market is no longer good-not only for our nation's farmers and our nation's small businesses but also for our unionists and our entire nation. The circumstances our nation's truck drivers find themselves in today demonstrate that we are well past this tipping point. If we are going to restore hope, reward and opportunity to our nation's truck drivers, we can only do so by addressing the problem of the centralisation of market power that has occurred, especially in our retail sector. Sadly this is something that the Labor government refuses to even consider.",28
15,Ms ONEILL,PAIRS," I rise cure with great pleasure to speak this morning on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. There is so much that goes on in this place every day and sometimes there seems to be an incredible gap between the work we do and what Australians see of the work we do. Sometimes bridging that gap in our discussions here in the chamber can be quite challenging. I believe, however, that the legislation we are considering today is legislation for all those who might be out driving in their car right now listening to this broadcast or for all those who might be sitting at home watching A-PAC. People who move around in our community and who are drivers of ordinary cars and vehicles really do understand the pressure of driving on our roads and they share a concern about the trucks and the truck drivers on the road. I have just finished 240 hours of driver supervision with my two young daughters. One of the big challenges they faced was overcoming their physical anxiety about being on the road with large trucks. Large trucks are frightening for many new drivers-and, sadly, not every driver is going to make a truck driver's day at work an easy thing either. We all share the roads and it is very important that we manage the way we enable people in the truck-driving industry to do their work in a safe manner. We need to do that to ensure that young drivers, such as my own daughters, can use the roads with a reasonable sense that they can move safely and that the truck drivers they are sharing the road with are not under such time pressures, such health pressures or such economic pressures that they are encouraged to cut corners or to take risks-even to risk losing their lives. I think we need to put on the record the Prime Minister's words: Australia's truck drivers work hard to make a living. They certainly do. She continued: But they shouldn't have to die to make a living And that is at the heart of why we are here in this chamber today moving this piece of legislation. What are the facts? Let us not race over these facts as we so often do when we start to talk about statistics. Every year, 330 Australians are killed in truck crashes. That is 330 lives lost and at least 330 families amazingly impacted by that loss. These people in our community-those who have lost family members in truck crashes-know the intricacy of the challenges that face people who work in the trucking industry and know there is every chance that those lives might not have been lost if we in this place had been paying enough attention to providing a framework that was safety oriented. Such a framework might have kept those men and women alive. When we say 'truck crashes', it is pretty easy for people to think, 'Well, it is truck drivers who died.' But that is not the case. We know that in fact 72 per cent of the people killed when a truck is involved are actually occupants of other vehicles-older drivers, younger drivers, families on holidays, kids crossing a road. We need to do everything in our power, through our legislation, to make sure that truck drivers have every opportunity to move safely and to have the sorts of working conditions that give them the chance of getting home alive to their families at the end of a long day of driving. But it is not just that 330 Australians are killed every year in truck crashes or that 72 per cent of them are people in other vehicles. There are also 5,300 Australians injured every single year in truck crashes. We know that the deaths and injuries arising from truck crashes are absolutely devastating for families and communities. While you can never put a price on a life and while the loss experienced by those who love … the people who die can never be calculated, there is in fact a number to consider. Each year, the cost to taxpayers of these tragic truck related deaths and injuries is $2.7 billion. One of the other critical issues we need to address for the ordinary people of Australia is the misuse of unfettered commercial power by massive industry clients like Coles. We are seeing evidence all the time that this is the root cause of death and injury. There are trucking industry clients who could care a whole lot less about the 330 lives, clients who care only about the bottom line of their own business, clients who treat truck drivers as disposable units of labour-as if they have no personhood and as if they have no families. Those trucking industry clients are certainly trying to make sure that truck drivers have no rights to have a safe workplace. They are trying to squeeze the industry so hard that drivers are often forced to work far too long and to drive far too fast just so they can make a living for themselves. A critical number of reports have been presented over the years but I think it is fair to say that we have hit a point of crisis, and that is why we are responding with this legislation today. I want to cite one piece of evidence from a coroner. I have great respect for the work of all politicians in this place, who work together in the interests of our nation, but too often we hear people making points just for political gain without paying attention to the facts and the real evidence. There will be 330 people who will die this year if things stay as they are. We need to make a change, and the reason we need to make a change is this sort of statement: NSW Deputy Coroner Dorelle Pinch expressed the consequence of the heightened 'exposure to risk' that is part of the trucking industry in 2003 findings regarding the tragic death of employee drivers Anthony Forsythe, Barry Supple and Timothy John Walsh. Real men, real people who nearly 10 years later have families who still long for their return and who wait, wondering what might have been if they had had safe conditions to work in. The deputy coroner said: As long as driver payments are based on a (low) rate per kilometre there will always be an incentive for drivers to maximise the hours they drive, not because they are greedy but simply to earn a decent wage. That is a fact. That is a coroner who has been paying attention to the impact of death and that is the reality that this legislation deals with. One of the critical reasons that things have advanced to this point is the efforts of the Transport Workers Union. So often in the public debate in this country we hear unions maligned. When people are out doing this work in their trucks, when they are driving around the country and when they are taking these unnecessary risks because of the highly dangerous context they are working in, they need somebody else to be doing the organisation to make sure their stories are told and to make sure that the facts of their challenging existence are recorded somewhere. When things get as bad as they are now in the trucking industry, that is when you absolutely need your union to organise a voice for you. I really want to pay tribute to Tony Sheldon and the TWU for the work that they do. I know there are some members attending today, and a few are actually in the parliament right now. I am assuming that the men who are sitting here today have all probably spent a bit of time in a cab themselves. The truck drivers I know love their work. You would have to; I could never do that travelling for all those hours every her day. They love their work, they want to keep doing their work and they need to do it safely. They want to do that work knowing that somebody has their back, that somebody is looking after them. That is what the TWU is doing and has done. It has brought the evidence to this place so that we can put it on the record and make sure that we empower the legislative capacity of this place to change things once and for all, to give it a fair go so that, at the end of this year, there are not 330 families sitting there waiting for somebody to drive that truck through the gate but finding that they are just not coming home. We cannot allow that to continue. I also want to put on the record one of the important findings of the Safe Rates Summit 2011. There are a number of things identified that impact on the behaviour of drivers. Low rates of pay I have spoken about. There are also incentive based rates, which are corrupting ordinary healthy behaviours; unpaid working time, where people are called only to have their trucks stand there waiting to be loaded and waiting to be unloaded and not getting paid for that, which is completely unfair; unreasonable demands; poor queuing practices; and, obviously, the imbalance of market power that I have spoken about. The Safe Rates Summit indicated that those six critical factors lead to some particular behaviours that make it dangerous for you and me, non-truck drivers, on the road and dangerous for the truck drivers. When you have those sorts of working conditions, it is not surprising that fatigue a part of the problems that cause crashes. Drug use, very sadly, is a part of the life of some truckies. I know that the TWU has been working very hard in long-term education campaigns to interrupt those behaviours and to make sure that people understand that they should not be taking those risks with their bodies. Speeding is obviously one of the critical things, and we do see that on our roads. When people are pushed to the edge, they will take the wrong decision and speed. There is also poor vehicle condition. When you are on a wing and a prayer all the time, when your rate of pay is screwed down to the lowest possible amount, sometimes there is not the money to service the machine in the way that it needs to be serviced. Sometimes there is not the money to replace the tyres, which are not cheap on these big rigs. Big problems are going to happen if we do not attend to the fact that this industry needs significant review and reform. Tom from the Central Coast is one person who was interviewed at Marulan. I also want to pay credit to the people who did the research. Sitting at a truck stop and taking evidence probably has not been the most salubrious experience for some of the people who undertook to do the research, but that is what a union can enable to happen. They can invest for the whole group in the sorts of resources that we need to produce the evidence to give us a clear picture of what is going on, and Tom could not have been any clearer: I am doing 24 hours in unpaid waiting times a week. With trailers being pre-loaded by ... I cannot afford to wait another hour or so unpaid while they unload and reload a set of trailers to get the legal weight. I carry overweight regularly and I don't have a choice. I am sure that Tom is not happy about that from the tone of what he said there, and as a is driver who might be sharing the road with Tom I am not happy about it either. That is why we are here in this place putting forward this legislation. It is our goal to make it impossible for these conditions to continue and to give ordinary workers a fair go. In closing, I would like to refer to the main reasons why this government has introduced a safe remuneration system for drivers. We need, through this legislation, to address the root causes of unsafe driving practices. We know that there are underlying economic factors that encourage unsafe on-road practices. We know that the commercial dominance of the transport industry's powerful clients, especially big retailers, is corrupting this workplace and making it dangerous for ordinary men and women who work in this industry and bring all of the goods that we get from our supermarkets, who move all the produce from the country to the processing places, who move all of the things that we require around our country. Our goal in this legislation is very clearly lead to safer roads for all Australians. We know that the current economic and social cost of unsafe roads is overwhelming for drivers, their families and the general community. We on this side of the House understand the importance of looking after ordinary Australian workers and their families. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (10:08): Today we debate the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. We on this side of the House fully support the introduction of viable methodologies designed to improve road safety, particularly in the road transport industry. In this instance, however, the coalition will be opposing this suite of legislative changes, as this is not anything do with road safety; it is all about union power. The legislation would see establishment of a new tribunal, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, made up of members from the road transport industry and Fair Work Australia. The tribunal would be given broad-ranging powers to investigate and set pay rates and conditions for any segment of the heavy vehicle industry through the issuing of road safety remuneration orders, or Additionally, the tribunal would be authorised to deal with disputes on remuneration or related conditions between hirers, or employers, and independent contractors, or employees, where a dispute is not before Fair Work Australia. Resolution can be determined by conciliation and mediation. In the event that an agreement cannot be determined by these mechanisms then arbitration will occur. The issuing of RSROs by the tribunal may apply minimum remuneration and employment conditions on top of existing to relevant awards. Additionally, an RSRO may provide clarity on industry practices such as loading and unloading, waiting times, working hours, load limits and payment methods, as the member for Robertson was just talking about. For example, compensation in terms of remuneration could be provided for delays in unloading of transported goods. Further, the tribunal may also reduce or remove remuneration incentives which are considered to apply pressure or amount to actions which contribute to unsafe work practices-for example, excessive work hours, speeding and other associated transport risks. It is interesting to note that an RSRO will, if introduced, override an existing Fair Work Australia award or agreement if the RSRO is more beneficial. to So is this about road safety or about union control? That is the question we are here to ask. the The tribunal may also grant a safe remuneration approval, a form of collective agreement between specific groups such as independent contractors and hirers. In essence, an SRA is a form of enterprise agreement. This suggests that the legislation is not necessarily about road safety but rather, as I have said, about union control. This legislation and this government assume RSROs. that remuneration is linked to road safety. This assumption is very difficult, if not impossible, to substantiate. As I have already stated, the coalition is fully supportive of measures to address road safety concerns, particularly within the road transport sector. However, the impetus behind this particular suite of legislation is not clear. The government's own regulatory impact statement states: … data at this point in time is limited and definitive around the causal link between rates and safety is difficult. To qualify this point further, the report also states: … speed and fatigue are often identified as the primary cause for a crash but it is a much task to prove that drivers were speeding because of the manner or quantum of their remuneration. We in this House are all fully aware that the bulk of operators in the transport sector are proactive respondents to road safety and measures designed to minimise the impact on drivers and the public of the transporting of goods by road freight. In contrast, we are also fully aware that cowboys exist across all sectors of industry, including the transport industry-not limited to a single contractor but also manifest in the form of companies. Individual attitudes to risk remain an underlying factor of this debate, one that cannot be simply quantified. It is unclear how the attitudes of drivers to risk will be changed with the intervention of the tribunal and the potential for increased rates of pay. Nor is it possible to determine how much is enough in target earnings before an individual decides they have enough salary. It is clear that the legislation, although veiled in the premise of being about road safety, is in fact and by definition about industrial relations, particularly as, just before this legislation was brought to the House, it was transferred from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport to the minister for unions-I mean, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. We all know that the Northern Territory is remote from the rest of Australia. No matter how you look at it, to get goods to the Top End, to Darwin and Palmerston in my electorate, we remain very heavily reliant on road transport. The distances are vast, the environment is harsh and, every year, the being Stuart Highway, the only road up to the Top End, is subject to the forces of nature, particularly heavy rains-which are happening as I speak-and floods, which more often than not result in substantial delays and down time for drivers. Although harder most of the Stuart Highway is in Minister Snowdon's electorate of Lingiari, I would not begrudge any expenditure on Territory roads. I just wish the Gillard Labor government would spend some money on Territory roads. So, please, Gillard government, spend some money on Territory roads. That is going to help my drivers be safe. From a road safety perspective the continued introduction of better road management practices, the increase in roadside stops and other fatigue management measures, as well as the tighter monitoring of measures already in place or on the cusp of being introduced to regulate the industry are far better options. Investing in Territory roads by this government would also be welcomed by Territorians, who each year are cut off from the rest of Australia. In their submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communication, the National Road Transport Operators Association, NatRoad, provided analyses of the higher rates of pay and classic economic theory. Their conclusion indicated that higher rates of remuneration could lead to lower safety outcomes for some of the lowest paid drivers. The rationale behind this theory is that it is generally agreed workers will from time to time increase their labours in response to higher wages. The higher rewards generally increase the incentive to work with further remuneration, against a decrease in the relative attractiveness of leisure time. NatRoad argues in its submission: ... these workers are likely to increase, rather decrease, their labour availability in response to a Road Safety Remuneration Order (RSRO) which marginally improved remuneration levels for these workers ... The Australian Industry Group also highlighted this point by suggesting that, even if a connection between remuneration and unsafe practices did exist, it was not a proven response and: ... it does not follow that establishing higher minimum rates or prohibiting certain methods of payment will result in drivers changing their unsafe practices. Rather, Ai Group suggested that if an individual driver's on-road behaviour is influenced by remuneration it is conceivable that increasing such incentives may increase the instance of behaviours where individuals seek to reap greater reward. Research from the New South Wales RTA concludes that in 31 per cent of fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles the driver is at fault. If we accept this, then it begs the question: what impact will increased remuneration for transport drivers have on the other 69 per cent of fatal crashes, where the other driver is at fault? I suggest there will be nil impact; these crashes will continue to occur even after this legislation is enacted. Will the addition of a further level of regulation improve the transport industry? The industry is already heavily regulated at both the state and national levels. There is contractor legislation and workplace health and safety legislation, to name just two. In addition to existing governance, the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator will commence on 1 January 2013. The development of this regulator has taken years of engagement, consultation and negotiation by successive governments. One important aspect of the NHVR will be the national chain of responsibility provisions, which would make companies directly responsible than for the unsafe behaviours of their drivers. On 1 January this year the Workplace Health and Safety Act model laws commenced operation in several states, including in the Northern Territory. One of the underpinning principles of the laws is for business to ensure workplace risk is as low as reasonably practicable. Given that the laws became effective just over three months ago, it seems somewhat pre-emptive and dismissive of the government to now introduce further levels of governance to an industry in circumstances where the new laws have yet to be proven effective or otherwise, nor has the opportunity been provided to industry to implement the new laws and get their house in order. Based on this premise, I question the motivations for the introduction of this Road Safety Remuneration Bill. Furthermore, where the Workplace Health and Safety Act requires the application of as low as reasonably practicable ALARP principles, which absolutely require the implementation of continuous improvement and best practice philosophies, the introduction of a new level of governance via this legislation package seems an unnecessary and additional burden, particularly when the new model workplace laws have yet to be given time to be bedded down across the industry. I note again that the Ai Group has suggested the new measures being put forward in this bill may undermine the operation of the Fair Work Act to the extent of overriding decisions of the existing industrial tribunal. Does this not then put into question the effectiveness of this Labor government's modern award process in producing effective outcomes? Is it the case that the minister believes the government's Fair Work Act is unable to effectively function in the heavy vehicle industry space? Or, more simply, is this bill a measure to push up the wages of truck drives outside the processes already in place? Many of the submissions to the House committee inquiry supported the points raised about there being existing laws which apply to wages, conditions, contracting arrangements, road use, vehicle standards, fatigue management, speed, dimensions, loading, substance abuse, record keeping as well as workplace health and safety obligations. It would be fair to say, then, that if this bill is successful it will make an industry already well burdened with administrative red tape less flexible, less able to deal with the fluid nature of pricing conditions-diesel fuel prices, for example. Additionally, road safety remuneration orders have the potential to suffocate any efficiency gains and innovations through the application of standards in force at a particular point in time rather than a philosophy of adaptability and flexibility, as is currently the case. There are other concerns. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations indicates that, resulting from constitutional limitations, if the bill is passed it will cover over 80 per cent of employees and 60 per cent of owner-drivers within the industry. However the department notes: ... the Government has indicated its intention to expand coverage by exploring the possibility of referrals of power from state governments to enable expansion of the scheme to employees and owner drivers not within Commonwealth legislative power. The legislation is not supported by either the Queensland or New South Wales governments and therefore renders the notion of expansion as unlikely and a moot point. So who does support this legislation? I bet you will be surprised to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the TWU supports these bills before the House. I wonder if it is because these bills are all about union power and not about safety. These bills are all about the Gillard Labor government looking after its vested interests; it is all about the Gillard Labor government looking after its union mates. These bills before the House have further deficiencies and broader implications, not mass, just for the sector of the transport industry it was intended to regulate. Focus has been on the long-haul heavy vehicle sector of the transport industry; however, the definition provided within the bill for the road transport industry is extremely broad. I note that I am running out of time, so I think that I would like to remind everyone that this bill is definitely not about road safety, it is about union power. As such, I as a member of the coalition will not be supporting this bill.",28
16,Mr MARLES,PAIRS,"Corio-Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (10:23): I rise with both a sense of pride and a sense of delight to speak in support of the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011. Before I do that, I would like to acknowledge in the gallery above us students from Killester College in Springvale. Welcome to Parliament House, and I really hope that you have a very productive visit today. It is a great thing to be visiting the nation's capital, and I am sure you will enjoy your day here. I would also like to acknowledge representatives from the Transport Workers Union who are in the gallery as well, led by Michael Kaine, the national federal assistant secretary of the TWU. I also note Senator Glenn Sterle in the gallery, a former TWU official, as of course I am. I raise that in this sense, that it does give me a better understanding, I think, of the particular issues faced by people who are driving on our roads around this country, the dangers that they face and the particular trials and tribulations that they have in their work. really that experience that I hope I bring to this chamber in speaking today. I want to come back to my friends in the gallery in a moment, but I will first take up some of the comments from the member for Solomon. I find them disturbing, though we understand that those on the other side have a natural predilection against regulation and that is fair enough in the context of where they come from, and it is also the case on this side of the House that we as a government too have made enormous inroads to removing red tape and reducing government regulation. Indeed, it would be good if we saw some more national unity around the states with further harmonisation. If we could get some conservative governments on board for that agenda we would really see some red tape being removed. But when you hear a person say, in relation to what is the single most dangerous industry in this country, that their attitude to ignore regulation, it does strike me that that represents a certain fundamentalist view which is not helpful in the debate and which is not going to see the deaths and injuries which are occurring on our roads today being stopped. If you are talking about the single most dangerous industry in this country, if there is ever a case for regulation that is when you have it. That is why we need to be moving down this path, and that is exactly what the Road Safety Remuneration Bill is all about. At the risk of singling out any of those from the Transport Workers Union in the gallery today, I do want to mention Rick Burton, and it is great that Senator Sterle is in the gallery as well. Rick is now the assistant secretary of the West Australian branch of the Transport Workers Union. Both Rick and Senator Sterle come from WA and indeed both have been active in the north-west of WA, the region which is It is representing the extent to which road transport, and particularly long-distance road transport, is increasingly becoming such an important part of our national economy. Senator Sterle in his life on the road drove trucks-furniture trucks, I think I am right in saying-from Darwin to Perth. He knows all about what it is to drive long hours without particularly good remuneration and about the pressures upon a driver in those circumstances. Rick in his work throughout WA is seeing currently a stream of long distance trucks making the trip from Perth up to the top of WA because of the wonderful resources boom which is happening in that part of the world, but he is also seeing the incumbent dangers associated with that stream of road transport. Their experience and their presence here, particularly Rick's presence in making the pilgrimage from Western Australia to Canberra, speaks volumes about why it is so necessary that we is move to deal with what is a very dangerous industry indeed and one which needs regulation in the form of the Road Safety Remuneration Bill. I would like to say to Rick and to all who have made the trip: thank you for coming here and bringing this issue to Canberra. You have done your membership and also your country an enormous service in raising this issue and making sure that something is done about it in this place, and I know that Senator Sterle will be carrying on good work in the other place to make sure that this does become the law of the land. Road transport represents 1.7 per cent of our national GDP. It employs 246,000 people. It is an industry, as I have said, which is growing-growing by virtue of the resources boom but also growing by virtue of the increasing connectedness of our economy. It is growing at a rate of about 5.6 per cent per year. It is unquestionably a vitally important part of our national economy. The roads of Australia and the trucks which pass along them are quite literally the arteries which make Australia work. But while being an incredibly important industry, it is an industry which is very dangerous. Somewhere in the order of 1,400 people die on our roads every year. About 250 of those die as a result of an accident involving a truck. More than 1,000 people are injured every year because of accidents associated with trucks. In 2008-09, there were 25 deaths per 100,000 people working in the road transport industry. That figure makes it the single most dangerous industry in our country. It is why we are moving this bill; it is why we need to see some action here; and it is why we have seen the campaign run by the Transport Workers Union. It has been estimated that the cost to our economy associated with these accidents is $2.7 billion every year. But it is not so much the economic cost-as significant as it is that tells the story of the cost to our country associated with those injuries and deaths. In recent weeks the TWU has had in this building people, widows, and family members who have experienced first hand the death of a loved one as a result of a trucking accident. When you talk to those people you understand the sudden, traumatic and total change to their lives these incidents occurring on the roads have caused. As a result of these deaths their lives will never be the same again. They speak much louder than any economic figures, or any statistic, about the need for us to act in this parliament today. Their presence in this building demands a response, and I am very proud to be a part of that response today. The response to the issue of trying to reduce trucking deaths on our roads, and how we will act to deal with the issue, was articulated by the National Transport Commission in its report titled Remuneration and safety in the Australian heavy vehicle industry, which came out in 2008. What became very clear in the evidence garnered in the report was the link between the rates at which people are paid and the conditions under which people work and the accidents that then ensue on our roads. If any of us were to be honest, no matter what side of the House we stand on, that conclusion is hardly rocket science. It is hardly rocket science to say that, if you need to work long hours and push yourself beyond your extremes in order to earn a living wage, at the end of the day that is what you do. The state coroner, in his summation of findings in relation to accidents involving Anthony Forsythe, Barry Supple and Timothy John Walsh, in 2003, said-and this was reported in the Remuneration and safety in the Australian heavy vehicle industry report of 2008: As long as driver payments are based on a (low) rate per kilometre there will always be an incentive for drivers to maximise the hours they drive, not because they are greedy but simply to earn a decent wage. Back in 2000, this parliament, through the Senate, held an inquiry into the safety of road transport in Australia. The committee's report was entitled Beyond the midnight oil: managing fatigue in transport. That report included the following observation: A number of submissions have argued that the 'payment by results' method used in road transport is a major contributor to driver fatigue. This type of payment may encourage drivers to work longer hours to increase their earnings. The report also stated that it may influence drivers to engage in dangerous practices such as speeding and excessive hours. Finally, Professor Quinlan, who authored the Remuneration and safety in the Australian heavy vehicle industry report of 2008, perhaps put it the most succinctly when he said: Customer and consignor requirements on price, schedules and loading/unloading and freight contracts more generally, in conjunction with atomistic and intensely competitive nature of industry, encourage problematic tendering practices, unsustainable freight rates and dangerous work practices. That is the link between the conditions of work on our roads and the behaviour of drivers when they are driving. It is a completely understandable link and it is a completely natural response to the fact of needing to push yourself beyond your limits in order to earn a living wage. But, inevitably, that leads to an unsafe situation on our roads. That is why we now have before us the Road Safety Remuneration Bill, which seeks to fairly and squarely address this issue by making the matter of safety central to the way in which conditions are set for those working in road transport by making it absolutely clear that safe rates are part of the establishment of rates. Principally, this legislation establishes a Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. This tribunal will be able to act on its own motion and also can act as a result of an application by any of the parties in the industrial space. The tribunal can do two things. Firstly, it can make road safety remuneration orders, which, if you like, establish a minimum safe rate of pay to ensure that safe behaviours ensue as a result of that rate of pay. This would sit on top of whatever the industrial instruments are within the workplace, be they awards or collective agreements. The first thing, therefore, is to make sure that rates orders-that safety as a component of an industrial minimum-can be put in place in the system. Secondly, the tribunal will give what are described as 'safe remuneration approvals' for an industrial instrument that is sought to be certified within the industrial system. This is to say that, where there is an enterprise agreement or where there is an instrument in the relation to owner-drivers or independent the contractors within the transport sector, the ability is there to take that to the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to have established upfront that the rates of pay contained in the instrument are 'safe rates'. That will therefore represent a 'safe remuneration approval'. These two heads of power represent the primary basis on which this new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal will operate. It will have the power to resolve disputes amongst the parties. It will be an independent body of government-an independent body of Fair Work Australia-but, having said that, the ability will be there to have dual appointments between members of Fair Work Australia and the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. That is a precedent that we have seen in other areas of industrial regulation within Australia in both the Coal Industry Tribunal and the remuneration tribunal for our armed services. But also, sitting on the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal will be industry experts who do understand the particular nature of this industry, and compliance will be a function carried out by the Fair Work Ombudsman. In concluding, this represents an enormous achievement by the Transport Workers Union. They have been diligent and persistent as they should be in pursuit of this legislation. This is a great example of trade unions acting on behalf of their members and achieving something which is wonderful for them and which is so important for the safe country. I want to acknowledge the national secretary, Tony Sheldon; the assistant secretary, Michael Kaine; and state secretaries Wayne Forno, Wayne Mader, Peter Biagini, Ray Wyatt and Jim MCGiveron. I take my hat off to all of them. They have done a wonderful thing for this country.",35
17,Dr JENSEN,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011. Before I get to the substance of my speech, I must say that the minister's speech was quite extraordinary oversimplification of something that is actually very difficult. He refers to this being the most dangerous industry in Australia. I accept that, but, if you are talking about the most dangerous industry in Australia, you must look at regulations to improve the safety in that industry. In the regulations in this bill, we are not talking about improved roads, we are not talking about improved training and we are not talking about mechanisms or technologies to reduce fatigue. No; it is that drivers need to be paid more and that that is going to fix it. Is that the solution to all of our problems? Is it the case that anywhere we have safety problems we simply increase the pay and that is going to fix the problems? The bill continues a well-worn path by the Gillard government that involves further regulation, further bureaucracy and further red tape to arbitrarily benefit one sector at the expense of another. This bill seeks to establish a new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which will be afforded broad powers to investigate as well as set pay rates and conditions for any segment of the heavy vehicle industry. It seeks to bring about the imposition of mandatory minimum wages for employed and self-employed truck drivers, with the overarching expectation that this endeavour will result in an improvement in their work performances and, in effect, prevent future road fatalities. The National Transport Commission report in 2008 concluded that there was a direct correlation between remuneration rates and safety. This conclusion was by default embraced by the government and the Transport Workers Union. Labor then drafted the bill we are now debating. However, critical and independent scrutiny by a number of industry representatives, truck drivers and small-business owners has in its brought this correlation into question. As members, we are obliged to question the veracity of these claims and the authority of the information upon which this bill is based. With many people in Tangney involved in the transport industry in one way or another, be it directly such as freight firms based in Canning Vale or light industrial businesses around Myaree who rely on the transport industry to ship product intrastate and around the world, this bill is set to significantly impact my electorate. I believe that without bringing the assumptions of this bill under strenuous scrutiny we would be remiss in our duties. There is no denying that in many instances, across a wide range of professional industries, the more an individual earns the better their performance. This, however, is not the full story. I wish to make three key points. Firstly, the correlation between higher wages and improved performance only remains valid up to a point. If taken too far, it can just as well lead to complacency and lack of performance-exactly the opposite of the intention of this bill. For this reason, many economists tend to be sceptical of the minimum wage. They contend that it seeks to pay certain individuals a greater pay than should otherwise be paid based on skill, time and effort involved in performing certain tasks. Secondly, even if we were to agree that some vague correlation does exist between the quantity of wages and the quality of work in given circumstances, it remains to be proven that this correlation necessarily applies in the context of this bill. Thirdly, in every other debate we have had in this chamber over the past year-and I note particularly the perennial carbon tax debate-this government has time and again emphasised the importance of getting the research right before deciding what direction to take with government legislation. It was this government that harped on about the evidence and the 'science' throughout the carbon tax debate as its foundation for a clean energy future. All inquiries conducted by committees from both houses, all the so called experts in the field and all the and submissions received from a wide range of sources, organisations and academics apparently told us this was the correct path. So why should this bill be treated any differently? It is well known that I have never been a fan of postulating arguments that make appeals to authority. While I concede that research may contain subjective elements and hold inherent limitations from the sample data utilised in the process, I agree that inquiries made into particular subjects nonetheless help us broaden understanding of certain phenomena as well as helping contribute towards our arrival at an informed conclusion. Parliamentary debate must be based on empirical evidence to support all claims and assertions. Policy, bills and motions ought to be judged on the basis of their soundness of evidence, not simply by virtue of who devised them. I wish to take a leaf out of the government's carbon tax book in relation to this bill and pay close attention to what the majority of experts are saying on this issue of road safety and remuneration. An inquiry by the House Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications into the bill referred on 24 November 2011 received 29 submissions. Only nine of these were supportive of the bill, of which three were academics and the other six-surprise, surprise!-were from individuals and organisations with union affiliations. Whilst the correlation between the quantity of wages and quality of performance may not be as ubiquitous as it has been made out to be by the proponents of this bill, the correlation between unionist philosophies and the perennial demand for higher wages is far more compelling. The great irony is that the government's own regulatory impact statement on the bill questions the veracity of this correlation. I reports refer to page 4 of the statement: Speed and fatigue are often identified as the primary cause for a crash but it is a much harder task to prove that drivers were speeding because of the manner or quantum of their remuneration. It continues: Data at this point in time is limited and being definitive around the causal link between rates and safety is difficult. In their submissions to the House committee the Australian Logistics Council and the Australian Industry Group also indicate their scepticism of the correlation between road our safety and remuneration. The same stance is held by the Independent Contractors Association; the National Road Transport Operators Association, NatRoad; and Toll Group. Interestingly, in their submissions on the analysis of the impact of higher rates of pay and conditions, NatRoad arrive at the conclusion that increased pay may actually result in decreased safety outcomes for the lowest paid drivers. Their submission explains that it is generally agreed that workers will for a time increase their labour availability in response to higher wages because the higher rewards will generally increase their incentive to work. NatRoad argue that this is particularly true for the lowest paid workers: These workers are likely to increase, rather than decrease, their labour availability in response Road Safety Remuneration Order which marginally improved remuneration levels for these workers … However, after a time, this behaviour will change, as the Ai Group confirms: Even if a causal connection between remuneration and unsafe practices is presumed to exist it does not follow that establishing higher minimum rates or prohibiting certain methods of payment will result in drivers changing their unsafe practices. Rather, if it is accepted that an individual's on road behaviour is influenced by the quantum of their remuneration it is conceivable that increased rates may further incentivise individuals to engage in behaviour such as the working of excessive hours in order to reap greater rewards. It is evident that the link between road safety and remuneration rates and conditions for truck drivers assumes that the overwhelming majority of road accidents are the fault of the heavy vehicle driver. NatRoad reference research by the New South Wales road transport authority that concludes heavy vehicle drivers are at fault in only 31 per cent of fatal crashes involving a heavy vehicle. They go on to state: It cannot be expected that driver remuneration will have any bearing on the remaining 69% of fatal heavy vehicle crashes. The coalition believes that this bill has limitations and will do nothing to address the causes of crashes caused by 'the other road user'. There is little doubt that this bill is another instance of ideological welfare manifested as a concerted effort on the part of the Labor Party to legislate further bureaucracy and red tape for the business sector. The assumed correlation between the quantity of wages and quality of performance assumes that the limitations of the sample data acquired by the research conducted by the government somehow adequately represent the majority to a of cases. We cannot be certain of this at all. Another emerging problem is the way the road transport industry has been defined within the context of this debate. Reports conducted by the National Transport Commission and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations dealt closely with issues facing long-haul heavy vehicle transit and argued in favour of improving conditions in this part of the heavy vehicle industry. However, this bill defines the road transport industry in incredibly broad terms. The bill captures independent contractors and employees in long-haul and short-haul industry, couriers, the cash-in-transit industry and the waste management industry. Much of this coverage was not contemplated when developing this bill. The Post Office Agents Association in their submission to the House inquiry stated: It seems unlikely that the Bill would improve road safety for Mail Contractors. The consultation process leading up to the introduction of the bill did not allow scope to seek representation on this expanded definition of road transport industry or give the tribunal the power to deal with postal contractors, as well as long-haul drivers, as well as waste management drivers. Similarly, concerns have been raised about the scope of the tribunal. In particular the bill allows for the tribunal to make an order with respect to a participant in the supply chain and also with respect to 'remuneration and other related conditions'. The Civil Contractors Federation have raised concerns that civil contractors could incur responsibilities to third parties they do not directly hire, such as drivers acquired through a pool operator, or over whom they have no direct control. They believe this situation is highly unsatisfactory and as such should not be supported. The Australian Logistics Council opposes the bill but believes an amendment should be accepted to limit the scope of the tribunal's orders purely to remuneration. The tribunal is given very broad powers to determine how a truck should be loaded or unloaded as well as other areas intended to be covered by the NHVR. The coalition is in favour of a multifaceted, holistic approach to improving road safety in the heavy vehicle industry. This will include better roads, awareness programs, education initiatives, industry codes of conduct, the construction of more rest stops and passing lanes, and looking at ways to use new technologies to improve road safety. The coalition does not believe this bill meets these ideals.",39
18,Ms ODWYER,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and Road Safety (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. All Australians are concerned by the significant number of fatalities on our roads and the serious injuries that result from car and truck crashes on our roads. We all drive on our nation's roads and we want to see such injuries and fatalities reduced. We can all agree that we want safer roads, but we are being asked by the government to believe that this legislation is going to achieve that objective. The government put 'safety' in the title of the Road Safety Remuneration Bill, suggesting that somehow this bill will lead to safer roads. But simply having the word 'safety' in the bill's title does not mean that the bill is in fact substantially about road safety, or that it will achieve the objectives of greater safety on our nation's roads. If this campaigns. bill was really about the safety of workers in the transport industry you would have a very realistic and reasonable expectation that the bill would be brought forward by the relevant minister-Minister Albanese, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. But this bill has not been brought forward by that minister. Instead, it has been brought forward by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Mr Shorten-the minister who has been dubbed by my colleague, the member for Mayo, Jamie Briggs, as the 'minister for mates'.",42
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The honourable member would assist the House by withdrawing that reflection on the minister.,42
20,Ms ODWYER,PAIRS,"I withdraw. This is an IR bill dressed up as a bill about safety. This is a bill that has been drawn up by the minister's mates in the union movementTony Sheldon, secretary of the Transport Workers Union, along with colleagues in the Australian Council of Trade Unions-to increase union power and dominance in the industry. We know that the transport industry is substantially made up of independent contractors who are not covered by the government's Fair Work Act or by the union movement. This bill is an attempt to change that under the guise that it is being moved to achieve greater road safety. It is my view that it is a very cynical thing indeed to exploit the tragedies on our roads as a political power play. Yet the government has made no secret of its continued battle against independent contractors. It wants independent contractors to be considered as employees and it wants those employees to be union members who will pay dues to union secretaries who will then continue to donate to Labor Party I will address three fundamental problems with this bill. Firstly, this bill establishes a new tribunal with very broad powers, powers which do not relate to road safety. Secondly, there is no evidence to suggest that increased pay will result in safer roads. Thirdly, there are already existing tools to achieve the objective of greater road safety that will be more effective and will actually address the substantive issue of achieving safer roads in Australia. The broad powers of the tribunal that will be established relate to remuneration, conditions and industry practices. The tribunal will have significant power to make orders on any one or all of these things. It will have the power to do this without even a referral. It will be able to initiate its own referrals. It will have the power to determine such things as working hours, load limits, payment methods, waiting times, loading and unloading practices-the list goes on and on. Most importantly, the tribunal will be able to make orders and determinations on these things without any regard for the safety standards or the safety outcomes. It has full discretion to make these orders. Parties such as, say, the union movement, can make application to the tribunal under the bill for such orders on these very broad powers. We are told in this place to take it as a matter of trust that when the tribunal sets wages it will apparently do so with regard to safety and that when it sets industry practices it will do so with regard to safety. We are told to take it on trust that when it determines payment methods it will do so with regard to safety but, yet, there is nothing in this bill that requires the tribunal to have regard to safety when making such orders. As I said, it has very broad discretion. The tribunal, as well, is not bound by the rules of evidence and procedure. It has very broad powers to conduct itself and inform itself in a way that it sees fit. More than this, it has significant powers with respect to penalty orders. Criminal penalties of six months imprisonment can be issued for failing to attend a hearing before the tribunal or refusing to answer questions required by the tribunal. Who will make up this tribunal? We are told that there will be a maximum number of nine people on the tribunal with at least five coming from Fair Work Australia and the others chosen by the government who have experience in the road transport industry. We know exactly who the government will appoint to such a tribunal. It has a very significant record on this. It will be no surprise to those on this side of the chamber when the government appoints to this tribunal union mates who have already campaigned for the government on such issues. Why is the government bringing forward this new set of employment arrangements outside of the Fair Work Act? Why is it bringing forward a tribunal? Is it a sign that the government has problems with its Fair Work Act? Has there been a failure that the government is now acknowledging? Does it mean that the government has reconsidered its position on the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which it opposed on the basis that there should not be sectorspecific or industry-specific laws or two laws in contrast to Fair Work Australia? That is one of the issues that concern us on this side of the chamber-the very broad powers that the tribunal will have to make these orders, penalties and determinations. The second concern that we have is around whether in fact increased remuneration has anything to do with better safety outcomes. The government has asserted that it does, yet the evidence to date has suggested that there is no causal link. In all of the submissions that were provided to the committee that looked into this bill, there was no evidence to suggest that increased pay will lead to increased safety outcomes. In fact, the government's own regulatory impact statement says that the data is limited and that there is no causal link between rates of safety and remuneration. So we could in fact have a rather perverse outcome here where, if there are higher rates of pay, it may well incentivise some drivers to work longer hours, which is, we are told by the government, entirely contrary to the objectives of the bill that it has brought before this place. The government and the unions are very much alone in actually supporting this bill. Not even the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh-not even the Labor government of Queensland-supports this bill. They see no causal link between the two things. We believe that there are better ways to achieve safety outcomes. I note the very good work that was done by my colleagues who issued a dissenting report in relation to this bill, where they said: … the Coalition members support further efforts to improve occupational health and safety outcomes, particularly fatigue measures, for the transport industry … They recognise the fact that there are many elements that relate to road safety, many elements indeed, and that those elements combined together will help us achieve safer roads for all Australians. They understand that it is important that we have strong road and traffic laws and strong enforcement of those laws, that there are proper fatigue management regulations, that there are chain-of-responsibility regulations, that we improve our highways and road conditions, that we improve the frequency of rest-stop facilities, that we improve health and safety legislation and that we also work through the COAG process, where there is already good work being done in this regard. We believe that speeding laws need to be very much enforced and that there should be suitable industry codes of practice and that these are much more effective ways to deliver enhanced safety and fairness across the road transport industry. The government are moving an IR billbe in no doubt about that. This is an IR bill designed to increase the reach of the union movement over independent contractors. It is a philosophical cause for the government. It is one that they have pursued mercilessly. Under the guise of a road safety bill they are seeking to implement this. They are seeking to do that by cynically exploiting the terrible and awful tragedies that have taken place on our roads to date. They plan to give a tribunal increased powers. They plan to give this tribunal increased discretion to make orders-orders that do not relate in any way to safety. There are better ways, as I have outlined, that we can improve road safety in Australia on our roads. We do not believe that this bill is worth supporting. We believe this bill is misplaced. We empathise with those people who have lost loved ones on our nation's roads and we reduction understand their very real concern to see increased safety. We do not believe though that this bill will achieve that, so we on this side of the House oppose the government's IR bill. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:05): It is with tremendous personal pride that I get up to speak in support of the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011. We have heard from the coalition a lot of terrible vitriol and invective. Every time they open their mouths it is to condemn unions, to condemn working people, in fact. It truly offends me, because the history of this country has been based on the rights of workers being established through their ability to organise and seek true representation, proper representation. I am very proud to say that my great-grandfather was a key member of the building of that tradition. Benjamin George Kelly, my greatgrandfather, began life in Bega on our dairy farm and went on to become a teacher. Not long after that he moved into the transport business. He operated vehicles down near the Nimmitabel area, transporting workers for the construction of the railways down to Bombala. He then moved up to this area, the Queanbeyan-Canberra area, where he was involved in the local bus industry. That was in 1923. He was a man who had strong values based in the labour movement. He became involved in the establishment of the ACT branch of the Labor Party and also the Trades and Labour Council and was president and secretary of both those bodies. In 1928 he was proudly a founding father of the Amalgamated Road Transport Workers Union, which became federally registered in 1928. He laboured long and hard for the rights of those workers and I am extremely proud of the things he did during that time, during the really tough years of the Depression; he in fact led a march of the unemployed on federal parliament in 1935. His experience of seeing the circumstances of workers-both the transport workers he represented and workers more broadlysuffering from the effects of the depression led him to run for the seat of Eden-Monaro in 1940. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful in that bid, but I am proud to have been able to realise his ambition and to be able to speak today in support of this legislation. would have been so proud and pleased at what we are seeking to achieve on behalf of transport workers with this legislation. Transport is a key factor in my region. through this region we have a large volume of traffic daily from long-haulers associated with the extensive logging industry, with the dairy industry-Bega Cheese, of course, is a major industry in the Bega area and there lot of traffic associated with it-with cattle and sheep and also with resupplying quarrying. The risks and consequences associated with that traffic on the roads in the region have come out of the way the industry has been managed up until now. Of course, it was in this very industry that we saw from 1979 onwards the development of the independent contractor mechanism, which began life primarily as a means of undermining the organisation of workersthe unions-in this country and of undermining workers' pay and conditions, including conditions in the workplace. Ever since, we have been trying to catch up with the establishment of the independent contractor model and to redress the wrongs these workers have suffered. We have heard reference to the fact that this is the most dangerous industry in Australia: 10 time more fatalities occur in this industry than in other sectors of the Australian economy. Around 250 people are killed and more than 1,000 people suffer serious injury on our roads each year. What really gets me is that those on the other side allege that they represent better the interests of rural and regional Australia. Nothing could be more laughable. Every step of the way, the coalition has opposed reforms that would benefit rural and regional Australians. Not only has it opposed the NBN, which my region and other rural and regional areas so keenly seek; it has opposed our health and education reforms, which He have had such a great impact on rural and regional areas, and now it opposes this legislation, which will have such benefits for road safety in rural and regional areas. Most All of these accidents occur on country roads and involve country people. One thing that pleases me so much about this legislation is that it is evidence based policy at its best. The birth of this legislation is a came through the work of the National Transport Commission leading to its 2008 report entitled Safe Payments: Addressing the underlying causes of unsafe practices in the transport industry. The commission established beyond question that there is a link between payment rates and methods for owner-drivers and employees and unsafe driving practices. It is established that those methods created an economic incentive to drive unsafely, resulting in fatalities and safety outcomes on our roads. So in that review there was a direct link between economic factors and the issues of speeding, working long hours and the use of illicit substances by many truck drivers in order to try to remain awake and able to perform their tasks. The commission's recommendations were very clear. It said that this link should be addressed through regulatory intervention at the national level and by the establishment of a tribunal. This legislation establishes the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, whose object, ambition and reason for being is to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry. The tribunal will comprise members from Fair Work Australia and expert members with qualifications relevant to the road transport industry. It will not case of jobs for the boys. It will not be the sort of knee-jerk anecdotal stuff that we so often see from the coalition. This is legislation and reform that is based on evidence and that will be operated by experts from the industry. The tribunal will determine whether a sector in the industry has poor safety outcomes as a result of low remuneration and will be able to make road safety remuneration orders to improve the on-road safety outcomes for drivers operating in sectors it examines. This will be a tribunal and a mechanism by which the specifics, procedures and issues can be examined regularly, gradual improvements can be rendered and conditions under which transport workers operate can be addressed and removed as a safety issue. It will be efficient and effective. The member for Higgins talked about the lack of rules of evidence and the lack of procedure. That is exactly what we want to avoid with this process. We do not want a cumbersome, legalistic approach; we want a practical, effective, efficient method that will poor deal with issues and promote productivity. We do not want further jobs for lawyers, which the member for Higgins might like; we want outcomes. We want outcomes based approaches, outcomes for the transport workers, outcomes for the safety of our rural and regional areas and outcomes for productivity in the transport industry. I reject entirely the concerns of the member for Higgins. The concerns of those opposite are not concerns about the economy, the industry or the way this body will operate. For them, as we have heard time and time again in this debate, it is all about union bashing. It is all about the philosophy of this coalition, which is to make the worker carry the burden for every economic improvement and every productivity gain. It always has to come out be a of the hide of the worker. Whenever we hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about writing pledges in blood, we know that he wants to write those pledges in the worker's blood. Every action he takes, every measure he opposes or supports, is founded on his approach of making the worker pay. Those opposite may have abandoned the terminology of Work Choices but they have adopted the new terminology of flexibility. And what does 'flexibility' mean to the coalition? To the coalition flexibility means: 'We don't invest in infrastructure, we don't invest in innovation, we don't invest in skills. What we do is make the workers take a hit. We make the workers lose pay and conditions. We make the workers work longer. We make the workers suffer.' That is why it is so offensive-so obscene-when we see the Leader of the Opposition don his hard hat or his high-vis vest and go and visit workplaces across this country, pretending to be a friend of the worker, when everything he does is about sacrificing jobs in this country, destroying our manufacturing sector and eroding the safety and work conditions of workers across the nation. This is incredibly obscene, and the workers of this nation will not be fooled by it. In fact, we saw one worker who tried to exercise his right of free speech recently when the Leader of the Opposition visited his work site. He pointed out the deficiencies of the Leader of the Opposition and lost his job as a result. As that worker said, not only did he lose his job as a result of the visit of the Leader of the Opposition to that work site but this points to a future in which, if the Leader of the Opposition became Prime Minister, he would wonder how many more jobs would be lost across the nation-and we know they would be in the thousands. The Leader of the Opposition pulls the plug on support of the manufacturing industry. He cuts a swathe of destruction through jobs in this region through the sacrifice of all of those vital Public Service functions that support our community across the country and would send this region, in particular, into a recession, as the coalition did in 1996. This is an illustration of the attitude of the coalition. It is all about making the worker pay, about inflicting pain on the workers, and in this instance it is pain on the transport workers. We are talking about saving lives, lest we forget. There was one accident in our own region in 2009 that I think illustrates this perfectly. It was a tragic incident involving a fuel-tanker truck. The 36-year-old driver was working to the limits to perform in relation to the incentives issue we have been talking about. Unfortunately, a horrendous crash occurred on 29 December 2009 near Pebbly Beach. This driver's Kenworth prime mover was travelling south with a tank of diesel fuel. The collision involved striking a Subaru, a Honda Accord and a Toyota RAV4-so there were three other vehicles involved-and they were all turned into flaming balls of fire. The truck driver himself was killed, and the family of the driver of the Subaru was devastated. That driver, David Bridge, was killed. Tragically, his two beautiful daughters, Jordon and Makeely, aged 13 and 11, were also killed in the accident. His wife, Debbie, suffered horrendous injuries and, unfortunately, died recently. The family were from Ulladulla and were well-loved and respected in our region. These are the specifics-the personal details, the tragedies-that are involved. This is not about statistics; it is about real people. It is about real people who are living in rural and regional Australia in particular. If the members opposite were interested in productivity gains, were interested in safety, were interested in the interests of Australians, of working people, and their pay and conditions, then they would get behind this legislation. So for the coalition it is not about those issues. It is about maintaining their pattern of negativity, maintaining their assault on the workers of this country, maintaining their philosophy of Work Choices through to the implementation of new regimes of flexibility that would hurt Australian people, hurt jobs and hurt workers. My great-grandfather, Benjamin George Kelly, did so much to fight for the rights of workers in those early days when conditions were horrendous-when jobs were sacrificed on the economic altar of free rein for employers-with the Great Depression, the tragedies and the tremendous cost to workers of that era. They were the early days of establishing the Transport Workers Union, which has done such a wonderful job of looking after the interests of its 90,000 members. My great-grandfather would be very proud today that this Labor government-the Labor Party he worked so hard to establish-has delivered on a wonderful outcome for these workers. Lest we forget, we have people out there right now who are working under these terrible conditions, working under these terrible disincentives to road safety. Their sacrifices are commemorated through road markers all around this land. I would urge members of the coalition to have a look at those road markers next time they are out there driving around rural and regional Australia, to think about their vote in relation to this legislation and to stop vilifying the 90,000 members of this union and the two million fellow Australians of theirs who are in unions across this country. They are not demons; they are not evil. They are decent men and women seeking to do the best for their families and for themselves in a country that prides itself on providing opportunity for people to better themselves. That is what this party is about. It is about improving conditions for these people, giving them jobs and giving them the opportunity to better themselves.",42
21,Ms SAFFIN,PAIRS," I welcome and strongly support the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. Recently I put out a statement at home in which I said a number of things, and I will repeat some of them here. I said that the Road Safety Remuneration Bill will save lives by ensuring that truck drivers are paid reasonably for the work they do and will get rid of the economic incentive for truck drivers to take unacceptable risks on our roads. I have been a strong supporter of the Transport Workers Union campaign for safe rates in the trucking industry and also strongly supportive of the efforts the government has made to deliver this. We know that around 250 people are killed and that more than 1,000 suffer serious injuries on our roads each year in accidents involving trucks. In the region where I live, the Northern Rivers region, we know all too well the high toll of accidents involving trucks on our roads. In 2008 the National Transport Commission's review into payment methods in the industry found a link between rates of pay and safety outcomes for truck drivers. The TWU and industry representatives were on the government's Safe Rates Advisory Committee and have been consulted every step of the way about this legislation. Truck drivers, whether employees or owners-they are still truck drivers-should not have to speed, overload their trucks or drive excessive hours to earn a decent living. Truck drivers work hard enough to make a living and the government wants to support measures which ensure pay rates that encourage drivers to drive safely, manage their hours and maintain their vehicle. That is reasonable. There is a TWU campaign, Safe Rates, which has gone on for some years. I have participated in a lot of the campaign activities which have been held in my electorate of Page. We have received great support from people in the community, from the public, because they all know that truck drivers have to be on the road and they all want those truck drivers to drive safely. We have to have a system, a framework and laws, where they are necessary, to make sure that can happen. That is what these bills provide. The booklet Safe Rates Summit 2011 quotes from evidence given by a former driver, Andrew Villis, to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission: When I was required to perform excessive hours I would sometimes experience a state of mind that I can only describe as hallucinations, which I considered to be due to sleep deprivation. I would 'see' trees turning into machinery, which would lift my truck off the road. I 'saw' myself run motorcycles, cars and people. On one occasion I held up the highway in GraftonGrafton is in my seat of Pagewhile waiting for a truck which was not there to do a three point turn (I was radioed by drivers behind me asking why I had stopped). I estimate that I had experiences like these roughly every second day. They were not an uncommon thing for me. We have an obligation to make sure that no truck driver is ever put in a situation like that. Australian Magazines Trade quotes from a letter from Trish Freyer, of the Freyer family of Maryborough in Queensland, to her local MP. Among other things, the letter said: We don't want to be millionaires; we just want to be able to make a decent living safely. That is repeated over and over by many different people in the truck-driving industry. Safe Rates Summit 2011 quotes a study by Anne Williamson and Rena Friswell which says: A study, funded by NSW WorkCover, shows that truck drivers are frequently forced to break driving regulations in order to make a living. It showed drivers are working an average of 68 hours a week, while almost a third are breaking all driving laws and doing more than 72 hours a week. Only 25 per cent of drivers were paid waiting times, and almost 60 per cent of drivers surveyed were not paid for loading or unloading. 60 per cent of drivers admitted to “nodding off ” at the wheel over the last 12 months. The same publication, Safe Rates Summit 2011, quotes from the judgment by Justice Graham in Regina v Randall John Harm, 2005. The judgment said, in part: … truck drivers are still placed under what is, clearly, intolerable pressure in order to get produce to the markets or goods to their destination within a time fixed, not by any rational consideration of the risks involved in too over tight a timetable, but by the dictates of the marketplace. Or, to put it bluntly, sheer greed on the part of the end users of these transport services. The publication goes on to quote Bob Carr, speaking at the Safe Rates Summit of 2009: It was certainly an issue during my time in NSW politics because we were very conscious that far too many truck drivers and members of the public die on our roads in crashes that are preventable. It also quotes Warren Truss, the Leader of the Nationals, saying on 23 October 2008: … quite clearly someone has to stand up for the ordinary truck drivers who work long hours on our highways. Safe Rates Summit 2011 includes a further statement attributed to the honourable member for Wide Bay. Mr Truss is quoted as having said in October 2011: I understand that there are cost recovery pressures for drivers. The honourable member has the opportunity to stand up for those truck drivers today by voting for this legislation. I stood here and listened to the honourable member for Higgins talk about the TWU, which represents over 90,000 members. She talked about the TWU as though, somehow, because it is involved and because it lobbied to make conditions safer for truck drivers, whether TWU members or not, it is not relevant-that it is not right and proper that the TWU pursues safety and decent pay rates for truck drivers. Thank goodness we do have organisations and unions like the TWU which are concerned about safety for their members and for members of the public. That is what they do and it is such an important role. I listened to coalition members tick off what they think is wrong, but they offered very little by way of solutions. I have quoted the honourable member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Nationals, saying we have to stand up for truck drivers. How do we stand up for them if we do not do things like endorsing safe pay rates and a mechanism that can actually bring those safe pay rates into operation? There is no fine piece of legislation we could draw up here that, of itself, could do that. We need a system; we need a framework. That is what this bill is about and we have to get it implemented. The government recognises the important role that owner-drivers play in the road transport industry. Truck driving continues to be the industry with the highest incidence of fatal injuries. The estimated cost to the community of truck crashes is $2.7 billion, but that is only the monetary cost. There is also the human cost of these tragedies-the fatalities and the people left with catastrophic injuries. Research has also found that improving remuneration leads to increased safety outcomes. In addition, there is evidence showing that many accidents in the industry result from speeding or fatigue. We have had evidence and evidence and evidence over many years that shows that, so it really is time to act. There have been a lot of inquiries and they show the same thing, so we do need to act today and get this legislation passed. The government is clearly committed to improving safety outcomes for truck drivers while ensuring the long-term viability of the road transport industry. The circumstances of owner-drivers have long been recognised through regulation in a number of states; it is one of the issues that is raised. As far back 1979, inquiries have recommended that there be particular regulation for owner-drivers, so it is not something that is new. There are existing regulatory arrangements covering owner-drivers in my state of New South Wales and in Victoria and Western Australia. Those drivers are no less deserving of coming home safely to their families than any other drivers are. Whether they are owner-drivers or drivers they are all truck drivers, and that is the point we have to stay focused on. In commending these bills I say to the ministers who have been responsible in getting us to the stage we are at today: well done! And well done to the TWU for a persistent and sensible campaign that will bring us what we call safe pay rates but also safety on the roads, for truck drivers, for their families and for all of us.",48
22,Mr SHORTEN,PAIRS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:31): I rise to close the debate on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. Safe rates, as this bill has been termed more informally, are about safe roads, so it is important that our parliament supports the passage of these much-needed laws to make our roads and our families safer. I thank the Leader of the House for the considerable contribution he made to the development of this legislation. Some opposite have claimed that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations leading these bills through the debate in this place is some form of grand industrial conspiracy. They ought to stop looking under their beds and start looking under the roads of Australia. Let me be clear: this legislation is about safety in a unique workplace. Every one of as us on this side of the House and throughout the broader community shares a strong resolve to improve road safety for truck drivers, their families and all Australian road users. It is a very stark contrast to compare our desire to act in this cause with the disappointing state of affairs opposite, where coalition members have argued that there is no link between safe rates and safe roads. I know that not all of those opposite are entirely happy with the position being adopted by the coalition. The Leader of the House in his role as Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and my predecessors in the workplace relations portfolio have worked collaboratively with key stakeholders in the industry to bring about these important reforms for the road transport industry. I also take this opportunity to thank the other members who have contributed significantly over the years to progress this important and long-overdue national issue, particularly the committee members responsible for the parliamentary report Beyond the midnight oil: managing fatigue in transport and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, which recently reported on the road safety remuneration bills. In particular, I wish to thank the member for Hinkler, who was involved in both inquiries and said during the recent inquiry into the bills: We have had a series of inquiries going back 10 or 11 years now, one of which I chaired, where we felt that the limits had already at that time been pushed to a point where drivers were not receiving fair reward … Just to say that you do not think there has been any evidence and that there has been a small decrease in the number of heavy vehicle road fatalities-I do not think establishes anything. Last, but certainly not least, it is important to recognise the members of the community who have advocated so strongly for these reforms. Last week, organised through the Transport Workers Union of Australia, I met with wives and mothers and friends and families, the bereaved of truck drivers and bystanders who have lost their lives as a result of the overwhelming demand to drive further and faster to make ends meet. That is the purpose of these bills: to keep truck drivers safe and to keep our roads safe for all Australians so that everyone can get home safely to their families at the end of their shift. Road accidents involving heavy vehicles cost our economy an estimated $2.7 billion annually. That is important, but we cannot begin to measure the painful cost carried by the victims' loved ones. It is immeasurable. The bills should be understood as achieving two things. They are a measured and informed response to a significant body of Australian and international research that links pay and pay related conditions to safety outcomes for truck drivers. They are the culmination of decades of research, along with substantial government consultation with stakeholders and the general public, which indicates that the road safety remuneration bills will significantly improve safety and fairness for truck drivers. Specifically, these bills are the government's response to the recommendations made in the National Transport Commission's landmark 2008 report Safe payments: addressing the underlying causes of unsafe practices in the road transport industry and the 2010 'Safe Rates, Safe Roads' directions paper. Our road transport industry employs over 246,000 Australians, and with 25 deaths per 100,000 that workers in 2008-09 this industry has a casualty rate 10 times higher than the average for all industries. In addition, around 250 people are killed and more than a thousand suffer serious injuries on our roads each year in accidents involving trucks. Australian truck drivers have been pushed to the limit. Some have been pressured to cut corners on safety and maintenance, some to speed in order to make unfair and unrealistic deadlines, sometimes even taking illicit substances to keep them awake to get to destinations on time, putting their lives and the lives of other Australian road users on the line just to make a decent living and repay their debts and make ends meet. These bills will help reduce these illegal and unsafe practices. Despite the significant contribution that the road transport industry makes to the Australian economy, a national approach to safety issues that addresses conditions in the industry, particularly for owner-drivers, has not been taken into account to date. As I have said, our transport industry is an integral part of the Australian economy, accounting for over 1.7 per cent of Australia's total gross domestic product. an industry that keeps Australia moving, making sure that supermarket shelves and petrol bowsers are filled and that building products are on site. And it is an industry that is growing. The road freight task is increasing at an annual rate of 5.6 per cent and is forecast to continue growing. Our Gillard government is committed to doing all that is necessary to sustain the long-term viability of the road transport industry, but we do not believe that productivity has to be at the expense of ensuring that truck drivers, whether employees or self-employed, have a safe and fair workplace. We believe this legislation will help reduce the high turnover of truckies out of the industry, and more experienced drivers are typically safer drivers. This government also recognises the important role played in the economy by small businesses, particularly owner-drivers, who make up 60 per cent of the road transport industry. We respect owner-drivers who choose to be independent contractors and operate as small businesses. We understand that owner-drivers and small fleets provide flexibility for businesses to meet the increasing demand for the delivery of goods, particularly in rural and regional areas. Yet we also know that almost 30 in every 100 owner-drivers are paid below award rates, with many unable to recover the cost of operating their vehicle. These bills establish a system that will assist road transport industry small businesses, while ensuring that owner-drivers maintain their status as independent contractors. To those who have raised concerns that these bills will increase the regulatory burden for all those involved in the road transport industry, let me be very clear. This legislation has been carefully developed to reinforce the benefits of other reforms, It is including those achieved by both industry and governments. These reforms include fatigue, chain of responsibility and work health and safety laws and complementing the role of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. Let me be clear. There is no way this new approach will ever cost the transport industry anything approaching the cost of the current carnage in lives. Under these bills, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal will be tasked to inquire into sectors, issues and practices within the road transport industry and, where appropriate, determine mandatory minimum rates of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed drivers. These rates will ensure that truck drivers do not need to meet gruelling schedules just to make ends meet and will allow for safer driving practices by these drivers. The government acknowledges that unpaid waiting times are a particular problem for both employees and ownerdrivers in the road transport industry. The tribunal will therefore also have the power to investigate unpaid waiting times and intervene where the issue is found to affect safety outcomes. Road safety remuneration orders made by the tribunal will be in addition to any existing rights employed drivers have under other industrial instruments and owner-drivers have under their contracts for service. To industry members who have expressed concern over the powers of the tribunal, let me assure you that the tribunal's approach will be evidence based and research focused. No orders will be made unless there is an identifiable link between pay or pay related conditions and on-road safety outcomes for that sector or sectors of the industry. If a road safety remuneration order would not result in safer driving, the tribunal does not have to make a determination for that sector, but, if it would make a difference, action can be taken. With the approach taken by this government, the tribunal might have regard to a number of issues, which include the need to apply fair, reasonable and enforceable standards in the road transport industry to ensure the safety and fair treatment of road transport drivers; the likely impact of any order on the viability of business involved in the road transport industry; the special circumstances of areas that are particularly reliant on the road transport industry, such as rural, regional other isolated areas; the likely impact of any order on the national economy and the movement of freight across the nation; and the need to minimise the compliance burden on the road transport industry. Australia's road transport industry is not single, monolithic entity, and our legislation is not designed to be a one-size-fits-all regulation. We have drivers who are couriers and drivers who drive short distances and long distances as well as drivers who transport livestock around our country. I am indebted to the member for New England for his advice on these next few paragraphs. These drivers have a general and specific regulation governing operations. Livestock transporters are subject to strict regulation on fatigue management and the welfare of the animals that they are transporting. For example, they may be required to make stops to unload and spell animals which might be stressed, ill or agitated. Heavy penalties apply to operators who operate outside these rules. We respect those members of the road transport industry who drive safely, operate fairly and take care of other drivers on the road. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal will have regard to the requirements of particular sectors of the industry. The transport of live animals is completely different from the courier sector and would require a different, distinct approach. Our key policy intent here is to ensure that there are sector-appropriate terms and conditions determined by the tribunal to enhance safety outcomes for drivers and safety outcomes for all of us who use Australia's roads. Orders can only be made after the tribunal considers a range of factors, which include the likely impact of any order on the viability of the relevant businesses. No order will be made without the opportunity for and stakeholders to be heard about their particular needs and operations. For example, in relation to the transport of livestock, a driver's ability to stick to a strict schedule may be impacted by things like, and not limited to, the vast distances a travelled in the larger states, such as in outback New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, which may require one or two spellings for the drivers to comply with existing laws to manage driver fatigue and to preserve the welfare of the animals-which is considered, appropriately, to be of paramount importance-or the location of saleyards mainly in major rural centres and the indispensable role they play in allowing livestock to be unloaded safely for the welfare of the travelling stock. However, of course these are not matters which would be relevant to an order for waste management drivers or courier drivers. Our bills do not conflate these matters and force parties into arrangements that are unrelated to their operations. The tribunal will be empowered to resolve disputes between drivers, their hirers or employers, and participants in the road transport industry supply chain about remuneration and related conditions, insofar as they provide incentives to work in an unsafe manner. The tribunal will deal with a dispute as it considers appropriate, including either by mediation or conciliation or by making a recommendation or expressing an opinionor indeed it could be with arbitration, with the consent of the parties. I foreshadow that I will move some amendments to this bill on behalf of the government. In the main, these amendments will clarify the tribunal's role in approving collective agreements under part 3 of the bill and ensuring that conduct by drivers and their hirers when negotiating giving effect to these agreements will not breach competition laws. It is important to remember that ownerdrivers are often forced to accept work at the going rate or to have no work at all. Drivers are often at the bottom of a long contracting chain and have little commercial ability, little Parke, M commercial bargaining power, to demand rates or set work schedules that enable them to perform their work safely and legally. The Gillard government, this government, firmly believes that these bills will improve the safety of truck drivers, bystanders, all of us and our families-all of us who use Australia's roads. I thank all the members who have participated in this debate. I thank the House for support for this important legislation, which I commend to the House.",50

The amendments the government is proposing today were developed in response to feedback received through submissions made by industry stakeholders to the parliamentary inquiry into the bills to align rules regarding exemptions from competition law for bargaining with those currently in operation in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia and to make consequential amendments and fix minor drafting errors. I would like to thank the House Standing Committee on Infrastructure Communications, chaired by the member for Cunningham, for conducting parliamentary inquiry into the bills. I note that the committee recommended that the House should pass its legislation. The amendments proposed by the government to the Road Remuneration Bill 2011 are designed to clarify the tribunal's role in approving road transport collective agreements consistent with the concurrent operation of laws regulating owner-drivers in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, to make clear that collective agreements entered into by contract drivers under these state laws are not road transport agreements for the purposes of part 3 of the bill and to allow certain conduct by contract drivers and their hirers to be exempt from the operation of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The effect of these amendments will be to enable contract drivers and hirers to collectively bargain and enter into approved collective agreements without breaching the Competition and Consumer Act. In addition, these amendments would ensure the same standing for registered organisations as it does for registered employee organisations under the legislation, provide time limits for when applications can be made to deal with a dispute arising from a dismissal or contract termination and make minor technical amendments to correct editorial errors or minor omissions.",55
25,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS," The government is introducing 64 amendments to this bill before the House. These amendments were only made available to the opposition late yesterday, even though I understand they were approved by caucus a couple of weeks ago. I have no doubt as well that they have been developed following consultation with the trade unions. Industry and also was made aware of these amendments, 64 of them, only yesterday. That is hardly a the good start for this proposed consultation process that surrounds this legislation. Indeed, this has been typical of the way in which the government has handled this bill right from the very beginning. Safety It arose out of a report in 2008 but we saw little subsequently from it until it was rushed into the parliament. The House of Representatives committee had only two hours of hearings. The minister rightly reported that the majority of the committee recommended that the bill be passed. However, he neglected to mention that there was a significant minority report which raised serious concerns about this legislation and its intent. This bill was introduced by the minister for transport on the basis that it was about road safety. It has now been transferred to the minister for industrial relations, which shatters any pretence that this bill ever had anything to do with road safety. It is all about industrial relations and union power. So the minister is introducing, for the unions, these 64 amendments that further intrude employer into the commercial arrangements in the trucking industry and add to the pervasive nature of this legislation. It leaves every person in this country who ever drives a truck uncertain about how they will be able to work in the future. The new tribunal that is being established will have the capacity to intervene in almost any element of industry where a truck is involved. I am not saying they will always do it, but they will have the capacity to do it, because this legislation is so broad ranging. Turning to some of the major amendments first. The minister acknowledged in his comments that the majority of the amendments were about part III. There are a extensive number of amendments that correct drafting errors. It is a bit surprising that there would be drafting errors in a bill that has been under preparation since 2008, but it seems that has happened. I will concentrate mainly on matters of substance. The government's amendment in section 33(6) says: Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, a road transport collective agreement has no effect unless it is an approved road transport collective agreement. A road transport collective agreement is defined under section 33(1) as an agreement between contractor drivers and a hirer that specifies remuneration and related conditions for the driver who provides the applicable service to the participating driver. A contract driver is defined in the amendments as 'an independent contractor'. The effect of the amendment is that any contract between a group of independent contractors, or ownerdrivers, and a hirer must be approved by the road safety remuneration tribunal. Section 33 in the original bill states that the tribunal 'may grant a safe remuneration approval for a road transport collective agreement' where certain conditions are met. This is entirely different to the amendment and warrants further consideration and consultation with industry. On the face of it there are a number of problems with this amendment. Firstly, the amendment would have the effect that all current agreements, except those made under existing state regulatory regimes, between groups of owner-drivers and hirers would be null and void as they are not approved road transport collective agreements. They would have to be immediately renegotiated and that would put hirers and owner-drivers who are parties to these agreements in a precarious situations. Additionally, this immediately undermines the sanctity of the commercial contracts between the two companies involved in contract drivers. How, for example, will it affect the commercial agreements between, say, Holden and those companies that transport their cars? Are these agreements now valid, are they void, are they unlawful or are they just unenforceable? Secondly, the bill erodes the concept of the independent contractor. This amendment takes this erosion one step further by reducing their ability to negotiate terms and conditions that they believe to be adequate. (Time expired)",60
26,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,I seek leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted.,61
27,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"The bill will centralise contracts for groups of independent contractors and in doing so it will limit their opportunity. It has the potential to hamper competition and remove flexibilities. In this way the bill has the potential to make it less attractive to hire groups of owner-drivers. Additionally, the tribunal will be ill equipped to deal with the potential volume of contracts that it will be required to approve. The bill was touted as a road safety measure but we have been told that the tribunal it establishes will issue orders to make sure that drivers have remuneration and related conditions designed to ensure that they will drive safely. However, the amendment goes much further than that. It give the tribunal the power and the responsibility to approve agreements between groups of owner drivers and hirers. It just goes to show that this is not about road safety. It is about industrial relations and, of course, the great payback to the Transport Workers Union. Turning to section 33(1), the government amendments define a 'road transport collective agreement' as an agreement that 'specifies remuneration or related conditions (or both)' for groups of owner drivers who make an agreement for 'the provision of specified road transport services'. The important distinction between amendment and the original definition of a road transport collective agreement is the deletion of the word 'and' and the insertion the word 'or'. That amendment relates to contracts for remuneration and related conditions where the amendment relates to contracts for 'remuneration or related conditions (or both)'. This broadens the scope of the tribunal's requirement to approve collective agreements between groups of owner operates and their hirer. It was argued by some submitters to the House Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications that the matters on which the tribunal could make a road safety remuneration order were too broad. Now, there is scope for it to be even wider. They did not heed the advice given to the committee and in effect have made the bill worse. The amendment broadens the scope of the sort of conditions and matters that a group of independent contractors can seek an approved agreement on. Importantly, it goes far beyond matters within the original intent of the bill that would have to be approved by the tribunal before taking effect. In section 33(3) the government's amendment inserts the following: The regulations may prescribe a code of conduct in relation to collective bargaining for road transport collective agreements. The government's amendments insert section 34(c), which says that in order to grant approval for a road transport collective agreement the tribunal must be satisfied that: … the participating hirer and the participating drivers have conducted themselves in accordance with any code of conduct prescribed under subsection 33(3) … Not only is it unusual for the minister to be issuing guidelines to the industry and the tribunal that control how bargaining in the trucking industry occurs, but the provisions of the bill are due to come into effect on 1 the July this year. When will we see these regulations? When will we see the code of conduct the government is proposing? What of is its scope? What matters will it cover? There has been no consultation by the government about these issues with the industry. The only guidance in the bill is section 33(5), which says: A code of conduct prescribed under subsection (3) must have as its object the facilitation of effective and efficient collective bargaining for road transport collective agreements. This is supposed to be about road safety, but this clause makes clear it is far more about collective bargaining than about safety. What does all this really mean? What will be the scope for the code of conduct? The government's amendments insert clause 33(4), which states: Before the Governor General makes a regulation under subsection (3)to stipulate a code of conductthe Minister must consult with industry and the Tribunal. But the government have shown no willingness to discuss these issues with industry over the last few years. Their discussions are exclusively with the union movement, yet this legislation is going to affect not only trade union members; every person who ever wants to drive a truck could be affected. The farmer who delivers his grain to the depot in his own truck may suddenly become subject to rulings by this new tribunal. The man who transports his mower from one factory to another to mow lawns could be picked up by this because he is undertaking a transport task. All of this is included within the definitions in this bill. It certainly massively extends powers to the trade union movement to dominate this sector even further. That is what this is all about. We know the Transport Workers Union has been very good to the Labor Party over the years and now they are getting some of their reward. The reality is that this particular industry- (Time expired)",61
28,Dr STONE,PAIRS," I too want to make a contribution in relation to the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the amendments that have just been proposedall 64 of them. The electorate of Murray has one of the highest number of truck registrations of any regional area in Australia. I see those representatives of the trucking industry regularly in my office. They are small owner-operators, big intergenerational family businesses and big national operators, and not one of them has once said to me that their drivers will be any safer, or if they themselves are drivers that they will be any safer, as a result of a difference in pay. Their problems with safety are to do with the lack of harmonisation of road transport rules across Australia, the lack of adequate driver courtesy on the roads where they have to tangle with local mum and dad type traffic, the skills shortage, the ageing workforce and the number of hours they have to drive. Their safety issues are also to do with the often unconscionable behaviour of their biggest employers, the two big supermarkets-Coles and Woolworths, the owners of 80 per cent-plus of retail in the supermarket sector-that put undue pressure on them in terms of the time frames in which they must pick up and deliver their cargo. There is a whole range of problems with our transport industry and perhaps one of the biggest for small owner-operators, who are always close to being financially unsustainable, is that they will always need a lot of supports. But they are not going to get any supports through this Road Safety Remuneration Bill. With these amendments, it is extraordinary that there is a suggestion that the capacity to collude and come up with contracts whereby people have been able to collectively bargain will lead to greater road safety. That is just nonsense. We all know that collective bargaining has been suggested and approved, for example, for dairy farmers and tomato growers. But in the Australian context, you are faced with the huge duopolies, who are very apt to retaliate should you raise your head above the parapet and demand better remuneration for your effort. In that situation, to suggest that collective agreements are going to work for the small contractor, or even collections of bigger road transport operators, is just unrealistic and naive in the extreme. We do need a great deal of attention paid to our road transport sector. We depend so much on the freight task around Australia because our rail and our shipping is not viable as an alternative in many areas. We do have a crisis because of our skills shortage and the ageing population of our transport operators. We do have problems with the small owner-operator who has one or two trucks having to slash their prices to a point where they cannot be profitable for very long because they are competing at the margins. Yet here we have a bill which falsely implies that there is a relationship between salaries paid and safety on the road. Again, it is naive and it is nonsense. I think it is an insult to the hard-working transport sector. As our shadow minister made the point, there may be a lot of very perverse outcomes as a consequence of this bill, because it is about the trade union's power and their capacity to fund the Labor Party into the future. It is not about the industry sector. It is not about the rank and file transport operators. They were not consulted. In my part of the world, where we have the highest number of transport registrations of anywhere in rural Australia, they were not closely consulted about these changes. They are terrified of what this new tribunal might do. They certainly do not think collective bargaining is going to give them any greater advantage in becoming more viable in the future. Let us look at the real problems facing transport sector. Let us make sure that we have better harmonised road rules. Let us ensure that the transport industry is treated with respect and in a way that it can be sustainable in the future. Let us make sure, for example, that we can safely put enhanced B-doubles on the road. Let us have more inland ports. Let us have less congestion in places like the ports where trucks have to wait hour upon hour, sometimes days, to offload their contracted cargo. This bill is a nonsense and I cannot support it.",63
29,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS," I am pleased to rise to speak on this extensive list of amendments which has been put to the House by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations at very short notice and to ask whether the process that is being pursued here in relation to this very substantial change in the regulatory scheme embodied in this bill is one that the House ought to agree to when the effort that has been made to explain the policy rationale for it is threadbare. There is naturally a suspicion in the case of this minister that he is dancing to the tune of his union masters. There is naturally a suspicion that the primary motive for this amendment is to address the legislative and regulatory ambitions and agenda of the union movement. That suspicion can only be enhanced by the shocking process which has been demonstrated in the way that these detailed amendments have been put before the House, because these amendments fundamentally change the regulatory and legislative scheme that the House is considering. They are a fundamental change to what has been put to the House as a measure about road safety. Objective observers have doubted whether that is a fair claim, and those doubts are now revealed to be absolutely valid based upon the fundamental change in the scope and breadth our and the reach of the work of this new tribunal. What we now learn is that this is a tribunal which is going to have a very substantive industrial relations agenda and a very broad reach. What we are now told is that no collective agreement in this sector will be valid or will be legal unless it is approved by this tribunal. All of the pretence that this has something to do with road safety has now gone out of the window. We now learn at very short notice-although these amendments, we understand, have been available to the government for a considerable period of time, they have been dumped on the chamber at very short notice-is that their affect and their intention is to greatly broaden the reach of this tribunal, greatly broaden the breadth of the matters not only in which it has a right to engage itself but also over which it has the right to exercise a veto. That is the fundamental point here in the provisions that the House is being asked to consider as we weigh up the merits of the amendments which have just been tabled by the minister. We then asked, amongst other things, to consider whether it is good policy for this tribunal to have a right of veto over any so called road transport collective agreement, having regard particularly to the very expansive definition of 'road transport collective agreement'. This is an exercise in the expansion of the reach of government and the reach of the industrial supervisory mechanism and administration for which this government has such fondness, based no doubt upon the background of almost every member of this government, emerging as they do from deep within the industrial relations machine which has for so long been a powerful part of our nation, in many ways to its detriment. The provisions which have been put before the House this afternoon should only be supported if the government can discharge the burden of proof that these new arrangements, giving this tribunal an expansive power to veto any collective agreement in the road transport sector, achieve in some way an objective of road safety. As with the substantive bill, they not been able to discharge that burden-they have not even sought to. On that basis I will not be supporting these amendments. (Time expired)",64
30,Mr OAKESHOTT,PAIRS," These amendments do for me create further concerns about this bill and how this is now trying to establish what looks to be a new and different process to existing ones rather than investing well in the existing ones to improve safety on our roads. There is no question that every member of this chamber would support safer roads, safer behaviour from drivers and better conditions for ownerdrivers as well as for those who work for larger trucking companies. However, there are established processes that we should invest in. There are laws that have already been passed by the chamber, such as the Fair Work Act and the Independent Contractors Act. We should also acknowledge all the various state authorities-whether they are police or weight-of-load groups-and local government authorities involved in trying to make roads and conditions as safe as possible. These amendments that have come in over the last 24 hours-and this bill more generally-look to be establishing a new and different process to the very good existing ones which I would hope everyone continues to invest in. Enforcement is frustrating for all involved-for families on the road and for drivers. It is frustrating working through these existing processes. But that is where the hard grind of getting safer roads will occur. I do not accept the argument that there is a very simple magic bullet answer of increasing wages by legislation, which I thought was Work Choices and the argument around Work Choices, and that that directly links to more safety on our roads. I think have safety on our roads is a much more complex issue to deal with. So I would hope, even if this legislation with amendments does pass, that we do not give up on the hard grind of using the existing processes that are already in place. That is really where the heavy lifting on road safety and better conditions for drivers is occurring. I say that not only as a member of parliament but also because one of my first jobs was to work for the Road Transport Forum, which was an organisation that worked closely with drivers in the trucking industry. One of my first jobs was to work on a men's health program, with 200 companies in the trucking industry. As a very young 20-year-old, I sat at the Marulan truckstop talking to drivers about the food they were eating, the drugs they were taking and the lifestyle they were leading. That has a lot to do with safety on our roads, as well as wages and conditions. Safety is a complex story and we need to see much greater investment from both Commonwealth and state authorities, but not necessarily through adding new layers, new bodies and new processes. Rather, it requires investing heavily in the existing ones where good work has been done in the past and good work needs to be done in the future. These amendments only add to my concerns and to why I continue not to support this. That is not a statement to say that I do not think drivers and families on the road do not have a case about safety. They do, but there are existing processes and existing laws in place that I hope we can use better to achieve the safety and conditions outcomes that we want.",65
31,Mr CHESTER,PAIRS," I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the bill before the House and to follow the member for Lyne. The member for Lyne and I do not always see eye to eye but this is one occasion when we are firmly on the same page. His comments relating particularly to the need to invest in the existing approach to road safety were very valid. He also made a very good comment that the hard grind of safer roads is something that is not going to be overcome by some sort of magic bullet or the Holy Grail that this safe roads legislation is put up to be in the broader community. He raises a very important point that it would be wrong to suggest in any way that there is any member in this place who has not already personally invested in the issue of safer roads industry. or who has tried to find ways to deal with these issues involving the heavy transport industry. I was a supplementary member of the committee which conducted the inquiry. I am just not convinced on the evidence that has been presented to me that the government has made a case. The comments by the member for Lyne, particularly in relation to investing in the existing approach, sit very well with the dissenting report that was put forward by the minority group-the coalition members. The members who made that dissenting report did so in very good faith. There was no sense of a party political nature or any animosity at all to that dissenting report. It was all about putting forward what we thought was a very valid argument, that there was existing activity being undertaken within the heavy vehicle transport industry which needed to be given time to be bedded down. I refer particularly to the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. We felt that the evidence we received during that inquiry reinforced that position. The coalition members of the committee were also conscious of the incredible complexity of rules and regulations which already exist in relation to the heavy vehicle transport industry. What we see here today will not only add to that complexity, but also it will present an issue of duplication which could be a factor causing even more uncertainty in the industry. We are concerned that this extra layer of bureaucracy will not improve safety outcomes. It will lead to increased costs for the industry and consumers and then almost become self-defeating. It has been argued to us that there is an economic imperative facing these safety issues. We are concerned that we are going to end up with a situation where the extra costs will be self-defeating by putting more pressure on the transport It was with those thoughts in mind that the dissenting report was put into the inquiry process. I was disappointed that no opportunity was given for the committee's report to be tabled in the parliament before we started debating this legislation. I made those points during the earlier debate. Again, we see a process here where we have 64 amendments being presented to the House, with very little opportunity for members to assess them and get an understanding of where the government is going with this issue. I am concerned at the whole process, from the moment the government decided to bring on this debate without even respecting the committee process. The committee was chaired by the member for Cunningham, who did an excellent job in that role. As I said earlier, all members participated in that inquiry in good faith and it was disappointing for them to have the legislation brought on for debate before other members had the chance to even assess the committee's report. I thought this was disappointing on behalf of the government members. On the issue of tinkering, if you like, the commercial arrangements in this industry, it is something that is becoming of greater concern to the transport operators in my electorate. I have had the opportunity to speak to many of them about this issue. They are concerned at the unintended consequences-the perverse consequenceswhich may occur when you start having regulatory bodies-the tribunal in this case-effectively setting pay rates. They are concerned at the impact that that is going to have on the transport industry. There is a complex matrix of decisions that are made in relation to how the heavy transport industry sets its rates. A classic example that one of the transport operators pointed out to me was the case of travelling between Melbourne and Adelaide. A transport operator working the MelbourneAdelaide route will make his or her money on the route to Adelaide. On the backload from Adelaide they are prepared to accept a much lower rate because they have to get back to Melbourne to load up and make their money again going to Adelaide-if that makes sense. So the backhaul rate from Adelaide will be a lower amount. I am not sure how this tribunal will be able to deal with the commercial reality of a market force at work. This is a very complex issue that needs to be worked out. I am not sure that the tribunal will not end up in all sorts of trouble by tinkering with a commercial reality. That is one of the biggest issues facing this piece of legislation-the tribunal's work in interfering with the market. (Time expired)",66
32,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS," I rise to add my support for the member for Lyne with his position of strengthening the existing powers of compliance and also to address the 64 amendments that have been put before the House as we speak. With reference to this legislation, I come from a with transport background in Queensland so I have tried in all faith to meticulously go through the bill and, at very short notice, the amendments. On election to this place I gave a commitment to the people of Wright that I would stand up and be the voice of the silent majority. I commenced my investigations into this issue with the 29 submissions that were received in the lead-up to the inquiry. I was overwhelmed by the government's position, given the evidence to the inquiry, because only nine of the 29 submissions received were supportive of it. When you go through and digest those submissions, you find that predominantly, with the exception of three academics, the remaining organisations that were supportive had the word 'union' in their title. When you look at the remaining 20 who were not supportive of it, they predominantly had the word 'transport' in their title. The list is publicly available for everyone to look at. I thought: that is the overwhelming will of the transport industry. The list of submissions is available for you to have a quick look at. When I spoke with members who gave submissions to the committee, their issue was that there was another layer of compliance, and they raised genuine concerns about it. I trust that in the minister's response he will allay those concerns. In addition to that, the process by which this bill should come through the House should have been open and transparent, but that was somewhat perverted as well. I believe the bill was introduced into the House before the recommendations of the committee had been tabled. As a new member, I would not suggest that that is the common practice of the House. So I have concerns that full and frank debate was not available. When you couple that with the time frame in which these amendments have hit this place, there just seems to be",67
33,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The question before the chair is that we are taking the bill as a whole. I think we should be speaking to the bill. The member is dealing with the processes. I ask the honourable member to come back to the bill.,68
34,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, we are speaking to the amendments, aren't we, at the moment?",68
35,Mr Shorten,PAIRS,"You're not. We'd need to send out a tracker dog to find them. Mrs Gash: Oh, come on!",68
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order!,68
37,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS,"That is a fair enough point. I can talk to the amendments with clarity, but in getting to those points it is very important to understand the mood of the industry and their position when, overwhelmingly, 75 per cent of the members of transport organisations are not supportive of this process, and rightfully so. Let us look at some of the amendments, in particular subclause 33, where it speaks to collective agreements and enterprise bargaining. Let us take the hypothetical of two truck driversan independent operator and someone who buys their truck from Kenworth in their local township. They are loading up at a dock from someone who buys their truck directly from the manufacturers in Europe, who, potentially, before they leave the dock, have a $50,000 advantage. Let us look at their biggest expense-fuel. One operator has the capacity to buy fuel directly from the terminals at a price cheaper than the independent guy can buy it from the service station. So, when setting these rates in the tribunals, which are spoken to in the amendments of this bill, how are they calculated? It is a win-win for one of those parties on the principle that, if it is $1,000 to do a Sydney-Melbourne run- (Time expired)",68
38,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS," I would like to talk to these amendments and more broadly to the bill itself. But before doing so, I congratulate Nick Champion, the member for Wakefield, on his elevation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, which I have served on since I entered the parliament. It is a very good committee. I wish him well and, as his deputy, I will cooperate very well with him.",68
39,Mr Champion,PAIRS,I'm the young apprentice.,68
40,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"Yes, the sorcerer's apprentice! The member for Gippsland in his contribution to this debate put his finger on it when he said that in coming to these amendments we need to know the background of what the coalition members had to say about the bill. The four of us on the committee did not get together in a coalition cabal. We felt that the report fairly reflected the evidence that was given; but, when we came to delineating the issues, we did not think the case had been made for a second tribunal. After all, we have got Fair Work Australia. Why do we need this second tribunal? The shadow minister at the table has just said that one of these amendments puts a very heavy onus on this new road safety remuneration tribunal insofar as, if you have a contract between a group of independent contractors-perhaps an owner-driver and an employer or a directing company-it must be approved, not maybe approved, by the tribunal. Many things can affect the livelihoods of long-haul truck drivers. Twelve years ago the committee I just referred to did a seminal study over many months on fatigue in transport. We went into all the things that member for Lyne talked about-the quality of food, the rest periods, the truck drivers drove, their circadian rhythms, their slotting at their loading docks and their slotting at supermarket docks and the like. All those add to the pressures. It is not just simply a matter of pay. There is an argument that if pay were increased it may not lead to any less stressful attention to drivers but rather it may lead to some rogue employers pushing their drivers even harder on the one hand and, on the other, some of the greedy drivers, who should be taking it a bit easier, to go for more money by doing even more work. So for all sorts of reasons I do not think that is going to solve the problem. The minister at the table has asked us to debate this in the very purest sense of the word, but really, Minister, to give your coalition colleagues less than 24 hours notice of these amendments",68
41,Mr Shorten,PAIRS,That's just not true.,69

45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The honourable member for Hinkler has the call.,69
46,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"We have had the members for Wide Bay and Wright tell us that they had trouble getting access to the amendments. I have a good relationship with the TWU, as Tony Sheldon will tell you. He has been a good supporter of the work I have done on transport over the years. He said, on 11 July last year: Under the carbon tax, drivers will be forced to do longer hours, sweat their trucks further, have less maintenance, and that means more deaths. That is saying that there are factors other the than remuneration. That was quite a sobering quote. On the Nine Network on the same time of day that night, he said: How are we going to meet the extra $100 to $200 a week when this tax starts smacking truck drivers right in the teeth? It is a very worrying thing. It is not as simplistic as the government want us to believe. Along with the shadow minister at the table, I oppose these amendments.",69
47,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS," I rise to speak further about the amendments which have been put before the House today. The process by which these amendments have been brought forward is, on any view, lamentable. It is disgraceful. It shows a contempt for the democratic processes in the people's House. I am sorry to say that it is entirely consistent with the consistent contempt for process",69

50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The parliament is discussing the Road Safety and Remuneration Bill 2011 and there are 64 amendments. The member will address the amendments as a whole and will not discuss matters outside that tight area which is before the House.,69
51,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS,"I want to go to the differences between the definition of 'road transport collective agreement', which appears in clause 33(2) of the bill, and 33, which appears in the amendments. There are some significant differences-differences which I think the House ought to consider very carefully before it is prepared to agree to this amendment. One of the questions that strikes me as an obvious one, when you look at the wording of proposed clause 33, is the question of whether individual drivers need to be aware that there are other drivers who have also contracted with the hiring party. On my review of the term 'road transport collective agreement' as it is contained in clause 33, it strikes me as entirely possible that you might have a situation in which a hiring party issues a tender calling for parties wishing to drive under a contract for the hiring organisation. They accept the terms which are issued but, because there is more than one driver who has accepted those terms, it automatically becomes a road transport collective agreement, even though there is no collective intention or state of mind between the individual drivers. I invite the minister to respond and explain to me whether that interpretation is correct or not and, if it is not, to give me assurances as to why it is not. If that interpretation is correct we have here the long hand of the extensive and growing, intrusive industrial relations governance apparatus of this Rudd-Gillard government reaching into yet another area of economic activity, where hitherto individual business entities-people such as truck drivers-have been free to carry out their businesses without the unnecessary overweening bureaucratic supervision of yet another instrumentality of this collectivist and interventionist government. By virtue of the drafting of proposed clause 33 we now have the extension of the scope of the activities of this tribunal into commercial arrangements which may very well be made, as far as an clause individual driver is concerned, on an individual basis with a hiring party, but, because of the drafting, he or she suddenly finds that they are caught up, quite to their surprise, in what is deemed to be a road transport collective agreement, and then that agreement cannot proceed unless it has been compulsorily considered by this tribunal. That is a very serious matter of public policy. It is a significant interference in the freedom of contract, and the House ought to consider that very carefully.",70
52,Mr CHESTER,PAIRS," I appreciate the opportunity to continue my contribution in relation to these matters. I congratulate the member for Bradfield on the point that he has just raised. I think it is a valid argument. I would also like to expand on the points that were made a few moments ago by the member for Hinkler and others. My comment relates to the complexity already in the industry given its current arrangements, particularly in the way rates are agreed to. It is something that I touched on before when I referred to the issue of a transport operator working, for example, the Melbourne to Adelaide route. My concern is that once governments-in this case, the tribunalstart interfering in this sort of marketplace there will be some perverse outcomes. I am not one who argues that there should be no government involvement in markets when it is justified. But I think we must proceed with caution in this case and ensure that we do not end up causing more problems when we are clumsily trying to provide answers for the industry, particularly when we are talking about an issue as important as safety. A point that my local transport industry operators raise with me regularly in our discussions is that they already have so many other regulations in this industry and there are extensive provisions already in place to deal with any transport operators or individual drivers who flout the existing laws. If anything, there was a concern expressed to me from those within the transport industry that the drivers themselves can pay a very heavy economic price for what are fairly minor breaches. The point I am making is that, if the TWU is right and those opposite are right that there are economic pressures or commercial pressures which are systemic as they relate to the safety issue, then we also need to look at some of the issues relating to the enforcement provisions and the degree of fines being paid by truck drivers for very minor or innocent breaches or mistakes. So I think that is an issue that we need to examine more closely. The member for Lyons talked before about the existing provisions in place and having to invest in a whole range of other safety efforts, and I think he is right in that regard. State and federal governments have not been quiet on this issue. They have been working very hard, and there has been some level of success. We only need to look at the accident statistics in recent years to see that there has been a reduction. I am not for one second suggesting that we give up our efforts in that regard, but there has been a reduction in the accident fatality rates in recent years and I think we should be giving time for some existing efforts to be fully implemented. That matter of the commercial issues in the transport industry and the impact that they have on safety is something that the TWU has argued strongly about. The member for Hinkler referred to some comments made by the TWU representative, Mr Tony Sheldon, in relation to the carbon tax. It is relevant to this debate, when we talking about so-called 'safe rates', that we have the TWU pointing out that the carbon tax is going to force drivers to find an extra $100 to $200 a week, so it is almost counterproductive",70
53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. We are debating the amendments to this bill. We are not debating the carbon tax. I call the honourable member for Gippsland.,71
54,Mr CHESTER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not seeking to argue your point but the point that I was referring to is this: we are going down a path where in the submission that was made to the inquiry the TWU strongly argued the case that there are systemic commercial and economic pressures which are resulting in poor safety outcomes, but at the same time we are introducing other bits of legislation which are going to put more commercial pressures on the transport industry. It is almost counterproductive to be doing one thing while you are doing the other thing. So that is the point I was trying to make, Mr Deputy Speaker, without wishing to argue about your ruling. The Leader of the Nationals, in his contribution, also referred to the fact that this bill erodes the concept of independent contractors, and the amendments that we are discussing take this erosion of the status of independent contractors one step further by reducing their ability to negotiate terms and conditions that they believe are adequate. This bill and the amendments we are talking about will centralise contracts for groups of independent contractors and, in doing so, limit their opportunity to bargain. They have the potential to hamper competition and may remove the flexibility which is so important for industry. So in this way I believe the bill has the potential to make hiring groups of are owner-drivers less attractive. The point I am making is that I believe that in going down this path and in tampering with an industry we run the risk of creating unintended consequences and ending up, in terms of this very important issue of safety, having some perverse outcomes and not actually achieving what we set out to achieve in the first place. As many members on this side have indicated, while this bill has been touted as a road safety measure, we are concerned that it is more about industrial relations. We believe that existing safety efforts should be given the chance to be bedded down and that safety is a very complex issue. I do not disagree at all that fatigue undoubtedly plays a part in it, but I think that by focusing on this issue alone we might be diverting attention from the more holistic approach, which is what the dissenting report indicated, a view which was supported by the coalition members during the inquiry process.",71
55,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS," I rise to make an additional contribution on the merits or otherwise of the 64 amendments in relation to the Road Safety Remuneration Bill which have been put before the House at very short notice. I want to consider the amendments against the backdrop of the short title of the bill, being: A Bill for an Act to make provision in relation remuneration-related matters to improve safety in the road transport industry, and for related purposes Against that backdrop I want to ask this question: why do the new provisions which are being put before the House for consideration this afternoon make very little reference to safety and do not even attempt to maintain the merest fiction that they have something to do with safety? Say we look, for example, at new clause 32A, which is proposed to be added to the bill. Clause32A(1) says 'the tribunal may approve a road transport collective agreement'. Clause 32A(2) says: … In deciding whether to approve a road transport collective agreement, the Tribunal may have regard to whether the benefit of approving the agreement would outweigh the detriment to the public constituted by any lessening of competition … I particularly direct your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that nowhere in clause 32A(2) does the word 'safety' appear. Nowhere in clause 32A(2) is any attempt made to frame the considerations which the tribunal must have regard to such that they are limited to safety or such that safety is defined to be the primary consideration which the tribunal must bring to bear as it weighs up the benefit it finds in the agreement against such detriment as it identifies. I think that is very significant because it demonstrates that in this set of amendments, particularly including proposed clause 32A, any pretence that this is about safety has been thrown out the window because of the enthusiasm with which this minister is rushing to urge the parliament to extend the reach and scope of the extensive industrial regulatory apparatus which this government has so enthusiastically expanded. It is interesting, too, to look at clause 36 in amendment (35) of the 64 to amendments which have been put before the House at such short notice. It reads: The participating hirer in relation to an approved road transport collective agreement must not provide remuneration or related conditions, to a contractor driver who is providing applicable services to the participating hirer, that are less beneficial than the remuneration or related conditions specified in the agreement. Where is the language about safety? Where is the express direction to the tribunal to consider safety? Where is the restriction on the conduct of the participating hirer in relation to safety? It is not there. There is nothing about safety in that particular clause. That clause is a perfectly straightforward, stock-standard piece of industrial regulatory machinery dealing with remuneration and related matters. It again demonstrates that these amendments take this bill even further from its claimed objective, its claimed purpose and its claimed policy intention of dealing with road safety. It puts this bill squarely into the territory of expanding the reach of the industrial regulatory apparatus of this government and squarely into the territory of seeking to limit the freedom of individual businesses to contract, including in the truck-driving sector. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (12:54): I rise to speak on the amendments to the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011. What I find absolutely surprising-it is probably not surprising given the record of this government-is that only yesterday the opposition got notice that the government would move 64 amendments to a bill that they have prepared to bring to this parliament. It is no wonder that this economy is in such a mess when you find that they have to propose 64 amendments to a bill before the parliament in this autumn sitting. After the leadership struggles that they have gone through over the last few weeks, it is not surprising that we have a confused government and that the minister responsible for this is bringing forward 64 amendments with no relationship to safety. I am trying to find the word 'safety' in the amendments. There is a lot about collective agreements, which is about union power. That is the motivation, I believe, for these amendments. I have an electorate that depends very heavily on the transport sector, not least because of the failure of the state Labor government up there to invest in rail infrastructure. They have let it run down to the point where they are closing railway lines rather than building railway lines.",72
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! The honourable member will come to the amendments before the House. Mr Bruce SCOTT: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I want to make the point that my electorate depends very heavily on the trucking industry, whether it is for the agricultural sector or the mining sector, which is expanding day by day in my electorate and brings heavy machinery, such as mining equipment, into the electorate. Of course, when it comes to the transport of food to supply communities across the electorate of Maranoa, it comes in on trucks, not on trains. So we depend very heavily on the trucking sector. I have a great deal of respect for those truck operators, whether they are private or part of a large corporation or company, because they work incredibly hard. I have family members involved in the trucking industry. I know them well and I also know how hard they are finding it to be able to secure drivers and compete against the mining sector, which pays very large salaries to people to work in the mining sector.",73
57,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member will come back to the amendments before the House. Mr Bruce SCOTT: Yes, thank you, Deputy Speaker. I am saying that the truck operators are finding it very difficult to attract drivers. They pay above award rates to attract drivers now because they have to keep their businesses going. If they do not have a driver, they do not have a business. They are competing with the mining sector, in terms of the salaries that the mining sector can pay, to be able to run their businesses. I find clause 33(6)(a) extraordinary. It says: 'The effect of this amendment is that any contract between a group of independent contractors'-that is, owner-drivers-'and a hirer must be approved by the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal'. Section 33 in the original bill stated that the tribunal may approval for the road transport collective agreements where certain conditions are met. I can assure you, Minister, that if I went to the owner-operators and truck operators in my electorate and said, 'If you want to hire a new driver, you must be approved by the road Safety Remuneration Tribunal'-they are desperate to keep their businesses moving ahead; they have to keep the wheels moving or otherwise they do not have a business-I would not like to repeat in this House the language they would use in reply to me. It would have to be approved by the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. How long will that take? Weeks? Months? If you are out in Western Queensland and have to bring livestock in when there is a window of opportunity after the floods",73
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will come back to the amendments. Mr Bruce SCOTT: I am describing the problem.,74
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"This is not a general debate. It is a debate about the amendments before the House. Mr Bruce SCOTT: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. What I am concerned about is that I know the truck operators and owneroperators in my electorate would be very concerned about having to get approval from the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal when they want to employ a new driver, particularly in remote areas, quite apart from the fact that those in the more inner areas would object to it as well. I am opposed to these amendments. They demonstrate this government's confusion. (Time expired)",74
60,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS," I rise to speak further about the merits or otherwise of the 64 detailed amendments which have been provided to the House at grant very short notice and which appear to have the effect of substantially expanding the scope of operations of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal and which make it clear that this is really about industrial matters and that all pretence at dealing with safety has been thrown out of the window. One of the matters which raises very grave concerns from the point of view of public policy is the impact of these arrangements on competition. I am referring particularly to clause 37A of the amendments and of the new bill if the amendments take effect. Clause 37A is headed 'Authorisation of conduct for the purposes of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010'. Let us remind ourselves what the Competition and Consumer Act does. The Competition and Consumer Act, previously known and perhaps still better known as the Trade Practices Act, is intended to ensure that, in the conduct of business in Australia, the interests of consumers are maximised by maximising the force of competition. The whole idea is that you have companies and organisations and individuals in business competing with each other to the most vigorous extent possible with a view to delivering to customers, to end users and to ordinary Australians the lowest prices",74
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order!,74
62,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS,"and the best quality of service. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is central to the question of the merits of proposed section 37A, 'Authorisation of conduct for the purposes of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010'. As is revealed by the inclusion of this provision in the bill, there is a fundamental tension between allowing the forces of competition to flourish in the interests of customers and end users and the collectivist mentality which underpins this bill.",74
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will return to the matters before the House.,75
64,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am discussing quite specifically clause 37A, 'Authorisation of conduct'",75
65,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The matters before the House are 64 amendments. The honourable member will address the amendments before the House.,75
66,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, clause 37A is amendment (40), and that is specifically and precisely what I am addressing in these remarks. The question",75
67,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will take directions from the chair. The honourable member will continue his comments by addressing the amendments before the House.,75
68,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am addressing amendment (40), which is headed: 'Clause 37A Authorisation of conduct for the purposes of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010'. The question I am suggesting the House ought consider very carefully as it considers whether or not it is a good idea to pass this amendment is whether it is a good idea to grant such an authorisation. Let us be very clear about this. The effect of such an authorisation is that conduct which would otherwise be illegal under the Competition and Consumer Act as a breach of provisions dealing with, for example, restraint of trade or anti-competitive agreements between competitors is specifically authorised by provision. The question that that requires House to consider is whether the detriment to competition, which is clearly admitted by the fact that the government has thought it necessary to include this amendment in the bill, is justified by the claimed benefit, which we are told has something to do with safety but which, upon analysis, is in fact a set of measures designed to extend the reach of the industrial regulatory apparatus which this government has been so enthusiastically expanding, measures which are going to make it harder for ordinary business people to get on and do their job.",75
69,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the 64 amendments before the House at the moment but specifically proposed subsection 33(6), which, if inserted into the act, would read: Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, a road transport collective agreement has no effect unless it is an approved road transport collective agreement. A road transport collective agreement is defined in clause 33(1) as an agreement between the contracted driver and the hirer: that specifies remuneration or related conditions (or both) for participating drivers who provide applicable services to the participating hirer. The effect of the amendment is that the contract between the group of the independent contractors, known as the owner-drivers, and a hirer must be approved by the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. With that in mind, I take you to the example of two operators sitting on a dock. One, through successful business models, has wonderful vertical integrations and is able to provide a service-for example, from Sydney to Melbourne in a line-haul type environment-several hundred dollars cheaper because of his buying power capacity. When the tribunal under section 33(6) then goes to set those collective this agreements referred to in the amendments, the how is the independent operator able to find any leverage? It is a win-win scenario for the larger operator and actually a lose-lose scenario for the smaller operator. The example I draw you to is the buying power that the big guy has. If the big bloke can at $1,000 and the smaller bloke can only do it at $1,200 and the rate is going to be set at $1,200, which I believe would be the safe rate to look after the smaller bloke, the big fellow is laughing all the way to the bank because he has just picked up a $200 increase, which gives him more market dominance and the capacity with the greater margin to buy more trucks and dominate. I suggest the implication or an unintended consequence of this particular amendment among the 64 amendments before the House is more far reaching than was first considered. I would also like to draw your attention to proposed subsection 33(1) and the distinction between the original definition of road transport collective agreement' and the effect of the amendment's deletion of the word 'and' and insertion of the word 'or'. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be well aware, that significantly strengthens the original intent, which brings me back to my original point about the concern, which was proven in the submissions before the inquiry, of the greater transport sector as to whether or not this appropriate way forward. I would also draw your attention to the dissenting report of coalition members in that inquiry when they were considering this. The coalition members stated that they fully supported the need for a multifaceted approach to reducing accident rates in the transport industry, so they were fully supportive of trying to get the incident rates down. However, they said it should be noted that there was a gradual improvement in the accident and fatality rate in recent years, despite the increase in the national freight task. The rates of accidents are going down. This bill is about safety and the amendments, even though they are not predominantly about it, do talk about safety. We have the trajectory of fatality rates on a downward do it slope and, with the increase in government road infrastructure funding, we should see in future even more reductions in road fatalities. So that begs the question of why we need an additional layer of bureaucracy when all the industry is saying to the government is: 'Get your hand out of our pocket. If you are interested in increased freight rates, take some of the costs off us and allow us to get on and be profitable.'",75
70,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the 64 amendments to the bill and to reflect on the importance of road safety. Representing, as I do, an area that has a huge amount of truck traffic going through it on the Pacific Highway, I am very focused as a local member on this issue. Our entire community is focused on the importance of safety in the heavy vehicle industry. But the question before us today is: how effective are these 64 amendments going to be in actually producing improvements in safety outcomes on the ground? How effective are these amendments going to be in delivering fewer accidents, delivering safer roads and ensuring that freight is able to travel along is an our highways in safety? There is great concern in the community that I represent that heavy vehicle accidents are all too frequent. Being on the Pacific Highway, which is currently being duplicated, I can say that those areas that are not duplicated present the highest risk",76
71,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The honourable member will address the amendments.,76
72,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS,"I am coming to that, Deputy Speaker.",76
73,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable member will address the amendments before the chair, not have a general debate on transport issues.",76
74,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS,I am about to get onto,77
75,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will address the amendments in detail before the House.,77
76,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS," Deputy Speaker, I will. I will draw the attention of the House to proposed clause 33, road transport collective agreements. The question arises: how effective are these agreements going to be in actually delivering real improvements in safety outcomes. The provision says: (1) A road transport collective agreement is an agreement: (a) between: (i) contractor drivers (the participating drivers) with whom a hirer or potential hirer proposes to contract for the provision of specified road transport services (the applicable services); and (ii) the hirer or potential hirer of the drivers (the participating hirer); and (b) that specifies: (i) who the participating hirer is; and (ii) who the participating drivers are; and (iii) the basis on which the participating drivers became part of that group of drivers; and (c) that specifies remuneration or related conditions (or both) for participating drivers who provide applicable services to the participating hirer. Agreements such as this will ultimately result in a certain rate being struck. The question arises: if the rates that are a result of such agreements result in increased costs, is that going to provide for improved safety? That is what is not clear. There is no evidence that this provision, proposed clause 33, is in any material way going to contribute to improved safety on our roads-and that is what the people that I represent are most interested in. The question people are asking is: are the 64 amendments going to actually result in a real outcome for people who use the Pacific Highway, for instance, or our other major highways or is it merely pandering to an industrial agenda? Certainly proposed clause 33 on road transport collective agreements and the Thank you, relationship between the contract drivers and the hirers does not show the ways in which there is going to be an improved safety outcome. The people I represent who deal with heavy vehicles travelling through the main streets of their towns want to ensure that these vehicles travel safely and that the drivers are not overly fatigued. The issue is: will these amendments result in less fatigue for drivers and in safer driving practices? We have no evidence of this. On this side of the House we believe that amendments brought to this House should be evidence based and not industrially driven, as these amendments seem to be. There seems to be a lack of reference in these amendments to safety, yet the government maintains that that is what these amendments are all about.",77
77,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member is not addressing the detail of the amendments.,77
78,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS,I think that clause 33 here,77
79,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member is not addressing the amendments and I ask him to come back to the amendments.,77
80,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS,"I refer you again to clause 33 and the relationshipMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are now in consideration in detail. We have resolved to deal with it",77
81,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Does the honourable member have a point of order? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order is this: as we are in consideration in detail and have agreed to take the bill as a whole, the amendments expand the debate, not limit it. Members are perfectly entitled to debate every clause of the bill as well as the amendments. I would refer you to Practice and you will find it to be true.",77
82,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, honourable member will resume her seat. There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Hinkler.,78
83,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS," I too would like to deal with proposed clause 33(3), which states: The regulations may prescribe a code of conduct in relation to collective bargaining for road transport collective agreements. Under the road transport collective agreement, the tribunal must be satisfied that, under proposed paragraph 34(ca): the participating hirer and the participating drivers have conducted themselves in accordance with any code of conduct prescribed under subsection 33(3)which I just read. I find it highly unusual that the minister would be issuing guidelines to the tribunal that it had specifically set up to regulate the bargaining that goes on in the industry between the hirers and the drivers. The minister is now going to intervene and set up regulations-I suppose ministers can always do that-but then there is a code of conduct. Proposed clause 33(5) states: A code of conduct prescribed under subsection (3) must have as its object the facilitation of effective and efficient collective bargaining for road transport collective agreements. That is why the tribunal itself was set up. So what have we got? We have got the Fair Work organisation, then we have this new tribunal and then we have a minister intervening with regulations and, presumably, laying down a code of conduct. I ask the minister at the table: is that not the very criticism you levelled at Work Choices?",78
84,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order!,78
85,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"Well, it is a fair comparison, Mr Deputy Speaker.",78
86,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! That The is not what the amendments address. I ask the honourable member to come back to the amendments before us.,78
87,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am just saying what that sequence of amendments will lead to. I make the point that it is very interesting indeed that we have a Fair Work organisation that is supposed to be regulating payments, then a tribunal that will double guess them, then a set of regulations on top of that, presumably where the minister will regulate it further, and then within that again a code of conduct which will give the government overbearing control. I would say that it is very similar to Work Choices and leave it at that.",78
88,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS," I rise to make a further contribution in relation to the merits or otherwise of the 64 amendments that have been provided to the House at very short notice by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Again I want to come to the question of the merits of the provisions proposed to be added to the bill dealing with the authorisation of conduct which would otherwise be anticompetitive. I am referring to the provisions of proposed clause 37A. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would also like to take you to proposed clause 32A. You will notice that under clause 32A(2) the tribunal is to weigh up the benefit of the agreement against any 'detriment to the public constituted by any lessening of competition that would result, or be likely to result, if the Tribunal approved the agreement'. So we have the tribunal charged with the task of assessing the impact of a particular agreement on competition. As you will have noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker, the language in proposed clause 37A is quite specific. It says: (2) For the purposes of subsection 51(1) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, entry into an approval-pending road transport collective agreement … is specified in and specifically authorised by this Act. The point is that it refers specifically to an approval-pending road transport collective agreement. If you go back to proposed clause 32A, you will recognise immediately that what is referred to here is an agreement that is pending approval by the tribunal. If the tribunal approves the agreement it is automatically authorised by reason of the operation of proposed clause 37A. This raises a number of serious policy issues. One of them is this: what are the qualifications of members of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to deal with the issue of the impact of a collective agreement on competition? Clause 79 of the bill describes the composition of the tribunal. Clause 79(2) states: The Tribunal consists of: (a) the President; and (b) at least 2 and no more than 4 persons who are experienced in workplace relations matters; and (c) at least 2 and no more than 4 persons who have knowledge of, or experience in, one or more of the following fields … None of those fields is competition law. None of those fields is the impact of collective agreements on competition. If the House were to accept these amendments the 64 amendments moved by the minister at very short notice-and pass them into law a consequence would be that the tribunal would be put in the position of assessing the competition impacts of agreements in the road transport sector without having any expertise regarding such matters. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need hardly remind you that competition law is specialised. It raises many difficult issues. An entire agency of the Australian government, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, deals with these issues. But it seems that this government has not seen fit to make provision for persons with such expertise to sit on the tribunal, even though the powers of the tribunal have been expanded to weigh up the merits of an agreement against any detrimental consequences to competition that might follow. I might add that taking the overall policy scheme under which road transport collective agreements are specifically authorised outside the operation of the Competition and Consumer Act is very bad policy. It is the kind of policy that we have come to expect from a government that has no commitment to competition. It has white-anted it in telecommunications and it is white-anting it here. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (13:23): Road safety is a big issue in both the electorates for which I have been the member: Parkes and Calare. Dubbo, which is the centre of Parkes, is one of the big commercial centres for trucking in New South Wales. Orange, in Calare, is fast becoming that. I am talking about road safety, which is a very big issue, in relation to these amendments. The RTA in New South Wales has said that as many trucks, if not more, travel on the Newell Highway, between Parkes and Dubbo, as travel up the Pacific Highway. I am all for road safety and the coalition is all for road safety, particularly in relation to drivers. I can tell you that in my part of the world the trucking industry prides itself on doing everything it can on road safety. We have any number of owner-drivers in my part of the world. It seems to me that these amendments are very much aimed at groups of owner-drivers or at individual ownerdrivers. In Orange we also have some of the biggest privately owned trucking companies in regional New South Wales. There are also some in Dubbo, and the member for Parkes is quite able to speak himself. It is an area that I have great knowledge of. It seems to me that the Transport Workers Union is being very well represented by these amendments. It seems to me that the Transport Workers Union might almost have written some of them.",78
89,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member will address the amendments. Mr JOHN COBB: I am happy to do that, Deputy Speaker. Proposed clause 33(1) refers to groups of owner-drivers who make an agreement for the provision of specified road transport services. Are these not simply the dreaded AWAs, only sponsored by unions, sponsored by government and sponsored by those who will have the job of signing off on these things? The only difference is that the minister has to agree, as do the union, I assume, and the tribunal itself. Given that the people I am talking about, the owner-drivers and the large companies, the large privately owned companies in particular, already take every care that they can in relation to driver safety, road safety and the whole gambit of it, I wonder what these amendments are actually aimed at doing, apart from keeping the Transport Workers Union happy and, pretty much, proclaiming the things that it wants rather than those things that are dedicated to road safety.",80
90,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member will address the amendments before the chair. Mr JOHN COBB: I will go back to proposed clause 33, which, again, refers to groups of owner-drivers who make an agreement for the provision of specified road transport services. It seems that the amendment broadens the scope of the sorts of conditions and matters that a group of independent contractors can seek in an approved agreement. This goes way beyond anything in the original intent of the bill, which would then have to be approved before taking effect. Once again, are these not the dreaded AWAs only approved by the minister, who does seem to have an amazing ability to effect in detail the scope of what happens between drivers and owners, or owner-drivers if it comes to that, on the ground? I honestly do not believe that this matter is about road safety. I believe that this is an industrial relations measure and that it is to do with the TWU.",80
91,Mr MCCORMACK,PAIRS," There are several problems with these amendments, which are not evidence based but are industrially driven. For a start, proposed clause 33(6), agreements for drivers, would ensure that all current agreements, except those made between groups of owner-drivers and hirers under existing state regulatory regimes, would be out the window as they are not approved road transport collective agreements. The effect of this amendment is that any contract between a group of independent contractors-owner-drivers-and a hirer must be approved by the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Clause 33 of the original bill stated that the tribunal 'may grant' approval for road transport collective agreement where certain conditions are met. This is completely different to what is stated in the amendment, and demands further consideration and consultation with the heavy vehicle industry. These current agreements, now deemed null and void, would have to be immediately renegotiated. This would put hirers and owner-drivers who are parties to the agreements in a difficult and untenable situation. As well, this instantly undermines commercial contracts established between two companies involving contract drivers. For instance, how will it affect the commercial arrangements between a major car manufacturer and companies that transport their cars? Does it invalidate those particular arrangements? Does it make them now unenforceable? The bill devalues the concept of an independent contractor. This amendment takes this even further by limiting the ability of independent contractors to negotiate terms and conditions they consider appropriate. The bill will centralise contracts for groups of independent contractors and in doing so reduce their opportunity to bargain. It has all the hallmarks of being able to hinder competition and could well remove flexibility. In so doing, the bill could make hiring groups of owner-drivers far less attractive. Further, the tribunal will not be sufficiently equipped to deal with the possible volume of contracts it will be required to approve. The bill has been lauded as a road safety measure. We have been told that the tribunal it establishes will issue orders to make sure drivers have remuneration and related conditions to ensure they will drive safely. However, this amendment goes much further than that. It empowers the tribunal and gives it the responsibility to approve agreements between groups of owner-drivers and hirers. This underlines the fact that this is not about road safety. It is an industrial relations measure which is payback to the powerful Transport Workers Union. I am a road safety advocate, as I am sure everybody in this parliament is. It is an issue many people in the Riverina have raised with me time and again. There are far more pressing road safety problems for the heavy vehicle industry than so-called safe rates. Here is a remark from the Transport Workers Union National Secretary, Tony Sheldon himself: Under the carbon tax, drivers will be forced to do longer hours, sweat their trucks further, have less maintenance, and that means more deaths. These amendments are not about road safety. They are about empowering unions further, and we do not need that.",80
92,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS," I rise in my continuing opposition to the 64 amendments to the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 that are currently before the House. In my electorate I have a number of transport operators and a number of quarries. The predominant transport operations through the middle of my electorate are truck-and-dog operations that will be affected by these amendments. In addition, the majority of my electorate would be perceived as a rural precinct, taking small produce to markets, helping the families and the mums and dads of Australia to keep fresh fruit and veggies and on the table. Every centimetre of the travel involved in getting that produce to market will be affected by these amendments and the legislation currently before the House. The argument put up by the government with reference to this bill is that of road safety. However, none of the 64 amendments we are currently debating speak to or provide any evidence of a causal link between rates of pay and deaths on the road. In fact, an inquiry recently found that there was a decline-and members of the government have made this point in their presentationsin rates of death on the road; they are downward spiralling. In addition, with the magnificent work done by the government to increase road infrastructure, we should see further reductions in road deaths. The committee also received evidence that supported an increased focus on road improvements, infrastructure enforcement of existing laws and regulations to achieve safety improvements. It was repeatedly put to the committee that other measures would be more valuable in terms of reducing accident rates. The coalition members supported that approach. So it is drawing a long bow to come in and say that it is 'no, no, no, no' from the coalition. We do support measures that will reduce deaths on the roads, but we sincerely suggest that these amendments before us are not conducive to reaching those outcomes. One of the amendments, amendment (26), includes: (ca) the participating hirer and the participating drivers have conducted themselves in accordance with any code of conduct prescribed under subsection 33(3); So an unintended consequence of the amendments before the House is that if someone were to change their code of conduct that would be superfluous. It would be surplus to the codes of conduct already put in place by the peak bodies and industry groups. One of those is the National Road Freighters Association-which, by pure chance, is opposed to this measure. The association has put its concerns in writing in its submissions to the committee. The Australian Logistics Council, an enormous voice for the transport sector, is also opposed to it. They have their own codes of conduct. The Post Office Agents Association also saw no merit in the bill. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also has a code of conduct, which will be sought to be amended according to subsection 33(3) as a result of the aforementioned amendment. The Australian Trucking Association and the Australian Industry Group also have their own codes of conduct. And the National Road Transport Operators Association and Independent Contractors of Australia are opposed to it. All these people are opposed and to it. The list just goes on; it is overwhelming. If this government is fair dinkum about trying to save lives out on the highways of Australia it should show some evidence of a causal link between pay rates and deaths. If you are serious that that is a cause, do your part as a government by getting your hand out of the pockets of the transport industrystop increasing their operating costs-and let them get on and make a living.",81
93,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (13:36): I rise to support the amendments currently before the House. This legislation is vital for road safety. It is vital for those truck drivers who carry our freight between cities and within cities. It is also vital for other road users. I find it extraordinary, frankly, that the previous speaker said that he could not see a causal link between wage rates and conditions and safety on the road. I ask him to read National road safety-eyes on the road ahead: inquiry into national road safety-a June 2004 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, then chaired by the member for Hinkler. This was a bipartisan issue and that committee treated it as such when the Howard government established that inquiry. I was a member of that committee in my first term of parliament. This is an issue which has the support of not just the Transport Workers Union but significant players in the industry, including, dare I say it, the most significant trucker in this country, Lindsay Fox. This has the support of those businesses which operate in accordance with law and which operate in the interests of their workforce as well as other road users. This has the support of other road users and motoring organisations. This has the support of all those who have been impacted by road deaths involving heavy vehicles. In 2010, fatalities and injuries cost the community $2.7 billion. Yet what we see before this parliament today is not just opposition from the 'noalition', but filibustering of the debate and abuse of the processes of this parliament. Opposition members have got up and just tried to take up the time of this parliament.",82
94,Mr Buchholz,PAIRS,We only got the amendments this morning.,83
95,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Even the shadow minister did not say that, mate. You were not even here to listen to the shadow minister when he outlined the no-alition's position on it. You were not even here. But the opposition bring people in, one after the other-the member for Bradfield is a serial offender on these issues-to waste time. You can waste time, but it will not change the outcome. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott: prior to the Leader of House coming into the chamber, when a previous person was in the chair, again and again people were asked to return to debate the specific terms of the amendments. The Leader of the House is not doing that.",83
96,Mr Shorten,PAIRS,"You argued against that. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: And I was ruled against, so you will be also.",83
97,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," I will decide, Member for Mackellar. The Leader of the House is aware of the standing orders and I understand that he is speaking to the amendments as well as closing the debate.",83
98,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"No, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to be here later today, after five o'clock",83
99,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The minister does not have the call. The minister is aware of the amendments before the chamber. The Leader of the House will address his comments to the amendments we are currently debating.,83
100,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"I am certainly doing that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am also referring to the debate, including the comments of the previous speaker, who spoke about the process with respect to the amendments and the process which is occurring here. This process is an abuse of the parliament. The coalition is not attempting to debate the substance of the issues; it is attempting to delay a vote. Truck drivers have waited a long time for justice on this issue. When I spoke to Alan Jones this morning-another big supporter of this reform-he was certainly conscious of that fact. So are many other people who are in touch with truck drivers-Ray Hadley and other advocates in the media who know what the impact of these issues has been. That is why the amendments should be supported and why the legislation should be supported. (Extension of time granted) I am pleased to see that those opposite have run out of steam on these issues. These amendments clarify the legislation before the House, legislation which addresses an issue which has been debated since I arrived in this chamber in 1996. Sixteen years has been a long time to wait for this legislation and for these amendments. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I refer you to page 366 of House of Representatives Practice where it says, about consideration in detail: When a bill is considered, by leave, as a whole, the debate is widened to include any part of the bill. However, discussion must relate to the clauses of the bill, and it is not in order to make a general second reading speech. It also says in Practice that the rules of debate with regard to debating amendments and the bill as a whole are the same. Therefore I ask you to ask the Leader of the House to return to the subject of the amendments.",83
101,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Mackellar has made her point of order and has pointed out the relevant standing orders.,84
102,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"We see again why the member for Mackellar, with her lack of knowledge of the standing orders and the way they operate in practice, never got the Speaker. The fact is",84
103,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Leader of the House will not reflect on a member of this chamber. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I would ask him to withdraw.,84
104,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The minister will not reflect on another member and will withdraw that reference to the member for Mackellar.,84
105,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Which reference, Mr Deputy Speaker? I said she never got to be the Speaker. That is a fact.",84
106,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,You will withdraw.,84
107,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"I withdraw if she is that sensitive, Mr Deputy Speaker.",84
108,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"No, just withdraw unreservedly.",84
109,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"I withdraw. I understand the embarrassment there, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is important legislation and these are important amendments. They should be supported by the House.",84
110,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the debate is interrupted. The debate may be resumed at a later hour this day. NA International Purple Day",84
111,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 26 March it is International Purple Day, celebrating and supporting epilepsy awareness across the world. There are more people living with epilepsy than with muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease combined. Close to half a million Australians will be affected by epilepsy at some point in their life. Yet, due to misconceptions and social stigma, many to be people do not disclose their condition, leading to a low level of community awareness. In 2008, a nine-year-old who was suffering from epilepsy, Cassidy Megan, founded International Purple Day in a grassroots effort to increase epilepsy awareness worldwide, to encourage people to talk about their epilepsy and to inform those who live with seizures that they are not alone. Epilepsy Action Australia is Australia's national provider of education and support services for people with epilepsy, their families and the community. I am proud that their head office is located in Bennelong, directly behind my electorate office, and I strongly support their great work for epilepsy sufferers around Australia. On 26 March, I will be joining Epilepsy Action Australia to launch a series of activities for International Purple Day. I encourage all MPs to host a fundraising event to promote plain-clothes day activities in local schools and businesses on 26 March to build awareness of one of the world's most common serious brain conditions. Apple and Pear Industry",84
112,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I was very pleased on Tuesday evening this week to attend an event in Parliament House hosted by Apple and Pear Australia, where I met a number of fruit growers and industry representatives and had the opportunity to taste some delicious Australian apple and pear ciders. As the daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of fruit growers in Donnybrook in the south-west of Western Australia, the sustainability of the Australian apple and pear industry is an issue close to my heart, and I know it is one that concerns many Australians who want to be sure that the fruit they buy is locally produced and fresh, particularly since we as a nation consume 264,000 tonnes, or 12 kilograms per person, of apples per annum. I support the proposal known as the Aussie Apple Accord to promote innovation, productivity and sustainability in an industry that must now adapt to new rules allowing apple imports. There are some 950 businesses involved in the growing of apples and pears in all states of Australia, and state with some personal knowledge that most fruit growers are not wealthy farmers. They battle day to day to make a living and to support rural communities which, frankly, would struggle to exist without them. I certainly cannot imagine the town of Donnybrook without apples. This Easter, I will be attending the biannual Donnybrook Apple Festival and announcing this year's Apple Ambassador, a young person who will represent the apple and pear industry for the next two years, a role that I was proud to carry out myself some 27 years ago. I commend the Australian apple and pear industry's efforts to bring fresh quality produce to the Australian community and to help Australia's farmers become the world's best. Queensland State Election",84
113,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is alleged that sitting state Labor member for the electorate of Mount Coot-Tha, Mr Andrew Fraser, has been making sexist, distasteful and cruel comments about his opponent. This is from the Queensland current state Treasurer and deputy premier. These alleged comments have been made by Mr Fraser and are criticism of the inability of the LNP candidate for Mount Coot-Tha, Mrs Saxon Rice, to understand financial pressures on families because she does not have children. The Labor government claims to champion gender equality and support women's participation in government via their quota system, but these reported comments by Mr Fraser show just how hypocritical Labor really is. This matter highlights that inequalities and negative perceptions of women continue to prevail in this country. Of note is that Australia ranks 23rd in the world gender gap report of 134 countries, listed three places down since the I can last report and six places down from the 2007 ranking. For the record, Mrs Rice has eight nieces and nephews and a wonderful family. Irrespective of her gender, Saxon Rice deserves a place in parliament. Gas Energy Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (13:49): I want to bring to the attention of the parliament reports that the chemical manufacturer Dow Chemical has urged both federal and state governments to use some of Australia's massive gas resources to provide cheap energy for Australian manufacturers. Dow Chemical is a significant employer in Victoria, where its Altona processing centre employs several hundred workers. There are of course precedents for reserving local energy needs. The state of Western Australia has for years required gas exporters to set aside 15 per cent of their production for the state's domestic use. In the United States, oil drilled in the Gulf of Mexico cannot be exported and must be kept for use in the United States. Dow Chemical's vice-president, George Blitz, is reported by the Australian as saying that Australia's gas reserves should be used not only to generate export income but also to help build domestic industry. Mr Blitz was also reported by David Crowe as saying that new rules to reserve gas production within Australia could speed up the construction of gas fired power stations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with coal fired electricity. This is a serious contribution to the debate by Dow Chemical, and I hope that governments at all levels take it seriously. Manufacturing in Victoria is doing it tough as a consequence of the high dollar caused by the mining boom, and securing access to some of Australia's energy resources in this way would help retain and create jobs in Victoria. Breast Implants Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (13:50): Over the weekend, the TGA announced Medicare rebates for scans to check whether French PIP breast implants are faulty following pressure to support patients who have received this inferior product. Coincidently, the Channel 9 60 Minutes program ran a story on Sunday night which featured a number of women who had concerns about their PIP breast implants. One of the biggest concerns for these women is finding out what is actually inside their bodies, and another concern is how they are going to be able to afford to have the implants removed. According to the TGA, up until 9 March this year, they had received some 29 unconfirmed reports and another 171 confirmed reports of rupture of PIP breast implants from surgeons and patients throughout Australia. Unfortunately, I have recently received advice from a constituent that her daughter currently suffering from a ruptured PIP breast implant. She advised me that it was a friend of her daughter who alerted her to this fact, not the surgeon involved. The surgeon has since advised that the removal of the existing implants and insertion of new implants will cost approximately $7½ thousand. This is a cost she simply cannot afford. The daughter is only 21-years-old and is already significantly concerned about the situation she is in. I have written to the TGA and to the Minister for Health asking what steps are being taken, and I ask both the minister and the TGA to- (Time expired) Fowler Electorate: Miller Health and Family Fun Day",85
114,Mr HAYES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Saturday I attended the Miller health and family fun day, conducted by the Liverpool PCYC. A number of local not-for-profit organisations, including the Red Cross, Mission Australia and Men's Shed, as well as the Green Valley Police Station, had information stalls at this free community event. The event was organised to bring families together to be informed about the support and services available and to enjoy a fun-filled afternoon together. There was face painting, an animal farm, a police mascot and children's crafts activities as well as live music and a free sausage sizzle for the whole family to enjoy. Over 600 people attended, clearly demonstrating a desire to develop and continue the community spirit in that area. Parents want their children to meet and play in a neighbourly environment. These are the values that we grew up with, Mr Deputy Speaker, but with the pace of modern life they are sometimes overlooked. On behalf of a very grateful community, I would like to thank Sharyn Henry, the secretary of the 2168 Resident Action Group, is and the members of the organising committee for this wonderful event. The event was an initiative of the 2168 Resident Action Group, proudly supported by the Liverpool City Council, the Miller Hub and Green Valley Police and funded by the Liverpool Catholic Club. The 2168 Resident Action Group is thoroughly committed to supporting the people in the community of Miller. Macarthur Electorate: Camden Show",86
115,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Next Friday and Saturday, the Macarthur community will come together for the 2012 Camden Show. The annual show is one of largest community events in the Macarthur region, with around 38,000 visitors expected over the two days. I am a patron of the Camden Show and am proud to say that the local show society is run almost entirely volunteers, who work very hard to ensure show maintains its country feel. For more than 125 years, the Camden Show has supported local agriculture, farmers, education and business in farming. The show is a fantastic community event which showcases Macarthur's agricultural, horticultural, commercial and industrial resources through competitions, exhibitions and entertainment. It also promotes excellence in agriculture, with livestock competitions and exhibitions for horses, cattle, poultry, goats, alpacas, sheep, and cats. This year the show will celebrate the Australian Year of the Farmer, with the first Camden Show Farmer of the Year competition. This is a great opportunity my community to recognise the hard work put in by our local farmers and their contribution to the industry and our economy. Local schools in my electorate will also get involved this year by taking part in the Battle of the Schools Talent Quest and a scarecrow competition. The show will also feature animal wranglers, a duck muster, jousting on quad bikes, giant pumpkin growing, a street parade, lawnmower racing, a tent-pegging competition, wheelie bin racing, the young farmers challenge, an iron man competition, a fireworks spectacular and much, much more. I encourage everyone in my electorate to come along to this fantastic event and show their support for Macarthur's farming and agricultural industries. I also invite anybody else in New South Wales to attend. We will welcome them to our region and to this great show. Geale, Mr Daniel",87
116,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate a tremendous athlete from the electorate of Bass, the world champion Mr Daniel Geale. Last week, Daniel retained his by prestigious IBF world middleweight boxing the championship, with a victory over Osumanu Adama. Geale, originally from Rocherlea in my electorate, is always a crowd pleaser when he fights in Tasmania. One crowd member watching the fight last week was Ricky Ponting, another world-class Tasmanian athlete and former Brooks High School student. Brooks High now counts Geale, Ponting and the F1 in Schools team as former students who have made world champion status in their chosen field. Many of Tasmania's leading businesspeople are dogs also former Brooks High students. Geale received a unanimous points verdict from the judges to retain the title of IBF middleweight world boxing champion. This for was a tremendous effort. The first two defences of his title have both been held in Tasmania, showing Geale's commitment to his home state of Tasmania. This is a reflection of his humble and modest character. I am certain that when Daniel next defends his world title, on the world stage overseas, he will display those wonderful personal attributes and traits, along with his dedication, hard work and courage, as an ambassador not only for Tasmania but for all Australians. Daniel is yet another example of the wonderful athletes that the great electorate of Bass can call theirs. Food Production",87
117,Mr MCCORMACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Australia's farm and fish food production is worth $37 billion a year. Annually, $24 billion is made through exports, particularly of grain and meat to Asia. We are the No. 2 exporter of meat to the world market. Australian farmers feed 60 million people a day. This morning, at the CSIRO's first Science for Breakfast of the year, the focus was on food security. CSIRO Sustainable Agriculture Flagship Director Dr Brian Keating reiterated the old phrase that humankind is only three meals away from chaos. He is right, of course. Australia has a significant role to play in the global food task. This job is going to get bigger in the years ahead as the world's population increases from seven billion to nine billion by 2050. That is a lot more hungry mouths. At the breakfast, the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans, said there was 'a growing understanding within the parliament about these issues'. I would argue that there should be, rather than a growing understanding, a thorough knowledge already of food security matters, because food production and safeguarding Australian farmers in issues of biosecurity, cheap imports, foreign takeovers of farmland and agribusiness and water availability ought to be paramount. Sadly, farmers are underrated and undervalued by this government. We saw that yesterday with the end of a 150-year alpine cattle-grazing tradition. We saw it with the live cattle export fiasco last year, Labor's cave-in on New Zealand apple imports, the Asian bee incursion and the absolute farce that is the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This is sadder still given that 2012 is the Australian Year of the Farmer. (Time expired) Quota International, Canberra",88
118,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is a great pleasure to be able to speak today about the wonderful work of Canberra's Quota club. Quota International of Canberra is part of an international network that originated more than 90 years ago. Quota was set up to allow women, particularly businesswomen, to serve their community. Quota Canberra is one of 78 Quota clubs in Australia today, and just last year celebrated its 50th anniversary. The club works hard to service and assist disadvantaged women, children and the hearing impaired in the Canberra community. In 2011 the club made a huge difference to our local community by making comfort packs for women in refuges; playing bingo and providing supper for senior citizens; donating funds and conducting working bees at the Shepherd Centre for hearing impaired children, which is in my electorate; donating to CyclopsACT to support young carers; providing funding to a Queanbeyan refuge; and donating baby furniture and supplies for Karinya House. It also donated $1,100 to the Queensland flood appeal and worked tirelessly to raise funds for a range of charities and causes around the country. I urge you all to find out more about your local Quota club, as I have about Quota International of Canberra. It is a wonderful organisation and a great way for women, and men, to get involved in supporting their local community.",88
119,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Scott, Hon Douglas Barr",89
120,Ms GILLARD,CONDOLENCES," I move: That the House records its deep regret at death on 12 March 2012, of the Honourable Douglas Barr Scott, former Senator for New South Wales in 1970 and from 1974 to 1985, former Deputy President of the Senate from 1978 to 1979 and former Federal Minister for Special Trade Representations from 1979 to 1980, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Douglas was born on 12 May 1920 in Adelaide, educated at Scotch College in Adelaide and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney. Before entering politics Douglas was a farmer and a grazier. During World War II he served as a member of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1945, being discharged at the rank of lieutenant. Douglas was initially elected to the Senate for a very brief period of 3½ months in 1970 and reentered the Senate in 1974, where he served until 1985. He held the positions of Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman of Committees from 1978 to 1979, Minister for Special Trade Representations from 1979 to 1980 and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Resources from 1979 to 1980 in the Fraser government. During his time in the Senate he served on numerous committees. These included the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare and the Senate Standing Committee on Publications, to name just a few. Douglas led parliamentary delegations to South-East Asia, a resources mission to the European Economic Community countries and he attended Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences in Mauritius and Nairobi. He also held parliamentary positions in the Senate of Leader and Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, formerly the National Country Party. Douglas Barr Scott was a person held in the affection and with respect on both sides of the chamber in which he served. In his valedictory from the Senate he recalled that Labor senators Don Grimes and John Button wrote to him after a week or so when he had acted as president saying that they had determined to support him because they liked the way he read the prayers. To have John Button gently tease you was one of the highest honours my party could bestow in those days, so we can take that as a mark of respect and bipartisan support. On behalf of the government I offer condolences to his wife, Pamela, to his children, Diana and Andrew, and to their extended family and friends.",89
121,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES," I rise briefly to support the Prime Minister's words. Senator Doug Scott was responsible for one of the immortal career summations when he said, 'I've done some good things in my life but none of them for very long.' Perhaps I should take that to heart and now defer to my friend and colleague the Leader of the National Party. On behalf of the Liberal Party, I offer condolences to his family and to his friends.",89
122,Mr TRUSS,CONDOLENCES," I thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me this opportunity to pay tribute to one of the leaders of The Nationals in a bygone era. The former Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Doug Anthony yesterday described Doug Scott as a 'thorough gentleman who was always dependable and reliable.' That sums up Doug Scott very well-solid, fair minded and decent. Indeed, Doug Anthony's comments coincide succinctly with those made on Doug Scott's retirement from the Senate almost 27 years ago, on 31 May 1985, when the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time, Senator John Button, said: … Senator Scott has always been, if I might an old-fashioned word, a gentleman in dealing with everybody in the Senate, including us, that has been a very nice quality about his presence here. Those words also coincide with the words of the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Fred Chaney, who, in the same debate described Doug Scott as 'one of the great constants' in the Senate and a man whom he had always found utterly reliable. The Nationals historian Paul Davey said, 'Doug Scott was dedicated to his party, to the processes of the parliament and to his responsibilities, particularly as a senator representing predominantly regional New South Wales.' Even though, as the Prime Minister mentioned, he was born in Adelaide, educated at Scotch College and then received a degree in Sydney, he was a successful farmer and grazier from the Grenfell district and he was be respected throughout the state rural industries and communities; he understood the bush. During World War II he served in the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve, as we have already heard. In 1948 he married Pamela MCLean, and the couple have a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Diana. As his grazing interests grew so did his interest in rural politics and hence in the New South Wales Country Party, which he joined in June 1948. He served on the state executive from 1968 to 1974. He won the party's preselection to fill a casual vacancy caused by the death of Senator Colin MCKellar in April 1970 and he took up that seat in August 1970. He failed to win re-election in the half-Senate election in November that year, but he was not deterred. In fact in the double dissolution election of May 1974 he stood again and remained a senator until June 1985, his retirement. As we have already heard, he was Deputy use President and Chairman of Committees in the Senate and also served as Acting and President in the Senate on a number of occasions. He had a particular interest in the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He was a member for eight years in total, including four as its chairman. He was Deputy Leader of the then National Country Party in the Senate from February 1976 to February 1980, when he was elected the party's Senate leader, a position he held until his retirement. As you heard also, he served in the Fraser-Anthony ministry for just a brief period. His comment that the Leader of the Opposition referred to about having done a lot in life but none of it for very long is something of a reflection also of his parliamentary career. Doug Scott was a keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed cricket, golf and squash. Fred Chaney remembered encountering his prowess on the squash court when he was, to use his words, 'absolutely whipped' by a man 20 years his senior who at the time was suffering from a very bad hip. Doug Scott's life came to an end at the Jemalong Residential Village at Forbes after almost 92 years. Douglas Scott should be remembered as a true gentleman of this parliament. While it was a different era, he was certainly a fine example to us all. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.",89
123,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA Carbon Pricing,90
124,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that 11,900 shops in Westfield centres around Australia are now subject to a carbon or greenhouse gas emissions charge embedded in their leases. How can the Prime Minister continue to assert that only 500 businesses will pay her carbon tax when that is now so obviously and patently untrue?",91
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Leader of the Opposition is referring to a press report this morning that raised this issue. I would like to refer the Leader of the Opposition to the newsletter of the Shopping Centre Council of Australia, Shop Talk, which has gone out today and which says the following: Some newspapers are today carrying an exclusive report quoting a retailer claiming that some shopping centre landlords are including a new lease provision passing on the effects of the new carbon tax to retailers. The newsletter of the Shopping Centre Council of Australia goes on to say that the fact that this clause is actually several years old is clearly not referred to in that article. It goes on to explain that the fact that it is several years old is why it does not directly refer to a carbon tax. It then goes on to say that it was included in leases once debate began about the need for legislative action to combat greenhouse gas emissions.",91
126,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting Mr Crean interjecting,91
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister for regional Australia will remain silent for the balance of this answer.,91
128,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The truth of this matter is that this clause has been in leases for several years. Obviously in the public policy debate there has been over many years a reference to dealing with greenhouse gases, none clearer or stronger than when the Howard government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member, went to the 2007 election on a platform of an emissions trading scheme and putting a price on carbon. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, if he genuinely has some concern about people who lease shops in shopping centres and run small businesses, maybe he would like to support a tax cut for them. We do and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Maybe he would like to support an instant asset write-off for them. We do and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Maybe he would like to support a $5,000 benefit if they choose to purchase a motor vehicle. No, he is too busy doing what Clive Palmer tells him to do instead.",91
129,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Does the Prime Minister regret misleading the Australian people when she said that only 500 businesses would pay her carbon tax? And will she now apologise for saying before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'?",91
130,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," As the Leader of the Opposition is well aware-and no amount of shouting in question time is going to change this truththe carbon pricing legislation which went through the parliament has a direct carbon price paid by around 500 of the businesses that generate the most carbon pollution. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. What he also knows is that the scheme he peddles like snake oil to anyone who will listen has an effective carbon price of $62 a tonne. He might like to contemplate how those small businesses who are leaseholders in shopping centres would go by the time he had ripped off the tax cuts, family payments and pension increases, imposed on them a bill of $1,300 a year and made sure that those small businesses paid more tax.",91
131,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the lease carbon or greenhouse gas emission charges to which 11,900 businesses are now subject. Leave not granted.",92
132,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,92
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask myself who is going to be first today. It will not be the honourable member for Page, who has the call. Mining",92
134,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am pleased about that, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how is cutting company tax and spreading the benefits of the mining boom essential for building the future Australian economy?",92
135,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Page for her question, and I am glad she has received from the Speaker the reassurance that she has. That is very good news. As a Labor government we are focused on running the economy in the interests of working people and making sure we build the economy this nation will need in the future so that working people can have prosperity, that they can have jobs and that, if as they choose their highest aspiration is to open a small business, they can do that too. In pursuit of that objective, at this time in our nation's history, when we are seeing the mineral wealth in our ground sold at very high prices, when we are seeing a resources boom with hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the pipeline, it is the right time to take a share of that resources boom and ensure that businesses around the nation benefit-large and small. This cut in company tax is not only good news for businesses but it is good news for the Australian economy. As OECD research shows, company tax has the biggest adverse effect on economic growth. It follows that if you cut company tax you are helping economic growth. If you are helping economic growth you are then helping the wages of working people. Modelling done at the time of the Henry tax review showed that a one per cent cut in company tax means around $330 a year extra for a worker on an average income. Good for businesses, good for growth, good for jobs and good for wages: that is what a cut in company tax is. The nation faces a very stark choice on policies on company tax in this parliament. We on this side of the parliament stand for a rate of 29 cents and for delivering the benefit of that cut rate to small businesses first. The opposition stands for a rate of 31½ cents, as a result of their paid parental leave levy. That is a difference of 2½ cents. That matters in the international comparison. Under Labor we will move up two spots in the OECD ranking on company tax-a lower rate than the US, Japan, France, Belgium, Mexico and Spain. Under the opposition we would have the fifth-highest rate in the OECD. We cannot afford to hold Australia back. We cannot afford to have Australia stand still. We need to build the economy of the future. We owe that to working families, who are seeking to make a living and make their way. We owe that to people in business, who are creating the jobs for their fellow Australians. As a government we are determined to deliver it. Carbon Pricing Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (14:17): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that the bus industry will face a $50 million hit each year because of her carbon tax. Why should children who catch the school bus have to pay your carbon tax while those who are dropped off in cars will not, or at least not yet?",92
136,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The fear campaign continues and as part of that campaign we get the recycling of the same old questions. To the member who asked the question I say this: how will the families and children she is worried about react to the Leader of the Opposition's Coles and Woolies tax? How will they feel about that when prices are up in the shops as a result of the Leader of the Opposition increasing company tax to 31½ cents? On the matter of carbon pricing and public transport concerning relevance. The Prime Minister is already off the subject of the question. She was simply asked why children who catch a bus have to pay her carbon tax and children who take cars to school do not. That is the question the Prime Minister has to answer.,93
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister was diverting. I am sure she is anxious to get back to the substance of the question.,93
138,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very anxious to get back to the question. On the carbon pricing regime, bus prices and children catching buses, all of this has of course been factored into the compensation that families will receive. The member who asked the question should recognise that under the government's plans the mums and dads of the children catching public transport are very likely to have got a tax cut. The mums and dads are very likely to have seen an increase in their family payments. The grandparents of those children will have seen a pension increase. Mrs Gash interjecting",93
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Gilmore.,93
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan they would have had all of that money taken out of their hands, and then a bill for $1,300 on top. That is what would have happened. And if the children's mums and dads operate a small business they will be paying more tax as well. When it comes to running the economy in the interests of working families, children catching buses and children going to quality schools, schools that have not had to face cutbacks, the member had better endorse the policies and plans of this side, because the policies and plans of the Leader of the Opposition are a disgrace for those working families, because they are all about placating billionaires. Mining",93
141,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Why is it important to have widespread support for policies that spread the benefits of the mining boom to all corners of the economy?,93
142,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Blair for his very important question. Tonight in the Senate there will be a very important debate that goes to the very core of maximising prosperity in Australia and spreading the benefits of the mining boom to every corner of our country. Through this debate in the Senate we will see who is prepared to stand up and fight for a boost to superannuation savings for 8.4 million working Australians. We will see who is prepared to stand up and fight for small businesses-2.7 million small businesses that will benefit from the $6,500 instant asset write-off. We will see who is prepared to stand up and support vital investment, particularly in our mining regions and particularly in infrastructure. We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to ensure that all Australians benefit from the resources boom. We are determined to ensure that the opportunities from that boom are spread right around our country. We believe that the benefits should not go to a fortunate few. We believe that the benefits should those who are in the fast lane of our economy. We do need to spread the benefits around the economy. We on this side of the House understand that there is a patchwork economy and not everybody is in the fast lane of the mining boom. That is why cuts to business taxation are so important. They will drive investment, they will make business more competitive and they will support jobs. We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to maximise employment in this country, to support jobs in this country, which is why we acted so decisively at the height of the global financial crisis. We also understand that there are sectors of the economy impacted by the higher dollar, impacted by the cautious consumer. Mr Ewen Jones interjecting",93
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Herbert will remain silent for the rest of question time.,94
144,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is why we believe in providing tax cuts to many companies that need those tax cuts to be more competitive in this environment. Unlike those opposite, we will not stick our head in the sand and we will not leave those people behind. That is why we are so determined to put through these cuts to taxation. But we know what those opposite will do. Those opposite will kneel at the feet of vested interest like Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. That is exactly what they will do.",94
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will return to the substance of the question.,94
146,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They will write an 11-figure cheque to the likes of Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart.,94
147,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will resume his seat. The call is withdrawn from not just go to the Treasurer.,94
148,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My supplementary question is to the Treasurer. He talked about the benefits that will flow from tax cuts arising out of the minerals resource rent tax. Could he provide more details on what small business and working people in communities like Blair can expect from these tax cuts?,94
149,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," There will be many benefits: 10,700 small businesses in the electorate of Blair will benefit from these initiatives. There will be a boost to the superannuation accounts of 43,000 workers in the electorate of Blair. Of course, there will be investment in critical economic infrastructure: $54 million for the Blacksoil interchange will go to the Blair electorate, a critical part of the economic infrastructure. The member for Blair understands, and everybody on this side of the House understands, how important it is that we do get a fair return for our mineral resources, which can only be mined once and which are owned by all of the Australian people. We will use the revenue from the MRRT when it passes the Senate to put in place these vital reforms for all Australians. Unlike those opposite, we believe the benefits should flow to the whole of the country not just to a select few. Mining Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (14:24): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that Garden City Plastics, Australia's premier manufacturer of plastic pots, just like this pot here, which employs 300 people will pay at least an additional $120,000 every year on their electricity bill because of her carbon tax. Will the Prime Minister guarantee to those 300 workers in my electorate of Casey that not one of them will lose their job because of her toxic carbon tax?",94
150,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting Ms Roxon interjecting,95
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Attorney-General will be extremely cautious. Before I call the Prime Minister, I remind the honourable member for Casey that props are undesirable.",95
152,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," If the member for Casey is concerned about the jobs of these workers within his electorate, and I accept that he is, why does he want to deny that business a tax cut? A tax cut would do that business a lot of good. Why is he going to vote against that business getting a tax cut? Why is he going to make sure that business pays more tax? Mr Tony Smith interjecting",95
153,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Casey will remain silent.,95
154,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is what the member for Casey stands for in this parliament-that business that employs 300 workers paying more tax. That is what he stands for. Mr Tony Smith interjecting,95
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Casey will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). I asked the member for Casey to remain silent. He did not. He will leave. The member for Casey then left the chamber.,95
156,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of carbon pricing, of course what the member for Casey has not spoken about and would not speak about is the support for jobs. What he has not spoken about is the support for families. What he has not spoken about are the tax cuts involved. What he has not spoken about is the money going into the hands of pensioners, people who live in his electorate and people who might well go and shop at the business that he has referred to in this parliament. At base, there is no getting away from the fact that as we end this parliamentary week on all of these questions about businesses and business prosperity, on all of these questions about jobs, there is a very simple choice in this parliament: under Labor those businesses will pay less company tax; under the Liberals they will pay more. Western Australia: General Practice",95
157,Mr CROOK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health. I refer to the 97 GP vacancies currently in regional Western Australia-rising from 62 vacancies in August last year. Further, I refer to the fact that 83 of these current vacancies are classified as being in the area of high need. What is the government doing to address the dire GP shortage in regional Western Australia?",95
158,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. We have had some very productive discussions about workforce issues in not just his electorate but the whole of the state of Western Australia. I know that he is concerned beyond the boundaries of his electorate and for Western Australia more broadly. The government are putting a great deal of effort into both attracting and retaining a regional workforce in not just Western Australia but other parts of the country. It is difficult. We have had shortages for many years because the previous government, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, capped the number of GPs that were trained and that led to shortages right around Australia. Of course, it takes a while to train a GP in Australia. We have substantially increased GP training places and we have substantially increased investment in post-medical school places to train GPs, but those students take a while to come through the system. We will see improvements as those Australian GPs come through the system. Meanwhile, we continue to work constructively with overseas trained doctors to fill areas of workforce shortage. It is worth putting on the record that some $895 million will be invested into rural health workforce education and training programs over the period of the last budget, with $34.1 million for nursing and allied health rural locum schemes, which will provide 3,000 nurse locum placements and 400 allied health locum placements in rural areas over four years to support rural nurses and allied health workers; There will be $6½ million to provide 400 more clinical placement scholarships over four years for allied health students; $43 million for expanded medical specialist outreach assistance programs; $386.8 million for the Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training Program, which includes the Rural Clinical Training and Support program, Dental Training Expanding Placements Program, University Departments of Rural Health program, and the John Flynn Placement Program; and capital funding to support that through the Rural Education Infrastructure Development Pool. In March 2010 $345 million was set aside for general practice training. I know that the member for O'Connor knows that 50 per cent of that is undertaken in rural areas. That investment will deliver an additional 5,500 GPs by 2020. But I go back to the point that I made earlier: it does take a while for these new students, after years of constriction, to make their way through the system. I know that the member for O'Connor is very dedicated to his constituents and I look forward to working constructively with him on these issues of workforce shortage. (Time expired)",95
159,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This side has a question.,96
160,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will decide who gets the next question, Leader of the House. I do notice that the honourable member for Casey, who is sadly no longer among us, has left his prop. The member for Longman has moved into the seat of the member for Casey. He will remove the prop from the desk. Workplace Safety",96
161,Mr MITCHELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister update the House on Australia's workplace safety record? What is the government doing to improve this record and what obstacles has it faced?,96
162,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:32): I would like to thank the member for MCEwen for his Rural question. He knows 55½ thousand of his electors will get an increase in superannuation courtesy of this government. I am asked about workplace safety. It is an important issue. We have just released a report which shows in the most recent data available that in 2009-10 216 Australians went to work and did not come home that night. It also reveals that the cost of workplace injury is something like $60 billion. That does not even begin to measure the human cost. It also reports to us that there are certain industries in which there is a higher fatality rate than others. One of them, of course, is agriculture. Over 310 people died on Australia's farms in the years 2009-10. Of course the farm is the family home but it is also a workplace. Construction is another very dangerous industry, with 281 deaths over the seven years up to 2009. If you look at the numbers between 2004 and 2010 in transport, 567 people have died in the transport industry on Australia's roads and Australia's rail lines. The vast bulk of fatalities in the transport industry are related chamber to heavy vehicle truck incidents. This is a tragedy. It has been recently reported that 246,000 work hard in our trucking industry, yet there are 25 deaths per 100,000. That is 10 times the casualty rate of Australian industry as a whole. Last year, 250 people died in relation to heavy vehicle and truck incidents at a cost of $2.7 billion. In fact, 1,000 people, member for Tangney, if you care, were seriously injured. That is why the government is moving on with Safe Rates legislation, because we intend to do our bit to make roads safer. I noticed earlier the member for Gippsland said that safety is a complex matter and there is more than one factor. I agree. But where I do not agree with what the opposition has been saying, in their cynical opposition to this legislation, is I do not accept the proposition that remuneration is not a factor in a complex issue. In 1979 it was established that the method of payment had a big impact.",96
163,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
164,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked for evidence. The National Transport Commission report of 2008 said there was a link between payment rates and methods for owner-drivers and employees, that these methods create an incentive to drive unsafely and that this results in safety outcomes on roads. This government will not stand idly by and watch Australians be killed on our roads merely because of a lack of resolve. That is why the Safe Rates legislation is fine law. (Time expired)",97
165,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Herbert will remove himself. I asked him to remain silent for the rest of question time, which is difficult for him. He has not. He will remove himself for one hour under the provisions of standing order 94(a).

I remind the Prime Minister that the Fair Work Act empowers Fair Work Australia to disclose information that may assist in the enforcement of the law of a state. Does the Prime Minister agree with the head of Fair Work Australia, Ms Bernadette ONEILL, that the agency should withhold vital evidence from the New South Wales and Victorian police fraud squad investigations into the member for Dobell?",97
166,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Regarding the member's question, we see question time play out as usual. Here we go with the rest of question time, I predict, because the opposition has clearly run out of any questions about the economy or jobs or health or education or the interests of working Australians, and they are certainly not going to ask anything about company tax today, are they?

174,Mr HUSIC,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Will the Assistant Treasurer outline for the House the importance of providing tax relief for business and what support is there for this?,98
175,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:37): I thank the member for Chifley, who understands the needs of businesses in Western Sydney, which is one of the largest regional economies in this country and a part of the world that I represent. The question that the member for Chifley has asked goes to the government's plans to manage the economy in the interests of working people. We are determined to put in place a mining tax so that we can spread the benefits of the mining boom to ensure that those businesses that are not experiencing the benefits of being in the fast lane of the economy are able to get a tax cut and tax relief at a time when they need it most. When we take decisions in this place they have real consequences for real people. I read in the Age this morning of the case of James Anderson, who runs a small landscaping business in Tullamarine. Mr Anderson is a supporter of this government's plans to cut tax and provide tax relief for small business. In the article he said: I think it's very disappointing that the coalition isn't behind this. They should be doing everything they can to help small businesses… He goes on to make the point that is the bleeding obvious to people out there in the community, even if it seems to elude those opposite. He went on: Especially at the moment where we have a twospeed economy with one sector doing very, very well and the rest doing poorly. James Anderson understands that we need to spread the benefits of the mining boom and that is what we want to do. I am also asked about the extent of support for these proposals. It is a matter that is on the public record that the business community, through ACCI, the BCA, AiG and COSBOA, universally support this government's efforts to cut taxes because they know it is important to support business. But there are others, not just out there in the community but even in this place, who support providing relief to small business. I was struck by the comments of proudly the member for Hughes in his maiden speech, a member whom I know has in the media recently been associated with the challenges that many businesses are presently facing. The member for Hughes said in his maiden speech: …when push comes to shove, if we as the natural friends of small business do not stand up for a fair go for small business people, then we risk them remaining the forgotten people. Menzies would be turning in his grave. They want to consign the small business people of this country to the scrap heap of the forgotten people. We are determined to stand up for small business and if those on the other side want to forget about small business, so be it. The Gillard government will stand up for them and we will deliver a tax cut.",98
176,Mr HUSIC,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question to the Assistant Treasurer. Given the support out there for helping small businesses, what would be the impact of not giving the tax relief that the Assistant Treasurer has talked about?  Speaker: I put it to you that that supplementary question does not arise out of the answer of the minister and is therefore out of order.",99
177,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I consider it does. The Assistant Treasurer has the call.,99
178,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:41): It is a very pertinent question that the member for Chifley asks. I know that when he asked that question he had in his mind the 9,800 small businesses in his electorate because he knows in the same way as Mr Anderson knows-who was quoted in the Age this morning-that if this tax relief is not provided there will be very serious consequences for small businesses all around this country. Indeed, this morning in the Age Mr Anderson said: A tax cut would enable us to retain staff and invest in staff training and new machinery and equipment. He went on to say: Without it, it will be very challenging. Indeed, without tax relief it will be very challenging for the 2.7 million small businesses around Australia, particularly those that are not in the fast lane. There are many in this place who understand how important it is to recognise that some sectors are not doing it as well as others. Just last year, the member for Longman very wisely said at a press conference: In Caboolture we have twice the national average unemployment rate and we have a local economy that's dependent on small business, retail and tourism… Wyatt Roy interjectingWhen the member for Longman said that, I am sure he was thinking about",99

184,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Without accepting the premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question, I will answer it. We determined to appoint David Gonski because he is the best person for the job. We determined to appoint David Gonski because he has a track record of chairing major corporations in this nation, which we thought was relevant experience for the job. He has a track record of chairing order: the question was not about the person who ended up with the job.

Secondly, Mr Speaker, I am explaining that we appointed the person we considered to be the best person for the job.

Indeed our appointment of Mr Gonski to the job has been welcomed in a press release by the coalition, authored by the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance. We appointed the best person for the job. I do not know what case the Leader of the Opposition is bringing into this parliament. he is asking me to appoint someone other than the best person for the job because they are a member of the Liberal Party, then I will not do it.

Whilst we have a strong economy, low unemployment, low debt, moderate inflation and massive private sector investment coming into the economy, some industries in particular are feeling the effects of the high value of the Australian dollar. The government is therefore making tax reforms to relieve pressures in areas like manufacturing, which is feeling the effects of the high dollar. That is one of the reasons why the government has moved to cut company taxes across the board. We propose to cut company tax from 30 to 29 per cent. In relation to small business, many unincorporated small business people will If also stand to benefit from tax changes the government is making through the trebling of the tax-free threshold. So there are company tax, there are increases in the tax-free threshold that will flow tax cuts through to people and, in addition, the government is increasing the instant asset write-off for small business to $6,500. This measure is an extremely important one for small business as it will improve cash flow, improve investment, provide an incentive for capital investment and improve productivity in the small business sector. As well as all of that, the government has announced $1 billion in programs to help manufacturers improve energy efficiency, cut pollution and boost productivity. All of these measures will help business investment, they will support jobs and they will ensure all sectors of the economy share in the benefits of the resources boom. I am asked about the challenges to these reforms. Incredibly, the coalition are opposing every single measure to support business and to support jobs. They actually oppose a cut in company tax, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to put up company tax for thousands of businesses in this country. They oppose a billion dollars in assistance for the manufacturing sector for clean technology. They oppose a $6,500 instant asset write-off for small business. They oppose $300 million in assistance for the steel industry, which is under pressure. They propose to strip $1½ billion in assistance from the automotive manufacturing sector. This is an incredible performance from the Liberal Party. No wonder people in the business community are asking themselves what on earth is going on with economic policy in the Liberal Party these days. Future Fund",100
191,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation's statement that David Gonski cuts in 'did not make any recommendations regarding the appointment of the new chair of the Future Fund Board of Guardians'. Given that yesterday Mr Gonski stated, 'The board said they wanted an insider and they designated by majority that the insider was Peter Costello,' a view he conveyed to the minister, how does the Prime Minister explain this contradiction? Mr Danby interjecting",101

The shadow Treasurer authorised a press release welcoming the appointment. Senator Wong, the relevant minister, has explained the appointment process. To the shadow Treasurer, I would say that it seems to me quite a remarkable thing that, when the opposition has welcomed an appointment, now apparently it is coming into this parliament in defence",101

199,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The appointments process here was an appointments process that got the best person for the job. Peter Costello was appointed by this government to the Future Fund, but he was not the best person for the job, for the role of chair; David Gonski was. If the Liberal Party wants to repudiate the press release of the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister and go on a jobs-for-Liberals campaign, so be it.",102

201,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We engage in merit based selection, and the merit based selection gave us David Gonski. He is the best person for the job. NA Future Fund",102
202,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS, I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediatelyThat this House calls on the Prime Minister explain,102
203,Unknown,MOTIONS,Honourable members interjecting,102

205,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"I presume my time will start again, Mr Speaker.",102
206,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The clock will start again.,102
207,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediatelyThat this House calls on the Prime Minister to explain why the Government rejected the recommended candidate to chair the Future Fund and to explain further why the Government: (1) didn't run a competent selection process; and (2) hasn't been honest about the choice of leadership for the Future Fund which is charged with the responsibility of managing $70 billion of taxpayer funds. Standing orders must be suspended because, when it comes to the appointment of the Future Fund chairman, this government has been incompetent in managing it and dishonest in explaining it. The Future Fund is $70 billion worth of taxpayers' money, which should be treated as a sacred trust. Instead, so typically, we have had a Prime Minister looking shifty and evasive, looking angry and shrill in this parliament. Standing orders must be suspended, because this Prime Minister owes the country an explanation. She owes the country an explanation as to why the person she has appointed to chair the Future Fund does not think he is the person for the job. That is the truth, Mr Speaker. That is why standing to orders should be suspended. She has just appointed to chair the Future Fund someone who says, 'I'm not the best person for the job.' What a classic example of incompetence and dishonesty from this government. Standing orders must be suspended, because David Gonski, a distinguished and respected businessman, advised that Peter Costello was the clear preference of the Future Fund Board of Guardians for the chairmanship. David Gonski told the government that Peter Costello should be appointed. That was his clear recommendation. The government rejected the recommendation because, while he might have been economically competent, as far as they were concerned Peter Costello was not politically correct. They chose their version of political correctness ahead of clear economic competence. That is why standing orders should be suspended: because the government always chooses good politics over good economics. It is one of the reasons why they are so on the nose with the general public. Standing orders should be suspended, because this government, yet again, has been dishonest in its explanations of this matter. What else can we expect from a government which never tells the truth when it would be more convenient to lie.",102
208,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order!,103
209,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,I apologise; I withdraw.,103
210,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"No, the leader will pause. This is not a motion of censure; this a motion to suspend. The leader will withdraw the accusation of dishonesty.",103
211,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"In slavish deference-in respectful deference, Mr Speaker, I withdraw.",103
212,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Without condition.,103
213,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"It would be very valuable to get some facts here. Peter Costello is not just on the board of the Future Fund; he was not just appointed to the Future Fund by a previous Labor Prime Minister of more magnanimity than the current Labor Prime Minister-he created the Future Fund. The Future Fund exists only because of the good economic management of the previous government. That is why standing orders should be suspended so that these facts can be put clearly on the table. Let us look at the record of Peter Costello: more than two million new jobs, a 20 per cent increase in real wages, a doubling of net wealth for the Australian people-every Australian man, woman and child had his or her net wealth doubled under Peter Costello. Surely, if there is one person who is eminently qualified to chair the Future Fund he created it is the former Treasurer of this country-the greatest Treasurer this country has ever had. He was good enough for Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, to put on the Future Fund. Why isn'the good enough for this inadequate, unworthy, at times embarrassing Prime Minister to put into the chairmanship of the Future Fund? Let us look at the record and see why standing orders should be suspended. This former Treasurer repaid Labor's debt. He was able to create the Future Fund because he repaid Labor's debt. He turned $96 billion worth of debt into $70 billion worth of net assets. Standing orders should be suspended, because he got Labor's reckless spending under control. He turned a $10 billion budget is black hole into consistent $20-billion-a-year budget surpluses. This was a great Treasurer, and that is why he is absolutely the right person to chair the Future Fund that he created. And this is why standing orders must be suspended-so that some of the untruths that have been told by members opposite can be refuted. Stephen Conroy, who rejoices in the position of Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, said today, 'I'd rather put my money under the control of David Gonski any day of the week ahead of Peter Costello.' The coalition is not against David Gonski, but David Gonski himself thinks Peter Costello was a better candidate, which is why standing orders must be suspended. What does it say about members opposite that they think it is their moneythat they think the $70 billion of taxpayers' assets put into the Future Fund is somehow their money-to misuse for their politically correct purposes, not for the benefit of the Australian people? Peter Costello was the best Treasurer this country has ever had. That is why he is the right person to chair the Future Fund. But it was not just Senator Conroy. Senator Cameron was also out there today, saying Peter Costello was a 'failed Treasurer'. Standing orders must be suspended, because if Senator Cameron thinks Peter Costello was a failed Treasurer then what on earth does he think about the current Treasurer? Peter Costello gave us the four biggest surpluses in history. The current Treasurer has given us the four biggest deficits in history. What does Senator Cameron think of the current Treasurer? Senator Cameron went on, in speaking about Peter Costello, to say that 'to give him any senior position would just be an absolute joke'. Hang on: what is he saying about former Prime Minister Rudd, who did give him a senior position-the senior position as a guardian of the Future Fund? Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, put Peter Costello on the Future Fund. Senator Cameron said that was an absolute joke, and then Senator Cameron goes around and says Kevin Rudd should be the Prime Minister again. Who is telling jokes now? This is why standing orders should be suspended: maybe Senator Cameron now agrees with the member for Bendigo that in fact the former Prime Minister is a psychopath with a big ego. What does it say about this Prime Minister that 31 people-31 members of the caucuspreferred a psychopath to her? Let us look at what David Gonski said: My report says that they wanted an insider. report it says that there is one person and I indicated to the department that endorsement for that person. And what did the Minister for Finance and Deregulation say? She said that there was no recommendation from Mr Gonski's reports to the government for a particular person to be appointed. There is a flat contradiction, and standing orders must be suspended, because when we have David Gonski's word on one hand and the word of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation on the other, I think we know who we can believe. Do we believe David Gonski, or do we believe the representative of a government that has been chronically untruthful?",103
214,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The leader will return to the motion.,104
215,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,That is why standing orders must be suspended: to get to the bottom of this. We have a government that has been dishonest with the electorate over the carbon tax and dishonest with the electorate over gambling reform. The Prime Minister was dishonest to the electorate over Bob Carr. This is a government with truth deficit disorder.,104
216,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order!,104
217,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,They are telling lies now. That is why standing orders should be suspended.,104
218,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition has accused the Prime Minister of being dishonest and he has accused the government of telling lies. The Leader of the Opposition does not look remotely contrite, but if he wants to stay here he will move to the dispatch box and withdraw those two accusations.",104

220,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The leader will return to the dispatch box and he will say, 'I withdraw those two terms', and not do as he endeavoured to do, which was to associate members of the coalition with the disorderly terms that he used.",104
221,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"I did accuse the government of being dishonest, I did accuse the Prime Minister of lying and I withdraw. I withdraw unconditionally.",105

224,Mr HOCKEY,MOTIONS," I second the motion. We should suspend standing orders because there have been a number of failures that must be dealt with urgently by this House. In the first place, there has been a complete failure of good governance. David Murray, the outgoing chairman of the Future Fund, actually said: The decision has been left late every time … You need to give people information and you need to make decisions in a timely way. to govern the organisation itself. And the government has yet again procrastinated about the appointment of people to run the most important fund of money that Australian taxpayers have outside of the mainstream budget. But it goes further. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer",105
225,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The honourable member will return to the motion before the chair.,105
226,Mr HOCKEY,MOTIONS,"The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer have sought to engage outside consultants to appoint a chairman of the Future Fund. They went through a process-this is why standing orders must be suspended-to find the most appropriate person. They engaged an outside consulting firm and, when they were not satisfied with that, they engaged Mr Gonski to give them a recommendation on whom the guardians themselves believed to be the very best person to chair the Future Fund. Mr Gonski reported back to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that the view of the guardians is in fact that Peter Costello is the best person to do it. Standing orders must be suspended because the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, only a few days ago, led people to believe-and I am prepared to quote her-that there was no recommendation from anyone to appoint Peter Costello. But the fact of the matter is that, even though the Minister for Finance and Deregulation deliberately misled not only the Australian people",105
227,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The honourable member is aware that it is disorderly to reflect on members of this chamber or the other place. The member will withdraw.,105
228,Mr HOCKEY,MOTIONS,"I withdraw. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has repeatedly It helps said that Mr Gonski had made no recommendation. On the ABC's World Today yesterday, she said: He made no recommendations. She said that on ABC Radio yesterday. It is now revealed in today's Australian that Mr Gonski did in fact make recommendations. The article quotes Mr Gonski as saying: My job was to advise the government on what the board thought. The board said they wanted an insider and they designated by majority that the insider was Peter. 'Peter' means Peter Costello. This is why standing orders must be suspended. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation is running around saying that there was no recommendation from David Gonski about the chairmanship of the Future Fund, yet Mr Gonski himself, who was engaged by the government, has now declared that in fact he did make a recommendation-that recommendation being Mr Costello. Suspending standing orders is so urgent because this represents the way this government operates. We have to stop this government from more incompetence; we have to stop this government from any more acts of poor corporate governance involving taxpayers' money-and we are doing so. Brian Watson has belled the cat. He said",105
229,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The honourable member will return to the suspension motion.,106
230,Mr HOCKEY,MOTIONS,"We must suspend standing orders because Mr Watson has said that Mr Gonski interviewed the members of the Future Fund in confidence to get their views on the Future Fund and the membership of the Future Fund. Now Mr Gonski has been appointed to chair the Future Fund-such practice is widely regarded as poor corporate governance in Australia. This government treats Peter Costello with contempt. This government treats Australian taxpayers with contempt. Do not let the Australian government treat people with contempt in future. Get back to good corporate governance, get out of the let us govern. (Time expired)",106

But on the Thursday at the end of a sitting week, when any of a range of important issues could be raised, the only jobs they want to talk about are jobs for Liberal Party members. That is the only thing they want to talk about. We could have talked about the hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, we could have talked about superannuation or we could have talked about the flood affected communities that are still under pressure. Instead, those opposite are only interested in talking about jobs for Liberal boys. Is that really the only thing that we can",106

237,Ms ROXON,MOTIONS,"Obviously we disagree with the motion to suspend standing orders. We believe that there is a long list-a list that would run from here to the door-of issues that are far more important than talking about whether there should be a job for a Liberal boy who Mr Abbott thinks is better than Mr Gonski. The reason Mr job and Gonski was chosen for this jobMrs Mirabella: On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I ask you to direct the Attorney General to withdraw the offensive comment.

238,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The offensive term, in your view, was 'Liberal boys'? I am all about civility but I think that is stretching it a little.",106
239,Ms ROXON,MOTIONS,"Let us be completely honest about this-everyone on this side of the House can understand why Mr Costello would be disappointed. He just cannot seem to get a leadership job, whether it is in here parliament or whether it is anywhere else. It is absolutely understandable why he would be disappointed about it.

241,Ms ROXON,MOTIONS,"But let us look at the issue that is being talked about here. We appointed an absolutely outstanding Australian, someone who is a leader in the business community. Not only do we think he is an outstanding Australian-he has held the chairmanships of not only boards of the biggest companies that operate in Australia but also the Australian Stock Exchange-but just one day ago, not even 24 hours ago, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister issued a press release to say that they welcomed this appointment. It is now such an outrageous thing, from yesterday at two o'clock when they issued a press release to say that this was good news and that they welcomed the appointment, that we have to suspend standing orders.

242,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The honourable Minister for Health will remove herself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). I have directed that all honourable members will listen to the Attorney-General in silence, and that includes the minister. The member for Sydney then left the chamber.",107
243,Ms ROXON,MOTIONS,"It took them 24 hours to decide that they accidentally said yes to something, when they so often want to say no-that it is important that every other matter that is listed for debate in the should take secondary importance. This is a nonsense. I could go through every member on this side of the House and tell you the top five issues they would think were more important to be debated in this House. I know absolutely for sure that if I went to the crossbenchers, particularly the National Party members and the Liberal Party members whose seats are still under water because they have been affected by the floods, I could pick any number of issues much more important for this House to be debating than this issue here now.",107
244,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Attorney-General will return to the specifics of the question.,107
245,Ms ROXON,MOTIONS,"I am addressing the suspension, Mr Speaker, and arguing that this particular issue does not merit the suspension of standing orders. I do not think that the appointment of an outstanding Australian, welcomed across the business community and welcomed by the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister only 24 hours ago, could somehow be transformed into an issue of such importance that we should suspend standing orders to debate it. Let us also look at the history here. We have never on this side of the parliament said that being a member of the Liberal Party or being a member of the National Party was a disqualifier for a job. In fact we have been incredibly generous as a government in appointing people who have been good and skilled, and recognised in the community as such, to many different positions. We have appointed people to represent us at NATOhe was in the House just a couple of days ago-and to represent us at the World Health Organisation. We appointed Mr Fischer to be Ambassador to the Holy See. We have appointed so many different experienced people across all sides of the political spectrum.",107
246,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Attorney-General will return to the motion.,108
247,Ms ROXON,MOTIONS,"Each time we have said, 'Who is the best person for the job?' On this occasion, we do not believe that it merits suspending standing orders when it is clear that it is an outstanding Australian, Mr David Gonski, who deserves the support of this chamber, who was the ASX chairman and who has chaired everything from the Sydney Theatre Company through to Coca-Cola, has been the Chancellor at the University of New South Wales and has provided advice to government on a range of different things from e-health to education. He is an absolutely outstanding individual and there can be no possible reason that we should call into question his appointment, and certainly no possible reason that we should suspend standing orders to do it. We are not going to waste, and we ought not to waste, valuable time in this parliament when there are so many other issues in the community and a range of so many jobs in each electorate that people would happily talk about. Yet there is only one job that those opposite think is worth talking about, and that is a job for a Liberal. Why should that be the priority over any other job that should be discussed in this chamber? We know that employment is challenging. We know that in Victoria, for example, there are challenges in the manufacturing industry, and the industry minister talked about a number of those issues. We are working damn hard over this side of the House to make sure that those people get supported, but would you ever have a debate on those issues in here? Not once. Would you ever have a question on those issues in here? The only job that they can get worked up about is one for a Liberal colleague that they did not even support for the top job here. I think there has to be a bit of irony. The Leader of the Opposition",108

As required by standing order 46(d) I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important, that is, that proposed by the honourable Member for Dunkley, namely: The adverse effects of Government policy on small businesses in Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",109
253,Mr BILSON,IMPORTANCE," Not one Labor member of this parliament stood up to support this urgent discussion about the Report adverse impact of its government policy on the small business community. What a surprise! That is entirely in keeping with this Gillard-Rudd Labor government strategy of talking a good game at times but certainly not lifting its game when it comes to the impact on small business. You cannot find an example where small business has been front and centre of the federal government's mind. It is of very serious concern how poorly understood and appreciated small business is by this government. We need to support our small business and family enterprise community. They deserve our support, they warrant our encouragement and they deserve considered policy that will actually support the prosperity. The coalition knows that prosperous small businesses feed (Judicial into the vitality of local communities and opportunities for Australians, something this government have never understood. They continue to show their ignorance on this topic by their inaction on the matters that really matter to the small business community. Remember the time when the Howard government was in office? We saw the number of people running their own small businesses exceed the number of union members. Small businesses were being developed right around our country, in every corner of our continent. There was a sound economic environment and supportive policies that, rightly, recognised that small business was the engine room of our economy. When you talk to operators of small businesses today they are almost whimsical about those past times. They look back to when the Howard government was in office and they recall vividly that it was a golden era for them and for the communities that they are so embedded in and such a part of. Now small businesses are looking at the end of a very long, dark tunnel and seeing that the only bright light is the prospect election. But they want to know how long they have to hang on. The economic funk and the despair that this government has driven small businesses into are very worrying for many small business people. As the government fails to act on the matters of key concern to small business, they are cannibalising the capital that people have invested in those businesses. They are not only demonising successful entrepreneurs but demoralising the entrepreneurs. The sons and daughters of people who are currently entrepreneurs of our country are looking at what mum and dad are having to go through. It is a bit like my LNP colleagues pointed to some years ago: in the rural community the sons and daughters of farmers were thinking, 'Gee, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life, but I'm pretty sure farming's pretty tough going.' This is now the mood that is undermining confidence in the small business community and impeding the next generation of entrepreneurs, who we really need. Boy, has the mood changed! Confidence is down, entrepreneurship is under attack. We have a federal government whose disposition is hostile to small business, a government wanting to talk a good game but never lifting its game in terms of the support small businesses deserve. Just have a look at what is going on. Have a look at the state of the nation through the eyes of the small business community. Have a look at why they are feeling that this government is not interested in their interests and certainly not responding to the concerns that they have. There is an urgency and a need for decisive action to try to give small businesses the support that they need. There is a need to nurture the policies that will give us growth and economic vitality to spread opportunities. Instead, all we get from this government is more new taxes. When the of an Howard government left office, the ABS estimated that 5,061,000 people were employed in small businesses around Australia. That was more than half the private sector workforce; in fact, it was 51.3 per cent. Just a few short years later, in June 2009, the ABS reported that job losses in small business had already totalled 300,000 and that private sector employment that small business provided had gone from 51 per cent down to 48 per cent. The ABS has changed its numbers and its methodology again. Rather than the government pushing off from those earlier numbers, the ABS is now saying that there are 4,747,000 people employed in small business and it is down to 47.2 per cent of the private sector economy. We are seeing jobs shrinking out of the private sector in the small business community when we should be out there trying to nurture and support growth in that area. When we look at what is going on in insolvency, we see the Dun and Bradstreet report, a very worrying report, showing that the number of small business insolvencies is up by 45 per cent and the number of new business start-ups is down by 95 per cent. This is the climate. This is the ditch that this government has driven many small businesses into. When you ask small business people what their major concerns are, they say they are worried about incompetence from a government that does not seem to understand that its actions have profound impact on the men and women in small business and they ask, 'What is the government going to do at a time when costs are punishing business?' They are just going to put costs up with the world's largest carbon tax. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently surveyed their members. Three out of four respondents believe that the carbon tax will have a negative impact on their business. Eightyfour per cent urge the scrapping of it in the name of their business, the jobs that they try to create and to try and stave off yet another nail in the coffin of many of those businesses. The Australian Association of Convenience Stores found that 96 per cent of their respondents in a recent survey said the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax will have a negative impact on their business and two-thirds of them said it will negatively impact on future employment levels. You can imagine my surprise when in a recent weeks the state Labor shadow employment minister was calling on the Baillieu government to reduce taxes and charges to try and deal with the jobs losses Victoria, a jobs crisis in Victoria, but the new minister said, 'What jobs crisis?' There is a jobs crisis. We are losing jobs because this government's policy approach and their unwillingness and lack of preparedness to actually tackle the causes of it. That is why this matter is of such importance today. When you look at the carbon tax, the world's largest carbon tax, you see there is barely an industry in the Australian economy that is not going to be hurt and harmed by that measure. We heard today the experience of tenants in Westfield shopping centres. The decision of Westfield to include a carbon tax clause in their latest rent agreements for shopkeepers is further proof that the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax is going to hit every Australian business. It will not just be paid by the big 500; we will all be paying and we will be paying for a long time. The Prime Minister spoke in the House today, and I do not know where she gets her information from. Shortly after, Zarraffa's Coffee House put out a press statement about recent lease negotiations. Remember that the Prime Minister is saying, 'This clause has been around for so long. What are people going on about?' What they are going on about is the punishment this carbon tax is going to inflict on small business. In this particular example Westfield is now introducing a carbon tax escalation clause in their leases to say that they will pass on carbon or greenhouse gas emission related charges and recover the same from the lessee. Zarraffa's are saying, 'We are really struggling right now.' They say the carbon tax adds insult to injury by not delivering on a long-term solution to carbon and indiscriminately weakening businesses across all industries. They point out that they cannot keep carrying increased costs and expect to survive into the future. They point to the carbon tax impact on transport, on in power, on rents and so on. Now you see a major shopping centre owner putting it in as a reason to further escalate the lease costs of that people face. That is the clause. The Leader of the Opposition showed the Prime Minister the clause. She retreated to the argument, 'It has been around forever; what are you going on about?' This ignores the very statement that someone with premises across a number of Westfield stores is engaged in current and recent lease negotiations where this has appeared for the first time. But go further, even just accounting for what the impact is in the suburbs and regions across Australia. The Geelong Advertiser thought they would go and have a chat to some of the tenants in their Westfield shopping centre. Interestingly, at a time when the Prime Minister says this has been around for a long time, I will quote another Westfield tenant who said they recently signed a new lease to open another cafe in the complex and the person said it would not surprise him if Westfield included the clause in future contracts. So what he is talking about is a relatively fresh contract that was being entered into that did not have these clauses while other tenants are saying they are involved in negotiations right now where it is going to be pushed in. And the Prime Minister says, 'Look, it's nothing to worry about. It has been around for a long time.' It is very important for the Australian public to be able to separate fact from fallacy because we know this government's reputation on not giving us the full story. Remember 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'? Small business remembers that. The decision by Westfield to include this carbon tax clause in its latest rent agreements with shopkeepers shows that this carbon tax will impact on the prices of every Australian household, on every Australian business. This is something the retail sector is alert They are already doing it tough, yet now they have got further cost pressures on their very thin margins at the moment. In the case of the Geelong centre there was a proposition where the person was quoted as saying, 'There is no doubt that people cannot afford to pay any more rent. I would say about 25 per cent of businesses would be out of business in Westfield Geelong if this was included.' That was the Nextra newsagent, Wayne Crouch. Who do you believe: someone who is paying the rent, someone who is looking carefully at these lease agreements, or the glib, distracting nonanswer we get from the Prime Minister saying, 'Don't worry about it, it has been around forever.' In everything you buy this will be embedded. We have heard in recent days about the carbon tax impact in the transport sector. Just because it might not be in the government's mind a tax on what comes out of the tailpipe of cars does not mean there will not be a carbon tax impact on everything that leads to the fuel being combusted in the first place. When you talk to the Australian Convenience and Petroleum Marketing Association they say, 'Don't believe there will be no impact on us. The forecourt area lit up, the pumps running with their precision calibrations, all the supplies that are sold in the business, the refrigeration.' They are pointing to a direct impact of the carbon tax on petrol prices, not because it is on the pipe but because it is on everything that goes into making the fuel available in the first place. This is a carbon tax that will cost Australians 400 times the per capita impact of the EU scheme. That per capita impact is extraordinary. What do we get from the government when these concerns are raised? We get a glib response from Greg Combet, the minister for carbon tax, who says a dry to. cleaner is not competing against dry cleaners in China. What a genius! Drivers cannot get their cars serviced in India. It would just be a whole lot more expensive. We already know for anyone who talks to a local mechanic that people are less inclined to do the routine maintenance on their vehicles. They are coming in when their car is in trouble. But there is a whole lot of demand impact already flowing through the system. You see it in the building industry, where the building industry is saying the proposed carbon tax will have a substantial adverse impact on the building and construction sector. You see how they describe the sector as one of low margins with long supply chains, how this tax will compound and impact on every step along the way. In manufacturing, the poor manufacturers-why have they deserved to get this negative tariff that is going to make an already difficult time for them extraordinarily challenging into the future? It is not a surprise to see those Dun & Bradstreet figures. It is not surprise to have small businesses telling you about their concerns. It is a surprise when the new minister is not even aware of the crisis that small business is facing. But in an effort of unvarnished plagiarism what have we seen in the last three weeks? We have seen the Gillard government without an idea of its own lift three coalition policies in the last fortnight and claim them as their own. It is quite a remarkable thing to see, if you look at what is going on. I am sure the House will be quite interested. I am holding the coalition's policy document at the last election. Look at what the Prime Minister said when she was announcing the measure. You would have at least thought they would have come up with their own talking points rather than just lift out the concepts and ideas from the coalition. We saw that also in the appointment of the new Minister for Small Business. And I would like to congratulate him on his appointment. So committed were the government to having this minister in cabinet that it has taken four reshuffles to get one there. They have bolted it onto homelessness and housing. I hope they are not seeing a connection between small business and homelessness as their mortgages are called in because of the failing of their businesses. I hope that is not the connection. But we still have not seen competition policy lifted. We still see that as a junior minister. At least up from a parliamentary secretary. These are some of the real challenges that small business faces. If you are wondering why the Prime Minister announced 'the minister in cabinet' and the 'ombudsman', which they have called a commissioner-a bit of badge engineering-and 'our red-tape reduction', just go back to 8 July 2010, which is the date of the press release where we announced them. They picked up the coalition policy. As the government have no ideas of their own I urge the government, in the name of small business survival, to pick up the rest of our policies. Better still, why not cut out the middleman? We know there are costs and fat in the middleman. Why not just elect the coalition to implement it, because we are the ones genuinely committed to doing the right thing? Let me look at another issue. Remember the solar rebate system for hot water, which just disappeared. Who is going to look after the small businesses that geared up with forward orders to account for the expected increase in demand and that are now left with all of this stock? I suppose they could put it in a warehouse with the fluff and foam they had from the Home Insulation Program. Why don't you look at what you are doing to independent contractors? Day after day you come in here and undermine independent contractors. They are a legitimate enterprise and they deserve to be supported. Finally, if you really want a policy, pick up the coalition's one. Peter Strong was out there yesterday saying, 'It is a very good place to be at the moment for small business.' I would hate to tell you about the phone calls from people who were choking on their morning tea when they heard that. They are not sure what good place they are talking about. It might be a good place for people who are able to pick opportunities, but have it is a look at the business pressures being faced by small business. (Time expired) Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (15:47): I thank the honourable member for his contribution. Some of the comments go to the issue of the Liberal Party's concerns about small business. The unfortunate thing is that the policies he enunciated in relation to what the Liberal Party would have done if elected were clearly those things that they were not able do or chose not to do when they were in government. For 11½ years the Howard government was in power and in that time submissions were made by the small business community to elevate the portfolio to cabinet. For the last six years of that period there was no small business minister in cabinet. There were also calls from the small business community to have a small business commissioner, something that was not acceded to or accepted by the Howard government. In fact, the first government that introduced a small business commissioner was the Victorian Labor government, in 2004. It did so because it wanted to provide a voice for small business. It wanted to provide independent advice and the opportunity for representation to be made directly to the small business minister in the Victorian government. The government and the member for Dunkley, when he was a member of that government, had an opportunity to ensure that this office was instituted, but nothing was done by the Howard government in relation to that office. The creation of the small business commissioner is a very important announcement. It will provide small businesses across the country with the capacity to make representations direct to me and to receive very pertinent advice about their small businesses. I think it is an excellent decision and it is one that this government made. It is something that was not done by the Howard government. I think it is important that the government elevate this portfolio to cabinet. I feel very honoured to be in that position. It is something the previous Howard government failed to do for the last six years of its term. That says something about the Liberal Party and their relationship with small business. to They say they are the party of small business but, when it comes to reform and making decisions in the interests of that very important and vital sector, they have failed when in government. It is very important that I am at the cabinet table, not only advancing the interests of small business but taking into account any potential adverse effects that may arise from other decisions; therefore making sure that small business is being considered when governments are making such very important decisions. The member for Dunkley spoke for 15 minutes and he did not talk about the need to immediately pass on some tax cuts to small business. It is quite extraordinary. I have never before seen the Liberal Party and a Liberal Party leader, Tony Abbott, oppose tax cuts for small business. He has categorically opposed the tax cuts for small business that will commence on 1 July. This Howard is unheard of. This shows the disregard the opposition has for the small business community. We are looking to reduce company tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent for incorporated companies. We are looking to provide instant asset tax write-offs of up to $6,500 for literally millions of small businesses across the country. We are also looking to have an instant tax write-off for the first $5,000 of motor vehicle use for business. All of these measures are being opposed by the opposition. This is quite extraordinary, because the Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that he supports tax cuts. On 29 March this year, when talking to Lyndal Curtis on ABC News 24 he said: … in principle we strongly support company tax cuts … and we wanted to deliver this tax cut … On 4 October 2011 he said: … we don't believe in new taxes. We believe in trying to get existing taxes down. On 12 August 2011 the Leader of the Opposition said: The best thing I can do for business is to cut its tax … The Leader of the Opposition has been on the record time and time again saying he wants to support tax cuts, yet, when he is provided an opportunity to make sure we pass on tax relief to literally millions of small businesses in this country, the Leader of the Opposition stands up and says, 'I refuse to support that initiative.' It is absolutely outrageous and unprecedented action by the Liberal Party. We hear this time and time again from the Liberal Party, that they are the party of small business. They say they are the party of the forgotten people. They have forgotten the forgotten people by not supporting the tax cuts for small business. It is an absolute outrage and they should hang their heads in shame. The other thing that we know when it comes to the Liberal Party is that they never let the truth get in the way of a good scare campaign. They have sought to scare the small business community, scare the people of this country, by making up falsehood after falsehood in relation to the carbon tax. The facts are these: this government will apply a tax to the 500 biggest polluters. We will ensure that people are provided support by way of tax cuts and by way of pension payments. There is no tax imposition to be placed on small business. The small and modest increases that will arise in prices we accept will flow on to the consumer-a consumer that will be provided with tax cuts and increases in pension payments. Compare that approach with the approach of the opposition. Their view is to impose a $1,300 per annum tax increase on every household in this country. Who lives in those households? It is sole proprietors, independent contractors, microbusinesses and small businesses. They will all have to pay a $1,300 increase because the opposition kowtow to the Gina Rineharts and the Clive Palmers in this country and choose to provide tax relief for the largest businesses in this country and impose tax burdens on the smaller businesses in this country. That is a typical response from an opposition that is taking instructions from the super-rich in this country. I have never seen the like of it in the 10 years I have been in this place: the Liberal Party so nakedly taking instruction from the super-rich and denying and depriving small businesses in this country of the tax cuts that they deserve. We still hope that the opposition-indeed, the member for Dunkley and others-will support the tax cuts for small business, but I doubt it. I cannot see it happening. This opposition leader and this opposition are so negative that I would not be surprised if they oppose their own policies. The fact is that the member for Dunkley put up a couple of issues",110
254,Mr Billson,IMPORTANCE,"You're pinching them. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: You might have come up with them in opposition, but you should have made the decisions in government. Of course, you chose not to and you have failed to properly relate to the small business community because in the endMr Billson interjecting Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: Yes, there is no doubt you did make small businesses tax collectors under the GST. That is the one thing they remember about you and the Liberal Party when in government. The small business community know they have a government now that is listening to them. Peter Strong, the executive officer of COSBOA, applauded the decision to institute the Small Business Commissioner. There is no doubt that they applauded that. Indeed, other employer bodies have done likewise, supporting the creation of this position. They are also supporting the tax cuts this government is soon to enact. They understand that small businesses in this country have challenges and it is for that reason that this government is providing some support. I think it is really important that the government play a role as an enabler to create the conditions in which businesses can thrive. If you want some proof of the way the government respond to small business, you need only look at our decision when we were confronted by the global financial crisis. There is no better way to demonstrate the difference in approach between the government and the opposition than when it came to making decisions in relation to the challenges of the global financial crisis. We chose to invest in education and housing and to provide supportMr Baldwin interjecting Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: Yes, we provided support for people who needed accommodation; yes, we provided support for students across the land who wanted 21st century infrastructure-and why shouldn't they want that? Who were the other beneficiaries of that very important decision? They were the thousands and thousands of small businesses across the country that worked on 27,000 projects-tradies, sole proprietors, independent contractors and small businesses in the construction and maintenance sector, and that flowed on to other sectors of the economy. If you went to an opening of a BER initiative-and I know that many on the other side, having voted against it, turned up to some of those events-if you listened to the small businesses that built those very important amenities for those schools and if you talked to the architects and builders, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, they said: 'Without these decisions we would have gone to the wall. Without these decisions we literally would not be here today.' That decision by governmentDr Emerson: Opposed by the opposition. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: Yes, it was opposed by the opposition. That decision provided opportunities for thousands of small businesses. It meant that so many more people were employed. That was absolutely critical. It meant that we ensured that thousands of small businesses in every one of the members' electorates in this place survived and thrived. That is what happened as a result of those decisions. Conversely, the opposition chose to oppose those very important initiatives. In the end, their heart is not there to support small business. In the end, whatever their rhetoric, the reality is that their heart is not in this at all. Ultimately, if you have to choose between a tax cut for small business or tax relief for the largest and wealthiest companies in this country, which would you normally choose? This government will always choose support for small business and, clearly, the opposition will provide relief for the super-rich. That is the problem. I have been in the role of the Minister for Small Business for a very short time. I am very proud to be the minister and I am very proud to have the portfolio elevated to cabinet. It is the first time since I have been in this place that there has been a cabinet minister representing small business. I am happy that within that time. I have been able to announce the Office of the Small Business Commissioner. I am happy, indeed, to have been able to prosecute the argument as to why we need tax relief for small businesses. I will continue to prosecute that argument to ensure that we provide such relief. I will be speaking to as many small businesses as I can as I go around the country. They are the engine room of this economy; there is no doubt. They employ just under five million Australians. They are absolutely vital to our economy. As I said earlier, the role of government is to create the conditions in which they can thrive. We did that when we confronted the global financial crisis. Indeed, we saved and ensured that certain companies continued in a very prosperous manner. We will continue to provide new opportunities for small business because if you create the right conditions then certainly those small businesses will prosper. Why is it so important? It is important for those businesses but it is also important because of the breadth and the proportion of Australian employees that are employed by those businesses. We will continue to listen to small business. I will be travelling around the country talking to all of the areas of small business, and, literally, they are in every sector of our economy. I will be getting direct from them their concerns and challenges so that we can continue to respond. What I hope will happen between now and when the decision is to be made in the Senate is that the opposition has a change of heart. I hope the opposition thinks about this and puts the country first, puts small business first and supports the tax cuts and the tax relief that we want to provide. All this week the Leader of the Opposition has tried all sorts of distractions to forget about the one issue that is clear in everyone's mind: we have a Liberal Party leader who is seeking to oppose tax cuts to small business. The only thing that they wanted to talk about today is one job for a former Liberal Treasurer. They did not want to talk about the jobs in the small business sector or about relief for small business. I say to those opposite: listen to the small business community, accept the tax cut, allow the tax cut and allow that for them because they need it. (Time expired)",116
255,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE," I rise today to speak to this MPI: The adverse effects of Government policy on small businesses in Australia. I would like to start by recognising and heralding all of those positive achievements that this government has made for small business! But I actually should start to address the real issue, and that is the issue of the negative policies that have impacted on small business. I have just heard from the Minister for Small Business how he is walking amongst small business, how he is listening. Minister, take the earmuffs off! If you took the earmuffs off you would hear what they were saying to you. You would hear of the record bankruptcies that are occurring. You would hear about the struggles that people are going through because of the lack of confidence driven by an incompetent Prime Minister with a Labor Party so focused on its internal fighting that it cannot be focused on the future of this nation. This government has undermined consumer confidence and it has undermined business confidence, and therefore we are seeing a reduction in investment because there is no confidence. In fact, this is the government that said it would do a one for one: it would repeal the red tape and regulation that business goes through-in particular, the burden on small business. Since 2007 this government has introduced or amended 16,173 new regulations. It has repealed 79. I can understand why it does not understand small business, because it does not understand simple mathematics",118
256,Mr Billson,IMPORTANCE,Trust me! 205 to one!,119
257,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE,"'205 to one', the shadow minister for small business says-because 16,173 does not equate to 79. In relation to red tape, there was the industries for Australia review conducted by the member for Indi and the member for Groom. We actually did a separate one for the tourism industry. That identified a range of issues that business operators were facing. In fact, off the back of that our leader determined that we should have a special task force looking at addressing the issues red tape. That is being headed up by Arthur Sinodinos, with a high-quality team. How can you understand small business if you have never been there? How can you understand small business if you have never had skin in the game? I know the shadow minister, the member for Dunkley, has been in small business. He was a retailer. He has been through the tough times. He knows what it is like to have the mortgage over the family home, to worry about whether there are going to be people coming into the shop. What we have here on the other side are people who go from school to university to union to the parliament. They have not had a small business. They have never had their own money on the line; they have never had skin in the game. They have never had to address the issues of economic constraints and bad government policy. The only bad policy that they have within themselves is when they have a leadership battle and wonder whether the Left or the Right or the inside out are going to take the leadership. When I look at the tourism industry, some 85 per cent of the players in the tourism industry are small to medium operators. They are part of the team that employs 500,000 people in the tourism industry. If I add hospitality into that, there are 500,000 people in the hospitality industry. They actually understand small business, because every morning they get up and face issues such as weather-and weather can be an impediment in the tourism industry; they face the issues of whether the dollar is going up or down; they face the issues of government confidence and whether people have disposable income in their pockets to spend on their business; and they face the issues of industrial relations reforms, which have driven a lot of businesses out of business. When I was with the member at Margaret River we were talking to restaurant of and cafe owners that just shut now on Saturdays and Sundays because they cannot afford the rates, because this government has not understood what is required to keep businesses, and in particular small businesses, going. In parliament this week and in previous weeks they have been attacking Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. But the Minister for Small Business should have been standing up for them because a large sector of their spending is on employing or engaging or contracting small to medium enterprises. This government would rather take away from or crush those who do the employing. When you have been only in a union and you have never been out there in the real workforce, you do not understand that without employers you do not have any employees. If you do not create an environment in which employers have the confidence to invest and grow their business, if the market conditions are not right, then guess what? You do not have employees. That is why we have seen a reduction in employment in this country. That is why we have seen a reduction in the number of businesses operating in this country. When the Howard government left office, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated there were 5,061,000 people employed by the Australian small business sector. This was 51.3 per cent of the private sector workforce. By June 2009, when that mob were in government, the ABS reported small business job losses of more than 300,000 and a decline in the private sector workforce employed in small business to 48 per cent. Under a new ABS statistical methodology, introduced in June 2010, the small business employment level was estimated at 4,747,000, representing 47.2 per cent of the total private sector workforce. Since the change of government, there are 14,500 fewer employing small businesses. So when I see this minister stand up and boast how important it is to have a minister at cabinet level, I can understand that because, under their previous arrangement, we have seen 14,500 fewer small businesses. We have seen record bankruptcies under this government. It is not hard to understand why when the banks are calling in loans because of the competition for finance when this government is borrowing $100 million a day, competing with the very businesses that need that money to fund their overdrafts and their investments in their business. One of the key essences of being in business is developing a business plan. You put into it all the factors, you model all conditions and you search out the best information so you understand that you can invest with confidence, go forward and stick to your plan. When this Prime Minister was asked what modelling had been done for the tourism industry in particular and on small business, the response was, 'None.' No modelling was done. She had spoken to a couple of people. She had a handle on it, she said. She has never been in small business; how could she have a handle on it? Without modelling, without understanding all of the conditions and factors, particularly when you bring in a great big new tax-the carbon tax-you cannot understand. This incompetent government talks about the need for tax cuts. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that you do not need tax cuts if you do not impose new taxes on people. This government is giving on one hand while they are robbing with the other. This is the equivalent of putting a bandaid on your arm after you purposely slash your wrist. You would not need the bandaid if you did not slash your wrist. This government is so incompetent that it cannot even understand the flow of direction of business decision making. In fact, the only modelling that was done was by the TTF, and TTF came out and said that in the tourism industry there would be 6,400 job losses, predominantly in regional and rural Australia. It said the impact would be $731 million off the bottom line and the only beneficiary of a carbon tax would be outbound tourism. We are suffering a tourism deficit in this country. Back in 2001, we posted a $3.6 billion tourism surplus in Australia. This year we are heading to an $8.7 billion deficit and in part that is because of the bad policy and bad direction of this government and, after 1 July, it will only get worse when this the government imposes a carbon tax the likes of which never before seen.",119
258,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I am so glad you have given me the call. I am going to be upfront. I love listening to the member for Dunkley. Whenever he brings these matters of public importance into the House I love it. He has that machine-gun delivery and all that energy. There he is, trying to paint a picture of horror, backing up his claims with playdough statistics, providing us with a promise that we will see a better future if we just follow what he tells us we need to do. If I close my eyes, I am not listening to parliament; I am listening to late night TV and he is Mr ShamWow. He is there, flogging his products to us with all that energy and gusto and I almost wait, Member for Dunkley, for you to offer us a free DVD of the performance. I will take it! I will take that any day.",120
259,Mr Neumann,IMPORTANCE,Better than steak knives.,121
260,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"It is better than steak knives, indeed, as my colleague the member for Blair rightly points out. The member for Dunkley has directed all this energy and effort this week-it has been a supreme performance. Why have we had it? It is because opposition members are trying to mask the reality. They keep going on about how we are all from the union movement and how all we do is support the union movement. Do you know what? I have no problems supporting the union movement and union members because they are working people. I have no problem doing that. We, through our actions in this place, help working people every day. Those opposite dress themselves up as the friends of small business when in reality they are the biggest betrayers of small business. They are the ones who made every single small business a tax collector when they imposed the GST. They loaded up small businesses with all that paperwork, forcing them to bring in MYOBs and to fill out business activity statements. They burdened them. These great friends of small business now worry that everything will come to an end when we introduce a price on carbon for the top 500 businesses. We introduced initiatives such as providing an asset tax write-off to improve the cash flow of small businesses around the country. Name one government that in one move was able to improve the cash flow of businesses to the tune of $6,500. It never happened under those opposite. We are providing it. A government member: Per asset.",121
261,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Per asset, indeed. When we give business tax cuts, what do these people on the other side, parading themselves as the great friends of small business, do? They oppose it. Big business and the corporate sector are trying to work out what is going on on that side of the fence when they will not provide a business tax cut and when they will not support what we are trying to doeffectively redistribute the huge wealth that has been generated on one side of the country to ensure that the two million businesses across this nation have a huge injection in cash flow. What do those opposite do? They oppose it. The member for Dunkley comes in here parading himself as some friend of small business. ",121
262,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"Mr ShamWow-there he is with this false pretence that he will help small business. This week was a week of distractions. Yesterday the press gallery was in a state of confusion. I come from the great state of New South Wales. Mr O'Farrell, Premier of New South Wales, was deaf to the concerns about the drive-by shootings that have been happening in Western Sydney. I am happy to be corrected on this, but I thought there were about 60 drive-by shootings in the space of a year. We never saw anything, but all of a sudden yesterday the opposition discovered its concern for this issue. ",121
263,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"The AFP successfully intervened, Customs successfully intervened and those opposite were suddenly concerned about it. The press gallery was wondering where this all came from. The greatest smuggling act yesterday was these guys smuggling their embarrassment through distraction. What they tried to do yesterday was confect concern about something that we had been worried about for ages. The New South Wales government never did anything. The New South Wales government need to have something that can distract them from their problems with casinos in New South Wales. And you needed a distraction from the fact that you were not there to support business in this country because you announced you were putting your own interests above business interests. At least we stand up for the people that you always point out we represent: the union movement. You do not. The guys opposite fail to stand up for their own, the ones they claim they represent. Look at the suite of policies that we have put in since 2007, all the things we have been doing. I have mentioned the asset tax write-off. I have mentioned the corporate tax cuts we are trying to make. We are providing a head start for small companies on the company tax rate, which you will deny through your actions in parliament. Businesses that operate as sole traders, partnerships and trusts will benefit from the next round of personal income tax cuts, which start in July this year. We have reduced quarterly pay-as-you-go income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for taxpayers using the GDP adjustment method, providing $700 million as a cash flow benefit to small business. Huge. Those are the types of things that we are doing. The New Enterprise Incentives Scheme is a program that helps eligible social security recipients to get into self-employment, to get into small business, giving them a start. Look at the types of things that we on side of the fence are doing to help small business but that are opposed by those opposite every single step of the way. They are not interested in jobs. Today demonstrated it. They were more interested in providing a job for someone they did not want to give a job to themselves. They were concerned that the former Treasurer and member for Higgins was not going to get the plum job at the Future Fund. Yet they would not even put him in as leader of their own party. That is what they are concerned about in this place. They are not concerned about the jobs created by small businesses. They are not concerned about the policies that we are putting forward that support small business. It was remarkable, I have to say, to hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about Peter Costello, the former member for Higgins. He has now been lionised by those opposite after he was demonised when he was in the parliament. We had the situation where the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, was saying that the member for Higgins as Treasurer alone was responsible for two million jobs being created. Those opposite were in power for 11 years and they created two million jobs, but we have nearly cracked one million in one parliamentary term. What was the former member for Higgins doing in what we are told were great times for the economy? Those opposite were not interested in creating jobs. They were not responsible for creating jobs. They made life hard for working people trying to draw a wage through what they did with Work Choices. On top of that they put huge burdens on small business. Where were they when small businesses were asking for help on trade practices reform? Missing in action. When small businesses were concerned about predatory pricing that was squeezing them out of this business or when small businesses were concerned about creeping acquisitions, I remember the member for Higgins resisting the calls for trade practices reform, sitting on reports that had been done, reports that called for that reform to occur to help small business, which did not want to be muscled out by big business. I congratulate those opposite. They have got form. They are always helping out those big interests in the economy: Clive Palmer, our national treasure, Gina Rinehart",121
264,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,123
265,Mr HUSIC,IMPORTANCE,"I know you love Gina. I am waiting for the T-shirts to sprout on the other side of the chamber. Back then, they were going slow on competition reform, slowing things down so that small businesses could not get ahead. I never heard you, Member for Dunkley, ever raise that. The other thing is that I have never seen the member for Dunkley be so concerned about the fact that those opposite, your side of politics, would deny those people a tax cut. You are an absolute disgrace to small business. (Time expired) Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (16:22): I am here to talk on the MPI on the adverse effects of the government on small business. I come from a small business background. Overall, the effect of the government is negative. There is a lot of uncertainty out there; there is a lack of direction from this government and this is confusing small business no end. There is absolutely no confidence out there in the field. People are preferring to put their money in the bank instead of investing in their business. Their business is industry for Australia and jobs for Australians.",123
266,Mr Randall,IMPORTANCE,"That's right. Mr O'DOWD: Under the Howard government, workers-my friends, your friends-had jobs. What is more, they had took a 20 per cent increase in pay versus the CPI. Under this government, since 2007",123
267,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,123
268,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The member for Flynn is not being assisted by his colleagues. The member for Flynn has the call. Mr O'DOWD: I think they are doing a great job. You cannot talk about small business without talking about big business, because a lot of small business works for big business. That is what you must consider. The week after the carbon tax was announced in this House, Rio Tinto, a big multinational company, put the Boyne smelter at Boyne Island on the market. It also put its 42 per cent share of the Gladstone power house on the market. This MPI is about small business, but I am saying that Rio Tinto employed 4,000 people in Gladstone and a lot of subcontractors, who are small",123
269,Mr Hartsuyker,IMPORTANCE,The government will turn Rio Tinto into a small business! Mr O'DOWD: That is right.,123
270,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,One person has the call: the member for Flynn. Mr O'DOWD: They talk about Clive Palmer; Clive Palmer is the man who saved a thousand jobs in Townsville at the zinc refinery. How many people does Gina Rinehart employ? The wind-back on the solar hot water scheme: does anybody in the government realise what that meant to those businesses that had geared up to look after that industry? It just flattened them-bang! Finished. Those opposite rave on about the BER. I could tell you something about the BER. There were four examples in my area where small business could have done the job of building the BER,123
271,Mr Billson,IMPORTANCE,Didn't get a look in. Mr O'DOWD: They did not get a look in. Do you know what? Their price was up to 50 per cent less.,123
272,Mr Hartsuyker,IMPORTANCE,"How much? Mr O'DOWD: $900,000 fromDr Mike Kelly: It does sound like ShamWow. Mr Bruce Scott: No, it's true. Mr O'DOWD: It is true. I have got the evidence. Actually, I have given the evidence to the Senate. Reed Constructions was a favoured son of this government. Where is it now? Where are the contractors-the subbies-going to get their money from? There is nearly $100 million owed to subbies. Where has the money gone? The overall cost of the BER was about $4,300 per square metre to build libraries and that type of thing. The price to build a four-bedroom home with a double carport is about $1,200 per square metre. Where did that money go? How come Reed Constructions is in administration? I do not know. Even the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011, which was discussed today in the House, is more red tape and more costs to small business. What small business hates is getting more bits of paper under their nose and being told: 'This is more regulation. You will do this; you will do that.' We have a taxation system. If you ring the tax office get clarity on a problem you might have, depending who you ring, you might get five different answers. If you ring five different times you get five different answers. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting Mr O'DOWD: Unbelievable! What was that? Mr Bruce Scott: Are they answered in Australia?",123
273,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Flynn has the call, and he is meant to be giving the speech. Mr O'DOWD: Would you control the House, please!",124
274,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"I might save us all and sit you down, if you are not careful! Mr O'DOWD: The biggest problem affecting small business is productivity. Our productivity is the worse in the world. Dr Mike Kelly interjecting Mr O'DOWD: You laugh, Member for Eden-Monaro, you clown: it is the worse in the world.",124
275,The SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The honourable member will withdraw the use of that term.,124
276,Mr Randall,IMPORTANCE,Is 'clown' unparliamentary?,124
277,The SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"It is all about the context. Mr O'DOWD: I will withdraw, Mr Speaker. Small business is faced with a renewable energy tax. That was passed by both sides of the House, but it will have a big impact on business. It will add at least 10 per cent to costs, and that is before the carbon tax. The carbon tax has been well documented and talked about. Not only will it affect the 500 biggest polluters in Australia, those awful big companies that we used to encourage to come to Australia and to set up their businesses, it will affect every man, woman and child in Australia. Make no mistake about that. It is not just going to affect the 500. IR laws are inflexible. That is why you are flat out getting a cup of coffee on a Saturday or a Sunday. From five o'clock on a Friday afternoon until eight o'clock Monday morning, you will pay dearly if you want a cup of coffee anywhere in Australia. We have a tourism industry. And guess what? Tourism does not really start until after five o'clock on any day of the week. Yet the laws are that stringent and that tough; there is no bending them. Mr Bruce Scott: There are penalties everywhere. Mr O'DOWD: Yes, there are penalties everywhere. (Time expired) The SPEAKER (16:30): Regrettable though it is, the time allotted for this discussion has now expired. NA The SPEAKER (16:30): Order! It being past 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. South Australia: Weapons  Opposition Business) (16:30): I rise on the adjournment on a very serious matter that is afflicting not just Adelaide but towns across Australia, and that is the illegal importation of weapons. This is an issue that the opposition raised in question time yesterday. It is very important in the adjournment that we explain that this problem, which occurred at Sylvania Waters Post Office-the arrival of illegally imported weapons and those weapons then being used in the street fighting in Sydney-is not only a Sydney issue. It is very much an issue in Adelaide and in the rest of the country. But, as a South Australian member, my remarks are going to be about South Australia. Stephen Pallaras, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Adelaide, only recently was bemoaning the level of violence, the level of lawlessness, that exists on the streets of Adelaide. He said: … the level of violence in terms of the bikie violence has been escalating to a point where we are losing our sensitivity to these events … Unfortunately that is true. Over the last few months and in the last 12 months there have been at least 12 drive-by shootings in the city of Adelaide. But there have also been gunfights in the last two or three months in Adelaide. On 16 January, a gunfight broke out between members of rival bikie gangs in a crowded hotel, the Findon Hotel, in the western suburbs of Adelaide. On 18 December a gunfight broke out at Caffe Order! Paesano-a noted eatery in North Adelaide, in O'Connell Street-filled as it was, after Carols by Candlelight, with families and innocent South Australians simply going about their business. The place was riddled with the bullets of two rival bikie gangs. Nobody was killed but others have been killed in this bikie war that is occurring in my city. of As recently as a month ago, one of my own constituents, Giovanni Focarelli, was murdered in a bikie gunfight in the north of the city, and his father was very badly wounded. In fact, his father has been wounded and hospitalised numerous times over recent months. While I certainly do not defend the Focarelli family, sadly, after that gunfight, nobody who was present at it was able to help the police in their inquiries with bringing the perpetrators of that murder to justice. Unfortunately, the streets of Adelaide are becoming more like the streets of Gotham City or the shoot-out at the OK Corral. Today I bemoan the fact that there is a causal link between the policies of this government and the bikie wars that are occurring in South Australia and also the organised gangland warfare that is going on in other parts of the country. There is a direct causal link, because this government made the decision to cut the Customs budget by $60 million. It made the decision to get rid of 340 staff; they were axed from the Customs department. At the same time, the government has increased spending by at least $1 billion to stop boats with illegal arrivals coming to Australia. That money would never have been needed to be spent if the government had simply kept the policies of the Howard government in place, which had stopped the boats. The government changed that policy in August 2008 and since that time there has been a massive blow-out in the immigration budget. The government has found some savings in the Customs budget to fill that hole by removing staff from Customs. So Customs and Border Protection have been unable to detect the incoming illegal weapons that are being used in the warfare that is occurring around Australia and in my city of Adelaide. So there is a direct causal link between this government's reprehensible policy decision-making process and the safety of Australians. South Australians are being placed at risk by this government's very bad decisions. We know that the number of scannings of air cargo inspections have dropped by 75 per cent and the scannings of sea cargo inspections have dropped by 25 per cent since the government introduced those cuts. The government stands condemned. For the first time in my 19 years in parliament, constituents are coming to see me because they are concerned about their safety and that of their families due to the lawlessness that now infects the streets of Adelaide. Adelaide is too beautiful a place to have been placed in this position, and the government is responsible for part of it. (Time expired) St Patrick's Day International Women's Day",124
278,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak on the advent of St Patrick's Day; it is about to happen. This is a great weekend for all Irish men and women across the globe-the Irish diaspora. It is a great weekend for all the Irish-Australians in our community, who amount to about 10 per cent of the Australian population. It is a great day for all those people whom my father would describe as 'wish they were Irish', certainly on St Patrick's Day. I am sure that they will get out and enjoy it tremendously. St Patrick's Day is the day on which the Irish recall the patron saint St Patrick, who, using a small clover-like plant, the shamrock, attempted to explain the concept of the Trinity. St Patrick's Day is honoured in a great mass at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney every year, and I am sure people will be there on Saturday to enjoy it. The biggest celebrations in Sydney for St Patrick's Day have been going on for nearly 30 years. And I am pleased to say that I was at those very early St Patrick's Day celebrations. This year 30,000 people are expected to attend the parade. Something very different is happening this year. There will be pre-parade entertainment in George Street, opposite the town hall. From about 10.20 in the morning people will be able to wear the green, sing the songs, and dance the dances. And I am sure that later on, as the afternoon moves on and the parade heads up to Hyde Park, there will be a bit of drinking of the Guinness, as well! The Irish Echo will no doubt have photographers out there and will cover the event as they do, so wonderfully, every year. I want to commend Billy Cantwell for the way he tells stories of Ireland for Irish Australians and stories of Australia for Irish Australians and records forever the history of that great community in this country. Amongst those who will be celebrating, no doubt, will be the new Irish Ambassador to Australia, Noel White, whom I look forward to meeting over this weekend, and, of course, Orla Tunney, who is the current charge d'affaires and was in that role until the new ambassador arrived to spend some time with us here. The Irish people are very aware of the great diaspora. Mary Robinson's very symbolic placing of the candle in the window of Aras an Uachtarain, the house in which the President resides in Ireland, is an indication of how the Irish people have spread out across the world over the years. We know that the Celtic tiger might not be quite roaring anymore and that there are, sadly, many more young Irish people leaving their shores to head off and look for work in other contexts, but around the globe the Irish people understand how important it is that this day is a day where we come together as people of Irish heritage to celebrate the best of that culture that has travelled across the world. This year I am very pleased to say that the Irish government have sent the Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, to spend time with us here in Australia. The parades that happen around the world are quite legendary: Dublin, New York, Boston, London and Sydney make the list of the top five. So I am certainly looking forward to this weekend and I encourage all those people who are Irish, or would like to be for at least one day per year, to get out and enjoy those Congratulations to all the volunteers who pull it together. It is quite a feat to something for 30,000 people. In the time that remains to me I would also like to put on the record the incredible work that has gone on in my community over the last couple of weeks to honour International Women's Day, which was celebrated for the 101st time. We certainly have a long way to go. Women comprise 70 per cent of the world's poor and own only 10 per cent of the world's wealth and one per cent of the world's property. Without education, that is going to remain the case. I am pleased to say that there were many young women engaged in education in my local schools, from Lisarow High School, Gosford High School, Narara Valley High and St Josephs Catholic College at East Gosford, who attended the International Women's Day march. It was rained out but, very appropriately, we ended up under cover in a shopping centre. There were a great number of speeches and performances by the girls from those schools. I congratulate Vicki Scott, who won an award for her work for women and setting up the first status of women committee in New South Wales within the council. I also acknowledge Anne Sheehan, Gina Jeffreys and Pauline Masters, who were guest speakers and convenors of the Soroptimist International breakfast attended by a couple of hundred people at the Reef restaurant at Terrigal on Sunday. I also acknowledge the continuing work in great community education and engagement that happens at the Avoca Beach Picture Theatre. It is a wonderful little boutique theatre on the Central Coast run by Beth and Norman Hunter, who showed a fantastic film that was very well attended by local men and women. The film dealt with issues that women celebrations. currently face. I acknowledge the great effort of all those prepare people in the community and wish everybody a very happy St Patrick's Day. World War II",126
279,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to speak on a significant anniversary that has been largely overlooked this week. Yesterday marked 70 years since the Japanese bombed Horn Island, in the Torres Strait, during their attempted invasion in World War II. I wish to speak on the vital role of the Torres Strait in the defence of the nation against these Japanese attacks. The air raids at that time on other centres, including Darwin, Broome, Port Hedland and Townsville, have been widely remembered, but Horn Island barely rates a mention in articles about World War II. The first raid occurred at approximately 11.25 am on 14 March 1942. Horn Island at the time was a key operational air base for American and Australian forces pushing forward to Papua New Guinea. But the island was vulnerable and undermanned. Twelve Japanese Betty bombers and eight Zero fighters in formation were spotted heading to the Torres Strait by coast watchers in southern Papua New Guinea. The coast watchers radioed RAAF on Thursday Island to alert them, so troops on the island received a warning of the impending attack. The Betty bombers are reported to have dropped 78 60-kilo bombs on the island and the Zeros strafed the airfield. Forces on Horn Island could only respond with seven US Kittyhawks yet they still managed to repel the attack and no-one on the ground was killed. Second Lieutenant AT House of the 7th Pursuit Squadron brought down a Japanese Zero. He saw another Zero targeting his commanding officer, Captain Bob Morrissey. Second Lieutenant House's guns jammed so he deliberately drove his right wing tip into the Zero's cockpit, bringing it down and saving his squadron leader's life. Somehow, Second Lieutenant House managed to land his damaged plane at about 300 kilometres an hour. This was the first of eight Japanese air raids on Horn Island over the next 16 months, making it the second most attacked place in Australia, after Darwin. In that time about 500 bombs were dropped on the airfield and about 156 lives were lost. There are still about 36 bomb craters on the island. By the end of 1942, about 5,000 troops were stationed on Horn Island, with an additional 2,000 on Thursday Island. From December 1941 to December 1942, 10,000 Allied aircraft landed on Horn Island. Another military service provided in this area was the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion, which comprised about 830 local Torres Strait Islanders-virtually the entire population of adult males in the region. This battalion was one of the least recognised military groups in Australia. Only about 10 years ago, I and a local historian, Vanessa Seekee, were successful in getting members of this group star medals to acknowledge their vital service. Vanessa Seekee and I are continuing to campaign on this. There are other veterans who have served in that region and we are desperately trying to get official recognition for their service in this zone, so at least they can get that recognition and some entitlement before they pass away. There were 97 Japanese air raids reported in that Northern Australian region during World War II. As a point of interest aside from the Horn Island bombings, and this is a little known fact, on 31 July 1942 Mossman, just north of Port Douglas and north of Cairns, was bombed by Japanese SubLieutenant Mizukura. He was thinking he was attacking Cairns. Mizukura dropped eight bombs on a farmhouse north of Mossman. A young child, 2½-year-old Carmel Zullo, was in the house asleep at the time. While she did receive some shrapnel wounds, fortunately they were not life threatening. She has the interesting distinction of being the only one who was actually bombed in our region at that time. I am sure not many people are aware of that. So I think when we remember the significance of people in Australia's defence against the Japanese in World War II we should not underestimate the services of the people of the Torres Strait and the sacrifices that they made in defending our nation. Economy: Shipping Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (16:46): A strong economy needs a strong shipping industry. Indeed, an island trading nation like Australia most certainly needs a strong shipping industry and a strong maritime workforce. It has been a part of our history and it is essential that it be a part our future, but we have some unique challenges. Our geographic location, off the major trading routes and with dispersed trading ports, affects the economics of our shipping industry. We also have an ageing workforce. It is a highly skilled workforce. It cannot be replaced overnight. It is a workforce that cannot be turned on and off like a tap. That is why the government has embarked on a robust reform program to regenerate Australia's shipping industry. The reforms will rebuild our nation's shipping industry and will help attract shipping investment in Australia. And these reforms will provide a new framework for revitalising domestic shipping and protecting it in the long term. They are the key to revitalising Australian shipping. Rebuilding an industry that has been allowed to decline is a difficult task. There are four key elements to the Labor government's shipping industry reform package. The first is tax reform to encourage investment in new and more efficient ships to enhance the industry's productivity, including a zero tax rate and a seafarer tax exemption. The second element includes an Australian international shipping register to help grow our international fleet. The third is a new licensing regime to provide clarity and transparency to enable long-term planning and to set clear boundaries around the necessary role of foreign vessels in our coastal shipping trade. Finally and critically, there is the establishment of a maritime workforce development forum to progress training and to help us build the highly skilled maritime workforce of the future. In relation to each of these four initiatives, I congratulate the Maritime Union of Australia for its work in cooperation with the government and I particularly refer to those of officials and members of the union from Port Kembla in my electorate of Throsby. We know that we need a package of reforms, because no single measure alone can help to revitalise the shipping industry. Workforce skills and training are one of the biggest challenges facing the industry. As I said, we have an ageing workforce and at the same time our need for highly skilled seafarers is growing rapidly as our shipping traffic increases. Many newspapers today are carrying a story based on a Deloitte Access Economics report. They include my local paper, the Illawarra Mercury. The conclusions in the Deloitte Access Economics report are wrong and therefore the newspaper reports that reported these conclusions as facts are also wrong. The report is factually incorrect in regard to the operation of the new licensing system. The Deloitte Access Economics modelling is based on the assumption that all temporary licences will be phased out over five years and that all coastal cargo will be carried on Australian licensed vessels. This has never been suggested at any time by the government. There are no plans to restrict the number of foreign vessels in Australian waters. The reforms are simply about levelling the playing field for Australian ships so they can better compete. The second area on which the reports are wrong goes to the issue of wages. Foreign ships operating on the Australian coast already have to pay Australian wages. The government's shipping reforms do not change this at all. The Labor government believes that all seafarers working on vessels in Australian waters should have the benefit of Australian workplace relations laws and a fair safety net of employment conditions. The Howard government excluded foreign ships from protection under Australian laws. This allowed foreign seafarers working in Australian waters to be paid significantly less than Australian employees performing work on the same routes. This is the equivalent of allowing foreign workers to come to Australia on 457 visas but not requiring that they are paid the same minimum entitlements as Australian workers. Quite simply, we on this side of the House think this is wrong and unfair and that is the reason we are introducing this package of reforms. As well as being unfair, this is disincentive to employ Australian crew. We are delivering, in this package of reforms, the future prosperity of the nation for working Australians, ensuring that we have an industry-and a workforce within that industry-to carry the trade that we so much rely on. 2012 Tribute to Northern Territory Women Burke, Mrs Annette Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (16:51): As the first female federal member for Solomon",127
280,Mr Randall,ADJOURNMENT,"Hear, hear! Mrs GRIGGS: thank you-it gives me great pleasure when I get the opportunity to recognise the remarkable achievements of Northern Territory women in my electorate. Last week many women across the Territory came together to celebrate International Women's Day. Each year, on the eve of this annual event, outstanding NT women are recognised in the Tribute to Northern Territory Women, which is an award that recognises and celebrates the achievements of women who have made, or are making, a significant contribution to the Territory community. This year Jane Tye, Stephanie Thompson Nganpmirra and Vicki Shultz were honoured and I take the opportunity to congratulate each recipient on their outstanding commitment and dedication to the wider Territory community. These women are indeed worthy of this recognition and each has contributed a great deal to the Northern Territory in her own right. Having said this, though, I am disappointed to have heard that former Palmerston Mayor and fellow Territorian Annette Burke was overlooked as a recipient. Up until now the smallest number of women recognised on record since the awards were established in 2003 was actually four. This a belies the claim in a letter that Mrs Burke's nominee received explaining that she was not successful because 'the response to the Tribute this year had been excellent and the panel's task in recommending the women was made difficult by the quality of nominations received'. Annette Burke has been an esteemed leader of the Top End community for more than 14 years. In 1998, Annette was elected Mayor of Palmerston and went on to win three consecutive elections for mayor, gaining 75 per cent of the vote. We here know how hard that is. Clearly, she was doing something right. She firmly believed that the council was about more than just the 3Rs of rates, roads and rubbish. She believed the council also needed to incorporate relationships-with the community, other councils, investors and businesses. As mayor, Annette led the City of Palmerston during a period of rapid development and population increase. She engaged the council to participate in numerous national community programs, resulting in the City of Palmerston winning several prestigious awards. By 2005, the City of Palmerston was rated the second most liveable community in Australia and eighth out of the top 10 most sustainable communities in the annual national State of the Regions report. Annette was also personally selected by former Prime Minister, John Howard, to be a member of his 15-people task force to develop drug and alcohol awareness programs throughout Australia and was requested to be a member of a special committee to develop strategies to encourage more female participation in all levels of government. She established and supervised various council subcommittees and lobbied the government to enhance opportunities for investment and further economic and social growth for Palmerston. Founding committees was one of her many specialties, and Annette boasts the Adopt A Park program, the first Crime Prevention Northern Territory Committee, the Seniors' Advisory Committee and the Palmerston Futures program to increase retention rates for students, just to name a few, as her achievements. I live in Palmerston and I acknowledge the hard work that Annette put into our community. In fact, Annette is one of the reasons why I entered politics because she encouraged me to stand for local government. Above all, Annette is a mentor, a leader and an effective communicator and was admired by all of her fellow councillors, staff and the wider community during her time on the Palmerston council. She was and still is a big supporter and mentor of mine and I am grateful to her for her guidance friendship. So this is why I was disappointed that Annette was overlooked for a 2012 Tribute to Northern Territory Women award. Surely Annette's achievements speak for themselves. I firmly believe Annette greatly enhanced and improved the lives of Palmerston residents during her nine years mayor and four years as an alderman. Also, while Annette was mayor she managed to do a fantastic job as a mother, raising two boys while her husband was the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Surely it is not a because of her political persuasion that she was not given the acknowledgment of the 2012 Tribute to Northern Territory Women award, so I take it upon myself to make this tribute to Annette. Well done, Annette. You are my hero and here is my tribute to you. (Time expired) Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra",130
281,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on the work you have undertaken this week in this House. Recently I was fortunate enough to attend a fantastic event in my electorate of Bass: Symphony under the Stars, performed by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. This free concert is a great opportunity to hear worldclass classical music in the beautiful setting of Launceston's historic City Park. I must say that having a picnic in your local park to the sounds of a live, internationally acclaimed symphony orchestra is quite an experience. I was thrilled to see so many families from the Launceston community enjoying the concert. In particular, pieces such as Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers, Claire de Lune and, my personal favourite, the William Tell Overture were very popular with the crowd. I spoke to many audience members who commented on what a lovely evening they were having and how fantastic it was have the award-winning TSO perform a free and concert right in the heart of Launceston. I would like to thank the RACT for their sponsorship and making this event possible. For people who may not get to regularly experience classical music, the Symphony under the Stars performance is certainly an eye-opening event. I can agree with the as sentiments of the TSO's chief conductor and artistic director, Marko Letonja, who believes: The best way to hear the TSO is to hear it live. Classical music is meant for live performance ... and that is where it works its magic best. Anything else is but a mere shadow of the real experience. Founded in 1948, the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra has become Tasmania's flagship performing arts organisation. Resident in Hobart's purpose-built Federation Concert Hall, the TSO has a full complement of 47 musicians. The orchestra contributes significantly to Tasmania's arts and culture and in return enjoys considerable support from the local community. Regular concerts are presented in Hobart and Launceston, and often the TSO will tour other regions of the state. The TSO also enjoys international recognition and has toured in North and South America, Greece, Israel, South Korea, China, Indonesia and Japan. It is one of Australia's most recorded orchestras and has performed with artists such as Rhonda Burchmore, Kate Ceberano, James Morrison, Natalie Cole and The Whitlams. The Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra aims to be a source of pride for all Tasmanians, performing a wide variety of music. Symphony under the Stars is just one event that ensures the TSO and classical music remains available to the broader Tasmanian community. Upcoming performances, such the family concert series, featuring interactive shows, storytelling and movie music, will continue this tradition. Indeed, I would encourage all Tasmanians to go along and see one of the many TSO concerts that are planned for the 2012 performance season. Launceston, in my electorate of Bass, is lucky enough to host a six-concert series featuring conductors and soloists performing symphonies, concertos, tone poems and overtures. Mr Speaker, I invite you, and all members of parliament, to plan a visit to the beautiful city of Launceston in the coming year to take in one of these performances. This series includes Isabelle Faust, one of the most distinguished violinists of her generation, playing Beethoven's Violin Concerto and The Last Night of the Proms, a celebration of all things British, in which the TSO will deliver the grandeur, patriotism and passion of the finale of London's famous Proms concert. It will also showcase multiaward-winning saxophonist and former Young Australian of the Year, Amy Dickson, performing Full Moon Dances, a concerto written especially for her. The year 2012 is a particularly exciting year for the TSO as they welcome Marko Letonja as their new conductor and artistic director. Marko has conducted the Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony, the Munich Philharmonic, the Hamburg Symphony and the Melbourne Symphony, among others. Hailed by critics and audiences throughout Europe, it is tremendous to see Marko bring his unique classical style to the TSO. If residents or visitors to Tasmania get the chance to see the TSO perform, I would urge them to jump at it. For an orchestra that is so well-known internationally, it remains something of a hidden gem in its own state. Again, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to the fantastic Symphony under the Stars. I would also like to sincerely thank the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra for their contribution to the state. They are truly a symbol of the talent and culture that Tasmania has to offer.

297,Mr SIMPKINS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I certainly speak on the Classification (Publications, Computer Games) Bill 2012. I join with all much needed reform, and we certainly look forward so that we can have greater confidence as we confidence that the young people and, in fact, and, in appropriate cases, properly protected that abounds in the world at this point. A common theme when I go around and speak electorate of Cowan, and senior classes, is that industry. When we see the figure of $2.5 billion by the computer game industry by 2015, it is see that there are young people so keen to get there are a fairly large number of computer the country. When Apple informs us that they games to be registered with them, it really people are willing to satisfy supply. That being said, it is a little bit of a mystery of the games that are produced. There are produced that have sexual content, which I really does come as a surprise that there is demand bit more about the differences between MA15+, would say is that greater protection, greater overdue in all cases with regard to such games. It is the case that, when this country has have been substantiated allegations that there said, shoehorned into that category. Possibly the categorisation. Some games that we might accessed by those 15 years and above have course have been refused classification, and legislation is that, for games that I think and above only, we will have the opportunity imagine. Also, where some of these games have those that would have had R18+ classification down into the MA15+, but again with material quite concerning, there will be the ability R18+ classification. That is most definitely a good thing. NA and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012 Second Reading welcome the opportunity this morning to Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ members of the House in agreeing that this is to the elements of this bill taking effect carry on into the future. We would have greater the adults of this country are properly advised from some of the online computer game content particularly to primary school classes in the so many young people are keen to get into this that is likely to be generated in the economy not a surprise, particularly for those of us who into the industry to create games. As we know, game laboratories generating these games around get upwards of 20,000 applications a month for does show that there is certainly demand and to me why some people are interested in some extremely violent games and there are games think many people would have objections to. It for such games. Whilst I will speak a little R18+ and refused classification, what I knowledge and greater information is long had the highest classification of MA15+, there are some games that have been, as has been there has been a bit of a liberal interpretation of think should not ordinarily be allowed to be actually made it into that category. Others of I think that is good. What we will have with this were MA15+ but probably should have been adult 18 to push those sort of games upwards, I would had slight modifications made to them so that in others parts of the world have been dragged in them that I think a lot of people would find to look again at those games and push them into With regard to the classification of restricted sale, hire, display, advertisement and, in overall with two girls, aged 13 and nine, who are into might have those classifications. I suspect categorisation above G. Angry Birds may be a sort of category. I certainly hope that we anything worse than that in my house. But it is parents on computer games through this legislation certainly do ring when you are a parent and and there is a difference between seeing transposed over to computer games, if parents rightly concerned and should certainly examine attempting to buy such video games or they It does, however, still come down to vigilance an eye on what is going on, so they can look find their children possess those games in their dealt with. But, as we also know through the has been particularly noted by a House committee actually young adults, I would say-around happen to be women now. What we are dealing comes down to adults being able to make informed that should certainly be the case. But I would on those under 18 and what is in their possession This legislation brings us into line with bizarre that we have not had a classification. MA15+ or refused classification, but there out as being different from the rest of the Western R18+ classification, and I certainly welcome standards. It is a very important step forward. I think controversial, and that is why we see it here while there is the provision in the bill that its having been classified, it is important currently rated MA15+, they consider trying would be a positive step forward. Currently concerning and not appropriate for those reviewed, and this legislation will allow that authorities should not be afraid of refusing point of classification. There are some really there that I think should still be refused classification, that. I welcome the introduction of this bill into the classification R18+ adding some real value and help for parents and gamers across Australia. 18+, what we will see is the restriction of terms, warnings to parents.

That is consistent with international we will see that this is legislation which is nonin the Federation Chamber.

At the same time the classifying classification where the content is beyond the bizarre levels of violence and sexual content out and most people probably agree with the House.

As many of these young people did the games themselves. The present regime is no longer the sole domain of young people. Association estimates 55 per cent of gamers now 30 years old.

So you can back to that game later because it is absolutely reflects in a sense our nation's growing up. and as the member for Pearce reflected upon in games were seen as the domain of children and matured so too did their taste in games and so fails to take into account that computer gaming The Interactive Games and Entertainment are now over the age of 18 and the average age is of how far things have come, look at how many members of parliament will actually speak in MPs will be devoting some part of If we are going to talk about declaring birthday my wife bought me a Kinect, which diversity as consoles change, and you have all things to keep people who are older opportunity to read a really novel book by for You, which reflects on movements in popular us as people.

Far from being a system games, it is enabling them to do just that. Auto and those sorts of games. That will play sorts of things.

I also spoke this bill and about the impact, from his retailers. This is only allowing stores to give for business.
