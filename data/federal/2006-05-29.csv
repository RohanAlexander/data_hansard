2,Mrs DRAPER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Publications, I present the committee's report entitled Distribution of the parliamentary papers series, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",19
3,Mrs DRAPER,COMMITTEES,"As chair of the committee it gives me great pleasure to present to the parliament the Joint Committee on Publications report titled Distribution of the parliamentary papers series, May 2006, to give a brief overview of the committee's work over the past year and to outline to the House several key recommendations of the 23 recommendations in the body of the report. I would like to acknowledge my parliamentary colleagues and other members of the committee, the chair of the Senate committee Senator John Watson, and deputy chair of the House of Representatives committee, the honourable member for Lyons, and honourable members for Braddon, Isaacs, Werriwa, Riverina and Ryan, as well as Senators Johnston, Marshall, Nash, Polley, Sterle and Wortley for their worthy contributions and efforts in compiling this important report. Also, I would like to acknowledge the Secretary of the House of Representatives Committee, Mr Jason Sherd, the Secretary of the Senate Publications Committee, Ms Jan Chapman, and the documents manager, Ms Vicki Bradley, for their hard work, professionalism and patience and recognise their support and involvement throughout the committee process. I would also like to acknowledge and thank former committee members, the members for Paterson and Chifley and Senators Kirk, Moore and Scullion. The terms of reference were to inquire and report on the distribution of the parliamentary papers series, with particular reference to the potential impact of changes to the distribution of the PPS made by the Presiding Officers, mainly the tightening of the eligibility guidelines and the cessation of blister packs to commence on 1 January 2006; the provision of the PPS in a digital format, either as an alternative or an adjunct to the hard copy series; the feasibility of a subscription service, either in digital or hard copy form; and the possibility of partial or full cost recovery for the series. Mr Speaker, as you are aware, many documents are presented to the parliament each year; some are required to be presented by law, others may just be presented for the general information of members. These documents include the annual reports of all government agencies, reports of royal commissions and other government inquiries, parliamentary committee reports and a wide variety of other material. Whilst these documents assist with good and accountable governance, only documents of a substantial nature are included in the parliamentary papers series. Those documents not already ordered to be included in the PPS by the parliament are later considered by the publications committees, which have the role of making a recommendation to the parliament for their inclusion in the PPS. Mr Speaker, as you are aware, the PPS is then distributed to organisations such as state, publicly funded university or parliamentary libraries and is available throughout Australia for use by students, researchers and other sections of the public. It is fair to say that the PPS plays a major role in the governance practices of all government agencies and the parliament and is integral to an open and democratic system of government such as ours. But, most importantly, the PPS provides a historic record for future generations. The Publications Committee has existed since 1970 and since its inception has only specifically reported on the parliamentary papers series four times-the last time being in 1997. The committee in 2006 has recommended that the eligibility criteria be broadened to include Commonwealth departmental libraries and that all recipients of the are regularly monitored to ascertain their wish to continue receiving parliamentary papers. The committee has recognised the popularity of electronic copies and the benefits this provides for accessibility; thus, the committee recommends the Australian Government Information Management Office continue to ensure that all government documents are permanently available online and that where possible any digital versions augment the hard copy PPS. Whilst the committee acknowledges the advances in technology and its availability, it was not comfortable recommending it as a replacement of the hard copy series due to the inconclusive evidence of the reliability of tal copies and the concerns arising from this record-keeping format. The committee has also recommended that historic documents should be made available online and has requested the Department of the House of Representatives investigate the digital imaging of House committee reports from 1901 to 1996 to complement the Department of the Senate's digital imaging project. I commend this report to the House. (Time expired)",19
4,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"The member for Makin has touched on the role of the Publications Committee and the main thrust of the recommendations. Mr Speaker, as you will see from the contents of the report, Distribution of the parliamentary papers series, this committee has played a very important role in reviewing the process by which information can be relayed to the community at large, allowing everybody an opportunity to have access to the parliamentary process. The need for the report is because of tightening of the distribution of the parliamentary papers series. Mr Speaker, you would be aware of that. There was a false PPS expectation that the parliamentary papers series need be available only in a digital rather than in a hard copy format, thinking that it would allow access to the papers just as easily, and therefore we could reduce costs by reducing hard copies. This is certainly a simplistic view and too premature. It is important that the general public have access to these papers, so there needs to be a structure whereby papers can be put together in a less unstructured way. The cost of the retention of hard copies is usually small and there is not enough depth in the process with the digital electronic format. The important point is that those who receive the hard copies are usually the ones who set up the access for electronic copies. digi- The committee found from a departmental website that, as soon as this year's report goes on, last year's report comes off in most areas, thereby removing the link. So there is a need for national, state and parliamentary libraries to have an ongoing point of reference. There also needs to be more links and the ability to keep some continuity in the papers so that people can find the papers in the system. Recommendation 1 deals with Commonwealth departmental libraries not receiving hard copies and therefore not keeping a full series of papers. There is no doubt that there needs to be work done on departments that get their information together two years late. We received evidence that one department was up to three years late on one occasion. We need to make sure that those agencies receive a little bit more attention. Recommendations 12 and 14 deal with the issue of some documents which just do not turn up-usually the controversial onesand therefore are not available to the public. It is thought that there is a need to ensure they are available and in a timely fashion. Recommendation 16 shows the importance of having website links from each agency so that all documents that are presented to parliament are available as public documents. The committee became aware of the need to develop an online digital repository for the parliamentary papers series, with someone in charge to monitor and catalogue all papers that are in the system and make them available within a reasonable time period. This is reflected in recommendation 19. With cost always a consideration for good governance, recommendation 20 of the committee looks at the Senate's digital imaging project and asks the House of Representatives to investigate similar digital imaging of all documents, going back to all of the House's committee reports which have been presented from 1901 up to 1996, to make sure that they are available online. This is a large part of the Australian historical democratic process of the parliament at work which the public needs to have easy access to, using our modern technology. How can young people engage with the parliamentary process without having the links available at these documents? I think it is very necessary for these things to occur. I thank the chair and other members of the committee who have served with us, and particularly thank Jason Sherd and his assistants for putting all this together. I hope the Presiding Officers and our good clerks will give this report the consideration that it needs. It is a very important report and I look forward to speedy consideration of it.",20

9,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 74-Treaty tabled on 28 March 2006: agreement for establishment to look of the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",21
10,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"Report 74 contains the findings and recommendation of the review of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties of the agreement for the establishment of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, tabled in parliament on 28 March 2006. The agreement for the establishment of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, although a separate legal instrument, will operate within the framework of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was reviewed in the 68th report of the committee and provides a binding international framework for the conservation, sustainable use and exchange of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture for global food security. The agreement, through the establishment of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, secures the long-term conservation aims of the international treaty through long-term funding. The agreement will provide for the establishment of a trust to finance gene bank conservation of crop genetic diversity. The focus of the trust will be to secure the future of key interare national collections under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research system. The trust is a public-private partnership that will be financed by voluntary contributions from North American and European corporations and private foundations. The permanent endowment will be $US260 million and will generate $US10 million to $US14 million annually for the maintenance of eligible national, regional and international gene banks or collections of crop diversity. While the majority of funding received in the early stages has come from national governments, the trust will shortly commence fundraising, concentrating on private sources. Australia has made the largest overall financial commitment to the trust of $A12.5 million. The government informed the committee that accession to the agreement would formalise Australia's involvement in line with its commitment to global crop diversity and complement Australia's interests in the international treaty. The committee has agreed to fast-track the review of this treaty, as on 6 April 2006 the Hon. Alexander Downer, Minister for Foreign Affairs, informed the committee that Australia is seeking to secure a position on the Executive Board of the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Further, the minister stated that Australia's position on the board would ensure appropriate consideration of Australia' s interests and that Australia's executive board campaign would be strengthened if Australia were in a position to become a party to the trust agreement at the time of the board's first meeting. The board's first meeting is scheduled to take place from 12 to 15 June 2006. I thank all members of the committee for facilitation of this speedy review. The executive board of the trust will have responsibility for the operation of the trust, control over its budget and ensure its policies in line with those of the international treaty. The committee was informed that Australia has taken a leading role in the establishment of the trust and its ongoing management and administration. Australia was elected Chair of the Donor's Council of the trust for an initial term of three years at the inaugural meeting of the council in October 2005. In this role, Australia is responsible for selecting four members of the executive board of the trust in the first half of 2006. As the parliament would be aware, the period for review of proposed category 1 treaty actions by JSCOT is 20 sitting days. The period of review for this treaty would have expired in mid-August, at which time the committee expects to report on seven other proposed treaty actions which were tabled on 28 March 2006. In considering this treaty action, the committee was concerned that only one other member of the Cairns Group was a member of this treaty. The committee was also concerned that there were no other developed countries such as the United States and Canada which Australia would benchmark itself against in the area of agricultural research that were also party to this agreement. The committee was also concerned that in our three-year review of the overarching treaty this trust agreement was not brought to its attention. However, in conclusion, on balance the committee does support Australia's campaign to seek a position on the executive board of the trust and believes that Australia's representation on the executive board will ensure appropriate consideration of Australia's interests at the upcoming meeting of the governing body of the international treaty. The committee therefore recommends that the treaty reviewed in report 74 be acceded to. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",21
11,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES,"Report 74 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties contains the review of the agreement for the establishment of the Global Crop Diversity Trust. The thrust of the agreement is to establish a permanent funding structure that will help maintain the genetic plant material held in the field and in gene banks. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture provides for the physical maintenance of genetic plant material for food and agriculture and was previously reviewed by the committee and appears in report 68. The committee received evidence that in the last 25 years there has been an accelerated decline in agricultural diversity due mainly to large increases in population and unsustainable practices affecting the natural environment. This situation has also negatively influenced the security and put these food sources at risk in the wild and in gene bank collections. The role of the 1,470 gene banks in existence is to conserve, manage and reproduce crop varieties and their related wild species, of which there are approximately 5.4 million samples in existence. Sixty-five per cent of gene banks are located in developing nations and receive annual funding. However, since 1996, around 60 per cent of funding for the world's gene banks has either decreased or remained static. It is recognised that genetic diversity is central to agricultural innovation and allows for the breeding of crops that will increase production and enhance the capacity to manage new and existing threats from pests, diseases, climate change and environmental degradation. As a major agricultural producer and plant breeder, Australia has a national interest in ensuring the maintenance of continued access to genetic material held in international gene banks. In addition to ensuring that Australia will have continued access to the genetic material held in international gene banks, the trust will complement Australia's aid program by reducing poverty and improving food security in developing partner countries. The committee received information that new varieties of highyielding crops secure export markets for agricultural produce and increase domestic and export earnings, thereby contributing to economic growth in a developing country. As a joint initiative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, the trust will provide technical and capacity-building assistance to enable collections of genetic resources to meet required standards and promote and assist in the development of a rational and efficient system of crop diversity conservation in gene banks of food sources internationally. An executive board, to which Australia has indicated its intention to join, will manage the trust with an annual budget of $US260 million and an annual turnover of between $US10 million to $US14 million. The Grains Research and Development Corporation of Australia has pledged $US5 million and the Australian government has pledged $US7.5 million to the trust. In its role as Chair of the Donor's Council, Australia is nominating a member of the inaugural executive board. Australia will also be responsible for selecting four members of the existing executive board of the trust by mid-2006. A number of Australian agencies support Australia's pursuit of a seat on the executive board. These include the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Grains Research and Development Corporation, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering Crawford Fund. The committee has indicated its support for Australia's pursuit of a position on the executive board of the trust, given the upcoming meeting of the organisation. However, the committee has indicated that it is concerned that it was not informed of the trust agreement during the course of its three-year review of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, which would have allowed for greater scrutiny of this agreement. The committee is further concerned that only one member of the Cairns Group of nations is involved in the treaty, given their importance to Australia. I commend the report to the House and again thank the secretariat for their ongoing work for the committee.",23

NA CHANGE (KYOTO PROTOCOL RATIFICATION) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Albanese.",24
15,Mr ALBANESE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Today I rise to once again introduce the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2006, which lapsed due to the government's unpreparedness to have a debate on this issue. If this bill is passed, the Australian government would be required to ratify the Kyoto protocol and become part of the global solution to the global challenge that is climate change. Climate change is real and it is happening right now. The last four years have seen an unprecedented rise in the global level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Chief Scientist of the Marine and Atmospheric Research Division of CSIRO recently reported that 2005 recorded the highest ever growth of artificial greenhouse gases, up by 5.3 per cent. CSIRO said that 2005 ‘was a record for increases in greenhouse gas heating-the main driver of increasing surface temperature'. Last year was the hottest year on record. We can already see the kinds of impacts that will only get worse as warming advances: the long-term drought in New South Wales, Kakadu being flooded by salt water and coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. The recent destruction caused by Cyclone Larry must also serve as a reminder of the kind of severe weather events that we must prepare for at home as our planet warms. If for no other reason than self-interest, Australia should immediately ratify the protocol and engage with the global effort to avoid dangerous climate change. If passed, this bill will require the Austrato lian government to do several things. First, it must ratify the protocol within 60 days of the commencement of the act. Second, it must ensure Australia meets its greenhouse emission target set out in the Kyoto protocol: 108 per cent of 1990 levels. Of industrialised countries, only Iceland has a higher target. Third, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage must develop a national climate change action plan setting out our national strategy for meeting our greenhouse emissions target. Fourth, the minister must establish an annual greenhouse gas inventory and publish the results. Fifth, the minister must also develop a framework for involvement in the international trading of carbon. This will include emissions trading but also clean development mechanism projects in developing countries and will make Australia eligible to participate in joint implementation projects under the protocol. Given that Australia is on track to meet our emissions target, there is absolutely no drawback to Australia ratifying Kyoto today. Last week the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory report of the Australian Greenhouse Office stated that greenhouse gas emissions from energy and transport sectors are spiralling. There has been a 34.7 per cent increase in emissions of 1990 levels from the energy sector; stationary energy, 43 per cent; and transport, 23.4 per cent. The reason we will be able to meet our target is that there has been a 72.5 per cent reduction in emissions, due to decisions to end land clearing by the Queensland and News South Wales Labor governments. It is only because of this action that Australia is on track to meet our Kyoto target. If you exclude land use changes, our overall greenhouse gas emissions increased by 25.1 per cent between 1990 and 2004-one of the most significant increases in the world. If passed, this bill would enable Australia be a part of the global market benefits harnessed by the other 158 countries which have ratified the protocol. A recent report by the Australia Institute confirms that the government's arguments for refusing to ratify the protocol are fundamentally flawed. Staying outside of Kyoto and not pricing carbon nor introducing emissions trading carries significant economic risk. The report confirms that the Howard government's policy locks Australia out of emerging carbon markets, retards the development of new, clean industries and fails to preserve the competitiveness of coal exports-this country's biggest earner-which will be subject to emissions policies and taxes of importing countries. The potential for innovation and business investment is immense. It is about providing the market based stimulus for the deployment and transfer of clean energy technologies, the transfer of which the International Energy Agency has estimated at $27.5 billion. Australian companies are being disadvantaged now and our technology is moving overseas to countries such as China. Just last month the Roaring 40s company announced a $300 million deal to provide three wind farms to China, at the same time as they withdrew from projects in South Australia and Tasmania. We need to ratify the Kyoto protocol in the interests of the economy, jobs and the environment. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",24
16,The SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Religious Minorities",26
17,Mr CADMAN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I ask leave of the House to amend notice No. 2, private members' business, in the terms circulated to honourable members. Leave granted.",26
18,Mr CADMAN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I move notice No. 2 as amended: That this House: (1) commends Australians of Greek and Turkish origin for the peaceful and harmonious relationship they have established in Australia which is an example to all communities coming from older cultures; (2) recognises, with appreciation, the past endeavours of the Hon. Bill Hayden and the current efforts of Australia's Special Envoy on Cyprus the Hon. Jim Short, and their contribution towards improving relationships between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities to bring about the reunification of the island of Cyprus; (3) requests the Government of the Republic of Turkey, as it moves towards joining the European Union as a full member, to: (a) return private property to minority groups of all religious backgrounds and to allow the freedoms of settlement and property throughout Cyprus; (b) permit the re-opening of the Greek Orthodox Theological College on the island of Halke; and (d) permit Christian denominations to operate seminaries of their own, whether Greek, Armenian or Syriac; and (4) encourage all parties, including the Turkish Government and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, to work together with the United Nations and the European Union to ensure a lasting solution in which all Cypriots enjoy the economic, political and security benefits of the EU in a united, democratic, just Cyprus. I have decided to amend my original motion in order not to involve the sensitivities of the Australian community, particularly those who arrived here from Turkey or Greece. Australia has a friendly relationship with Cyprus, Greece and Turkey, and that has been the case for a long time. We are conscious that we have made a very strong contribution to relieving the tensions within the Mediterranean and particularly within Cyprus. We want to pay tribute to two Australians who have assisted in the process. Since the invasion of northern Cyprus by Turkey in 1974, this issue has been a consistent, festering problem. It is a particular problem for religious groups, particularly the Orthodox Church, and for parties, people and families with properties in northern Cyprus. This is a wonderful opportunity for the government of the Republic of Turkey to take steps to resolve some of these issues. It has been a tradition for Australia-and currently we observe the Australian military in East Timor-to move in, resolve a problem and move out. If there were problems which caused or brought about the invasion in 1974, it is time that those matters are put aside and that the people of Cyprus, who lived in harmony, are once more given the opportunity of reunification. Nothing could be more opportune. Nothing could be more valuable. Nothing could enhance the reputation of Turkey more at the moment. Taking this step will ease Turkey's entry into Europe and enhance its global reputation for the treatment of minority groups. I wish to acknowledge the work that was done by the Hon. Bill Hayden some years ago and the work currently being done by the Hon. Jim Short. The representatives of the Cypriot and Turkish governments, of course, have been interested in this motion, and I wish to express my personal goodwill to the peoples from both of those countries who have settled in Australia. I encourage the Turkish parliament to pass the proposed reform of the Turkish foundation law and applaud the opportunity for Christian groups to resume the operation of their religious training centres, something that is dear to the hearts of all of those people in the region. (Time expired)",26
19,The SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,Is the motion seconded?,27
20,Mr BOWEN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I second the motion. Freedom of religion is a fundamental and inalienable right of every human being. There is an obligation on those of us in positions of influence to speak out for those who do not have that freedom and cannot speak out. However, we must always be careful to describe the situation in other jurisdictions accurately and in the proper context. There are issues related to religious freedom in Turkey. These cannot be doubted, and I will return to the details of these shortly. The issues in Turkey must be put in perspective, especially when compared to those in some neighbouring countries, for example. I am particularly concerned about the rights of Christians in Iraq, and I have spoken about this previously in the House. It is hard to conceive that the position of Christians in Iraq has actually deteriorated since the fall of Saddam Hussein. As a member of the coalition of the willing, this government has an obligation to speak up for Christians in Iraq. I am sorry to say that the government's response has been less than adequate, and I use the forum of this motion to again call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make representations at the highest possible level to ensure the protection of Assyrians, Chaldeans and Mandeans in Iraq. The government also needs to be doing more in relation to providing safe haven for Christians who have left Iraq. I again call on the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to review the way her department handles applications for refugee status from Christians and Mandeans who have fled Iraq. Let me now turn to the situation in Turkey in detail. It needs to be noted Turkey is a fiercely secular state and a democratic state. Despite the fact 99.8 per cent of the citizens of Turkey are Muslim, the Turkish constitution gives no special status to Islam. This is one of the legacies of the statesman Ataturk, who abolished the caliphate and modernised Turkey's administration. We should be building on these foundations. It would be very tempting for a nation like Turkey, with such an overwhelming Muslim majority and so close to nations like Iraq and Iran, to adopt Sharia law, but it is in fact the fierce secularism which has led to some of the problems with religious freedom in Turkey. It is Turkish national policy, for example, that women in public service are not allowed to wear the burkha or hijab in work time or on government premises, and also that women who wear these religious garments in private time not be promoted. That is not a policy, of course, that we would be comfortable with in Australia, despite the well-publicised views of some members opposite. There have been improvements in transparency and freedoms in Turkey as it continues to negotiate for its admission to the European Union. I note that this is referred to in the amended motion circulated by the honourable member for Mitchell. We need to be encouraging Turkey to build on these reforms. It is true that there is an ongoing dispute about the property of Christian churches and individuals. Turkish law allows the state to expropriate land when the size of a local non-Muslim community falls significantly. The United States Department of State also reports that the state has expropriated the properties of individuals who had left Turkey or died without heirs. All honourable members would join together in calling for this situation to be fixed. It is also important for the future that the wrongs of the past are acknowledged. I believe the Assyrian people, among others, have a legitimate concern to ensure that the terrible events of 1915 are properly acknowledged and commemorated. The Turkish people and the Assyrian people could then join together in the acknowledgment that we must all work together to ensure that such events can never happen again-just as the Turkish and Australian people joined together in friendship after Gallipoli, especially after the warm words of acknowledgment of Ataturk, who paid tribute to the Australian men he fought against on the shores of Gallipoli. In conclusion, I support the calls for freedom of religion everywhere and the need for the rights of Christians in Turkey to be respected. I do not believe that the Turkish government is anti-Christian-the Turkish constitution would not allow it to be. But I do believe that Christian communities in Turkey have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. We need to extend a hand of friendship and cooperation to leaders of secular Muslim nations. While we may not always agree, we can work together towards greater tolerance and understanding of each other.",27
21,Mrs VALE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"In a world torn by religious conflict and beset by religious tension, it is worth reminding ourselves that a spiritual belief is one of the greatest and deepest needs of humankind. This is a fact that sometimes gets lost in a humanist, secular world which itself has bred its share of similar conflict and tension. Not all paths lead to God. Not all faiths and religexample, ions are the same, and that fact can be the source of discord and dispute amongst peoples. But we must always remember that each person on the face of this earth is a creation of God, who treasures each and every one of us, despite our failings and ungodliness. The modern Republic of Turkey is a democratic and secular nation that has done much to achieve religious harmony amongst its peoples and deserves our commendation. Over 90 years ago, because of a humanistic conflict, Turkey became home to the graves of many thousands of young Australian soldiers who fought and died on Turkish soil at Gallipoli. Today all Australians would join me in expressing their appreciation for the help and hospitality that the Turkish government and people give to the Australians who visit the Gallipoli peninsula each year. Despite the inauspicious start to our relationship, today there is a warm, strong bond of mutual respect and friendship between our two democratic nations. The law of Turkey establishes that country as a secular state and provides for freedom of belief, freedom of worship and the private dissemination of religious ideas. However, other laws regarding the integrity and existence of the secular state constrain these rights. In noting this, I again acknowledge the steps that Turkey has taken toward ensuring religious harmony. In keeping with these efforts, and in the knowledge that a secular state does not need to be an irreligious state, I respectfully urge the Turkish parliament to pass laws that will enable minority groups, including Christian organisations, to reclaim property that has been expropriated from them in the past. In particular, I ask that Turkish Christian foundations be allowed to acquire legal ownership of properties that were once registered under the names of, for saints and archangels during periods when foundations could not own property in their own name. Such gestures by the Turkish authorities would be warmly appreciated here in Australia, where we have extended the right of freedom of worship and the building of mosques to those settlers of Turkish origin. It would also be noted with appreciation if, likewise, the Turkish authorities would allow the Halke seminary to reopen, which I understand was closed in 1971, when all private institutions of higher learning were nationalised. I respectfully seek that the Armenian Apostolic Seminary in Istanbul be reopened and that other Christian denominations, such as the Syriac Orthodox Church, be allowed to operate seminaries of their own. I understand that currently religious communities other than Sunni Muslims cannot legally train new clergy in the country eventual leadership. Hopefully, this may change. Educated Turkish clergy providing leadership to their churches instead of coreligionists from abroad would be an asset to Turkish national identity and to the Turkish nation in the modern world of closer economic cooperation. Finally, I would like to respectfully encourage the good people of Turkey-a very large nation that plays a unique and geostrategic role as the bridge between Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East-to persevere in their efforts, together with the United Nations and its Secretary General, the United Nations's committees and the EU, to achieve more people-topeople contact and reconciliation and to reach a just and lasting peaceful settlement to the Cyprus dispute. We in Australia have been greatly blessed by both Turkish and Greek Cypriots, about 19,500 in number, who have come to our land as settlers and share our community in peace. I understand that the Cypriot community in Australia is the second largest outside Cypress, after the United Kingdom. Here in Australia both Christians and Muslims from Cypress and Turkey are free to worship, to build their churches and mosques, to exercise their free will under democratically formed law, to educate their children in religious schools of their choosing and to associate together as they choose within the one island territory and state that is Australia. I would urge both Turkey and Greece to help the birth of a new democratic Cypriot state, encompassing the whole island, where all the people of Cypress can enjoy the same conditions in friendship and prosperity and without fear of the future. I commend this motion to the House.",28
22,Mr GEORGANAS,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I rise in support of this motion moved by the member for Mitchell with reference to the Republic of Turkey and its relations with the different Christian minorities in the area. This motion was seconded by the member for Prospect. It was to be seconded by the member for Barton, who has a great interest in this area and unfortunately was unable to speak today. Firstly, I would like to point out that the Greek-Australian community and the Turkish-Australian community should be commended for the peaceful manner in which they coexist in this country, as was mentioned in the motion by the member for Mitchell. In a climate of world tension and unrest these two communities have set an example of how to live and learn with people of all nationalities and religions. I too welcome Turkey's request for membership of the European Union, but there are certain areas of responsibility and concern that quite simply cannot be ignored, and one of them is the reunification of the island of Cyprus. That is paramount. This is a central and critical issue that the Turkish government must act upon without hesitation. Cyprus remains divided after the Turkish invasion of 1974. Northern Cyprus is not recognised by any other country throughout the world. It is recognised only by the Republic of Turkey. The fact that over 200,000 Cypriots were expelled from their country courtesy of the invasion in 1974 makes it one of the great tragedies of modern day history. It is time to take whatever action is necessary for ensuring that this issue is resolved once and for all. The only acceptable outcome is for Cyprus to become unified. I would also like to mention Turkey's relarequest tions with the Christian minorities in the public of Turkey. While there have been reforms, promises of reforms and some improvements in this area, we must prove beyond doubt that the Turkish government is prepared and willing to conform to expectations from governments all over the world that they should be viewed as a worthy member of the European community. The government of the Republic of Turkey must dispel once and for all global concerns that, if admitted to the European Union, it would pose a problem. We must ensure that human rights are preserved. They can begin this process by adhering to the following: return to the Christian minorities properties that have been and continue to be expropriated by the state. In particular, the Greek and Armenian Orthodox communities have lost numerous properties to the state in the past and continue to fight ongoing efforts by the state for these properOrhan ties. I hope the government of Turkey realises that this practice of seizing properties from minority Christian communities must stop immediately and all properties must be returned to their rightful owners. The Turkish government must allow the reopening of the Greek Orthodox Theological College on the island of Halke, the most important teaching institution in the Orthodox world. It was closed in 1971 after claims that private tertiary educational institutions were not permitted to operate in Turkey. The Turkish government must also permit the reopening of the Armenian Apostolic Seminary in Istanbul. The government of the Republic of Turkey must allow all other Christian denominations, in particular the Syriac Orthodox one, to conduct seminaries of their own. As the eyes of the world watch closely with great interest the unfolding of Turkey's for admission to the European Union Reas a full member-and I am sure everyone supports that admission-I sincerely hope that the government of Turkey will listen to the voices of governments around the world and of the European Union and comply with the expectations put before them. There are some very welcoming signs that the government will take these up. Firstly, we welcome the initial cautious attitude adopted by the current Justice and Development Party (AKP) government of Prime Minister Erdogan on the Armenian genocide and we hope he will continue to retain an open mind on this burning issue. Secondly, we welcome other initiatives by the current Prime Minister, including cosponsoring, with the Prime Minister of Spain, the UN auspice initiative for the Alliance of Civilisations. Thirdly, there are healthy and encouraging signs for Turkish democracy that courageous voices, such as that of Turkey's leading novelist, Pamuk, are being heard over this issue. I remind members of the remarks Pamuk made concerning the Armenian genocide during an interview in February 2005 with the Swiss magazine Das Magazin. He said: Thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it. He was subsequently prosecuted but the charges were dropped. I hope these comments help in some way to ensure that peace reigns in Asia Minor forever and a day so that we will live in a peaceful world.",29
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. Fuel Prices,31
24,Mr BYRNE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I move: That this House: (1) notes the continuing and alarmingly high fuel prices in the South Eastern suburbs of Melbourne and across Australia; (2) recognises the enormous impact of these high fuel prices for families and their budgets and local businesses in the region; (3) acknowledges residents concerns about price gouging within the petroleum refining and distribution industry and their desire for some action to be taken by the Howard Government to reduce fuel prices; and (4) asks that, at the very least, the Treasurer action to direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to formally monitor fuel prices under Part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. In speaking to this motion, I am relaying the concerns of many of my constituents whom I have spoken to since the sustained rise in petrol prices. It is ironic that, when I raised a motion of a similar nature in this House in November, one of the contributors from the government side basically said that I was overstating the position and that what would happen in reality would be that, due to market forces, the price of petrol would come down to about $1 a litre. Mr Gavan O'Connor-Oh!",31
25,Mr BYRNE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"The last time. I checked, Member for Corio, which was when I took a drive around my electorate yesterday, the price of petrol ranged, as you would know, from $1.33 in Cranbourne to $1.30 in Narre Warren. So much for petrol prices coming down! That comment signalled the complacency of the Howard government over petrol prices and their effects on the communityand my electorate knows more than most the effects of petrol prices on the community. Remember that my electorate has the highest rate of mortgages in Australia, the highest rate of couples with dependent children in Australia and one of the highest rates of motor car usage in Australia. These are working people who have been affected by petrol price increases. These are the ones who have generated our current economic prosperity but are now faced with huge petrol costs with no relief in sight. Given the large number of families in the area of my electorate, these people need a car-and to pay a lot more for petrol-to take their kids to school, to child care, to sport or to the doctor. Because many of my constituents work outside the area, these take people need to drive to work, particularly the large number of tradespeople who live in my electorate. The government has given them no relief from petrol prices, but I will tell you what it has given them: the Work Choices legislation which, as we have seen, is ripping away job security and, even worse-particularly for the tradespeople in my electorate-the government's intention to employ cheap foreign labour in many of the trades and areas that my constituents work in. The sustained high price of petrol is having devastating consequences and effects in my area. Parents are being forced to tighten their belts. I hear so many stories of financial pressure and of the way that people are starting to worry about servicing their mortgages. Take, for example, the stories from the Casey North information and support service, which provides support and information services to suburbs in my electorate like Narre Warren, Narre Warren North, Narre Warren South, Berwick and Hallam. In the financial year of 2004-05, Casey North provided $1,500 in petrol vouchers. With the massive rise in petrol prices and the increasing demand for these vouchers, Casey North has since purchased $3,500 worth of vouchers, an increase of 133 per cent-and it still cannot keep up with the demand. These are not voucher requests from the poor people in these areas; these requests are from the working families in these areas. As a consequence of this demand, Casey North will only provide vouchers in the most extreme set of circumstances, such as medical treatment or picking up kids from school, and people will have to be turned away. This is the tip of the iceberg. Look basic hits that the residents of my area have copped. In May there was an interest rate rise that added between $33 and $37 per month to the average mortgage of families in Narre Warren and Cranbourne. If you compare the price of fuel in early 2005 to that now, families in these areas are paying up to $52 a month for petrol per car. Most of the families in my electorate have two cars, so that is an additional $104 per month. The government has made much of its tax cuts in my area. Many in my electorate have an income of between $40,000 and $60,000 per annum. The government's tax cuts in the budget work out to be $ 9.80 per week, so roughly $40 per month. That is not even covering the increase in petrol costs. So families in my area are seriously worried. Yet while they are suffering, oil companies are making gigantic profits. For example, the profits of companies like Exxon Mobil and the other companies which produce much of the petrol that we consume are expected to exceed $134 billion this year. In fact, the chairman of Exxon Mobil, Lee Raymond, has an income of $200,000 per day and a retirement package of $400 million. When the price of petrol hit $US1.20 a litre in America, George Bush hit the panic button and demanded that the equivalent of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigate price gouging and price profiteering. But what has happened in this country? Absolutely nothing, even though the government has the capacity to intervene under part 7A of the Trade Practices Act. The government has sat on its hands and done absolutely nothing, unlike George Bush. It is a disgrace and it is a betrayal of the families in my area. (Time expired)",31
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,Is the motion seconded? Mr Martin Ferguson-I second the moat the tion and reserve my right to speak.,32
27,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"It is a pleasure to speak on this motion today. Looking at the words put forward by the member for Holt, I see the point he is putting forward and the outcome he is seeking. He asks that: ... at the very least, the Treasurer take action to direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to formally monitor fuel prices ... If that is the least that he seeks, I wonder what could we do. If he had wanted the most that he could seek, perhaps it might have been to have an even bigger study and maybe to get a group of organisations to study fuel prices. Studying fuel prices is not going to deliver a better outcome for motorists. I would like to look at some of the different points associated with this issue. I would like to suggest something which members opposite might like to consider as an alternative and which, perhaps, could give motorists something positive to think about. I would like to talk a bit about excise and that part of the taxes on fuel that goes to the states. The Commonwealth applies an excise rate of about 38c a litre on fuel. That is an interesting position, because the Commonwealth under the coalition has capped the excise rate at 38c a litre. It is interesting to note that, when the new tax system came in on 1 July 2000, under the imposition of the goods and services tax there were reductions in rates of excise at that time. Now that we have the GST in place and the capping imposed by the government, we have had real reductions in the cost of that part of fuel is levied by the Commonwealth as part of excise. It is interesting to note in comparison that, during the time the Labor Party was in power, the rates of excise on petrol went from 30.75c a litre back in 1994-and that is as far back as I can go-to as high as 34.5c a litre, as at 1 August 1996. So, during its time in office, the party that the members opposite represent continually ramped up excise and sought to benefit from it. I would like to raise the fact that, quite some time prior to the introduction of the new tax system, the Commonwealth had to take over the petrol franchise fees, which were being levied by the states on fuel as a way of covering up all the black holes they had in their budgets. They imposed petrol franchise fees in order to keep their budgets as healthy as they possibly could. Those petrol franchise fees have now been rolled into the GST. So an amount of about 8.3c litre in the GST component is the old petrol franchise fee. What I would like to put to the House is that each of the states is now receiving revenue returns from the GST far and above the amounts promised to them at the time we introduced the GST. The states are receiving a higher amount of money and they are above the amounts that were guaranteed to them. Given that there are serious concerns in the community, as the member for Holt pointed out, I think we could look to recover the old petrol franchise fee. We could take it from state revenue, not from the GST money but from other grants that are applied to them by the Commonwealth, and we could recover up to 8.1c litre. If members opposite want to look at a way of addressing this issue they could get real and look at the petrol franchise fee money going to the states, which is being used to prop up their budgets and which does not provide a beneficial outcome for motorists. I think this is an option that should be that pursued by members. We should look at reducing the amounts of grants to the states, particularly those states that have not been honouring their GST obligations, those states that have not been making all the tax cuts that they promised they would. This is a way to use a lever on those states to ensure a bit of justice for motorists. The petrol franchise fee is something that members opposite are not speaking about because it directly aids those Labor state governments. (Time expired)",32
28,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"As my colleague the member for Holt has highlighted, Australian families are feeling the pinch of record high petrol prices. But I intend raising issues in this debate that I thought the member for Blair should have raised, given the fact that he comes from the state of Queensland. Unlike the Howard government, the federal Labor Party believes there is plenty that can be done about petrol prices. The most important thing, and it is interesting that the member for Blair did not touch on it, is the capacity to do something about security of supply and the challenges that confront Australia in the 21st century. That means growing the ethanol and biofuels markets and doing more to develop Australia's gas and coal to make liquid transport fuels. This is about producing more of our own transport fuels, like ethanol or diesel made out of natural gas or coal. It will not lower prices at the pump but it will make all of us better off in many other ways. It will mean more jobs, higher exports, more tax revenue from resource development and more money available for income tax relief, roads, better public transport, and hospitals. It is only through our domestic supply sources that we will be able to address fuel supply emergencies in the future if the Middle East supply is interrupted and scarcity induces price blow-outs that would threaten our industries, our way of life and our job and export opportunities. It is estimated that our current oil reserves will last only about 40 more years and, while Australia's prospectivity is lower than that in many other countries, exploration in our remaining frontier areas should be a national priority the Australian government. But we need to look further than oil exploration for the total solution, because that is only one part of the challenge. For the best part of the last decade Australia consumed oil three times faster than it added to its serves, so this is a huge national problem. Conversely, for the last 20 years, Australia has been finding gas faster than it is consuming and exporting it. I believe we could turn that natural gas into products like clean synthetic crude oil and diesel and jet fuel, which are all in demand in Australia. Australia's competitors in the gas industry are way ahead of us in this area, particularly in the Middle East, where countries such as Qatar already have major gas-to-liquid projects, making ultra-clean diesel for the global market. Why can't Australia do it? The same applies to the coal industry. Labor's climate change blueprint identified clean coal technology as a vital part of the climate change solution and, of course, coalto-liquids technology is central to the economics and efficiency of a cleaner coal industry. I point out to the House that it is now four years since CSIRO proposed a strategy for Australia's transport future, a strategy that recognised gas to liquids and coal to liquids as the key to the future. Four years on, the schools Howard government yet again has done nothing about securing Australia's future in the energy debate. It is about transport energy for a country which is dependent on the transport industry. For at least four years CSIRO has known that Australia needs to take action, but the Howard government has done nothing. Further, it is five years since Senator Minchin, then minister for resources, appointed a task force to investigate the feasibility and benefits of establishing a gas-toof liquids industry in Australia. The task force highlighted the potential significance of a gas-to-liquids industry for Australia's economy, saying it could underwrite offshore gas supply infrastructure to bring forward the possibility of major new domestic gas piperelines to connect the national market, increase domestic gas competition and energise gas exploration-all key components in Australia's future-not to mention the most pressing of problems: our future transport fuel security. It is not about self-sufficiency; it is about security of supply. But, five years later, the government is still sitting on its hands hoping the petrol price problem will soon disappear. I commend the member for Holt for bringing this motion forward for debate in the House. We are all concerned about high petrol prices, but the debate is bigger than the questions of excise and global demand. The debate is about our national government seizing opportunities and working out how we encourage industry by putting in place an investment regime which will force downstream processing in Australia. It is about gas to liquids, not just the export of LNG to China. It is about processing in Australia and creating further jobs. I say to the government: front up to the challenges and stop running away from your responsibilities. (Time expired)",33
29,Mr CAUSLEY,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I rise to contribute to the debate on petrol prices. I had hoped to hear from the members who spoke before me some policy on how they are going to reduce the price of petrol. The inference in the motion is that there is somehow a magic way in which the government can reduce the price of fuel for the general public. At this stage, I have heard nothing from the member for Holt. We at least heard a bit of policy from the member for Batman, but we have heard nothing about the real issues. It is fairly clear to anyone who knows anything about this that it is all about supply and demand. At present, supply and demand is so tight that any disturbance on the world scene anywhere near an oil producing nation increases the fluctuations in price. Of course that hurts the travelling public and the budgets of Australians; there is no argument about that. But, if you are honest and have a look at prices around the world, you will see that Australia still has the fourth cheapest petrol in the world and the sixth cheapest diesel in the world. We are not up there with the extremely high price countries. If you lived in Argentina, for example, you might have something to complain about, because they certainly have a high price for fuel over there-and very low per capita income. Australia is certainly not up there. The member for Batman seems to think the magic bullet is to suddenly jump into alternative fuels. Of course we are interested in alternative fuels. Because I represent a rural electorate, I am very interested in alterare native fuels. But you cannot artificially create a market. I think the market is adapting. We are seeing more and more of these fuels being produced, more ethanol plants are being built around Australia and, as the market works, we will start to see alternative fuels come into play. I am sure that the oil producing nations of the world are quite concerned about this. One of the real issues is the refining capacity in the world at the present time, and efforts are being made to try and overcome the problems with refining capacity. The oil producing nations of this world are not stupid. They know that, if alternative fuels start to get into the marketplace, they will sell less oil. So they will be looking very closely at how they can keep balance in the price. They are well aware of the effect of the oil price on international markets and international economies. I am sure that, given a bit of time-and it might take a couple of years to do it-we will see extra refining capacity in the world, and I think we will probably see a bit more balance in oil prices. Having said that, the opposition give the government no credit for what it has already done. I think it was in 1991 that fuel excise was capped. At present, fuel excise is 38.3c. If fuel excise had not been capped, with natural inflation it would now be somewhere around 60c a litre. That would have been a huge impost over and above the already high price of fuel. I have not heard any policy from members of the opposition as to what they might do to reduce the price of fuel. If they suggest that, in government, they are going to take off some of the excise, what government programs are they going to cut? Excise is collected by the government to pay for pensions, health and education, which are very important areas of government. What programs are they going to cut if they are going to cut the tax intake? It is very important to have a look at all these things. If you going to raise this in a debate, you need to look closely at what the effects are going to be, one side or the other, and not just get up in a political stunt and talk about the price of fuel. You need to look very closely at the cause and effect-what is going to happen if you do these types of things. I do not think the opposition have really thought this through. The government is well aware of the problems people are presently having in coping with the increased price of fuel. We have had 44 inquiries into fuel prices since 1983. I used to be in the New South Wales government and I can tell you that we had several inquiries there into the price of fuel. If the member for Holt is concerned about this, why doesn'the write a letter to the ACCC? Why doesn'the refer it to the ACCC to see whether they will investigate it? He does not have to wait for the Treasurer. Instead of coming in here with a political stunt, he can write to the ACCC and ask them to investigate whether the oil companies are engaged in price gouging and not handing on the true costs to the community. Let us do the hard work and see what we can do. (Time expired)",35
30,Ms BURKE,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I also support the motion on petrol prices before the House. I am pleased to see that the next government member speaking in the debate, the member for Deakin, almost comes from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne-at least someone in the ballpark of Melbourne will talk about petrol prices; his two colleagues who spoke earlier represent regional Queensland. It is quite nice that one Liberal Party member representing the burbs in the Melbourne will also speak about this issue. The Howard government has failed to keep petrol prices on hold and, as a result, Melbourne families are struggling to make ends meet. Only yesterday the Melbourne Herald Sun headline screamed at us ‘How higher petrol prices hurt'. A snippet from that opinion piece, which touched on the problems of various motorists, was very interesting. It read: A 25 per cent jump in the cost of running her car in the past year slugged pizza delivery driver Charlyn Winslow. ‘It used to cost about $28 to fill my car. Now it's at least $35 and you get fewer trips. Overall, I'm earning less,' she says. The Port Melbourne pizza shop owner for whom she drives has bumped his delivery charge to $1.50. Here a young person-a university student, I suspect, who is probably earning her way through uni by delivering pizzas-is copping the petrol price increase with no additional remuneration. The extreme industrial relations legislation that is now in effect, as the member for Holt mentioned, will probably impact her earning ability even more dramatically. While regional and rural Australians are suffering because their car journeys are usually so lengthy, so too are Melbourne families, who rely heavily on the many short trips they have to make each day. Families are paying record petrol prices. Since the 2004 federal election, the extra cost of filling the tank each week has risen to $84 per month, which is a lot of money for families on fixed incomes to find. As our shadow Treasurer recently pointed out, petrol prices for the average Australian family have skyrocketed by over $400 over the last two years. On top of the recent interest rate rise, families are really feeling the pinch. While some people are opting to use public transport or ride a bike, this is not feasible for a single working mother in Chadstone who has to drop her toddler off at child care, drop her children off at school, go to work and then pick them all up and shop for groceries at the end of the day-along with all the other chores she has to do on the way home. On average, Victorians drive 15,000 kilometres a year, using around 1,500 litres of petrol. The helpful RACV website clearly states: Stop/start driving is much less efficient and more polluting than driving at a constant speed. In comparison, free flowing driving, such as uncongested country or freeway travel, uses the least amount of fuel. If possible, organise trips in advance to avoid congested areas and peak-hour traffic. That would be lovely, but when you are live the suburbs of Melbourne it is virtually impossible. You are constantly stop-start driving. You are stopping and starting at traffic lights and in the traffic, but, more importantly, you are stopping and starting for the 500 different trips you have to do just to get through your day. Not just families are feeling the pinch. Many small businesses are experiencing severe drops in sales-couriers, independent petrol station owners, delivery services and so on. Indeed, the highest number of people in history have been driving off without paying for their petrol. A lot of people are ally filling up and taking off without paying their petrol bill because they literally cannot afford to. When Labor was last in government petrol prices were at 70c a litre. Today they have doubled. Those opposite are always citing what we did, but they have doubled petrol prices. The fact is that the Howard government has failed to keep petrol prices low and they are now out of control. The government has failed to address Australia's dependence on foreign gas, it has failed to encourage our biofuels industry and it has failed to give ACCC the power to formally monitor petrol prices. We are not talking about another inquiry; we are talking about the ACCC monitoring petrol prices. While the President of the United States, George Bush, is holding an inquiry into the possible practice of petrol price gouging in the US, his good friend John Howard, our Prime Minister, who is normally more than happy to follow in the President's footsteps, refuses to allow an ACCC inquiry into alleged price gouging in Australia. This is another broken promise from the Prime Minister. On 7 April, journalist Neil Mitchell asked the Prime Minister whether he would formally direct the ACCC to monitor fuel prices under part 7A of the Trade Practices Act. The Prime Minister responded: Yes I will. I will ask them to have a look at it... It must have been a ‘non-core' promise because, within a week, he had reneged on his word. Not that his word has meant anything for some time.",36
31,Mr BARRESI,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I am pleased to be able to speak on this motion on petrol prices as it gives me the opportunity to set some facts straight in this debate and to identify the long-term solutions available to us to better manage the cost of transport fuels, some of which were identified by the actumember for Batman in his contribution. There is no doubt that petrol prices are high and, as members of parliament, we are aware of the difficulty that petrol prices cause for home budgets and in the running of small businesses. If we are not aware, we should be getting out more often and engaging with our constituents or family members and friends, who are never backward in telling it as it is. It does concern me to see petrol prices at their current high levels, with expectations that they will go even higher. In saying this, the it is also important for us to understand the real cause of these increases, not simply respond to the political rhetoric of those who look to the short-term fix for every problem we confront. Implicit in the motion moved by the member for Holt is a belief that the Howard government is responsible for the high petrol prices facing Australian consumers. This is simply not the case. The real reason for the high cost of fuel facing Australian motorists has been clearly stated by the member for Holt's Labor colleague the member for Rankin, who wrote in the Canberra Times last year: Australia's record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only-high world oil prices. The OPEC oil-producing countries are pumping oil out of the ground as fast as they can, but not as fast as the world wants to use it. China is burning oil products for its industrialisation as if there no tomorrow. Unfortunately, there are high petrol prices all around the world. The fact that we are ranked fourth lowest for petrol and sixth lowest for diesel among the OECD nations is no cause for celebration. However, it does place into perspective the fact that, as a government, we do not control that price; the price is determined by the cost of crude oil on the world market. Australia is not self-sufficient in oil; we are now importing about two-thirds of our oil and we are at the mercy of world oil prices. In fact, the federal government is the only government in Australia that has taken action to reduce the cost of petrol at the bowserwe reduced the excise on petrol from 44c to 38c a litre and, furthermore, capped the excise at that level. Since that cap, the price of petrol has risen from 80c to $1.40 a litre. What is often not mentioned is that the 38c excise does not increase as prices increase. I acknowledge that the GST collected on behalf of the states also forms part of that cost, and that component does increase with petrol price rises. If criticism needs to be made, then let it be levelled at the state premiers.",37
32,The SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Order! It being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Deakin will have leave to continue his remarks when the debate is resumed. NA Mr Ron Byrnes",38
33,Ms BIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to take the opportunity today in the House to acknowledge the passing of Mr Ron Byrnes. Ron was a very important member of our community. He worked in the mines for many years and retired as a mine is deputy. But he had a significant involvement in community organisations, particularly as a member of the RSL subbranch board and the Woonona-Bulli Memorial Club board, where he was returning officer. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work he did in his role as the welfare officer. He was also a board member of the WA and involved in the Illawarra Lapidary Club. I attended Ron's funeral on Friday, which was attended by over 300 people, including members of his church, the ALP, his lapidary club and representatives of the RSL. Ron is survived by his wife, Pem; his daughter, Alison, and her partner, Paul; his son, Colin, and his wife, Sally; and his grand-daughter, Kimberley. On behalf of our community I would like to extend our sympathy to the family and express our great appreciation for the contribution that Ron made to his community in his working life and in his retirement. Snowy Hydro Corporatisation",38
34,Mrs HULL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I give notice that at the next sitting I shall present a bill for an act to amend the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997. For related purposes I would like to signal that the amendment will go along the following lines: After section 7(3), insert: (3A) In the event of the Snowy Hydro Company being listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, the following provisions shall be, or shall be taken to be, included in the company constitution: No individual, corporation or other entity shall be entitled to hold more than 10% of the shares in the company; The head office of Snowy Hydro Ltd must remain in Australia; Snowy Hydro Ltd must maintain a substantial business and operational presence in Australia; Two-thirds of the Directors of the Board of Snowy Hydro Ltd and the Chair of any meeting of the Board and shareholders must be Australian citizens; and, Snowy Hydro Ltd must remain incorporated in Australia. Notwithstanding anything in the Corporations Act 2001 or any other Act or law, these provisions of the constitution shall have effect and shall not be alterable except by Act of the Parliament. I give notice of my bill and hope that I will be able to get some sort of support from the House. Westralia Airports Corporation",38
35,Mr WILKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I present to the House two petitions, one signed by 2,500 people from the City of Belmont in my electorate and one from the Belmont Council itself. Since January Westralia Airports Corporation, the leaseholder of Perth Airport, has refused to make its full ratesequivalent payments to the City of Belmont and has withheld over $400,000. The chair of Westralia Airports Corporation is David Crawford. Mr Crawford is also Acting President of the National Competition Council, which is responsible for ensuring competitive neutrality. The citizens' petition draws to the attention of the House that the Westralia Airports Corporation leases the Perth Airport from the Commonwealth government. The WAC must make ‘rates equivalent payments' to the City of Belmont under clause 24.2 of the lease. The reason for this is the federal government's commitment to the principles of competitive neutrality, which in this instance ensure that the Westralia Airports Corporation does not have a competitive advantage over other commercial operators who must make annual rate payments. In accordance with the lease, the city has issued a notice to the WAC for a rates equivalent payment in the 2005-06 budget of $2.1 million. However, the WAC has advised the council it will only pay $1.691 million. The underpayment of rates leaves the city with a substantial budget shortfall. The impact of this will be a significant decrease in works and services in the local community and may result in an increase in the amount of rates other ratepayers will have to pay. The petition calls on the House to require the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who is responsible for administering Westralia Airport Corporation's lease, to enforce the lease and make the WAC pay, and continue to pay, full rates-equivalent payments to the City of Belmont. I commend both petitions and congratulate the signatories on their passion for their community. The petitions read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: - The Westralia Airports Corporation (“WAC”) leases the Perth Airport from the Commonwealth Government. - The WAC must make “rates equivalent payments” to the City of Belmont under clause 24.2 of the lease. The reason for this is the Federal Government's commitment to the principles of competitive neutrality, which in this instance ensure that the WAC does not have a competitive advantage over other commercial operators who must make annual rate payments to their relevant local government authority. - In accordance with the lease, the City has issued a notice to the WAC for a rates equivalent payment in the 2005/6 Financial Year of $2.1 million, however the WAC has advised the City that it will not pay the full amount of the rates equivalent payment and will only make a $1.691 million rates equivalent payment. - The underpayment of rates by $409,000 leaves the City of Belmont with a substantial budget shortfall. The impact of this will be a significant decrease of works and services in the local community and may result in an increase in the amount of rates that other ratepayers in the Belmont community will have to pay. Your petitioners therefore request the House to require the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who is responsible for administering the lease, to enforce the lease and make the WAC pay, and continue to pay, full rates equivalent payments to the City of Belmont - If from 2,505 citizens To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: - The petition of the City of Belmont (“the City”) of 215 Wright Street, Cloverdale in the State of Western Australia draws the attention of the House to the following facts: - The Westralia Airports Corporation (“WAC”) leases the Perth Airport from the Commonwealth Government under a 50 year lease with an option to renew for a further 49 years. - The WAC must make “rates equivalent payments” to the City under clause 24.2 of the lease. The reason for this is the Federal Government's commitment to the principles of competitive neutrality, which in this instance ensures that the WAC does not have a competitive advantage over other commercial operators who must make annual rate payments to their relevant local government authority. - In accordance with the lease, the City issued a notice to the WAC for a rates equivalent payment in the 2005/6 Financial Year of $2.1 million. The WAC has advised the City that it will not pay the full amount of the rates equivalent payment and will only make a $1.691 million rates equivalent payment. - The underpayment of rates by $409,000 leaves the City with a substantial budget shortfall. The impact of this will be a significant decrease of works and services in the local community and may result in an increase in the amount of rates that other ratepayers in the Belmont community will have to pay. - The City is not in a position to negotiate down rate equivalent payments as this is unfair to all the other ratepayers in Belmont who promptly pay their rates on time. Any such negotiation is in breach of competitive neutrality principles and the City does not want to engage in anti-competitive behaviour by providing the WAC with an advantage over other commercial operators. the Perth Airport was privately owned land then the WAC would be required to make full payments of rates. The lease already contains a number of exemptions that would not be available if the Perth Airport was privately owned. The WAC's ability to make further reductions exists only because the land is owned by the Commonwealth. The WAC is hiding behind the Crown to avoid paying rates. - The Department of Transport and Regional Services (“DOTARS”) is responsible for administering the Perth Airport lease. DOTARS has not obtained legal advice on the correct interpretation of the lease clause yet continues to advise the WAC that it can negotiate a lesser amount of rates payments with the City. DOTARS is refusing to enforce the lease against the WAC to the detriment of the City and the Belmont community. - At the time of negotiating the lease, DOTARS' role may have been to implement Government policy but its role changed when the lease was signed and since then its responsibility has been to manage the terms of the lease. - DOTARS has a conflict of interest between a responsibility to manage the lease and its apparent desire to advise the WAC how to reduce their rates or how other airports may have achieved a reduction. DOTARS' role should be ensuring that ALCs promptly pay, when notified, the amount of rates required under their lease. - Any reduction in rates payments by the WAC will result in an increase in profits. These profits will be subject to Company Tax payable to the Commonwealth Government. This is a form of tax shifting whereby duction in rates payments to the City results in an increase in tax income to the Commonwealth Government and imposes an additional burden upon local government to fund its operations. Your petitioner therefore requests the House to require the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who is responsible for administering lease, to enforce the lease and ensure that the WAC pays, and continues to pay, full rates equivalent payments to the City of Belmont. Signed under the City of Belmont's Common Seal on this seventeenth day of May two thousand and six by authority of the Council in the presence of: from 1 citizen. (Time expired) Fuel Prices",39
36,Mr BARRESI,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I challenge the member for Holt to ask his Labor colleague the Premier of Victoria to call for the GST component of petrol prices to be made an agenda item at the next COAG meeting. Will the Labor premiers be willing to forgo the GST take from the petrol bowsers? With $5 billion at stake, I doubt it. We should be asking why the Premier of Victoria is not doing the same thing that the Premier of Queensland was able to do after serious pressure from the federal Treasurer. Mr Bracks understands the windfall that his government receives from high petrol prices, which is around $2.5 billion this year. The higher the price, the greater the sum of money he receives. There is the challenge. The member for Holt and the member for Batman are both members of the Labor Party in Victoria of some influence. They should be using that influence to direct the Premier of Victoria to hand back some of the GST component, or at least to put it on the COAG meeting agenda the next time it comes around. High petrol prices are of concern to all in a re- this House. We should acknowledge the pain that members of the public are going through at the moment as a result of the increases. The people of south-eastern Melbourne would be better served if the member for Holt were to join those on this side of the House in demanding that the GST revenue the that the various Labor governments receive is put back in the pockets of the drivers, as currently happens in the state of Queensland. (Time expired) Awaba Open-Cut Coalmine",41
37,Ms HOARE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise this afternoon to congratulate the residents of West Lake Macquarie in their win in opposing an open-cut coalmine that was proposed for Awaba by Centennial Coal in our region. There was a long and hard-fought community battle to oppose this coalmine. I am pleased to say that Centennial Coal has withdrawn its application for this open-cut coalmine. The open-cut coalmine would have had major detrimental environmental effects as well as having a huge impact on the health of students at local schools. I congratulate the organisers of the two major committees that were formedSCAM, South Lakes Communities Against Mine, and NOCMFA, No Open Cut Mine For Awaba. I also place on the record my congratulations to my good friend and state colleague Jeff Hunter, the member for Lake Macquarie, on the fight that he took, alongside the community, to the state government on this issue. We have a long and proud tradition of coal mining in our area. We support underground coal mining and the workers in those coal mines and the families of those workers. But the proposal for an open-cut coalmine right on the edge of pristine Lake Macquarie would have been very damaging for the area, and it is fantastic news that Centennial Coal has withdrawn its proposal. We continue to support them in being a good local citizen. (Time expired) Macquarie Electorate: Blackheath-Mount Victoria RSL",41
38,Mr BARTLETT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to congratulate the Blackheath Mount Victoria subbranch of the RSL on their 85th anniversary. For 85 years this small but very active subbranch has played an important role in our community. The support and friendship that its members provide to local veterans are highly valued and its role in the broader community is appreciated by many. Equally important is the leadership it continues to provide for local commemorative activities, especially ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day. In a very real sense, its current members are representatives of so many who have served Australia in times of conflict over the past century. They are living reminders of the young men and women who sacrificed so much in the various theatres of war for the protection and security of Australia. As the President of the Blackheath Mount Victoria subbranch, Joe Tassanyi, so eloquently put they are custodians of the ANZAC heritage. This is a role that members of the Blackheath Mount Victoria subbranch take very seriously and carry out with real dignity. I greatly appreciate my association with this subbranch, and I am proud to be their patron. Congratulations to the Blackheath Mount Victoria subbranch for their 85 years of fine service. Gellibrand Electorate: Turkish-Australian Community",42
39,Ms ROXON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I appreciate getting the call, because I have been urged strongly by members of the Turkish-Australian community living in Gellibrand to speak today. Unfortunately, I was not able to speak on Mr Cadman's earlier motion on religious minorities. The terms of his motion before it was amended today were raised with me and were of great concern to the community. I think it was very wise that the House debated an amended motion, which was far more respectful of the differing views within the community. Obviously, it is important that the House is able to debate any issue that concerns members of the House about the broader international community, but I would like to place on the record my great support of and encouragement to Australians of Turkish origin, particularly those who live in my community. They have been such strong contributors to and a very peaceful and moderate force within the community and have integrated well in our schools and workplaces. They have set up soccer clubs and community groups-in particular, Mr Speaker, you might be amused to know that the old Tottenham pub has now been reclaimed, seriously renovated and turned into both a community centre and a place of worship for the Turkish Muslim community. This is an example of the positive influit, ence that a community can have in turning facilities into places that can be used by a vast range of people who practise different religions to the mainstream Christian groups within our community. (Time expired). Corangamite Electorate: Schools Funding",42
40,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to acknowledge on behalf of the 18 local schools in Corangamite that they were allocated $1.75 million under the Commonwealth government's Investing in Our Schools program. As members on this side would be aware, the allocation of this money has given a number of smaller primary and secondary schools in the electorate the ability to upgrade some of their equipment, fix up their classrooms and carpets and other school facilities, and it has provided them with some new computers. This brings to a total of $3 million which has been allocated to those schools in Corangamite. I am personally delighted on behalf of those schools and those parent groups who have made application for this federal funding. I acknowledge Alvie Consolidated School, Bannockburn Primary School, Bellaire Primary School, Colac Specialist School, Elliminyt Primary School, Ocean Grove Primary School, Point Lonsdale Primary School, Rokewood Primary School and Wallington Primary School and a number of others that will enjoy the extra funding which has been directly allocated to those parent groups and school communities. I will be visiting those schools during the break, and I am sure they will be very pleased to see me because of the way in which the federal government has funded them directly. (Time expired) Richmond Electorate: Whaling",42
41,Mrs ELLIOT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I seek leave to table a petition calling on the Howard government to take action on Japanese plans to kill whales in Australian territoWoolgoolga rial waters. Leave granted.,43
42,Mrs ELLIOT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This is a major issue of concern within my electorate. Many people have signed this petition and have raised this issue with me on numerous occasions. The people of my electorate want the Prime Minister to know that whaling is unacceptable and that, as a nation, we cannot stand by and allow these precious and defenceless animals to be slaughtered. Also of concern in relation to whaling is the effect that it will have upon whale watching season. Whale watching season is just about to start again this year. In my electorate, particularly around Tweed Heads and Byron Bay, it is a major tourism industry. Every year we see thousands of people come to the area to watch the whales pass by. The Japanese plan will have a huge impact on the number of whales passing by-and we have just seen those numbers build up. This petition calls on the Howard government to take immediate steps to prosecute boats detected slaughtering whales within Australian territorial waters. It calls on the foreign minister to apply diplomatic pressure on Japan to stop expanding its whale killing activity. It also calls on the Howard government to take immediate action to ensure that Australia's opposition to the proposed expansion of whale killing is clearly conveyed to all members of the International Whaling Commission and on the government to reaffirm its commitment to the establishment of a South Pacific whale sanctuary. (Time expired) Cowper Electorate: Woolgoolga Surf Lifesaving Club",43
43,Mr HARTSUYKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I recently had the honour of attending a function to celebrate the repair of the Surf Lifesaving Club premises, which unfortunately had been damaged in a severe storm. The roof was ripped off and substantial damage was caused to the building and to many of its fixtures and fittings. Through the insurance premium and the hard work of volunteers, the building has been successfully repaired and the club is now back in full swing and able to render a very important service to the people of Woolgoolga and to the many tourists who visit there. Surf lifesaving associations and their members right along the coast of New South Wales do a great job in keeping our beaches safe, ensuring that both locals and tourists have a safe and enjoyable time on our beaches. Only recently in Coffs Harbour there was the tragic drowning of a well-known local identity, Mr Ray Babbage, in very heavy seas at Diggers Beach, south of Woolgoolga. It goes to show that, despite his being a very experienced surfer, our beaches can be very treacherous as well as providing great enjoyment. It brings into clear focus the great work that our surf lifesaving clubs do in keeping our beaches safe and in ensuring that people can enjoy them",43
44,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 pm, in accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Occupational Health and Safety",44
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Does mine safety training pertain to the employer-employee relationship or is mine safety training not part of the miner's job and something which miners are only entitled to do in their own time?,44
46,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mine safety training is something which ought to be not only allowable but a matter of course in this country. My understanding is that mine safety training and matters of mine safety are governed by state law. It is also my understanding under the present law, any accredited safety provider can provide that training. It is also my understanding that there have been agreements entered into under the new law which allow for the safety training of people including attending courses provided by unions who are accredited trainers. Beaconsfield Mine",44
47,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister advise the House what initiatives the government will take following the Beaconsfield mine tragedy and rescue?,44
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Bass will be aware that this afternoon there will be an opportunity for all of us to pay tribute to all of those involved in this remarkable event and also, of course, to temper that with our sadness at the loss of one of the miners, Larry Knight. More specifically, I can inform the House of a number of initiatives that the government will undertake in relation to the Beaconsfield community and also this particular event. The government proposes to contribute a sum of $8 million to a Beaconsfield community fund, the trustees of which will be representatives of the federal government and the local council. If, as I would expect to be the case, the Tasmanian government joins the federal government in making a contribution to this fund, there would also be a representative of the Tasmanian government. So there would, in that eventuality, be three trustees. This structural adjustment fund has some precedence in relation to the response of the federal and state governments to the closure of the steelworks in Newcastle some years ago and also to the various iterations of closures or scaling down of activities by Mitsubishi in South Australia. I would hope that this fund would be drawn upon to provide that, some continuity of employment until the future of the mine is known. That, of course, is in addition to any other entitlements to which people affected by any prolonged closure of the mine may be entitled. It is also the government's intention to invest a sum of $1 million in a fund that will provide income of approximately, I am told, $70,000 a year to fund a Larry Knight memorial scholarship in mining engineering at the University of Tasmania. This proposal has been discussed with the family of the late Mr Knight and they have expressed their approval. We believe that this is a more practical and effective ongoing way of marking his life in mining and also the sad and tragic circumstances of his death. Finally, the House will be aware that the Australian Workers Union has established a fund. I have indicated that, subject to the completion of the formalities, any contributions to that fund would enjoy tax deductibility. It is also the disposition of the government itself, after the details of the objects of the fund and so forth have been processed and made known to us, to make a contribution to the Australian Workers Union fund. I believe that these three measures are an appropriate response to this situation. They do recognise the extraordinary dependence of the Beaconsfield community on this mine. They also recognise that the most practical way of remembering the late Larry Knight is to have a scholarship bearing his name in mining engineering at the University of Tasmania. There is also a recognition of the commitment of the Australian Workers Union to providing assistance to the Knight family not only by tax deductibility but by an appropriate contribution by the federal government. Occupational Health and Safety",44
49,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister and it follows on from his answer to the Leader of the Opposition in which he said that mine safety training should be allowable as a matter of course. I refer the Prime Minister to a statement by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on 20 March this year: Matters that do not pertain to the employment relationship should not be part of agreements ... And: [Training] is something which people are entitled to do in their own time. It is not part of the they are doing. Given that, post Beaconsfield, the Prime Minister now disagrees with his minister, will the Prime Minister change the government's extreme industrial relations legislation to allow leave for trade union occupational health and safety training to be part of workplace agreements?",45
50,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the question from the member for Perth, it is quite clear in the Work Choices legislation. If he would like to go to section 16(3) of the Work Choices legislation, he will find out-if he has not already looked-that that quite clearly and explicitly preserves state and territory occupational health and safety laws and, as part of that, it quite explicitly preserves the right of union officials to have entry for occupational health and safety reasons.",45
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My Speaker, on a point of order: the question was explicitly about leave for training under a trade union base training arrangement.",45
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is answering that question.,45
53,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In addition to that, as the Prime Minister indicated in his answer to an earlier question, there have been agreements lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate over the last seven or eight weeks since the introduction of Work Choices on 27 March which contain provisions relating to training for occupational health and safety. If you take the Tasmanian situation, nothing has changed in relation to the provision of occupational health and safety. Under the Tasmanian legislation, which provides obligations on the part of mine owners and others in Tasmania to provide training and instruction in health and safety, one of the authorised trainers is Unions Tasmania, and there are therefore provijob sions whereby workers in Tasmania can continue to receive that training. It is not as if the opposition does not know this because, in the email from a constituent of the member for Lilley, which had been previously referred to for advice from their workplace relations spokesman, Mr Smith, this was said: ‘An employer can send employees to union training. Yes, that is correct.' This was in writing from the member for Lilley, having obtained advice from the member for Perth. East Timor",45
54,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the political situation in East Timor and Australia's ongoing consular and humanitarian response?,46
55,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question and for his interest. As the House knows, Australian troops are re-establishing security and the rule of law in East Timor. As law and order returns, it is going to be vital for East Timorese political leaders to establish dialogue with each other to address seated problems that the country is facing and for that dialogue to occur within the constitution of East Timor. I understand that there are two key constitutional councils which are chaired by President Xanana Gusmao which are meeting today. I hope that those councils prove to be successful in at least beginning the process of addressing differences that exist. Quite clearly, the armed forces and the police must cease conflict between the two and within the two. There are signs that that has happened. Once calm is restored, fundamental issues relating to the broader question of governance will need to be addressed-including, very importantly, the rebuilding of East Timor's police force, which has been reduced to being completely ineffective. The United Nations is going to have to play an important part in the way forward for East Timor, just as it has done in the past since 1998 or early 1999. The Secretary General is due to report to the United Nations Security Council on 6 June, giving advice to the Security Council on the way forward for the United Nations in East Timor. That is going to be an important report, because the Security Council has to make a decision by 20 June on whether to renew the mandate for the current United Nations mission and if the mandate is to be renewedand I think that is probably pretty much a given now-then the nature of that new mandate; what role the United Nations will play. The Australian government is giving a lot of thought to that at the moment. We will have discussions before too long with the East Timorese government about it and obviously, importantly, with the permanent members of the Security Council, other countries on the Security Council and the United Nations Secretariat. I think it is important that we do the form a specific view on how the United Naa tions should go forward in East Timor, and the deep- we will be doing that. With regard to the second part of the honourable member's question, let me say that the government has responded quickly to the humanitarian dimension of the crisis. We initially pledged $1 million in immediate assistance to Australian non-government organisations in East Timor. We are now going to provide an additional $2 million, $1 million of which will be for urgently needed food, water, shelter and medical supplies from Australia to East Timor. We have also sent some medical supplies to East Timor over the weekend. We will also be making a further $1 million available to UNICEF and other international agencies to assist in efforts to provide for the thousands of displaced people in East Timor. We have medically evacuated two seriously ill East Timorese police officers and they are now in a stable condition in the Royal Darwin Hospital. We have medivaced a further seven injured patients. As of this morning, 422 people have been evacuated from East Timor on military flights, including 157 Australians. Citizens from over 30 other countries have also been evacuated. Of course, the government's first priority is the safety of Australians. That there are Australians who have wanted to leave explains why we have given priority to evacuating those 157 Australians who wanted to leave. We will do what we can to help the people of East Timor achieve stability but also provide now the humanitarian assistance that is necessary. NA",46
56,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the 10th delegation from the International Youth Cooperation Development Centre of Vietnam who are visiting Australia under the auspices of the Australian Political Exchange Council. On behalf of the House, I extend to our visitors a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Occupational Health and Safety",47
57,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the government's Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) and Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill. Is it not the case that this bill, gether with the active encouragement of the government, will allow private companies which operate across different states to move from state jurisdictions to the Commonwealth jurisdiction for occupational health and safety matters? Won't this have the effect that such multistate private employers will be subject to a less stringent enforcement mechanism for occupational health and safety than is currently the case? For example, in New South Wales alone in 2004-05, 203 Commonwealth workplace visits took place and 20,892 New South Wales workplace inspector visits. Prime Minister, postBeaconsfield, how is this improving occupational health and safety in the workplace of the future?",47
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the learned member for BanksMr Martin Ferguson-Learned?,47
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The learned member for Banks for asking me such a learned and searching question, and I will endeavour to give it the learned and well researched response that it deserves. I always listen carefully to what the member for Banks says. He has insights into many things, not least the operations of his own party in his home state. I would be surprised-and I am not in a position, as the learned member knows, to give an opinion-if it had that effect, but I will take the honourable and learned gentleman's question very seriously and give him a considered response. Corporate Governance Framework",47
60,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on threats to the corporate governance framework in Australia? Further, what action needs to be taken to address these threats?",47
61,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. toAustralia's system of corporations law rests on Commonwealth power from the Constitution, which is a part power, and referred powers from the states, which make up the difference. The states have referred to the Commonwealth their powers over corporations so that our system can be seamless under the one national regulator. Unfortunately that referral is due to end on 15 July of this year-less than eight weeks away. Only two states have renewed the referral. They are South Australia and Tasmania. I warned in this House in March of this year that unless referrals were forthcoming from the remainder of the states then Australia's system of corporations law would be subject to constitutional challenge and decisions made by the corporate regulator could be undone on constitutional grounds. In addition to that, this would affect investment and business costs, as the possibility would arise that some parts of the Corporations Law were deemed constitutional and others not. I wrote to the remaining state governments-Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria-last week and requested that they extend the referral of their power over corporations from July 2006 and that they do it as a matter of urgency. I stress again that this is only eight weeks away. There has been a suggestion from some of the Labor states that they may not renew this referral because the government has relied upon the corporations power for its industrial relations legislation. I assure the House that the Commonwealth has not used the referred power to support its recent industrial relations legislation and has no intention of doing so. Extending the reference power relating to corporations has nothing to do with the use of the Commonwealth's own constitutional power in relation to corporations as a basis for industrial relations reforms. This is something that is far too important for politics. It is something that should not be delayed. It should not have got to this stage. I call on the remaining states to immediately renew that referral of power so that Australia's Corporations Law can continue seamlessly, immune from constitutional challenge, in the interests of the business community and the people of Australia. Queensland: The Nationals",47
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to his response to news of a merger between the Queensland Nationals and Liberal Party, reported in the Australian today: I am just getting across the decisions made in Queensland today. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. That question does not fall within the confines of the standing orders. The minister is being asked questions for which he is not ministerially responsible. It should be ruled out of order.",48
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Mackellar for her point of order. I am listening closely to the question of the Leader of the Opposition. I would ask him to come to a question relating to the minister's responsibilities.,48
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, I am quoting from a statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister today. This is the one forum we have to ask him those questions. Given that the Prime Minister has known about this merger for two weeks, why wasn't the Deputy Prime Minister in the loop?",48
65,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I half expected a question from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue today. If he had cared to read on, in other comments I made today I also reflected on and referred to the incredible strength of the coalition here in Canberra and the benefits that have been delivered to 20 million Australians over the 10 years we have been in office. All the Leader of the Opposition needs to worry about is whether the numbers on this side of the House are going to remain the same. They are greater than the numbers on that side of the House. The Liberal and National parties will maintain strong and stable government in Australia, as we have done over the last 10 years. I would respectfully suggest that the Leader of the Opposition cast a wary eye behind him at his factional warriors. They did not quite get the member for Hotham, but they got the member for Corio, they got the member for Maribyrnong, and now Bill Shorten has come in and they have the member for Lalor ready to go. So if I were the Leader of the Opposition I would not worry too much about the Liberal and National parties; I would be worried about the Australian Labor Party. East Timor",48
66,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House on the progress of operations in East Timor?,49
67,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Two and a half weeks ago the Australian government, recognising the instability in East Timor, prepositioned its Defence Force and, when the request formally came from the East Timorese government to provide military assistance to bring peace and stability to the country, we responded alongside Malaysia and also Portugal and New Zealand. At the moment there are 1,300 Australian Defence Force personnel directly on the ground in East Timor. There are 2,000 in the total region of East Timor supporting this deployment and another 1,000 supporting it from here in Australia. At the moment the key areas of infrastructure have been secured, particularly the airport, the wharf, the United Nations compound and also the police headquarters. In the last 24 hours more than 200 weapons have been removed from people on the streets. These are predominantly young criminal thugs and people who are taking advantage of an environment of lawlessness. In a military sense, it is important that Australians understand that the East Timorese army has returned willingly to its barracks. As we speak today, the East Timorese police members are returning to their academy and also to their headquarters. Brigadier Mick Slater has been in consultation over the last 24 hours with the East Timorese authorities, military police and political authorities with a view to developing and supporting an effective and appropriate policing strategy for East Timor. It is also important that I advise the House that there has been some concern expressed by some aid organisations about their security in providing humanitarian and other support to the East Timorese. It is very important that Australians appreciate that the priorities for Australia's Defence Force in East Timor should be determined by Brigadier Mick Slater, who commands our ADF personnel, in consultation with a higher command of Defence. Nonetheless, I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force to ensure that Brigadier Slater and his officers are aware of the needs of aid organisations, in particular that of World Vision and its chairman, Reverend Tim Costello, in discharging their responsibilities. In that regard, I encourage all Australians to support not only World Vision, Red Cross and Caritas but other important aid agencies providing assistance in East Timor. Queensland: The Nationals",49
68,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and follows the answer he gave to my previous question. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to his decision to abandon the member for Dawson and allow her to be removed from the ministry following the defection of Senator MCGauran. Will the mass defection of the Queensland division of the National Party cause a further reorganisation of the ministry? If one National Party defection caused the loss of one seat at the ministerial table, how many Nationals ministers will now goDr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. House of Representatives Practice shows that there is ample precedent for ruling out of order a question which relates to ministerial arrangements and coalition arrangements between parties, and former Speaker Snedden in fact did that in 1978.",49
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Boothby raises a valid point of order. The question is out of order.,50
70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The simple fact of the matter is the ranging answer that the Deputy Prime Minister gave to the previous question invited precisely that sort of question. He feels free to range over all those issues both in public and in here and we are entitled to have an answer.",50
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has raised his point of order. I think he appreciates the standing orders. China-Australia Free Trade Agreement,50
72,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. To recognise the interests of my constituency in this question, would the minister update the House on progress in negotiations on a free trade agreement between Australia and China? How would a free trade agreement with China help keep Australia's economy strong?",50
73,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mallee for his question. Of course, the member for Mallee takes a very keen interest in this important subject of improved access for produce from his electorate into the Chinese market. It is well known that, currently, China is the engine of global growth and that annual GDP growth of 9.5 per cent in China is expected to continue for quite a long time. China's leaders in fact say that they expect nine per cent plus growth to continue through to 2020. China is already our second largest merchandise export market and trade has quadrupled in the last 10 years. Last week the fifth round of free trade agreement negotiations with China were held in Beijing and very useful progress was made. In those discussions China reaffirmed that the FTA will be comprehensive and that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed-two very important principles that we have argued for in negotiating this FTA and others. China accepts that sensitive issues such as services, investment and agriculture will be in the free trade agreement negotiation. Importantly, Australia tabled text of 15 chapters for this meeting and China has now agreed to negotiate, mostly on the basis of that text. China also agreed to include government procurement and investment. China's government purchasing is growing and is going to be an enormous market in the future. We need to get access to that. Agriculture, manufacturing and resources negotiations will begin in September, and services and investment later in the year. The recent DHL-Austrade Export Barometer shows more exporters than ever are looking to China for future orders. They are focusing on the growing market in China. Through the FTA negotiations, we are seeking to ensure that there are growing and increasing opportunities for Australia's exporters in the Chinese market on a fair basis. Our policy of pursuing multilateral trade negotiations, as well as FTAs such as that which we are negotiating with China, is focused on strengthening the Australian economy, providing more opportunity for exporters to grow their export effort from Australia and generating jobs in Australia, keeping the Australian economy strong.

74,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.31 pm)My question is also to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Trade and Leader of the National Party. I refer the minister to an answer he gave in this place on 1 March this year, when he said: This government has been totally transparent in offering up all the information to the Cole ... Will the Deputy Prime Minister now direct the member for Gwydir, who is a member of the government, to be totally transparent and fully explain the circumstances surrounding the sale of his AWB shares? Will the Deputy Prime Minister give this direction before he ceases to be Deputy Prime Minister and before the National Party disappears altogether?",50
75,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not have anything to add to the answer that I gave earlier this year. I think that the issue that is canvassed by the honourable member has been canvassed and responded to in the public arena-and, as far as the last comment he made is concerned, I am staying in this position and the National Party is staying where it is in this coalition government.",51
76,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's response to the recent earthquake that struck Indonesia?,51
77,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Forde and I appreciate her interest in this. The Australian government expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the major earthquake that struck Jogjakarta on 27 May. This was an earthquake of 6.2 on the Richter scale and it occurred just off the coast of South Java, about 25 kilometres south of Jogjakarta. The social affairs minister of Indonesia estimates the death toll has now reached nearly 5,000. Injuries are estimated at over 20,000, although that number is continuing to climb. It is estimated that about 100,000 people have been displaced and are in need of shelter. Not surprisingly, the Indonesian President, President Yudhoyono, has declared a three-month state of emergency and he has even gone to the extent of establishing inquiry a temporary office in Jogjakarta. We will provide some funding to Indonesia's disaster management agency under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, and that funding is improving the response capability of the Indonesians. Yesterday, as I think the House knows, the Prime Minister spoke to President Yudhoyono and offered Australia's continuing assistance. Within hours of the earthquake, Australia announced $1 million for the Indonesian Red Cross to assess the damage, provide early medical assistance and set up kitchens to feed the victims of the earthquake. On Sunday, as the situation became clearer, the government tripled that figure. So $3 million now will be used to fund the Indonesian Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, the International Federation of the Red Cross, key UN agencies and of course Australian non-government organisations on Indonesia the ground. The Indonesian President has requested medical assistance in particular, and a medical team, which is funded by AusAID, will be arriving during the course of today. Australia will also send an essential services team and an engineering team to examine the infrastructure needs and to see what specific additional assistance Australia might be able to undertake. In terms of the consular response, within hours the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade established a 24-hour emergency hotline to take calls from the public, and the embassy established an office in a hotel in Jogjakarta so that we could try to identify whether there were any Australian victims. We had a register of 86 Australians living and working in Jogjakarta, and I understand that all 86 have now been accounted for. We have no reports at all of Australian casualties as a result of the earthquake, but we will continue to monitor the situation. Parliamentary Behaviour",51
78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing in his capacity as Leader of the House. Does the Leader of the House recall his comments on 19 June 2000, when he said in respect of members of parliament: I think the best thing we could do would be to rededicate ourselves to being kinder and gentler to each other ... Given that last week the Leader of the House moved, and the House carried, a resolution which states: That that snivelling grub over there be not ther heardand that the motion is now enshrined in the Hansard, can the Leader of the House explain how he is being kinder and gentler?",52
79,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that the member for Wills is on occasions an upright and honourable member, but I do not think he upheld his own best standards that day, and I think this baseless vendetta against an honourable man, the member for Gwydir, does the member for Wills no credit. After-Hours Medical Services",52
80,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House how the government is providing better access to doctors after hours?,52
81,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I acknowledge his former role as a public hospital doctor in Adelaide. I have to say, it is nice to get a health question. Isn't it interesting that they only come from members on this side of the House? I am not so surprised, because this government is proud of our Medicare system, and that is why we are always trying to make a good system even better. To take a few examples, we provided incentives that mean that the bulk-billing rates for children and country people are at an all-time high, we have brought allied health professionals such as physiotherapists and psychologists into Medicare for the first time in history and the government will shortly be spending $1.9 billion on mental health because this area has been too long neglected. In this instance, let me say that the government has certainly not neglected the need for after-hour GP services. This government supports fee for service, and that is why we have put a $10 loading onto after-hour GP consultations. So far $53 million has been spent on our round-the-clock Medicare loadfuring. But sometimes additional incentives are needed both to start new after-hour clinics and to keep old ones going. Last week the government announced that there would be five new after-hour clinics, each to be funded to the tune of $200,000, and 37 existing after-hour clinics would receive $100,000 to stay open, including one at the Blackwood and District Community Hospital in the electorate of Boothby. These new commitments are part of meeting an important election commitment and they help to demonstrate that this government, not that opposition, is most definitely the best friend that Medicare has ever had.

86,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Witnesses, including an investigative journalist and a veteran military doctor have revealed that Falun Gong practitioners are being held in at least 36 concentration camps in China where they are routinely subject to the forced removals of their organs which are then sold for transplants. The bodies are quickly cremated to destroy all evidence. NA NA RESOLUTION TO: I. Call for the Australian Government to fully support the International Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong (CIPFG), and demand that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) immediately open the doors of all concentration camps, forced labour camps, hospitals, prisons and detention centres throughout the People's Republic of China in order to allow independent teams to investigate the charges of illegal tention, torture and live organ removal for transplants. II. Demand that the CCP regime release all detained Falun Gong practitioners immediately. by Mr Andren (from 100 citizens), Mr Fitzgibbon (from 343 citizens), Ms Hall (from 168 citizens), Mr Jull (from 57 citizens) and Mr Somlyay (from 74 citizens) Immigration: Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament 5.15 pm assembled: Whereas the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following motion: ‘That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking political asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' We, therefore, the individual, undersigned attendees at St Pauls Anglican Church, Ringwood VIC 3134, petition the House of Representatives in support of the above mentioned Motion. AND we, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Barresi (from 4 citizens) Immigration: Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: Whereas the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following motion: ‘That this Synod regrets the Government's adopdetion of procedures for certain people seeking political asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' We, therefore, the individual, undersigned attendees at the Uniting Church Gembrook 3783, petition the House of Representatives in support of the above mentioned Motion. AND we, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Wood (from 6 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The following details have been provided by a long-time reporter who worked for a Japanese non-governmental television news agency and specialised in news on China. In Sujiatun District, Shenyang City, the CCP has established a secret concentration camp, where over 6,000 Falun Gong practitioners are detained. The concentration camp has a crematorium to dispose of bodies. There are also many doctors on site. No detainees have managed to leave the concentration camp alive. Before cremation, the internal organs are all removed from the bodies and sold. The camp is said to hold over 6,000 Falun Gong adherents at any given time, and “nobody has yet to come out” from it alive. According to the source, it contains a crematorium, and an unusually large number of doctors work therereflecting the camp's practice of killing prisoners for their organs, which are then sold for profit. Your petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to: a) Request the Australian government to openly condemn the persecution of Falun Gong by the CCP regime, particularly the horrific practice of harvesting and selling organs of executed practitioners. b) Note that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal DeclaThe ration of Human Rights apply to all Falun Gong practitioners worldwide. c) Note that Australia is one the eight countries that drafted the Declaration of Human Rights, and the Australian government should therefore honour the principles in the Declaration and openly condemn the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners by the CCP regime. by Mr Jull (from 233 citizens) and Mr Somlyay (from 23 citizens) Human Rights: Mr Gao Zhisheng To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House the persecution of renowned Chinese human rights lawyer Mr Gao Zhisheng and the series of relay hunger strikes he has initiated to protest against the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian rule. Thousands of people in China and around the world have rallied to Mr Gao's cause but he is under tremendous pressure from the authorities and has received a death threat from a member of the security services. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House urge China's leadership to immediately: (1) Stop the harassment of Mr Gao and allow his legal practice to resume operation immediately. (2) Guarantee complete freedom of political and religious belief in accordance with the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and China's own constitution. by Ms Burke (from 4,028 citizens) Taiwan: World Health Organisation In support of Taiwan's application to participate in the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organisation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: petition of the undersigned residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House as follows: - that the World Health Organisation's Constitution, states “...the enjoyment of the highest obtainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, political belief, economic, or social condition.” - that Taiwan, with a population of similar size to Australia, has been repeatedly denied participation in the World Health Organisation and World Health Assembly as a result of political pressure from China. - that without access the World Health Organisation's network of services severely impairs the ability of Taiwanese health authorities to respond to and assist in disease outbreaks, thereby endangering the welfare of the people of Taiwan. - that infectious diseases such as avian flu can spread quickly by means such as international air travel, and it is the responsibility all countries to work with the World Health Organisation to control and monitor these diseases, irrespectively of political differences. - that while China claims it represents the people of Taiwan, China does not and cannot represent the needs of the Taiwanese people in the World Health Organisation, World Health Assembly and the United Nations, as they are not the democratically elected government of Taiwan. - that, given Australia has repeatedly displayed to the world its determination to defend democracy (e.g. committing its troops to Iraq and leading the peace keeping mission in East Timor), our Government ought to recognise Taiwan's democratic government and support Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organisation at all levels. - that Taiwan's participation in the World Heath Assembly and the World Health Organisation is paramount, not only for the safety and welfare of the people of Taiwan but also for the rest of the world. The undersigned petitioners therefore respectfully request and plea to the House, that in the interest of fairness, equality and justice for all human beings, politics be set aside and all honourable members give their support to Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly. We further call on the Parliament and the Australian Federal Government to recognize the democratically elected government of Taiwan as a suitable representative of the Taiwanese people to the World Health Organisation. Australia and Australians are known for their respect of human rights, their ideals on democracy and freedom of speech. Please show that we stand for the ideals this country is founded upon and we truly do care by supporting Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organisation. by Ms Burke (from 20 citizens) Mammograms To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. of The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that free mammograms are not accessible by breast cancer survivors despite the increased risk of breast cancer. Access to free mammograms is also being denied to women over 70 years of age in some parts of Australia. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that mammograms are free to all women in Australia regardless of age or medical history. by Ms Hall (from 451 citizens) Whaling To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: Certain citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House: The Howard Government's failure to protect the whale population in Australian waters despite laws passed by the Parliament in 1999 which gave it the power to do so. Your petitioners therefore request the House to call on the Howard Government to: (1) Take all necessary legal steps to enforce Australian laws creating an Australian Whale Sanctuary in the Southern Ocean and making it an offence to kill or injure whales in Australian waters. (2) Stop the slaughter of whales once and for all by taking Japan to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. by Ms Hall (from 305 citizens) Roads: Calder Highway To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws is currently $484.40c a WEEK [in WA] to the attention of the House the dangerous and congested condition of the Calder Highway between the intersections with Sunshine Avenue and Calder Park Drive. We call on the House to: (1) Acknowledge that this section of the Calder Highway is in desperate need of upgrading; (2) Guarantee funding for the construction of proposed interchanges at Kings Road, Calder Park Drive and Sunshine Avenue; (3) Subsequently enable the intersection with Robertsons Road to be closed; and (4) Support general improvements to the Calder Highway. by Mr Brendan O'Connor (from 1,523 citizens) To the Honourable the speaker and the members of the house of representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the house. The difficulty we on pension's and other minimal allowances _ have trying to make ends meet - with the fortnightly amount we are expected to manage with on the pension's. $494 being “the maximum” rate for the single disability pension, for example. [taking into account –one has an empty bank account when first paid]. For age pensioners, each get $410.50 a fortnight. [that's a married couple] Single age pensioner gets $490 a fortnight. If you take into account medical expenses, veterinary cost' s [if you have a pet], vehicle expenses-including fuel [referring to for example a 1984 Falcon], groceries, and other living expenses-including rent, [and those who own their homes of coarse have rates] - Telephone, gas, electricity, water, etc etc etc --. It is the same problem for Age pensioners AND Disability pensioners, Single's and Couple's. The fortnightly amount paid to pensioners is WAY below the minimum working wage._ which and it is actually IMPOSSIBLE to keep up with the ever increasing costs. AND SO we hereby urge the house to grant ALL pensioners an immediate increase. [somewhere closer to the weekly wage]. And we urge also that the twice yearly increases, are more in line with costs at the time of those increases. PLEASE NOTE the last widely acclaimed “pensions increase” on television and newspaper coverage Australia wide ___ of $5 [that's $5 a fortnight] was immediately gobbled up with a notice that private health insurance premiums would be raised by $5.50. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 194 citizens) Pensions Petitions received. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Baha'i Faith In Iran",53
87,Ms GEORGE,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I move: That this House: (1) notes the statement made on 20 March 2006 by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief expressing concern about the treatment of followers of the Baha'i faith in Iran; (2) expresses its grave concern that instructions have been issued to collect information and monitor activities of members of the Baha'i faith in Iran; (3) regards such action as an unacceptable interference with the rights of members of religious minorities; (4) fears that such monitoring could be used as the basis for persecution and discrimination against members of the Baha'i faith; and (5) urges the Government to pursue these concerns with our Embassy and with representatives of the Iranian Government. I submit the motion that appears before us for debate following my meeting with representatives of the Baha'i community in Wollongong, who came along and expressed at that meeting their fears and concerns for the safety of fellow Baha'i followers living in Iran. The motion it places special emphasis on the report by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief issued in March this year, which expressed concern about the treatment of followers of the Baha'i faith in Iran. It expresses grave concern that instructions have been issued to collect information and monitor the activities of members of the Baha'i faith in Iran. It regards such action as an unacceptable interference in the rights of members of religious minorities and fears that such monitoring could be used as the basis for persecution and discrimination against members of the Baha'i faith. Following that meeting, I thought it was important that the issue receive the due attention of the Australian parliament. It is in that regard that I submit the motion on behalf of all followers of the Baha'i faith. There are 13,000 living in Australia, many of whom have ongoing relationships and relatives still in Iran, and they are particularly concerned about their plight. In March this year, as I indicated in my motion, the UN special rapporteur revealed a confidential letter which conveyed high-level instructions from senior Iranian officials at the government level to identify persons who adhere to the Baha'i faith and to monitor their activities. The UN special rapporteur expressed concern that the information so gained would be used as a basis for increased persecution and described the potential monitoring of people as ‘an impermissible and unacceptable interference with the rights of members of religious minorities'. The latest reports come in the wake of mounting attacks on the Baha'i followers published in government sanctioned press, radio and TV broadcasts in Iran. The delegation pointed out to me that these latest developments are part of an ongoing systematic program of persecution against Iran's 300,000 Baha'i community, which is in fact the country's largest non-Muslim religious minority. I was advised that the current campaign of persecution began in 1979 with the coming to power of the Islamic government and that, in the late seventies and early eighties, virtually the entire leadership of the Iranian Baha'i community either was arrested and executed or disappeared. Thousands of Baha'i followers were then fired from their jobs, deprived of pensions and excluded from education. All manner of rights to religious freedom, worship and assembly were abrogated. Interestingly enough at the time, international condemnation of such acts of oppression, including through resolutions of the United Nations, saw changes and improvements in the late 1990s which offered hope to members of the Baha'i community. The government, it appeared, from that time onwards did in fact refrain from the most egregious human rights violations, even though religious intolerance remained. I give as one example the fact that, for more than 25 years, members of the Baha'i community in Iran have been refused entry to university and colleges except in the case where they deny allegiance to their faith, and very few are prepared to do that. Such actions, in the view of all here, would appear inconsistent with long-held human rights and religious freedom commitments made by governments at the international level. As recently as 19 May we saw 55 Baha'i followers arrested in the city of Shiraz. They were teaching classes to underprivileged children as part of a UNICEF community service activity. So the acts of persecution continue. This motion, I know, is above party politics, and the member for Gilmore has asked that I add her name to the comments made today. I ask the government to act urgently on the motion before us. (Time expired)",56
88,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,Is the motion seconded? Mr Wilkie-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,58
89,Mr KEENAN,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I congratulate the member for Throsby on bringing before the House this important motion relating to the Baha'i faith in Iran. comes after reports that the Iranian regime, one that has an extremely poor human rights record, has stepped up its campaign of religious persecution against non-Muslims in that country. This issue was first raised with me by constituents who had fled the persecution of the Iranian regime and who hold grave fears for friends and family who are still in Iran. I investigated the claims that they made me, which were truly horrific. Sadly, those claims were backed up by substantial evidence from independent bodies, including the UNHCR and Amnesty International. In fact, on investigation, what I found exceeded the horror of the stories they had told me. The steps being taken currently by the Iranian government are truly frightening, and those with a good knowledge of history should be extraordinarily worried about the actions of that regime. Specifically, steps being taken to monitor and identify people of the Baha'i faith, combined with an increase in the ferocity of media propaganda vilifying them, are grave cause for concern. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief highlighted some of these concerns on 20 May this year. She outlined to the world an official letter sent on 29 October 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of Iran's Armed Forces to several Iranian government agencies. This letter stated that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had instructed the command headquarters to identify and monitor, in a highly confidential manner, members of the Baha'i faith. She has since expressed her fear that the information gained through such monitoring will be used as a basis for increased persecution and discrimination against members of the Baha'i faith-in gross violation of all international standards. The UN has since issued more than 56 pronouncements condemning Iran's execution It and imprisonment of Baha'i followers solely because of their membership of the Baha'i community and criticising the overt discrimination of this religious community by Iran's government. Amnesty International supports these concerns. It has written to the head of Iran's judiciary to express concern at continuing abuses committed against the country's Baha'i community. It has urged him to ento sure that no-one is imprisoned on account of their religious or cultural identity or because of their peaceful activities in support of their community. Amnesty International has criticised the increasing pattern of harassment of the Baha'i community, which has seen at least 66 Baha'i followers arrested since the beginning of 2005-apparently on account of their identity as Baha'i or because of their peaceful activities on behalf of the Baha'i community. Amnesty believes that in recent months members of Iran's Baha'i community have been attacked repeatedly by unidentified assailants and Baha'i cemeteries and holy sites have been vandalised and destroyed. Some Baha'i followers have had their homes confiscated by authorities. Baha'is are generally subject to discriminatory laws and regulations that limit their access to employment and to benefits such as pensions. For many years young people belonging to the Baha'i community have been denied access to higher education by an official requirement that applicants state their allegiance to Islam or one of three other recognised religions. History tells us that identiin fying and then vilifying minorities in this way can be the beginning of increasing persecution. Given the situation as it now stands, the Baha'is in Iran can only be living in fear about what these measures might mean in practice. I do not think this parliament or the world in general should keep quiet. We need to ensure that the principles of freedom, respect, dignity, equality and justice are upheld in Iran for the Baha'i minority. I would also congratulate the Australian government on making representations, on behalf of the Baha'i community, to the Iranian authorities. I conclude by commending again the member for Throsby for bringing this very important motion before the House. (Time expired)",58
90,Mr WILKIE,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I would associate myself strongly with the member for Throsby's motion regarding the Baha'i faith in Iran. In doing so, I speak today on behalf of the Baha'i spiritual assemblies of Belmont, Canning, Victoria Park and South Perth in my electorate of Swan. I met with a delegation from the Baha'i spiritual assemblies in my electorate office a fortnight ago and I would sincerely thank Dianne Massoudi, Lai Loh, Houman Milani and Oscar Domingo for raising their concerns directly with me. The United Nations statement of 20 March concerning the treatment of Baha'i followers in Iran is a disturbing document. Given some of the odious comments emanating recently from the Iranian leadership, it certainly enforces the view that Iran is continuing its slide into the practices of a totalitarian state. Freedom of religion and freedom to practise spiritual beliefs-indeed, freedom not to subscribe to a religion-remain some of the most inalienable rights of society and the individual. As we have heard, there are around 300,000 members of the Baha'i faith Iran; however, they are not recognised as a religious minority and do not have the right to practise their religion. As the International Federation of Human Rights noted in 2003: Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, approximately 300,000 Baha'is in Iran are considered ‘unprotected infidels ... non-persons' with ‘no legal rights or protection'. They have no right to receive pensions, be employed in the civil service, inscribe a name on the tombs of their dead, inherit, or gather for religious worship. Their holy sites and cemeteries have been destroyed. Many Baha'is have had their belongings confiscated. Employers are pressured to dismiss their Baha'i employees. It was troubling to read last week that, as recently as 19 May, 54 Baha'is were arrested by Iranian officials in the city of Shiraz. Most of the arrested Baha'is were young teachers who were educating underprivileged children in a school, as part of a UNICEF community service activity. At the time of their arrest, they had a letter of permission to teach from the Islamic Council of Shiraz. These arrests come against the backdrop, as I said, of increasing concern and evidence that the Iranian government is escalating its harassment and victimisation of Baha'i followers. The UN statement in March released news of a secret October 2005 letter from the Iranian military high command ordering police and revolutionary units to ‘identify' and ‘monitor' members of the Baha'i community. The letter states that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had ordered this monitoring to take place. It is with some gall that the Iranian Embassy here in Canberra delivered a letter to members last week which included a copy of the rather bizarre correspondence from Iranian President Mahmood Ahmadinejad to US President George Bush. The letter states: We increasingly see that people around the world are flocking towards a main focal point-that is the Almighty God. Undoubtedly through faith in God and the teachings of the prophets, the people will conquer their problems ... It continues: Whether we like it or not, the world is gravitating towards faith in the Almighty and justice and the will of God will prevail over all things. The hypocrisy of this letter is quite staggering. The Iranian President dares to harangue the United States on religion, while Iranian authorities preside over the religious persecution of the Baha'is. The Iranian President also lectures: History tells us that repressive and cruel governments do not survive.  nately they can survive long enough to commit or condone atrocious acts of victimisation, murder and genocide. I call again on the government to raise the concerns of the Baha'i assemblies in my electorate with representatives of the Iranian government.",59
91,Mr BROADBENT,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"My local spiritual assembly of the Baha'is of Cardinia Shire wrote to me on 29 March this year, seeking to inform me of the situation faced by the Baha'i faith living in Iran. They feared that the Baha'i people in Iran faced imminent danger and wanted to bring this to the attention of the Australian government and their local member. I want to particularly thank Hasan Sabet and Kris Bernard from the Cardinia assembly for raising this with me, as their local member and as a representative of the federal government. I also thank them for arranging a gettogether with the representative group of Baha'is in Pakenham recently. I share the member for Throsby's deep concern over the Iranian government's treatment of the Baha'i people. In Australia we have prohibitions against a government controlling or mandating for a particular religion under section 116 of our Constitution. We are a signatory to international conventions that safeguard the behaviour of states towards human rights. We are a free and democratic society where the idea of a state owned and run newspaper deliberately inciting hatred and violence against a particular group of people based on their religious beliefs seems foreign to us. Following the 1979 Islamic revolution, the Baha'is say that hundreds of their faith have been executed and jailed by the Iranian government. Despite the Iranian government vehemently denying this, there have been documented cases by news services, governments and international human rights groups supporting these claims. The Baha'i people are a religious minority. Worldwide, it is estimated their followers number around five million. The largest population of Baha'is live in India and number around 2.2 million, and the next largest population live in Iran, where there are around 350,000 Baha'i followers. The Britannica Book of the Year accounts that the Baha'i faith is established in 247 countries throughout the world. Its members represent over 2,100 ethnic, racial and tribal groups, its scriptures have been translated into over 800 languages and the Baha'is are very proud of their multi-ethnic composition. On 20 March this year, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief released a report into the persecution of the Baha'i people. The report detailed a confidential letter sent on 29 October 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces in Iran to a number of government agencies that gave instructions to monitor the activities of the Baha'i people. The special rapporteur expressed her grave concerns in the report. The report refers to the special rapporteur as being ‘apprehensive about the initiative to monitor the activities of individuals merely because they adhere to a religion that differs from the state religion'. It says: She considers that such monitoring constitutes an impermissible and unacceptable interference with the rights of members of religious minorities. The report continues: She also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Baha'i faith, in violation of international standards. This is also evidenced by other documented cases that we do not have time to go into now. Since the beginning of 2005, according to Reuters news service, there have been more than 125 arrests. The state owned and run newspaper, the Kayhan, and its role in the persecution of the Baha'is is also of major concern. Baha'i people have been arrested whilst partaking in study groups and barred from attending university, they have had their homes ransacked and they have been banned from taking government jobs. In fact one United States congress report states that, since 1979, Iranian government authorities have killed more than 200 Baha'i leaders and that more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs. Despite the disturbing state of current affairs, these incidents have not gone unnoticed in the international community. Amnesty International and the United Nations have been closely following the deteriorating situation facing the Baha'is in Iran. In December 2005, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution condemning Iran's poor human rights record. I am proud to say that Australia was a co-sponsor of that motion. The Australian government has also been monitoring this and has taken some action. The Australian government has raised the issue with the Iranian Ambassador to Australia, and our embassy in Tehran has made representations to the Iranian government. In addition to this, in December 2005 Australia co-sponsored the proposition before the UN General Assembly that I have already raised. There has also been a disturbing rise in the incidence of anti-Semitism in Iran. Of particular note is the increase in official government policy that singles out members of the Jewish community and defames them. I deplore strongly the persecution of anyone based simply on the foundation of that person expressing or practising their faith, particularly the Baha'is. In this motion today I particularly and wholeheartedly implore the Iranian government to stop persecuting the Baha'i people and to allow people of all persuasions to be able to practise their religion freely.",60
92,Mr EDWARDS,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I was recently visited by members of the Baha'i community who came to my office to express concern over the persecution of members of their faith in Iran. Indeed, they expressed serious concerns for the safety of family members and loved ones living in Iran who are members of the Baha'i faith. I choose not to disclose their names. However, they sought my advice as to what action could be taken at a federal level to seek Australian government intervention in the persecution of members of the faith in Iran and to see if the federal government could use its influence to assist those being persecuted. I compliment Jennie George, the member for Throsby, for bring this motion forward today, and I am extremely pleased with the bipartisan support it has attracted. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already tried to use his influence to put a strong case to the Iranian authorities to stop the persecution. I would simply encourage him, the government and the United Nations to persist in their representations to try to ensure that the Iranians live up to their human rights responsibilities. I also suggested to the Baha'i people who came to visit me that they should approach the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and seek an opportunity for their spokespeople to visit the House and to put directly to the Human Rights Subcommittee their concerns and to put on the record the issues they wish to raise. What are some of the things that the Baha'i people believe in? There are two or three things that I would like to quickly mention. They say this: Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and disputes to vanish from the face of the earth, give birth to spirituality, and bring life and each heart. They also say this: ... religious, racial, national, and political prejudices, all are subversive of the foundation of human society, all lead to bloodshed, all heap ruin upon mankind. So long as these remain, the dread of war will continue. The last one I want to quote is this: All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization ... To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of man. Those virtues that befit his dignity are forbearance, mercy, compassion and loving-kindness towards all the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In previous years when there has been this persecution of people of the Baha'i faith in Iran, the people of the world, the United Nations and governments like Australia's have banded together and strongly pressured the Iranian authorities to leave the Baha'i people alone. This has worked to some varying degree in the past. It is of extreme concern that we now see the Iranian authorities escalating their persecution of the Baha'i people. I know other members have referred to recent articles, including one that was on the Baha'i World News Service as recently as 24 May, that report that Iranian officials have arrested 54 Baha'is in the city of Shiraz. I downloaded that from the internet and on the first page of that news coverage was a beautiful photograph of three Baha'i youth who were arrested in Shiraz on 19 May. I understand that a number of the people who were arrested have been released. Unfortunately, these three young women are not among them. I offer my thoughts and hopes to them and to other people who are being persecuted by this authoritarian regime. I would simply hope that the beliefs and principles of the Baha'i, which call for mercy, compassion and loving kindness, might be visited upon those people who were recently arrested.",61
93,Dr SOUTHCOTT,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"There are 300,000 to 350,000 followers of the Baha'i faith in Iran, and they face systematic discrimination from the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Members of the Baha'i faith are denied admission to colleges and universities, and they have been dismissed midstream from university. In 1998 college classes were raided and equipment was confiscated. Baha'i holy sites have been destroyed in Iran. Over 200 members of the Baha'i faith have been killed since the early 1980s and over 1,000 have been imprisoned. There have recently appeared in Kayhan, the official Tehran newspaper, defamatory and inflammatory articles about the Baha'i faith. What is particularly disturbing is that this was done before, in previous government campaigns of persecution in 1955 and 1979. Respected Middle East scholar and commentator Bernard Lewis has demonstrated that the persecution of religious minorities was never a part of classical Islam-that in fact Christian communities and other religious minorities existed peacefully within the original caliphate of Islam in the seventh and eight centuries and so on. Like the previous speaker, I was able to meet with members of the local Baha'i community in my electorate last month. They alerted me to the recent report by the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief. That report of 20 March outlines that a confidential letter was sent on 29 October 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran to government agencies asking them to identify persons of the Baha'i faith and to monitor their activities. To take some excerpts from the statement issued by the special rapporteur, she said that she has: ... long been concerned by the systematic discrimination against members of the Baha'i community. And that: ... the situation with regard to religious minorities is, in fact, deteriorating. She calls on the government of Iran to refrain from categorising individuals according to their religion and to ensure that members of all religious minorities are free to hold and practise their religious beliefs. This recent report of the UN special rapporteur highlights some serious concerns that the registering and monitoring of members of the Baha'i faith could potentially be presaging some government campaign of persecution. The Australian government has long been concerned about the human rights situation in Iran. On 2 November last year I was able to give a statement on human rights situations on behalf of Australia to the third committee of the United Nations. Along with concern about the human rights situation in Burma, North Korea and Zimbabwe, the statement said: Australia remains concerned by the human rights situation in Iran, including ongoing suppression of freedom of expression, discrimination against women and minority groups (including the Baha'i community, Christians, Jews, and Kurds) and deficiencies in the administration of justice ... We urge Iran to engage further with the United Nations and the international community on human rights issues. This was part of a United Nations General Assembly resolution on human rights. Since then, the Australian government has raised this issue with the Iranian Ambassador to Australia and our embassy in Tehran has made representations directly to the Iranian government. President Ahmadinejad's 2005 statement calling for Israel to be ‘wiped off the map', Iran's pursuit of uranium enrichment at Natanz and its persecution of religious minorities, including the Baha'i, are all deeply troubling and of great concern. Australia needs to continue to condemn all of these actions. We need to increase the international pressure on Iran to be a responsible international citizen. I commend the member for Throsby for moving this motion and having it debated in a bipartisan way. Motions like this are very important for raising international awareness of Iranian actions and, hopefully, curbing Iran's human rights violations.",62
94,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. United Nations and Darfur,63
95,Mr BAIRD,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I move: That this House calls on the United Nations to: (1) substantially increase the level of aid to the Darfur region of the Sudan; (2) call upon member nations to provide peacekeeping forces to quell the civil war currently taking place in the country; (3) lift the profile of this catastrophic situation that confronts Darfur and the conflict which has already claimed 300,000 lives and seen 2.4 million people displaced; (4) work effectively with the NGOs to ensure a substantial lift in the level of privately sourced aid going to the region; and (5) ensure that maximum cooperation is given to peace negotiations. As the House would be aware, the humanitarian disaster occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan only continues to worsen. The plight of the people of this region should resonate with every member of the House, as it should with every member country of the United Nations. It is almost beyond belief that this wanton murder, this genocide, of innocent people by armed militias could occur in our time. From within Australia, it is hard to picture the terror these people suffer in their daily existence. It is hard to imagine the feeling of waiting for the next raid by Janjaweed militias, not knowing if you, your spouse or your children will be the next to be murdered in the name of sectarian violence. It is more than 2½ years since the crisis began. The western region of Darfur is recognised as being a monumental humanitarian disaster. It is estimated that 300,000 people have been killed in this conflict and an additional 2.4 million people have been displaced over three years. On average, 60,000 people a year have been killed, which is far beyond the tolerance of most people. To put this in context, the number of people killed every day in the western region of Darfur is more than the total number of members of the House. Unfortunately, the situation continues to deteriorate. People are still dying in vast numbers from violence, malnutrition and disease. While humanitarian access has improved to a very moderate degree, we are not seeing a corresponding decrease in the mortality rates in this region. The international community is failing to protect these people adequately. Pressure must be brought to bear on the government in Khartoum to disarm the Janjaweed and restore order and peace. I call on this House to make the strongest representations possible for the UN to act swiftly and strongly, for this is quite simply a matter of life and death. As the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, it is our moral duty to pressure the United Nations, of which Australia was a formation member, to markedly increase foreign aid and to ready a large international peacekeeping force to quell the violence. Some of the refugee camps are reputedly home to more than 100,000 people who are living in the most squalid and distressing conditions. This conflict has already claimed more than 300,000 innocent lives. The international community stood back and watched the senseless destruction in Rwanda, which is still reeling and scarred from its experience. After Rwanda, the world promised that it would never again sit on its hands and watch a systemic genocide, yet the Sudan already closely resembles Rwanda. Without a huge international effort and a strong commitment to a peaceable solution, the situation will continue to worsen. The Australian government has already committed strongly to resolving the problems in Darfur. Over the past two years Australia has spent more than $50 million to help displaced people in Sudan. Just last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced another $5 million in Australian support for Darfur and $2 million for southern Sudan. This money will be used to provide more emergency food through the World Food Program and UNICEF. The international community has resolved on numerous occasions to call on the government of Sudan to allow full access to Darfur for peacekeepers and aid. The crisis in Darfur will be solved not by war, but rather by a properly negotiated political solution that addresses the underlying cause of the conflict. Australia has strongly supported UN Security Council action on Sudan, including the establishment of the UN Mission in Sudan, UNMIS, and assisted the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, which was signed in January 2005. We have contributed 15 specialist ADF personnel and 10 Federal Police officers to the UN mission. Now that the government of Sudan has signed a peace agreement with the main rebel group, there is no basis for it to delay to place conditions on a transition. But it continues to stall. There is a need to work more closely with NGOs to find a political settlement to the problem. Doctors Without Borders, Amnesty International, World Vision, the Red Cross and a wide array of other organisations are working tirelessly in Sudan and it is vital that they receive the strongest possible support from the international community. Already, the balance of Australia's funding for Darfur is ceded to various international NGOs. The government also provides support to several Australian NGOs working in Sudan. However, some of these projects have recently been scaled back as staff have had to be withdrawn due to the ever increasing threat of violence toward aid workers. A number of aid workers have been killed and injured over the last few months. The situation in Darfur is so serious that we, as legislators-and Australians, as human beings with compassion-are beholden to do all we can to push toward a solution to this dreadful conflict. Genocide is not a domestic affair; it affects the whole world. I call upon the House to recognise the importance of the situation in Darfur and to call for the appropriate steps to be taken to restore peace and order in one of the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries. I commend this motion to the House.",63
96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,Is the motion seconded? Mr Georgiou-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,65
97,Ms ROXON,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I strongly support this motion and congratulate the member for Cook for again bringing this matter on Darfur to national and international attention and to the attention of this parliament. I know many members across the parliament feel strongly about the need to and take more action. Without continually raising this issue through motions such as this, we cannot apply sufficient pressure-and we must keep applying that pressure-on the Sudanese government and international bodies. Of course, we must also urge our own government to continue its action to see whether there is anything else we can do to stop the great hardship we see occurring. The origins of this conflict, between government sponsored Arab militias and two rebel groups-the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudanese Liberation Movement-are many. While the political conflict emerged after attacks by rebel groups on government targets, the recruitment of Arab militias by the Sudanese government to attack villages added a very ugly ethnic dimension to an already ugly dispute. Some commentators have also pointed to the competition for land and water resources between nomadic and sedentary tribes in the region as contributing to the conflict. But, whilst the origins are complex-and we can go through them many times-there is no shortage of evidence that the conflict in Darfur continues to have an absolutely appalling humanitarian cost. Staggeringly, the World Health Organisation estimates that up to 10,000 people die of disease and violence each month. I note the member for Cook cited some other figures. In any case, the figures are staggering. On top of this, currently 1.8 million displaced people cannot return to their homes and are living in fear. In Australia we have a new and heightened investment to resolve this crisis, with the growing number of refugees arriving on our shores from the region. I have quite a large Sudanese population living in Gellibrand and I want to ensure that Australia plays its role in making Sudan safe for their extended families and in helping them to see an end to the conflict and crisis in their home country. I want to speak about a particularly disturbing aspect of this conflict: the use of sexual and gender based violence against Darfurian women and girls. Not only have women been subjected to gross violence when being driven from their homes and villages but it seems they are also not safe in refugee camps, where there are reports of ongoing harassment and extreme violence against women. We must call on all sides of this conflict to end this shocking treatment. makes you ask: where on earth has our humanity gone? The violence, the fear and the attacks on the most vulnerable must stop. These gross violations of human rights must be stopped, and this motion calls upon the international community to provide extra resolve and resources to do so. I urge the United Nations to increase the level of aid to the region and ask the Sudanese government to commit to ensuring the safety of aid workers. I commend the African Union mission in Sudan and other groups who work in very strained circumstances. I acknowledge the work they have done in the face of limited resources and immense challenges. Without a properly resourced peacekeeping force in the region, the conditions for administering aid are becoming just too dangerous. The UN's most recent humanitarian profile of Darfur states that the accessibility of the population to UN aid workers has dropped dramatically. In January 2006 it had dropped to 72 per cent of the population, which is well below what was achieved in the middle of 2005 and leaves nearly a third of the population without much-needed assistance. I add my voice to the call for the United Nations to provide peacekeeping forces to the region. This cannot be seen, as is sometimes suggested, as a statement of Western imperialism; it is one of global humanismmore must be done to stem the tide of extensive human suffering caused by this conflict. I also urge the Sudanese government to accept the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces to stem this violence in Darfur. Further, it is imperative that peace negotiations continue, to ensure that an inclusive peace agreement is reached. While I commend the signing of a peace accord in May this year, I remain concerned about its It chances of success given that the smaller rebel groups remain outside the process. I fear that there can be no lasting peace in Darfur without an inclusive agreement. Through this issue coming to the attention of the House, I hope that this parliament, our government, the international community and the government of Sudan will all redouble their efforts to do whatever they can to stop this humanitarian crisis from growing to an even greater scale. I commend the motion to the House.",65
98,Mr GEORGIOU,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"Kooyong) (5.57 pm)I commend the member for Cook for moving this motion on Darfur and acknowledge the comments of the member for Gellibrand. She made some very important points which demonstrate that this is a bipartisan issue. From 2003 onwards, the conflict in Darfur has created an immense humanitarian challenge for the world. The military actions of the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militias have seen vast outrages committed against the civilians of Darfur. At least 300,000 have died, millions have been displaced and more than 600 villages have been destroyed. The United Nations holds the government and the Janjaweed forces responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, forced displacement and rape. These waves of violence in Darfur require United Nations action to end the fighting and protect the vulnerable. Efforts thus far to end the violence have been unavailing. The force of fewer than 7,000 African Union peacekeepers currently deployed in Darfur lacks a mandate to prevent violence and finds it difficult to work in the volatile cirbrought cumstances it faces. This was dramatically illustrated by the capture of 18 African Union personnel by rebels in October last year. The 2004 UN Geneva fundraising conference for the provision of aid raised $US126 million, well short of the stated target of $US236 million. Clearly, more needs to be done both through peacekeeping and through the level of aid. There is an urgent need for the UN to commit peacekeeping troops to Darfur for the purpose of quelling violence and relieving human suffering. The UN Security Council has just this month unanimously called for the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to take over progressively from the African Union peacekeepers. This is a welcome development, but obstacles do remain. It is estimated the UN peacekeepers could not be deployed before September, even if the Sudanese government agreed to cooperate, and UN member states have not yet committed the resources to the proposed force. Meanwhile, appalling crimes are still being committed against ordinary people in Darfur. If the UN is to be a relevant and effective body, member states have to commit the resources that are essential for the United Nations to implement the Security Council resolution. The United Nations peacekeepers must be supported by United Nations efforts to ensure that maximum cooperation is given to peace negotiations by parties to the conflict. Previous attempts to engineer peace in the region have been unsuccessful. The Sudanese government explicitly excluded guerrillas from Darfur from negotiations that resulted in the January 2005 comprehensive peace agreement. Consequently, while civil war in the south of Sudan ended, conflict in Darfur continued. More recently, the 5 May 2006 peace accord between the Sudanese government and the major rebel force has not the killing to an end. In any event, it was rejected by other rebel groups. The UN should move the parties away from temporary tactical ceasefires and towards a long term peace agreement. Despite repeated appeals to donors in May, the World Food Program reported that, to date, it has received only $317.8 million, or 42.6 per cent, of the $746 million required to provide food assistance to 6.1 million people in Sudan this year, causing it to reduce rations by half. The World Food Program has been alerting donors, from as early as November 2005, of the urgent need for food assistance to the affected population at the right time and for pre-positioning purposes before the rainy season. The UN cannot substantially provide the requisite level of aid unless member states provide the resources. I note the member for Cook's recitation of the aid given to Darfur and the Sudan by the Australian government. I commend the efforts of United Nations officials and non-government organisations in continuing to press national states, the media and the community at large to respond to the plight of the people in Darfur. I wish to make special mention of non-governmental agencies that have been involved in relieving the suffering in the Sudan for keeping the issue at the forefront of international knowledge. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",66
99,Mr DANBY,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"I find myself again congratulating the member for Cook for his initiative in bringing this motion before the House, which I remember we discussed in February 2005the same issue, regrettably. Six million African Muslims live in the Darfur region of Sudan. It is a scandal that the genocide persists there and continues to disgrace the international community for our inaction. Estimates of deaths in Darfur range from 200,000 to 400,000. More than two million people have had to flee their homes, with up to half a million now languishing in refugee camps in Chad. More personal reflection on the destruction of the entire lifestyle in Darfur was brilliantly portrayed by Eric Reeves in The New Republic of 5 May this year, when he wrote: The attacks were comprehensive and revealed a rich understanding of what was most likely to destroy the future ability of African groups to live in Darfur. Irrigation systems were destroyed. Water wells were poisoned with human and animal corpses. Pottery vessels were broken to make carrying water impossible. Food stocks were annihilated. Cattle were killed or looted. Fruit trees were cut down or burned. Agricultural tools were smashed. Mosques or Korans desecrated. Buildings torched. Of course, the people were displaced, raped and killed. Estimates of how many have died are between 200,000 and 400,000. One of the most deplorable aspects of the Darfur situation is the slow and inadequate response of the international community. The African Union, the Arab League, the European Union, the UN and NATO have all at times considered interventions but, for various reasons, all have failed to make any decisive impact on the situation. Primary responsibility should rest with the African Union and the Arab League. At least the African Union deserves credit for taking the lead in efforts to restore security to Darfur, but it is poorly resourced and too deeply committed to other trouble spots to enable it to deploy a large enough force. Human Rights Watch has called on the African Union to increase its deployment from 1,500 troops to 12,000 troops. The Arab League has decided to support the Khartoum regime rather than to do anything to help the black Muslim people of Darfur. Human Rights Watch commented recently on the Arab League's role: The Arab League has condemned attacks on civilians, but it has remained silent about Sudan's atrocities in Darfur. Khartoum has used its diplomatic skills to pressure the League into overlooking Sudan's abuses in Darfur. In 2004, the League dispatched to Darfur its own Commission of Inquiry, which condemned violations of human rights by the militias. But following protests by Sudan, the League downplayed the commission's findings. The motion moved by the honourable member for Cook calls on the United Nations to do a variety of things, including deploying peacekeeping forces to Darfur. I wish I could share the honourable member's optimism that the UN can or will respond in the way it should. It is a sad fact of international affairs today that the unholy alliance of China, Russia and France nearly always stands in the way of any effective action against regimes which grossly abuse human rights. Whether it is in Iran, Belarus, North Korea or Burma, it always seems to be one or all of the three above that help to prop up oppressive regimes and to prevent effective action against them. In the case of UN Security Council inaction on Darfur, Amnesty International has reported that Russia, China and France are all heavy investors in developing the Sudanese oil industry and are selling arms to the Sudanese regime. The MiG fighter jets which were used to attack Darfur villages in 2003-04 were sold to Sudan by the Russians, who are also building an oil pipeline in Sudan. Amnesty also reports that the French have sold large quantities of military equipment to Sudan in recent years. The French corporation Total holds the rights to an oil concession in southern Sudan. Total is also heavily involved in Burma and has been frequently accused of propping up the Burmese regime for its own commercial interests. And what of China's role in Darfur? I would like to quote a letter to the Washington Post from Roberta Cohen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute: China is Sudan's largest trading partner and the main foreign investor in Sudan's oil industry. China National Petroleum Corp. has a 40 percent share in the international consortium extracting oil in Sudan, and it is building refineries and pipelines, enabling Sudan to benefit from oil export revenue since 1999. Although most Western oil companies have withdrawn from Sudan under pressure from human rights organizations, Chinese companies have turned a blind eye to the brutal way in which Sudan forced 200,000 to 300,000 of its citizens from oil-rich lands without compensation. Nor have these companies shown concern that Sudan uses oil revenue to purchase arms for its wars against its black African population. The prospective Chinese veto at the Security Council is the key factor that has prevented the UN from declaring what is happening in Darfur to be genocide. This policy failure is a poor reflection on that important international organisation. Like the member for Kooyong, I want to commend a number of international organisations for assisting the oppressed people of Darfur such as Medecins sans Frontieres, Human Rights Watch and others. These organisations have played an important role in preventing the genocide in Darfur. (Time expired)",68
100,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"It is a pleasure to join in this motion on Darfur, but the subject matter is something that appals all members of the House. I congratulate the member for Cook for raising it. Although it is a small part to play in a debate such as this, I think it is important that members of the House continue to focus on the international crisis in Darfur. I congratulate the member for Melbourne Ports on having raised some of the inadequacies in the international community's response. It is something that Australia, I am proud to say, is playing a very strong part in trying to correct. As members of this House, we need to focus on it and to continue raising our voices against the inadequate response we have seen so far from the world community. In 2004 the United Nations termed this the world's worse humanitarian crisis. Our effort in Sudan has been quite focused. The signing of a comprehensive peace agreement in January 2005 heralded a cessation in the 21year-long, north-south civil war in southern Sudan. The civil war in Sudan concerns disputation between the mainly Muslim north and the non-Muslim south and has resulted in a huge death toll, which we have heard about from members. As I said, Australia has played an important part in endeavouring to get involved by supporting the UN and other missions in Sudan. The current effort is the UN mission in Sudan, for which Australia is providing 15 specialist ADF personnel. With the peace agreement between the government and the main rebel group in place, there is no basis for the government of Sudan to delay and place conditions on a transition. The Australian government has strongly supported two Security Council resolutions-1591 and 1593 of March 2005-which impose an arms embargo and establish a no-fly zone over Darfur. There has also been resolution 1672 of 25 April 2006, which imposes financial and travel sanctions on four individuals because of their activities in Darfur. We have seen genocide in Darfur. We have seen an incredible tragedy unfolding there, and that is having an impact on the flow of refugees to Australia. We have seen that in my electorate, immediately to the west, in Toowoomba, with a growing Sudanese refugee population. I think it is timely to congratulate the local community on their efforts to accommodate these people and support them. We have seen articles highlighting some of the problems in Sudan and their ramifications. A recent article in the Bulletin and Newsweek on 11 April this year highlighted the fact that 30,000 black African refugees have settled in Australia since 2000-01 and that the Sudanese have accounted for well over half of these people. The rest is made of smaller numbers of people from Liberia, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Congo and Eritrea. This is a challenge for local communities such as those around Toowoomba and Gatton in my electorate. It is a huge cultural jump for these people, and I pay credit to Christian and other organisations that are putting such a big effort into supporting and giving them a new start in our country. I would like to finish by summing up what has been happening in Sudan. We have seen a divided government in Khartoum and long-term tension and hostilities in Darfur. We have seen uncertainty and unpredictability in the government's negotiations with the rebels. We have seen political difficulties confronting efforts to influence the Sudanese government and the limited capabilities of anyone involved in the exercise to monitor the force there and to effectively mitigate what is an unfolding crisis. (Time expired)",69
101,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,"Certainly members on both sides of the House are in screaming agreement with the sentiments expressed in the motion on Darfur. As others have recognised, the honourable member for Cook has raised this issue on many occasions. The latest statements from the World Food Program, the UN authority dealing with the food crisis, are certainly alarming. Three million people in Darfur and three million others in south and east Sudan are currently having their rations reduced by half. James Morris, the executive director, described this order as ‘one of the hardest decisions' of his life. It is a season in the year when rains would normally hit, but obviously no food is growing and crops are not available. Many members have criticised the government of President Omar Hasan Ahmad alBashir. Even recently it tried to delay an assessment team from entering the region; it up refused to respond to their requests. I represent an electorate with a historically very high Sudanese population. I have attended functions celebrating the overall national peace treaty as opposed to what is happening in the Darfur region. I have been very in the volved with members of my community who were very pleased that the forces of John them Garang were able to come to an accommodation. However, I was impressed by an article very recently in the Guardian Weekly by Jonathan Steele which said that, whilst we have all been very critical-including meof the actions of the Janjaweed, a militia which has close connections with the Sudanese regime in essentially destroying villages, poisoning wells, raping, taking cattle et cetera, the situation has become somewhat more complex in the last year or so. Even Jack Straw, the former UK foreign minister, urged the rebel forces in Darfur to be more accommodating and reasonable in negotiations. It is interesting to note that, when the Security Council last put international travel bans on four people, two of them, I think for the first occasion, came from rebel forces. In his article, Jonathan Steele made the point: One-sided international media treatment of the crisis may have emboldened the rebels to increase their demands. In many forgotten conflicts, the TV and commentary spotlights help to sound the alarm and bring pressure for action. In the Darfur case, they could be having a pernicious effect be delaying the chance of ending the killing. So, whilst historically there is no doubt about the guilt of the central authorities in Khartoum and their proxy militias, we have to be aware that, in some senses, in recent months there have been some indications of atrocities committed by the rebel forces. We have to try to ensure that there is a balance and a continuing pressure for negotiations. The Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said on 16 February in Abuja during negotiations that ‘an end to the haggling and posturing and a start to real action' was necessary. There are, of course, a number of issues here. There is the need to expedite the supply of food. The logistics sometimes require many months and transportation costs are incredible. At the moment, it would seem that the Western world has not been supportive enough. Because of a very strong proDarfur lobby in the United States, the US has been more proactive in providing foreign aid than they usually are, and that should be recognised. However, whilst we sit here and talk about the food crisis, I think we have to be also mindful of the need for the Western world to act with regard to armaments.",70
102,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,REQUEST THE HOUSE TO INITIATE A,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Area Consultative Committees,71
103,Mr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Scullin) (6.17 pm)Throughout my life in public office I have always been concerned about the delivery of government policies. One of the best ways, especially at the national level, is to have an and overarching national policy about the way we go about our business but that we put in place processes that enable appropriate devices that would allow those policies to be implemented at the local level. One of the important things is to identify a regional unit that will allow that to happen. Members of this chamber, predominantly National Party members, have laughed when I have talked about my region and said that I belong to a region within metropolitan Melbourne that is as important as any other rural or remote region. If we look at the way in which we operate, it is important that we seek a level of service and policy delivery that is appropriate. One of the clear examples of that has been the work of the area consultative committees. I think it is unfortunate that, as I rise tonight, there is under consideration by the government a proposal to amalgamate the five Melbourne metropolitan ACCs. The real risk here is that we throw out 11 years of success from these five ACCs. Tonight I particularly want to talk about the work of the Northern Melbourne ACC, the NACC, because that is the one that I know the best. The point is that I cannot think of any stage where the business of any of the five ACCs has been questioned. They have gone about their business in what I would describe as a definite bipartisan way. When, for instance, surrounding the last election, the opposition had concerns about money administered under the Regional Partnerships program it was not about the work within these regions. These are examples where ACCs have been successful. I think that we greatly risk throwing out all pluses in the structure in Melbourne by replacing them with one ACC. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Baressi, from the region of Melbourne that you represent, and the Minister for Small Business and Tourism at the table, who has an electorate that overlaps part of my region and that has other regions in it, that you both understand the importance of these ACCs and the way that they have operated in Melbourne. It is of concern that at a ministerial level the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Truss, has bypassed consultation with opposition members and we understand that, in consultation with government members, they have indicated their great concern at this proposal. In referring to the work of the NACC, we are not talking about projects of the ilk of Tumbi Creek or the Beaudesert railway; we are talking about projects, endeavours and works that have had a definite impact. Minister Bailey was involved in the work the NACC undertook to make sure that the Melbourne wholesale market came to the site of Epping. Mr Deputy Speaker, you understand that this was a battle between the western region and the northern region of Melbourne. Distinctly, this is an example of important regional differences. This was not a wasted effort. People who see themselves as being from the west put a case for the market's relocation to Werribee while those that were championing the north thought it should go to Epping. This proposal will have a great impact on the whole of the northern region. It was not about its going to Epping in the City of Whittlesea; the impact was felt by all the municipalities that now make up the northern ACC-Banyule, Darebin, Hume, Moreland, Nillumbik, Whittlesea and Yarra. There are some distinctly metropolitan municipalities and three of the outer urban fringe municipalities, but they are able to and the can work together through the work of the NACC. This government have to understand that, even though they trot out figures that indicate that they believe they can save operational costs by reducing the five ACCs to one, they are completely misunderstanding the way in which these ACCs have worked within metropolitan Melbourne and the multiplier effect that they have had not only in administering projects under a federal program like Regional Partnerships but also by involving themselves with other sources of funding, the private sector and the institutional sector. As the Northern ACC indicates, it sets out to make sure that business, training institutions and schools all have a place to come together to thrash out proposals that make sure that we have local solutions to local challenges and problems. For instance, there is a flow-on from not only the relocation of the Melbourne fresh produce markets to Epping but also the way in which there are logistics centres at the point where the Hume Highway meets metropolitan Melbourne and where the railway meets metropolitan Melbourne. Freight and logistics are very important to elements of the northern metropolitan region. Recently, a proposal was funded under Regional Partnerships through the Northern Metropolitan ACC. It is called ‘Freight train: delivering for the transport and logistics industry'. Simply put, this is a distinct local solution to a local challenge. There now exists employment opportunities for people such as disadvantaged job seekers, young people and people that need retraining. If we look at the funding of this, we will see that the Regional Partnerships funding is $267,000 but the project cofunding amounts to $773,000. These are proposals that have come up characteristically through these metropolitan ACCs that have not required 100 per cent funding but have achieved a great multiplier effect because of the networks that have been created. I really believe-and this is my grievance tonightthat we will lose this great advantage because of some bean counter who has decided that there is some element of savings that be made on operational costs without looking at outcomes. The minister's letter to the ACCs talks about operation costs as against the amount of money that has been allocated under Regional Partnerships. That is a very unfair comparison, given that Regional Partnerships is so skewed towards rural and remote regions. That is a decision of government; that is okay. It is for me, as a member from a metropolitan region, to fight for more funding. It is not a reason for scrapping a system that has over 11 years put the runs on the board. It really worries me post all the controversy there was after the last election, when there has been a supposed review of ACCs and their boundaries, that the biggest outcome of that review is to amalgamate the five metropolitan Melbourne ACCs into one. If you compare it to the other capital cities where that decision has already been made, such as the single Sydney ACC, I do not think you can characterise their success as being all glory or anything that can really justify saying, ‘That is an example of the way we should go.' I am sure the success of Western Sydney members of this chamber has had nothing to do with an amalgamated one-unit Sydney ACC. It has been other devices that have been used. The thing to be stressed is that there is no way that these ACCs in metropolitan Melbourne can be criticised for going outside of doing their business on a partisan basis because that is not the truth. In fact, these are successful units that have made recommendations to government on merit and if this were to continue I would be quite happy. I am not satisfied that the different regions of metropolitan Melbourne would get a fair go if there was only one ACC throughout Melbourne. The fact is that an ACC represents something like 700,000 people. What chance can do those 700,000 people have when there is an institution put in place that is going to look after four million people? What chance do the people of Blackburn have in getting what they deserve against other regions? I hope the government will reconsider this decision and not go forward with it. (Time expired) Cook Electorate: Kurnell Peninsula",71
104,Mr BAIRD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My electorate of Cook is lucky enough to boast the site of first landfall of Captain James Cook and the crew of the Endeavour. It was at Kurnell that the Endeavour dropped anchor, it was there that Cook first stepped ashore and it was there that Indigenous and European cultures first met. It was from Cook's landing and scientific surveys that the decision was made by the British government to establish the colony of New South Wales on the shore of Botany Bay. It was from Cook's exploration of Australia that European settlement radiated out across the Australian continent-the place in which the shared history of black and white Australia began. Kurnell has a central place in the history of New South Wales and Australia. Kurnell is of such unique and critical importance to the shire, to New South Wales and to the Commonwealth that it was the very first place in New South Wales to be inscribed on the Australian government's National Heritage List. Kurnell was protected before the Opera House, before the site of the Eureka Stockade, before Port Arthur and before Glenrowan. Given Kurnell's importance, the House would be right to be surprised that the New South Wales Labor government has allowed Kurnell to be largely destroyed and that it is continuing to aid and abet this destruction to ensure that the entire area is ruined. Just a few weeks ago, I invited the school captains of all of our local primary schools join with Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and me at Kurnell to announce more than $1 million in funding for the protection and recognition of Kurnell's importance. With the Endeavour riding at anchor a few hundred yards from the landing site, it provided a wonderful backdrop for this important announcement. This funding was provided to Kurnell on the basis that it is one of the very few sites in Australia of such unique value that is protected by its inscription on the National tage List. The funding will allow the Australian government to provide a more fitting replica to commemorate the landing of Captain James Cook, one of the world's greatest explorers and navigators; it will allow the rehabilitation of the land behind the existing Banks memorial to reflect the native flora at the time of Cook's arrival; and it will enable the launching of a national essay competition for primary and secondary students to better educate our young people on the shire's unique place in Australia's history. For years, Kurnell has suffered under the excesses of government and industry alike. We have all seen the once impressive sandhills stripped and replaced with ponds and lakes. We have heavy industry alongside wetlands of international significance. We have large-scale industrial development just a stone's throw from more than 90 per cent of the remaining salt marshes in the Sydney Basin and 50 per cent of the remaining mangrove communities. Of course, we also have the threat of a desalination plant that was proposed to be built by the New South Wales government in Kurnell. Residents only need to take a trip down Captain Cook Drive to see all of the development sites and subdivisions along the fragile neck of the peninsula. Now after years of procrastination by the New South Wales Labor government, developers plan to build factories adjacent to to Wanda Beach and Cronulla High School. The developer, Australand, has recently fenced off its 62-hectare site, which includes the heritage listed Cronulla sand dune, to prepare the site for construction. This means that sporting teams such as the Sharks and Dragons, local residents and visitors can no longer walk through the last remaining sections of the Cronulla dunes. It means that the beautiful walk from Wanda, which is used by many local residents, has been lost. Residents have been fighting the plan for Herithis site for years. The New South Wales Labor government had the developer's proposal on their desk for some four years. Due to pressure from local residents, they were forced to reject it in 2004. Unfortunately, due to Labor's lax and unashamedly prodevelopment planning controls over this precious area, the developers successfully sought permission to build factories from the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. While residents have known for years that there was a proposal in the abstract for the development of this site, it was made very real after workmen installed cyclone fencing, stopping the many users of this area from accessing the site. I understand that the developer, after the intervention of the Liberal Mayor of Sutherland, restored public access to the dunes and ponds late last week. While I applaud the work of the mayor, my friend Councillor Kevin Schreiber, the simple fact is that, without swift action, a valuThey able and beautiful part of the shire will be lost forever. Predictably, the local Labor aligned supposedly independent political party, the Shire Watch Independence Party, has tried to blame this latest outrage on me, the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth of Australia. As with every other outrage committed by New South Wales Labor at Kurnell, the Labor-Shire Watch coalition at Sutherland council respond by calling on the Australian government to buy out the land. While I and many others would welcome any such move, we are also very aware of the practicalities spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to right the wrongs of the New South Wales Labor government. The front page of the local newspaper, the St George and Sutherland Shire Leader, last week carried the story which was titled ‘Plea to John Howard: buy the Australand site to save Wanda sand hills'. This story was driven by Shire Watch and the photograph featured one of the Shire Watch's most prominent organisers. What the members of the Shire Watch team have said about a Commonwealth buyout to restore public access is nothing more than mischief making. I recently looked through the relevant records from the Land and Environment Court case which approved the current factory development site. What has stunned me is that the developer offered to give the balance of the site to the public, including the Cronulla dune and recreation areas, in the care and control of Sutherland council in perpetuity. On top of this, the developer also offered to establish a substantial trust fund to pay for the upkeep of the area. While Shire Watch and I agree that no development should go ahead on the site, for them now to clamour about the fencing of the area and the loss of dune and recreation areas is disingenuous. twice rejected the offers of the developers to gain for free the majority of the site, to rehabilitate it, to fund its ongoing maintenance and to ensure the dunes are protected. This is the exact same area that they are now calling on the Commonwealth to buy for many tens of millions of dollars. I wonder what the residents of Cronulla, the visitors, walkers and sports teams who use this site will think when they learn the reason they were locked out of this site was not that John Howard failed to buy it but rather that Shire Watch wanted to play politics over the site and ignore the best interests of of local people. The Commonwealth has not had nor will it in future have any role in planning decisions. It did not sell the land, it has never owned the land and it certainly has no interest in the development companies concerned. On the other hand, the Labor Party are the consent authority, the people who sat on the original application with a view to approving it, and they are the people who accepted nearly three-quarters of a million dollars from the very people who are about to build factories on Wanda Beach. I find it very hard to follow Shire Watch's reasoning that the Commonwealth is at fault for the continued destruction of Kurnell. The constant moves by Shire Watch to blame every state government failing on the Commonwealth show either a political alliance to Labor or, at best, a willingness to help shift the blame from where it belongs, with New South Wales Labor, onto the Australian government. Shire Watch are willingly acting as an extension of the Australian Labor Party in their dealings both on the council and through their repeated attempts to blame every state failure on the Australian government. At election time, Shire Watch portray themselves as being independent of party politics. Their voting record tells a very different story. In the last council term, as with now, Shire Watch were in coalition with Labor. They shared the mayoralty, they shared the deputy mayoralty, they voted the same way, as I understand from one source, on more than 90 per cent of the business before the council, yet they expect us to believe they are somehow separate and above party politics. Every time Labor fails the shire-and it happens often-they try to confuse the issue by talking about federal government buyouts and so on. I point out to the Shire Watch councillors that the New South Wales government are the approval body for this and every activity at Kurnell. Labor assumed all planning powers over Kurnell. They were the ones who wrote the planning code for the area and it was Labor that accepted a staggering $647,593 in donations from this developer since 1998. I cannot help but feel that Shire Watch ought to start living up to the ‘independent' tag that they have registered as a party name and start to question the motives of their Labor team-mates on Sutherland council. Let us for a moment examine the New South Wales government's shameful history on the protection of the Kurnell Peninsula. The Kurnell Peninsula has been mined for sand since the 1930s. Due to improvements in technology and extraction processes, the mining has escalated massively over the past 15 years. While it is difficult to rate information from the mining companies, it is estimated that more than 1.25 million tonnes of sand are stripped from Kurnell each and every year. Under New South Wales Labor, every week 25,000 tonnes of our history are carted away by the truck load, yet Shire Watch seeks to blame the Prime Minister and this government. Under New South Wales Labor, the Kurnell Peninsula has ‘For Sale' signs from Cronulla High School in the west to Caltex in the east. Does the Australian government retain planning and development consent over Kurnell? The answer is unequivocally no. Under New South Wales Labor, the Kurnell Peninsula has been slated as the site for a trial and, no doubt, after the next election will be slated for a full-scale desalination plant that threatens the environment, migratory whales and wetlands of international significance. I draw this to the attention of the House. (Time expired) Employment: People with Disabilities",73
105,Mr EDWARDS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have a long interest in disability issues and was recently approached by Sam Morton from Competitive Foods, an Australia-wide company, because he is having a few problems with the processes of employing people with disabilities. I listened to him intently, because his company received the 2005 Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Award, which recognises excellence in the employment of people with a disability. The company won this award under the large business category in the Northern Territory. It is a good award and it shows the credentials that Mr Morton's company have in employing people with disabilities. Mr Morton recently wrote to the Hon. Kevin Andrews, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, setting out a few problems. In his letter to the minister, he said: obtain accuThere are two basic issues: 1. Changes in the training instructions Assessors are given when assessing the abilities of disabled people on the job. 2. The need for a “gateway” organisation to assist employers in employing persons with a disability. Under the heading ‘Assessments', he said: In previous years the assessors used by the 16 different agencies in the Perth area were instructed to assess the person with a disability, against the job description of an able bodied The persons ability compared to that required by the job description was then expressed as a percentage, which was then used to calculate the person with a disability's pay. (A percentage of the full time salary of the award covering the job description). In recent years the assessors have received differable ent training instructions. The person with a disability is only assessed on the duties they perform. For example, if the job description was to drive a bus for eight hours and then clean the windows, with the current situation if the person with a disability could not drive a bus and only clean windows, if they cleaned the windows perfectly they would be paid 100% of the award rate. Obviously this bizarre situation is very discouragDr ing to an employer considering taking on a person with a disability. Under the heading ‘Structure of the various agencies assisting people with a disability', he states: Prior to 1986, there was no coordinated support to assist people with a disability gain jobs in open employment. Nationally today, 220 specialist Disability Employment Services support 46,000 people with a disability in the workplace, with this figure set to increase significantly from July 2006 as new “Welfare to Work” measures are introduced for jobseekers with a disability. Edge was the first Disability Open Employment Service in Perth opening in 1984 and Bizlink came on to the scene in 1992. I know both of these organisations. Mr Morton goes on: Back then they were funded by the Department of Family and Community Services and the focus at the time was about giving clients choice of service, hence the large number of services for a comparatively small group of clients ie some 2500 people with 16 services in Perth. All are funded by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, some run programs other than employment and these may be state funded. Some of the Perth services are standalone specialist employment services like eg peer. Bizlink, Edge, Interwork-others are a part of much larger organisations, eg Autism Association, Cerebral Palsy Association, Deaf Society … and may specialise with certain types of disabilities. Because of the organic rather than structured development of these agencies, and their often parochial attitude towards each, trying to locate a suitemployee is a daunting and time consuming task. If the full potential for employment of people with a disability is to be realised, some of the agencies must be amalgamated, and a “gateway” agency created to coordinate employment opportunities. I do not present this letter in any political way, but I do want to encourage the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Workforce Participation, Stone, to look at this issue. When someone like Mr Morton raises an issue like this, I think it is important that a government listens. Mr Morton strikes me as a decent bloke. Certainly he is genuinely motivated to provide better opportunities for people with disabilities to find employment. We all know that it is hard enough for people with disabilities to find employment, let alone to hold on to it, in a competitive workplace. When these sorts of people who work in big companies such as the one that Mr Morton belongs to and which have a long history, going back more than two decades, of employing people with disabilities come forward with criticisms, we should listen to them. I had a number of conversations with some of the agencies. One of them, in listening to what Mr Morton had to say, wrote to him and said: It is great that an employer is taking such an interest and time to look into fixing the system to make it easier for employers who want to create opportunities for people with disabilities in their community. Disability Open Employment Services … are funded by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations … Dr Sharman Stone is the Minister for Workforce Participation and … Kevin Andrews is the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. This person went on: … I have done a bit of web surfing and I can see why employers find it so difficult, the jobable web site has the list of agencies but does not tail the area they service nor the types of clients they assist … DOES market their clients individually as the key to success is job matching. They tend to be in regions because of historical reasons and how the industry has evolved over 20 years. I can understand that the single point of contact would make the process simpler, and the Dpt is funding Disability Works Australia on the basis of this approach … However, this agency goes on to say, ‘The success of this to date is arguable.' It also says: ... as you too have noticed, much of our work is through relationship building. Gaining the trust and respect of employers who provide quality employment who will then come back to us for repeat business-as you have noticed, individual agencies cannot always supply the client with the skills that match the job-so even when you have established relationships you have not been able to meet your employment needs ... it is a frustration ... we would not send a client who did not have the skills or who did not have a desire to work at KC-we do not want to set people up to fail ... as an employer then the single point of contact makes sense and / or your suggestion of more collaboration amongst the agencies to refer on opportunities if they could not fill a vacancy. Unfortunately the system is developing into one of even greater competition through a Star Rating approach-so it is doubtful collaboration will be fostered in this environment where your star rating will determine if your service will win der ... again perhaps the system is working against people with disabilities in some respects. This agency goes on to conclude: My sincere thanks to you for bringing these concerns to the table. I hope we can be of assistance. At the end of the day we just want to see people with disabilities getting a fair go, with a fair days pay for a fair days work-the system really does seem to be working against that objective in a number of respects. As I say, I bring this issue forward in a perfectly non-political way. I think there is a fair de- and legitimate criticism here. I ask both ministers mentioned in the letter to please have a look at this issue and work through it-work through it with the agencies; work through it with the employers-and see if, in the best interests of people with disabilities, they can adjust this process and the procedures to make sure that the winners at the end of the day are indeed people with disabilities looking to get into the workforce. Roads: Ipswich Motorway",76
106,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As is my wont, from time to time. I rise in this place to bring to book the crazy attitude of the Queensland state government in relation to the development of the Ipswich Motorway and its continued insistence upon a less than ideal solution to meet the road transport needs of our district. By that I mean the district from Ipswich all the way west to Toowoomba: the region that is primarily reliant on the Ipswich Motorway. The state minister responsible for all the planning and other practical parts of the process of developing an effective solution to the problems of massive traffic on the Ipswich Motorway is none other than the main roads minister, Paul Lucas. I would like to alert members to the fact that, immediately after the last election, on Saturday, 27 November 2004, Paul Lucas, the state Minister a ten- for Transport and Main Roads, made a joint press release with our own minister, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Jim Lloyd. He made some comments that I want to draw to the attention of the House. To quote from the press release they put out: Paul Lucas said Queensland welcomed the appointment of respected engineering firm Maunsell Australia to independently evaluate the proposed Ipswich northern bypass. The northern bypass is another name for the Goodna bypass, which is the long-term solution to the problems of the Ipswich Motorway, planned and proposed by the Commonwealth. Mr Lucas went on: The Queensland Government will do all in its power to cooperate with the Federal Government in delivering their roads priorities, including northern bypass. The simple fact is that the Australian Government is providing the money for the national highway and they decide how their money is spent. … … … If the feasibility studythat is, the Maunsell feasibility studyindicates the northern bypass is not a viable ject, Queensland and the Commonwealth will need to look again at how we address traffic congestion on the Ipswich Motorway. I bring that to the attention of the House because, of course, the Maunsell study did proceed. It was a feasibility study conducted by Maunsell; it was not a comparison between the bypass and the thing that Mr Lucas keeps hankering after-that is, the coordinated destruction and reconstruction of the existing Ipswich Motorway. That feasibility study of the Goodna bypass found that there were three feasible options, three potential ways the Commonwealth could build the proposed Goodna bypass, so of course it found that the northern bypass was feasible. In line with Mr Lucas's comments in his press release, you would expect therefore that the state government would proceed to give the Commonwealth government the support that he spoke about and to expedite the further construction, planning and completion of the Goodna bypass. That is not what happened. Unfortunately the state government has spent an awful lot of time after that trying to re-present its argument to tear down the existing road while motorists are trying to drive on it and to construct in its place a six-lane upgrade which would be deficient compared to the Goodna bypass in terms of its traffic-carrying capacity. In fact, Mr Lucas has been quite strident about this and he has got a bit ratty at times. In a letter he wrote to me, he wrote down the the bottom in a kind of rambling rant: Cameron, The problem for youand this is in his handwritingis that the joint state-federal study commissioned & undertaken by Maunsells shows the ½ northern bypass is not the best option. Yet you choose to ignore this. Stop playing politics ... I was not the one who got on the back of a pro- truck with Jim Lloyd and said that he was going to assist the federal government in ‘delivering their roads priorities, including the northern bypass'. Those were the words of Mr Lucas himself, yet he reneged on that and then had the hide to accuse me of playing politics! For the record, I want to speak a little bit about what the Maunsell report did find. It did find that the northern option-or Goodna bypass, constructed to bypass the corridor of the Ipswich Motorway-would be ‘greatly beneficial to through traffic, relieving congestion on the existing motorway and enabling both routes to offer a reasonable level of service'. That was on page 39 of the Maunsell report. It also found: A further potential safety benefit of constructing a road bypassing this section of Ipswich Motorway comes from the opportunities to divert traffic during major incidents blocking either road. That was on page 55. It found that forecast speed on that northern option from 2012 right through to 2032 would be a high speed of between 93 and 97 kilometres an hour. Forecast speeds on the existing motorway would deteriorate from 61 to 35 kilometres an hour-that is if nothing is done-but remain above 85 kilometres an hour if the northern option is built. That is on page 39 of the Maunsell report. Further, it found the provision of the northern option ‘would have the effect of substantially reducing traffic flows on the existing motorway, improving the level of service and reducing the incidence of accidents'. That is on page 54. ‘Traffic on the existing motorway over the Dinmore to Gailes section would be reduced to about 40,000 vehicles a day in the year of commissioning the IMNO'-the northern option, that is-‘which would rise to about 58,000 vehicles a day in 2032'. That is on page 29. So quite clearly the report found it to be eminently viable and found it to be a good project with very long-term consequences, being able to deal with the volume of traffic through our area through to 2032something, unfortunately, the prescription of the state main roads minister just cannot do. Unfortunately, not only would the state proposal for a six-lane upgrade inconvenience everyone when the road is dug up while people try and drive on it for the next five or years but, on top of that, once it was completed, it would certainly within two, three or maybe five years at the best be subject to the same levels of congestion that we currently experience. That is just a pathetic outcome for an organisation that is supposed to pride itself on planning main roads. Planning a road for maximum traffic disruption and then congestion is something that the Three Stooges might specialise in, but it certainly should not be the aspiration of the state main roads minister, and at the moment I am not sure if he is Larry, Curly or Moe. On the other side of things, I thought I should report on what Maunsell had to say. They did a separate analysis of Larry, Curly and Moe's efforts for the upgrade project. They found that the state main roads department had come up with an idea where they could do the whole upgrade in something like three years. Maunsell looked at this in a special report, which was only about eight pages long. On page 1 they said: ‘Amazing! The state government, in their plan to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway, has not allowed a single day for wet weather.' In a three-year construction schedule, they did not allow a single day for wet weather, and it turns out that a normal type of allocation for a three-year construction period would be six months. That shows you the level of chicanery we are getting here from the state government. That is the first point. Secondly, it found, as it says on page 8: Time allowances for bridge construction are considered generally to be extremely tight. Cop this: according to the state main roads department they can build an overpass-rail bridges passing over Warrego Highway, passing over the railway line-in one month. They can build a concrete overpass in one month. Currently they are down there working on the Granard Road overpass and they six have been there for years and years. In fact, money for the Granard Road overpass was allocated in 2001 and they still have not completed it. This same mob reckon they can build an overpass in one month just for the sake of conning the motorists and the federal government into accepting their cockamamie scam where they say that they can produce this whole thing in three years. There are other overpasses they say they could build in four months. There is another one they said they can build in seven months and another one they could build in five months-all of which, Maunsell said, were extremely tight. I think they are being very careful in their wording not to overinflate it, but quite obviously it is bunkum. The whole plan is bunkum and it is typical of the kind of con we have had from Paul Lucas ever since he made that ridiculous statement that he was going to get behind the Commonwealth and do what he is actually required to do. Other things that Maunsell found about his scheme was that basically it is a danger the workers who would be required to work on it. They were proposing island worksites between live traffic. They found that the worksites would be ‘of a narrow width and a long linear length, making those multiple work fronts more difficult, and such aspects may result in significantly reduced productivity and progress within each stage than might normally be expected, leading to the need for longer construction program allowances'. We have had our leg pulled every day of the week by Paul Lucas in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. What the Ipswich people need is the Goodna bypass so we can build the road off-line, so we can build it on a greenfield site and so that traffic can continue on the Ipswich Motorway uninterrupted. (Time expired) Doctor Shortage",78
107,Ms HALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It never fails to amaze me that, every time. I hear a Queensland member of the House of Representatives stand to speak in this House, they speak about state issues. They are afraid to talk about federal issues like the critical doctor shortage that exists in Australia today-federal issues that they should be putting their minds to. Tonight I would like to the raise in this parliament the issue of the critical doctor shortage in the Shortland elecshortage. torate. I have raised this issue on many occasions. I have written to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I have raised the matter in budget considerations in detail. I have raised the matter, as I just mentioned, in many speeches. I have worked with the Central Coast Division of General Practice and in Wyong Shire to try and attract more GPs to the coast. I have literally telephoned doctors in other areas throughout Australia and actually in New Zealand to try and get them to relocate to the Shortland electorate. I have supported to every application for overseas trained doctors that has been put to me by practices of GPs within the Shortland electorate. I have a motion on the Notice Paper for this parliament that I hope will be debated, and in that motion I condemn the federal government for failing to adequately address and find health care in Australia, its role in causing the current doctor and nurse shortage in Australia and failing to address this shortage. Unfortunately, the situation has gone from bad to worse, and this is on the Howard government's watch, particularly that of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott. It is important that I acknowledge at this point that there is a doctor shortage throughout Australia. It is not only in the electorate of Shortland, but as I represent the people of Shortland I want their voice to be heard on this matter. A Productivity Commission report that examined the medical workforce shortage in Australia identified it as a major problem. The government has belatedly attempted to address the shortage by bringing more doctors into Australia from overseas, which I think has some accompanying ethical issues. It has increased the number of medical training places at universities-too little done too late by a government that must take responsibility for this In 1996, the first act of the Howard government once it was elected was to reduce the number of medical training places at universities. We all know it takes 10 years of training for a student doctor to be able to practise in the community and here we are, 10 years down the track, faced with this chronic doctor shortage. The government also restricted provider numbers. The solutions have been slow to arrive as the government has failed to adequately address this issue, which has had a greater impact on rural, regional and remote areas. You might ask how this chronic doctor shortage is affecting the people in the electorate that I represent. As I mentioned at the start of my contribution, the situation has gone from bad to worse. In the Lake Macquarie part of my electorate, which has traditionally been a lot better serviced by GPs, a number of doctors have retired in recent times and now many people do not have a doctor at all. All the remaining doctors have closed their books and elderly people are sitting in their homes unable to have a doctor come and visit them. I must acknowledge that this is placing enormous pressure on doctors. It is leading to more doctors retiring because of their enormous workload and its related stress. It is leading to nursing home beds lying empty, not because no-one is there to fill them-there is actually a waiting list for all the nursing home and hostel beds-but because residents need to have a GP before they can accept one of these beds. I have had numerous phone calls from constituents in their 80s and 90s who do not have a GP and cannot access one in their local area because all the GPs in the area have closed their books. These are elderly people who cannot get out because of their disabilities and who were used to having GPs visit them at home. Now my office staff are actually going out, picking up people and taking them to see GPs outside their area. That is really not good enough. We have had elderly people who have heart conditions ring our office because they cannot get into see a doctor. Because they are fearful that they are going to run out of medication, they are taking half of their heart tablets at a time to make them last longer. I think this is a dreadful situation and I am sure members on both sides of the House would agree with me. Take sick people relying on emergency departments. We have had to organise an ambulance service to pick up an elderly resident every six months so she can have her medication checked at the local public hospital. I feel that this government is really letting people down. House calls are a thing of the past and doctors comment to me that, because of the fact that many of the people that they see are elderly, they have very complex problems, that the amount of time that these patients need when they come to visit the doctor is much longer and that they are now concentrating on treating people with very acute illnesses that require enormous management. Doctors comment to me, and I am sure the House is interested in this, that it is an exercise in frustration and hand wringing, that they are overloaded and just cannot wave a wand, that there are management issues, that increasing nursing services to assist them to deal with the shortage is one thing that has helped them, that the training of new doctors is lagging and that they have a few problems with some of the decisions that the college of GPs has made. They also argue that not enough incentives are in place to encourage medical students to go into general practice, that there should be some more sweeteners to get students to consider becoming GPs as well as sweeteners to attract medical students to enter the specialties, and that younger graduates are job sharing. I have had doctors ring my office and ask me why they have had patients go to their surgery and say, ‘Jill Hall said you have to see me.' Why does this happen? It happens because these people are desperate. I have told no-one to go to their GP and say that. But the bottom line is that these people are sick and have no other option. They do not know who to turn to. Sydney GPs will not leave their area and come to areas such as Shortland. But it is a beautiful area, and if there are any GPs listening to this speech I can tell them this: I do not think there is a nicer place in Australia in which to live. It is on the edge of a lake. We have wonderful surfing beaches and great schools. We are close to Sydney and we have a wonderful lifestyle. I encourage you to think about coming to live in Shortland. Unfortunately, doctors generally prefer to stay in the inner city areas, so there is a genuine, chronic shortage in outer metropolitan areas like mine. The government's outer metropolitan strategy has been responsible for three new doctors coming to the area, but six doctors have retired within the last 12 months. The strategy is not even anywhere near keeping pace. We need to look at some new solutions. Doctors would like to be able to employ more practice nurses. I think the government should support that. I think we should really look at the issue of nurse practitioners. We need greater flexibility in the area of GP training. We need programs that value the role and work of GPs. We need to train more doctors. Every doctor I speak to says that we need to train more doctors. In Shortland electorate we need to have the RAMA classification changed. It is time for action. The time for words and promises has gone. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Somerville Secondary College",81
108,Mr HUNT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (7.07 pm)-In rising in this grievance debate I wish to raise a lost opportunity within the electorate of Flinders. It is a considerable lost opportunity-that is, the neglect of the future of Somerville Secondary College. Members of this House may know that, over the last few years, along with members of the Victorian parliament I have been concerned about the potential for the creation of a wonderful school at Somerville, the Somerville Secondary College. After a long campaign by local residents, a wonderful group of people, that school came to pass this year, but it has come to pass without an oval. There was a chance for that oval to be created. We had the chance through the state government over this last week to establish a permanent set of playing fields for Somerville Secondary College, but it was chosen not to be of sufficient importance or of sufficient urgency to take the chance. In essence, on Friday, 26 May, despite adequate warning, despite considerable pressure and, extraordinarily, despite an offer by the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Ms Julie Bishop, to pay for that land the Victorian government declined to purchase the 1.5 acres, or 6,000 square metres, that would have allowed the school to complete its playing facilities. Instead, that land has been auctioned off and will go to commercial purposes. The children and students who attend Somerville Secondary College, not just over the next five, 10 or 20 years but over the next to 100 years, will forever be denied the opportunity to have a full set of sports facilities. That is a real indictment and a real failure. It was not a difficult thing to complete, because we made the offer to them. We offered to reimburse Victoria if they would purchase this land. The Commonwealth education minister, Ms Julie Bishop, made that offer within 48 hours of having had the proposal put to her last week. The proposal was made on Monday, 22 May, and by the afternoon of Wednesday, 24 May she had made the offer to say, ‘Yes, we will reimburse the Victorian government. We will meet the costs of this land if they wish to complete the school.' Their refusal to accept is reason for genuine grievance. I would like to recount to the House the facts so that the people of Somerville and the members of the House may understand precisely how an opportunity which comes once in the life to a school has been so grievously lost. Three greats wrongs have occurred here. Firstly, the Victorian government refused the offer of this 1.5 acres, or 6,000 square metres, of land adjacent to the existing Somerville Secondary College when it was first offered six months ago by the family who sold the original land to the school. It was done on a concessional basis because they wanted their parents' will to be fulfilled. They offered this land at less than market rates to the Victorian government precisely for the purpose of completing the land at Somerville Secondary College. That offer was extraordinarily generous. Having missed that first opportunity the second great wrong occurred when the state was given another chance. It again denied the school an oval. The problem here is that there was originally sufficient land for playing facilities, but Aboriginal artefacts were found on the site over quite a long period so the effective area available for use within school was dramatically reduced. There was no account made of that fact. So the people who said, ‘You can't build on this land'that is, the Victorian government-because, and I do not dispute this, they had found Aboriginal artefacts, subsequently said, ‘We will count that land, though, as part of your school area and of course you have enough by our ratios.' This is a classic catch-22 situation in which the school community, led by the principal, Roger Page, who does an outstanding job, was trapped by a sort of Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy from the late 19th century. So what is the second wrong? It is that the school is being denied an oval that will be of adequate size and with reasonable facilities as we go forward over the coming years-not five or 10 years but 20, 50, 100 years. This school will be forever penalised for the decisions made last week by the Victorian government, by the Victorian Minister for Education and Training, Ms Kosky, and by the utter failure of the sitting state member for Hastings, Ms Rosy Buchanan, to take up the case. This is when your character is tested: when you have to take on your own side. This brings me to the third of the wrongs, which is that the Commonwealth offered to reimburse Victoria and that offer has been lost forever, not because the Commonwealth has taken it off the table but because the land has gone. That land, which could have contributed so much to the school and to the community, is gone forever because now it is likely to be commercially developed. And it is not as if there was no forewarning. I want to quote from a letter written on 22 May by a concerned parent-who has asked, for fear of repercussion, that their name not be identified-warning the Victorian government of the risk. It begins, ‘Dear Minister,' and refers to the Somerville Secondary College. It notes that a property currently owned by Mrs Lesthe ley Sinclair, who was the vendor representing the remnants of the original property from which the education department acquired over 13 hectares of land in the early 1990s for the purpose of primary and secondary schools, was available. But as the Victorian government was aware, a sizeable proportion of this land ‘can never be utilised due to restraints imposed due to Aboriginal issues'. The letter goes on to say that the most significant omission in the construction of this school is that it does not possess an oval for recreational activities. Schools and ovals go together. This is a fundamental blight-an oval should be part and parcel of an ordinary development. The letter goes on to say it was always intended that an oval would be included as a school asset and, in fact, that the Mornington Peninsula Council was negotiating to assist in the construction of this oval due to a severe lack of recreational facilities in the Somerville area. So it is a lost opportunity not just for the students and the school but also for the town of Somerville, which has been woefully and shamefully neglected. The letter goes on to say that the construction of the oval stalled when certain areas adjacent to the oval were deemed to be of Aboriginal significance, thus restraining the size, placement and overall design of the oval. The letter said: I implore you to reconsider this position, as the school has lost the use of a sizeable amount of land within the site. Should this land be purchased by the department, it would not only rectify land lost onsite but would allow a significantly larger and better positioned oval to be constructed, which would have benefits not only for the school population but for the general population of Somerville. The letter ends there. But, throughout that week, extraordinary attempts were made to move the Victorian government to purchase this land. On 22 May, the same day I received this correspondence from a parent, I wrote to the federal education minister, Julie Bishop, and spoke to her office on a number of occasions. They worked assiduously over the next 48 hours to produce an offer to reimburse the Victorian government-to cover the costs and to make sure the Victorian government was not out of pocket-but that offer, which was made on 24 May, was allowed to pass. The result was simple: when the land went to auction on 26 May, there was no Victorian government bid. The land was passed in and the Victorian government was immediately notified that there was still a third opportunity to purchase this land. But there was utter inaction. By late afternoon the land was gone and the facilities were gone. Forever and a day, for as long as that school exists, the facilities will never be completed to the standard that the students, parents and teachers of Somerville Secondary College and the residents of Somerville deserve. This is a profound disappointment and I condemn the Victorian government's inaction. (Time expired) Skills Shortage",83
109,Mr HATTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise not only to make a grievance speech but also to make a speech of grieving. My grievance relates to the skills crisis in New South Wales, in my home town of Bankstown and, indeed, in the whole of Australia. Over the last 10 years, training in the traditional trades and in broader areas has fallen way behind what is needed by the community, by New South Wales and by Australia. This government has failed dramatically in this area and it has chosen the easy path. Instead of, first and foremost, training young Australians now, the government has chosen the easy way of simply importing skilled people from overseas. The government has recently gone even further, saying that it will import skilled tradesmen not just through the normal processes of the skilled migration program-or through family migration if the person happens to be a skilled tradesperson as well as having family members here. The government has said it will also use the four-year temporary entry program, as it has done these past 10 years, to bring in more than 255,000 skilled tradespeople from overseas to supply a deficit that exists within Australia. In that time, 300,000 young people from Australia have not been able to find places in our technical and further education system. The average age of tradespeople in Australia is 54 years. That is a pretty high age. I know it is lower than the age of Australian farmers, but it is significant that professional plumbers, drainers, carpenters and automotive mechanics are in that age bracket, about 10 years from normal retirement. People with experience in running their own businesses, working for others or working for large companies have known for many years that there are very few people beneath them to take their place. This mirrors the situation in our society at large-and the government has belatedly started to talk about the problem of the ageing of the population. Unless this tranche of skilled tradespeople choose to extend their working careers significantlyfrom their 60s, into their 70s and beyondwe will not be able to provide enough skilled tradespeople in Australia to keep the country running effectively. The government has not invested in training our own people. It has chosen to bring people from overseas on a four-year TEP. And if, at the end of that four years, the people apply to stay in Australia, the government will give them discounted entry in order to supply the skills deficit. I do not think that is the right approach to take. I think extremely short-sighted. It is certainly an easier way to go than what this government has chosen to do, which is to concentrate on traineeships. Traineeships are greater in number than traditional apprenticeships, but they are discounted apprenticeships. Traineeships are apprenticeships on the cheap. They are apprenticeships which can be completed faster and do not assist young people to develop the broad range of skills that they were once exposed to in the old apprenticeship training systems that the great institutions used to run. Now, because they are out of the game, those institutions do not train tradespeople in the significant numbers-indeed, the thousands-that Australia once had access to. I refer not just to workers in the public sector but to workers trained in the public sector who started their own businesses or moved into public or private companies either as independent contractors or as employees. The State Rail Authority does not train people to the extent that it used to. Telstra certainly does not. It has fallen to the technical and further education system and, in part, to Australian schools to make up, in a patchwork way, for this deficit. But there is no driving force in the government-and there has not been for the past 10 years-to seek to solve the skills crisis that has grown inexorably over that period. They have instead sought to substitute by bringing in people to fill the temporary gap. This is extraordinarily short sighted. As this has not been adequately addressed, Australia has significant problems due to the average age of its tradespeople. The people who make sure that the country ticks-those who fix our basic systems-are not there in significant numbers. The young people coming through have not experienced a broad enough approach to their training, in large part because the focus has been on emit is ployers seeking people with very narrow bands of experience. It has been neither extensive enough in time nor extensive enough in the kind of experience offered. We face a particularly difficult problem in all of the building areas-indeed, across all of the trades. I am pleased that Labor, in its recent policy announcements, has not only recognised the depth of the skills crisis that faces us but pledged to create accounts to pay the fees of young people going to TAFE. Labor has also pledged to pay them a bonus on completion of their apprenticeships and will provide that people studying in areas of demand-in particular, the child-care areaget the same benefit. I think it is right to train young Australians first and to train them now, because that is an investment in our very future. Recently I visited the Western Sydney Institute campus of TAFE at Chullora in Sydney's south-west. I had a great experience of that institution in the past because the Chullora site was one of the great training institutes in Sydney when it was controlled by the State Rail Authority. Over the years its workshops produced skilled tradesmen in their thousands. Although the existing facility was finally wound down-despite a number of years of fighting on my part and on the part of the employees-it has now been transformed into a campus of TAFE. The Bankstown building and sheet metal facilities have been centralised there. The programs in the sheet metal area are particularly interesting. The depth of the skills crisis is indicated by the fact that, before the young people who undertake training in apprenticeships at Chullora reach the end of their first year, 80 per cent of them are offered apprenticeships. The reason the number is so great is that the depth of demand is so great. It is terrific for the apprentices who take up those offers, but it is also an indicator of just how deep this crisis is. Not as many apprentices are taken up from the adjoining domestic building skills area. The reason is that there has been a drop-off in building in New South Wales. Another significant factor is the demand in those areas-the take-up rate is in the order of 45 to 50 per cent, but that is still a significant proportion of the entire volume. A new and significant addition to the domestic carpentry area is being built. That is a large building which will allow the Chullora campus to train people in high-rise construction. So there will be both commercial and domestic carpentry-indeed, the very epicentre of training in carpentry and building in Sydney will be at the Chullora campus. The young people lucky enough to gain access to skills in trades can seek apprenticeships and build a career for themselves in these very important areas where there is such a great deficit. I think it is terrific that they have done so well, but we need thousands upon thousands more of those students to go through the same types of courses not just in traditional areas but in a wider range of skills. We need a federal government that is committed to technical and further education for Australia and committed to solving the skills crisis that has been upon us these many years but has been underscored particularly in the last 10 years. (Time expired) Townsville City Council",85
110,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I think the grievance debate is the appropriate forum in which to raise this serious issue in the interest of the ratepayers of the Townsville City Council. We remember the Queensland ALP minister Gordon Nuttall. He had to step down as minister because he told lies to a committee of the parliament. This will not happen again-I do not mean the lies, just the stepping down, because the Queensland state government has introduced legislation into parliament to enable politicians to tell lies in the place. Queensland ALP government politicians are exempting themselves from the Criminal Code if they cut loose and tell a few porkies. With the ALP condoning the telling of lies, I have been increasingly concerned about the increase in incidences where I know that the Mayor and the Townsville City Council have been plain untruthful to Townsville ratepayers. It is not a pleasant thing to say to the parliament, but the reality is that the mayor simply no longer has any compulsion to be anything more than loose with the truth. Through the parliament tonight, let me give the people of Townsville some specific examples. Remember when the Townsville community became aware that the Australian Communications Authority had decided to sell a parcel of land at Pallarenda. The ACA met on two occasions with the mayor's righthand man in planning and no objection was raised to the sale. Clearly the Director of Planning would have discussed the council's attitude with the mayor, as he does every other sensitive development. Yet when the sale became public the mayor, with a straight face, told the people of Townsville he knew nothing about it. Remember too the mayor continues to tell Townsville ratepayers that he will keep rate rises to the consumer price index. This too has proved to be untruthful because recent history shows that rates have gone up above the CPI. The mayor apparently thinks that he is above public scrutiny and that he can tell the people one thing and then do the opposite. I ask the mayor tonight about his promise to alleviate the drainage problems close to my electorate office in Cranbrook. At the last three elections, Mayor Tony Mooney has said that he will address the flooding in the suburb but, again, his promise was a lie. The drainage problems have not been addressed and, again, the mayor thinks he can tell the people one thing and do another. Now I turn to the mayor's record on the Jezzine Barracks issue. With a straight face he told the people of Townsville that he has been unable to negotiate with me. Another Mooney lie. In fact, the reverse is the case: Tony Mooney has gone out of his way not to work with me on this issue. He is in the paper all the time saying he will do this or that, but he never picks up the phone to talk to me. In fact, in order to force Tony Mooney to bring a delegation to Canberra, I had to fly home on a parliamentary sitting day to achieve that outcome. On the Chalco refinery project, Tony Mooney has been telling the people of Townsville one thing yet supporting another. A week ago he circulated an expensive glossy brochure that gave ratepayers the clear understanding that the refinery would be built in the state development area at Stuart. But behind the scenes he has been having discussions about placing the refinery in the Woodstock area. I do not like that. But Tony Mooney is all about saving face, when he should really be all about properly informing ratepayers. The port access road is another example. Tony Mooney has taken every opportunity to be critical of the federal government for not providing funding for the road but all along he has known that the state Labor government withheld information from me that I could otherwise have used to back a case for funding. This is no way for the mayor of the city to work with the federal government. The ratepayers of the city must come to realise that their mayor politically works against their best interests. A week ago the council was asked about parking provisions for Centrelink staff at the new office on Ross River Road. The council's answer was that the federal government is not subject to town planning conditions and they wiped their hands of it. They misled the Townsville Bulletin reporter, who asked about the issue knowing full well that the building was not owned by the federal government and that the private owner was subject to council conditions. So it did not surprise me in the least when, in a later article, the council claimed that they had been told that there would be only 50 employees on the site. Again this was not true. Any council worth their salt would have known that Centrelink would not have 50 people in a building almost 5,000 square metres in size. I have heard of many other examples where the mayor has said one thing to major investors in the city and then done something entirely different. Major investors no longer trust the mayor of the Townsville City Council. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal these examples, because the investors concerned would suffer a most vindictive fate. But what it is already public is the example of the Townsville Mall. Again Tony Mooney said one thing to the people of the city and then did another. Moreover, his mishandling of the truth in relation to his dealings of the mall with the Chamber of Commerce is breathtaking. I understand that ratepayers may have very little interest in matters of a technical nature, but they do need to be alert that their mayor has no qualms in being loose with the truth. They should indeed be alarmed. Many senior people who deal with both councils tell me that Townsville and Thuringowa are chalk and cheese. Thuringowa has an open, can-do attitude with staff and councillors, who are open and approachable at all times. Ratepayers can contact Mayor Les Tyrell at any time, and I certainly find that Les, his councillors and his staff are an example of excellence in local government. The same cannot be said about Townsville City Council. I feel for the Townsville City Council, who have to work in such a difficult atmosphere. Mayor Tony Mooney is very hard to contact. He runs the council as an autocrat. He does not accept criticism where criticism is due and now there is this increasing tendency just to lie to ratepayers. This is a disgrace and not worthy of Australia's largest tropical city. At almost every council meeting the mayor uses the time of the council to attack the federal government or opposition councillors. Thuringowa Council on the other hand always bring their ideas, problems or concerns directly to me and together we work for the best interests of the Thuringowa ratepayers. Townsville Council is freezing itself out for the sake of political point ing and political witch hunts, and Townsville suffers because of it. I think it is time that the business community stood up and blew the whistle on the mayor and his uncooperative council. I believe that it is time that the ratepayers recognised that all of the new projects are in Thuringowa and that nothing is happening in Townsville. I believe that it is time that Tony Mooney must behave much more honourably in the interests of our city.",87

Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006 Debate resumed from 11 May. Second Reading",89
115,Mr NAIRN,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006 will consolidate and revise the governance arrangements for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSap, with effect from 1 July 2006. To make these changes the bill will amend the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Superannuation Act 2005 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Act 2006. The consolidation of the governance arrangements for the Australian government's civilian employees' superannuation schemes under a single board is being undertaken consistent with the governance principles of the Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, which is known as the Uhrig report. Following the release of the Uhrig report, an assessment in relation to the CSS board, which is the trustee of the CSS fund and responsible for the administration of the CSS, and the PSS board, which is the trustee for the PSS and the PSSap and the administration of those schemes, recommended changes to those governance arrangements. The assessment recommended that the membership of the PSS board be increased from five to seven, which is consistent with the Uhrig report's best practice principles that boards have from six to nine members. The assessment also recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of a single board for the CSS, the PSS and the PSSap. The bill therefore transfers the powers and functions of the CSS board to the PSS board, which is renamed as the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, and abolishes the CSS board. The Australian Reward Investment Alliance is to comprise seven members, giving it the same membership as the CSS board and two more than the current PSS board. This reflects the recommendations of the Uhrig assessment and the board's broadened role as the trustee of the three superannuation schemes. As a transitional measure, the two members of the CSS board who are not members of the PSS board will fill the two additional positions on the Australian Reward Investment Alliance. The bill includes consequential and transitional provisions to ensure that any references to the CSS board and the PSS board in any act, delegated legislation or relevant documents, for example insurance contracts, can be read as referring to the Australian Reward Investment Alliance. The seamless transfer of the assets and liabilities of the CSS board to the Australian Reward Investment Alliance is also provided for in the bill. The consolidation of the governance arrangements for the CSS, the PSS and the PSSap under one board will provide significant opportunities for efficiencies in the management of the CSS, the PSS and the PSSap. It will also offer an opportunity for the board to adopt one investment mechanism for the ongoing management and investment of the three funds, which would assist in its management of the CSS. This is particularly significant for the CSS because it is a closed scheme with a decreasing contribution base where net benefit payments exceed contributions received. The bill will modify the application of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide for the effective deferral of any capital gains tax liability that would otherwise result from the pooling of assets of the CSS fund with those of the PSS and the PSSap funds already pooled in the PSS Investments Trust. The provision of the capital gains tax rollover reflects the essentially involuntary nature of the transaction. I commend the bill to the House.",89
116,Mr FITZGIBBON,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Hunter) (7.42 pm)I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, this House notes the Howard Government's failures in superannuation policy. The superannuation system that Paul Keating created for this country remains unique. It was a world's first and it is world's best practice. Whenever we consider changes to that system, we should remember a number of things. The first is that Australia's superannuation savings are now approaching some $A1 trillion. In addition to guaranteeing Australians are more comfortable living in their retirement, it is taking pressure off our current account by providing a pool of savings available for those seeking to invest in Australia's productive capacity. Imagine where our current account might be now-already hovering at around 6.5 per cent of GDP-if we were borrowing from overseas pools of savings and paying additional interest on those borrowings to fund the investments that are currently being made. These investments are partly off the back of that superannuation pool of savings of $1 trillion that Paul Keating created when he created the superannuation scheme we live under today. The other thing we need to remember constantly is that pressure is being taken off the Commonwealth budget as a result of the many people who will now be living off their superannuation savings rather than their being partly or completely dependent on the age pension-an enormous burden which the Commonwealth budget has been relieved of. So it is a big thing, and it is appropriate for us to think about that every time the government introduces changes to that scheme. History will not treat the Howard government's superannuation record kindly. I am not so convinced that, in the long term, history will treat the government kindly even on the changes proposed in the very recent budget. People will look back at the incredible short sightedness and the missed opportunities. It is a problem that permeates this government, and it is little wonder that people viewed the recent budget more as a plan for an election than as a plan for the future. Labor has always been ahead of the game in addressing the ageing of the population and we will continue to provide that leadership. The reason is simple: we believe in a better future for Australians. We believe that the nation's super plan should be a plan for the future. When Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee we put in place a long-term mechanism for reform. We understood then, as we understand now, that the challenge of the ageing of the population would simply not fix itself. The superannuation guarantee has been the fairest measure in our community since Labor introduced Medicare. It has shown how good economic policy and good social policy can go together. To their great shame, the coalition voted against the super guarantee and have tried to undermine it ever since. Even though they had their own generous superannuation, they did not want to spread it to the whole workforce. That is the point I did not make in my introduction. Keating's super plan extended, for the first time, superannuation to all Australians. I made the point in an applied sense, but it is worth remembering that prior to Keating's plan it was something exclusively for politicians, senior public servants and a few who could afford to make their own investment. In addition to offering a broader and fairer superannuation tax cut, Labor has led the debate on superannuation simplification and safety. We have said recently that we will simplify superannuation by (1) automatically consolidating superannuation accounts, (2) ensuring a standard reporting format for all funds and (3) offering investment choice to all fund members. Labor will also make the superannuation system safer by (1) fully compensating for losses in the event of theft, fraud and business failure, establishing clear, simple and comparable disclosure of all fees, charges and commissions and (3) regulating some fees and commissions by (a) entry and exit fees prohibited, (b) commissions banned and/or restricted on super guarantee contributions and (c) a system of flat fees for advice. Protecting Australians against theft and fraud, excessive fees, charges and commissions and misleading financial advice provides confidence in superannuation as an institution of economic ownership. People are entitled to a secure retirement. The way to provide it is to ensure that our simple and fair system remains safe, secure and adequate. In recent weeks, there has been a lot of interest in Labor's fiscal policy framework. We have argued the case for an active approach to meeting the nation's long-term savings and investment needs. As I have discussed, Labor introduced the biggest intergenerational policy of them all-compulsory superannuation. The principle of superannuation is simple: put a little bit away today so that we can maintain a decent standard of living in the future. We need to recommit to this principle constantly. Superannuation for individuals will only be part of the solution to the ageing population. We know that it will not cover all of the costs and that it will not be the full answer for everyone. We will still need a social safety net, a universal public health system, affordable aged care services and an aged care pension for people to fall back on. Other nations do more than report on the intergenerational challenge; they respond to it. Nations such as New Zealand, Norway and Ireland put aside funds today so that they can meet the costs they know they will face tomorrow. I had the great honour and privilege to visit Norway recently and to speak to the people who control what used to be called (2) their petroleum fund but is now called their pension fund. It is interesting to note that the not too subtle title change was made in an attempt to quell growing public support for more expenditure to come from the pension fund than is now currently the case. In other words, by changing the name, the government sought to remind people that the then petroleum fund was there to cater for tomorrow's liabilities and was not necessarily in large measure available for spending on certain recurrent costs of today. I also noted while I was talking to the Norwegians that they have a fascinating ethical standard attached to their pension fund which ensures that those who control the fund are not able to invest in companies involved in industries which would not ordinarily enjoy the support of the local community, the most obvious example being the manufacturers of landmines. I note with great interest that our infant duplication here in Australia-the thing we now call the Future Fund-has no such ethical framework attached to it. I look forward to that debate panning out over the next little while, as I am sure it will and it should. Just as Labor introduced compulsory superannuation for all Australian workers-a savings fund which can only be drawn upon to meet defined future needs of our peoplewe should consider this principle at the national level. We should put aside funds to deal with clearly defined future fiscal pressures-superannuation for the nation. For too long the budget balance sheet has been driven by short-term concerns such as the Treasurer's obsession to sell Telstra and to kill the bond market. Labor will refocus the budget towards making provisions for our long-term intergenerational needs, including a transparent approach to dealing with unfunded superannuation liabilities. The most basic of intergenerational tests our willingness to provide for and invest in the future. At present, this is a test we are failing on both counts. Given its record on superannuation, I am surprised that the government wants to debate intergenerational issues at all. What is the Howard-Costello alternative to meeting future pressures through savings and investment? It is to pare back the social safety net-paring back Medicare and the public health system and pursuing an Americanised health system, refusing to ever face up to the long-term pressures confronting our aged care system, leaving it as a political football for every election, threatening the financial security pensioners through the Treasurer's latest big idea that there will be no such thing as full time retirement, that people should have to work until they drop. Labor is offering a different way. With a bit of foresight and a bit of planning, we can help achieve the future security and prosperity of all Australians. A civilised society should be able to meet basic needs of health, aged care and pensions into the future without forcing people to pay more and more. That will require action today for the sake of tomorrow. As with superannuation, only Labor is prepared to meet the challenge. I want to return to a very important point I made earlier, and that is the way in which superannuation savings are being directed into investment for the productive capacity of the nation. People listening at home or in the gallery might say, ‘What does all that mean? What are we talking about when we talk about this new pool of savings?' If people want to invest in Australia, they have to borrow the money from somewhere. We assume that if they need to borrow money they have to get the money from somewhere. They can get it offshore-of course, we pay interest on that money-or they can delve is down into the savings of Australians. From that investment comes enormous benefits to the Australian community. For example, in my electorate we have what is known as the Hunter Economic Zone. I cannot say that the Hunter Economic Zone would not have taken place if it were not for the assistance of superannuation funds or, to put it another way, if it were not for the capacity of the principals of the initiative to seek investment from superannuation funds, but there is no doubt that when you look at the Hunter employment zone or Hunter Economic Zone-the terms are used interchangeably-you will see there is some of doubt as to whether we would have that initiative if it were not for the opportunity to draw on superannuation savings. Let me tell you what that project means for the Hunter region. This makes it tangible for people listening to this debate. This is what Keating's $1 trillion bucket of money means for local regions. Nearly 14,500 people will be directly employed by businesses located in the Hunter employment zone. That is equivalent to 6.6 per cent of employment in the Hunter today. It is a huge increase. The current workforce of the Cessnock local government area, which I represent, is about 15,000 people. Through spending by state tenants and their employees, the business estate will also indirectly contribute over 12,000 jobs to the Hunter. HEZ is expected to contribute about $1.1 billion directly and $3 million indirectly to value add to the Hunter economy each year for a total contribution of $1.4 billion annually-an increase of 9.6 per cent on today's figures. Combining the direct contributions and indirect contributions-they are $2.8 billion and $5 billion respectively-to Hunter turnover, HEZ's business estate is modelled to contribute about $3.3 billion to annual Hunter turnover. That is an increase of 11.4 per cent on today's figures. There is expected to be a direct and indirect contribution of about $1.1 billion to annual wages and salaries in the Hunter economy. There is talk of a gas pipeline being built from south-east Queensland right through the Hunter and onto Sydney. That will of course not only introduce greater competition in the gas market at every point down that pipeline, including in the Hunter, but also introduce additional competition in the gas market in Sydney, Australia's biggest market, and no doubt as a result will drive gas prices down in the private sector for both residents and industry operating in Sydney. The gas pipeline would not be a viable proposition if it did not have the Hunter Economic Zone as a base customer. Superannuation savings, a pool of money, taking pressure of pensions, taking pressure off the current account and making savings available for investment in Australian projects like the Hunter Economic Zone all flow into delivering super benefits to regions such as the Hunter. This brings us to the question of the most recent talk about superannuation-the government plans as announced in the budget. Some on the other side of the House have dared to criticise Labor for not articulating fixed and firm view on these super changes. That astounds me, given that they are not in the budget and there is no real proposal. The Treasurer says he was out there consulting for 12 months to deal with the very many unanswered questions about that scheme, the least not being the transitional arrangements for many people, but the government wants us to have a firm position. That in itself is a ridiculous proposition and we certainly will not be drawn into it. It is interesting to see the member for Wentworth at the table because he, like me, sat for a long time on the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, putting a lot of energy into an inquiry into the adequacy of superannuation for under-40s in this country. I cannot say too much about that inquiry because the report is yet to be tabled. Indeed, I think it is still in draft form and that would be a question of privilege. I do not think anyone would be surprised to learn that members of that committee were surprised to see the measures in the budget. I do not think it would be giving too much away, or running the gauntlet on privilege, to say that it has obviously been a surprise to them and has caused them some difficulty, because these changes were out of left field. While they will no doubt prove to be politically popular, the question arises whether they are both good politics and good policy. I think there is a lot of debate to be had in this country before those matters are finally determined. The good thing about the government's super changes is that they present simplicity. There is no doubt that consumers and financial advisers alike have been seeking greater simplicity for a long time. The other good thing-I suppose you might call it a good thing-is that it retains the core of Keating's super plan, the employer super contributions a et cetera. So the savings net will continue. It is hard to argue that this legislation does anything about adequacy. I have not seen any great evidence that it will address in any way the number one issue, and that is adequacy. I do not see how it is going to add significantly to super savings for many people in many demographics. There are a couple of big concerns with this legislation. One is that it would appear that the changes proposed-I underscore the word ‘proposed' because in many senses we have not even seen the changes yet with no real costings-will undermine the progressivity of Keating's scheme; in other words, make it more regressive, with most of the benefits coming to those on higher incomes who are most able to take advantage of the changes. What really surprised me about those changes-in fact, it shocked me and many in the community-was the removal of the incentive to take one's super as a pension type payment; that is, as an annuity or an allocated pension, some other means of spreading the super over the balance of one's life. This was a key element of Keating's package. What is the alternative? Give people an equal choice not affected by tax of taking an annuity, an allocated pension or a lump sum. Human nature is a fairly predictable thing. When some people who have never seen in one lump sum more than $50,000 in their life see a bucket of money worth anything up to $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000, I know what they will do: they will take the lump sum. Unfortunately, in some cases-it might be the minority of cases-they will also blow it. Some will do it almost deliberately-buy some fancy things, go around the world a few times or buy a new, gold wristwatch. Others do it inadvertently. Unfortunately, they will get caught up in a bad financial decision and lose the money. But, whatever the mechanism, whatever the process, one thing is certain: when the money is gone there is only one place to turn, and that is back to the age pension. This is not a clever move. It might be superficially attractive to some, but it is not a good thing for the nation. This is the debate we need to have. Let me say this about the scrapping of the end benefit tax at age 60. The considerable majority of Australians do not pay this tax because it cuts in above $129,000 indexed for post 1983 superannuation savings. Even those that do pay it have it rebated back if they place the lump sum in a complying pension or annuity. That is the current systemagain, an incentive to take the super as a long-term payment rather than a lump sum. Turning to superannuation benefits, there is to be no income tax on a lump sum or pension at age 60. This is a significant change in benefit to those who have more than $129,751 in super savings at age 60. A person at age 60 will also be able to draw on their super even if they are still working full time or part time. They will no longer have to cease doing so at age 65; they can contribute to their super until age 75. This tax-free status will apply to new and existing retirees in a pension/annuity scheme but not to retired public servants in a defined benefit fund. It appears those in defined benefit pensions will receive a 10 per cent rebate instead. This, of course, is the politicians' tax cut, the principle being that you cannot deliver in the budget a big tax break for those in a taxed fund because that would upset the relativities between those in a taxed fund and those in an untaxed fund. So to fix this problem, the principle is that you have to provide equity. The only way to provide equity is to give a 10 per cent rebate to those in an untaxed fund. This will affect not only politicians but also in greater volume public servants in these defined funds. That might be a principle worthy of supporting-it is a shame that politicians were in there muddying the waters-but it raises real questions about the government's approach. These are the things we need to be debating. Turning to self-employed contributions, the self-employed are to be covered by the co-contribution scheme and the same new general tax stream limitations as employees. Currently, a self-employed person can claim a 100 per cent tax deduction for the first $5,000 of contribution and a 75 per cent tax deduction for anything above this amount up to the age based limit, and the selfemployed are not entitled to payment from the government's co-contribution scheme. This is the only new measure that will directly encourage higher contributions to the system. The number one issue is adequacy. Out of the government's whole super package-I am not going to put a dollar value because they effectively have not but it is billions dollars-only self-employed contributions are likely to add to adequacy. Again, these are matters we need to debate over the coming period in which the Treasurer has allowed us to consider the proposal. We will not be drawn into coming to conclusions on them now. With respect to contribution limits, there will be a new $50,000 yearly cap on all contributions for persons under age 49. This will replace the retirement benefit limit of approximately $1.3 million indexed and the existing age based yearly limits, which are less than age 35, maximum of some $14,000; from age 35 to 49, maximum of $40,000odd; and, from age 50 to 69, maximum of $100,000. This is of benefit to those aged 49 or less as it allows them to contribute more to their super each year if they wishif they can find the money to do so. It is negative for those aged 50 to 69 as it effectively halves the amount they can contribute to super. As the main group affected by this would be the high-income earners, the government has already flagged a transitional arrangement to help those persons over 50 who are disadvantaged-and so it should. This is the big call. I know that financial advisers around the country are scurrying to tell their clients to get that money into that fund while they can. They are typically selfemployed, they earn good money, they are looking for an opportunity to divest themselves of some of that capital into super, and the government is about to change the rules on them. With respect to asset tests for the age pension, there is a reduction in the pension asset test taper rate from $3 to $1.50 per fortnight for every $1,000 of assessable assets. Currently, the limits are a single home owner can accrue $165,000 in assets and a couple, $275,000 in assets, before it affects their pension. Currently, for every $1,000 of assets of a person exceeds this limit, it reduces their pension by $3. The budget proposal will help age pensioners by a $1.50 reduction for every $1,000 over the asset limit. Superannuation will still be included as part of the income assets test in determining a person's eligibility for receiving an age pension. There is nothing wrong with that. The opposition does not have a particular difficulty with that proposition but, again, where is the measure for adequacy? I will briefly say something about the detail of the bill before the House, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006. I do not want to dwell on it. It is unusual for me to immediately follow the minister presenting the bill but, as he indicated, the bill consolidates and revises the government's arrangements of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, commonly known as the CSS, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, commonly known as the PSSAP, and gives effect to them from 1 July 2006. I love all those acronyms. The bill's introduction is in response to the Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, commonly known as the Uhrig review, which reported in mid-2002. So you can see the government has not rushed in. The Uhrig review was appointed to review the governance practices of statutory authorities and office holders. Of particular interest to the review were those agencies which impact on the business community. The objective of the review was to identify issues in relation to existing governance arrangements and to provide policy options for government to gain the best from statutory authorities and office holders and their accountability framework. The review found that the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should be applied to statutory authorities and recommended that these organisations should be governed by a CEO. The review also found the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 should be applied to statutory authorities and these organisations should be governed by a board. In general, agencies which exclusively manage Commonwealth appropriations should be represented and governed by a CEO, and a board structure is favoured if there is a strong commercial focus to the organisation or if the agency is intergovernmental. The main recommendation of the Uhrig review was on the optimal size of a statutory authority board. The review recommended a public sector board size of between six and nine members. Currently, the boards overseeing the Commonwealth superannuation schemes are of different sizes: the CSS board has seven members, the PSS board has five members, and the PSS board is responsible for the operation of the PSSAP. Following the release of the Uhrig report, the Department of Finance and Administration recommended that the PSS board be increased from five to seven members and that consideration be given to the establishment of a single board for the CSS, the PSS and the PSSAP. So the proposed merger of the CSS and the PSS boards has several advantages, including reducing complexity, simplifying administration and bringing the Commonwealth superannuation investments into line with best practice principles identified in the Uhrig review. Labor's view is that this bill has no financial implications. It is true to the Uhrig report and on that basis we will be supporting the changes articulated in the bill.",91
117,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded?,97
118,Dr EMERSON,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I second the amendment. Labor supports the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006 because it involves a modest amount of streamlining and simplification and that of itself is a worthy objective. It involves no cost to the revenue; therefore, on that basis it makes sense to establish a single board overseeing the various superannuation acts governing public servants. That is why Labor supports it. I also support very strongly the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Hunter, and I want to dwell on the content of that amendment in my remarks tonight. The entire modern superannuation system of Australia was developed by former Treasurer Paul Keating-a tribute to him and his farsightedness in ensuring that there were reasonable retirement income prospects for working Australians. Up until that time superannuation had been the province of wealthy Australians, whereas working Australians on lower incomes did not look forward to the prospect of a reasonable retirement income. Mr Keating, as the Treasurer, set the ball rolling by introducing a compulsory superannuation scheme through the superannuation guarantee arrangements. He had the foresight to understand what was confirmed in 2002 by the present Treasurer in the Intergenerational report-that is, we do have a problem with the ageing population. In the true Labor spirit of encouraging self-reliance and self-provision, former Treasurer Paul Keating knew that something needed to be done and that is why he created superannuation for working Australians. In so doing, he created a world-leading retirement incomes policy, where there would be a combination of superannuation and, for all those who did not have adequate retirement incomes, a part or full age pension. This was a far-reaching reform that has put Australia in a very good position. If it had not occurred then the alarm bells that were ringing in 2002 in the Intergenerational report would have been positively deafening because, even with Paul Keating's far-sighted reforms, there are genuine financial problems associated with the ageing population and there are problems with the budget. Indeed, the Intergenerational report projects that, on the assumption that tax rates are unchanged, there will be an increase in the cal deficit equal to five per cent of GDP. is a very large amount of money, something in the order of $60 billion-something about which all Australians should be concerned and something about which we as parliamentarians need to anticipate and to put in measures to ensure that that very bad scenario does not unfold in Australia. When Treasurer Keating introduced these reforms you would have thought and hoped that a coalition in opposition that paraded itself as the champion of self-reliance and individual liberties would have supported the spreading of superannuation through the workforce but, sadly, it opposed those superannuation measures with extreme vigour. It did everything it possibly could to ensure that working Australians did not enjoy the benefits of the superannuation guarantee. This brings me to the often heard assertion in this parliament that, when in opposition, the coalition supported the reform program of the Hawke and Keating governments. At best, that is a massive overstatement. It is well known now-and confirmed by the Productivity Commission, the OECD, the International Monetary Fund, the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury-that much of the prosperity that Australia enjoys now was a consequence of the reform program of the Hawke and Keating governments. That reform program was not, contrary to assertions by the Prime Minister, widely supported by the coalition, then in opposition. Central to that reform program was the introduction of an assets test on the age pen the Opposition at that time, but the coalition ran a very strong campaign against the assets testing of the pension. I note in the discussion paper released on budget night that there is a proposal to further ease the assets test on fis- the pension. Access Economics has in the That media today estimated that most of the $6.2 billion cost of the changes over the next four years in retirement incomes is in fact attributable to the easing of the assets test on pensions. So the coalition has been pretty consistent on this and obviously believes that the pension should be universally available-yet this is a political party that parades itself as the champion of self-reliance and selfprovision. The coalition's opposition to Labor's reform program did not stop there. The coalition opposed many of the measures introduced by the incoming Labor government to close down the notorious bottom of the harbour schemes. It also opposed the major tax reform program of 1985, which included a fringe benefits tax, a capital gains tax and the nondeductibility of entertainment expenses-all of which in fact were used to broaden the income tax base and to lower the marginal rates. I notice the member for Wentworth is at the table today-certainly a strong advocate of broadening the income tax base to lower the marginal rates of taxbut, while the coalition talks the talk of tax reform, it was Labor in government that walked the walk on tax reform and effected the biggest cuts in marginal rates of income tax in the postwar period. If you look at the history of the reforms to the tax system, Madam Deputy Speaker, you will find that the cuts in the marginal rates of income tax were actually made by Labor governments. Ironically, the party that says it is the party tax reform has increased marginal rates of income tax, eroded the income tax base along the way and jiggled the thresholds ever so slightly. It was not only the fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and non-deductibility of entertainment expenses that the coalition opposed but also the petroleum resource rent tax, a tax that will be the subject of debate later this week. Thank goodness we have a petroleum resource rent tax: we have a resources boom and the PRRT, which I was able to assist in designing, collects for the community a reasonable share of the benefits of that resources boom as it applies to the petroleum industry. But, true to form, the coalition government opposed that. Where am I leading with this? I am leading to this point: one of the next great reforms that the coalition opposed was the provision of superannuation and a reasonable retirement income to working Australians. The coalition was, as I said earlier, vigorous in its opposition. Of course, the coalition knew that this was an important reform and thought, for political opportunism, it should nevertheless oppose it. I have a document titled Super for all-security and flexibility in retirement: the federal coalition's superannuation and retirement income policy, dated 19 February 1996. It was one of these rolled gold ironclad promises-a core promise, I am sure-because here it is in black and white on page 6: A Coalition Government: will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 Budget to match compulsory employee contributions according to the proposed schedule; will deliver this Government contribution into superannuation or like savings; reserves the right to vary the mechanism for delivering this contribution so as to provide the most effective and equitable delivery of the funds. So here we have the coalition coming into of government saying, ‘We will preserve and protect the amount of money that Labor has set aside for increasing superannuation contributions through the superannuation guarantee.' It said it might look at different ways of making sure that those funds flowed to people's retirement incomes but it would keep that amount. It goes on to say: The Coalition will inherit both Labor's proposal and the expectation that has gone with it. We will deliver the full benefit of the proposed contribution but will do so in a manner that is both efficient and equitable. The coalition took government in 1996 and then in the 1997 budget it cancelled the extra contribution which would have flowed into the accounts of working Australians and which would thereby have increased the provision for retirement incomes to 12 per cent from nine per cent. It did not preserve those funds. It did not do that at all. Instead it introduced the infamous savings rebate that lasted all of six weeks. When the Prime Minister was asked in the parliament whether he would take the savings bonus, he declared he would not and the whole thing went down the tube within six weeks-and with that came the breaking of the promise that was made in 1996 and the assurance that retirement savings of working Australians would be an adequate 12 per cent of incomes. Fast forward to 2006. We have another major change in the superannuation arrangements. It is a complex document and detail is still missing. I want to spend some time now making some observations about the discussion paper that was released on budget night. The Treasurer certainly gave the impression on budget night that this was a set of policies. It is not. It paper. But, when you stop to think for a moment it means this: that anyone over the age of 60 in the future need not pay income tax. The reason I say that is that anyone over the age of 60 will be able to take superannuation benefits as a lump sum or put it into a savings vehicle, and the earnings on that savings vehicle will be tax exempt. So they can take the lump sum tax free or they can put that money into this vehicle and any earnings on that will be tax exempt. Add to that the senior Australian tax offset, which is around $20,000 for an individual and $40,000 for a couple, and you would be a mug to be paying income tax if you are over the age of 60. When we assess the merits of this proposal, let us apply the standard tests. The first test in assessing the merits of a change in taxation arrangements is simplicity. It passes that. It certainly is simple, and there- a week. fore, on that basis, the proposal has merit. But I have a way of simplifying the income tax system dramatically. Up until recent changes, the income tax act ran to 9,600 pages. There is a way of simplifying that: abolish income tax. This is effectively what the government has done in respect of superannuation for anyone over the age of 60. So abolishing a tax certainly passes the test of simplicity and gets a tick on that basis. The second criterion would be revenueraising capacity. We have taxes to raise revenue. As a result of the effective abolition of income tax for people over the age of 60, as appears to be the case outlined in this discussion paper, there will be a very substantial hole in the revenue. Taxation statistics have just been released for the year 2003-04 and they reveal that income tax collected from people over the age of 60 amounted then to almost $10 billion. So I pose this question: do these changes put a $10 billion hole in the income tax base? On the face of it, that apis a discussion pears to be the case. If you put a $10 billion hole in the income tax base then we must ask the question: how will the hole be plugged? There are three ways. The first way to plug a $10 billion hole in the income tax base is to increase the income tax for those who still pay it-that is, working people up to the age of 60. I have done a simple calculation. For a taxpayer on $55,000 per annum, the average tax rate would have to rise from 25.2 per cent to 28.1 per cent. That is an increase of 2.9 percentage points and it equates to an increase in tax paid of-wait for it-11.5 per cent. What does that work out as in dollars per week? More than $30 a week. So, if you do poke a $10 billion hole in the income tax base and you say to the other people, who do pay tax, ‘You've got to pick up the bill,' the bill for someone on $55,000 a year is more than $30 There are two other ways of plugging the hole. The second way is to withdraw services for people over the age of 60-or indeed for people under the age of 60. People over the age of 60 have become accustomed to having their aged care supported financially by the government of the day. They have been accustomed to receiving an age pension if their incomes are not so high as to preclude them from receiving the pension, and there is also health care. One or more of those would have to be curtailed in order to fund the $10 billion hole. There is a third way. The third way is the GST. This is the orphan tax. The government of Australia, the Howard government, denies that it ever gave birth to this tax. It says not a Commonwealth tax. It is a Commonwealth tax. Ask the Statistician and ask the Auditor-General but do not ask the Howard government because it will deny that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The third way of plugging a $10 billion hole is to increase the rate of GST or remove the food exemption-that would do the trick. We on the Labor side of politics would strongly oppose these sorts of measures: increasing the GST rate or removing the food exemption, withdrawing the age pension or services from people over the age of 60 who have retired and are on low incomes or increasing the income tax burden on working Australians. It is incumbent on the government, when it releases its final position paper on these superannuation changes, to inform the Australian people honestly as to which of those three options it favours in order to fund the big hole that it has poked in the income tax base. The Intergenerational report was an important report and if we have a $10 billion hole now just imagine what that hole will look like as more and more wealthy baby boomers move into retirement. The first of those baby boomers, born in 1946, will reach the age of 60 this year, but we know that there is a huge surge of retiring baby boomers coming through the system and that that is what is causing the ageing of the population. I advise the House that at present around 18 per cent of Australians are over the age of 60 and that by 2041 that will have increased to more than 31 per cent, so the $10 billion hole must get bigger and the chickens must come home to roost. It is all very well for this government to release a policy which sounds terrific and simple but will it lead to those chickens coming home to roost and to a future government withdrawing services from or increasing tax rates on the poor? That is what the government has to it is answer, and it has to answer it soon. (Time expired)",97
119,Mr RIPOLL,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak tonight on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006. It is interesting to be speaking on this bill not only because the bill does a variety of things but also because it gives me and other members in this place some opportunity to venture wide while still remaining within the confines of discussing superannuation within the context of superannuation changes, particularly those relating to the budget. Superannuation is a very important area, and we have just heard the member for Rankin talking about the Intergenerational report and the impact that report will have on the future decisionand policy-making direction of governments and how we deal with people's retirement incomes, particularly those of the baby boomers when their turn to retire comes, many of whom will retire soon. So there are many very important decisions, issues and policies to be considered not only by this government today but by future governments in this area whose importance I think is sometimes well and truly overlooked in terms of long-term planning and what needs to be done. I cast my mind back to not too long ago when Treasurer Costello was lording the greatness of the Intergenerational report. We heard from him at that time that this was the biggest thing, the biggest challenge, the biggest policy area for the next 40 years-this was going to be bigger than anything else that had ever taken place. Mr Murphy-What has he said lately on it?",101
120,Mr RIPOLL,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Exactly! The member for Lowe throws me a good line when he asks, ‘What has he said lately on it?' Unfortunately, the Treasurer has said nothing, and it would be a real tragedy if he is not being true to his word. Not so long ago, when the Intergenerational report came out, he was using it almost like his personal manifesto. He talked about this great challenge for the next 40 years-visionary words but we are yet to see visionary policy or action. I have to say that am concerned about what that means for the future, particularly if you look at the latest budget: the huge spend by government, the opening up of the coffers and the throwing out of money, sprinkling it over Australia and hoping that it hits the political mark with our seeing nothing such as some serious work on the direction given by the Intergenerational report, which is very much supported and understood by the Labor Party. Labor were the builders of superannuation. It was the Labor Party that saw well into the future and had a grand vision, a great vision, of ordinary working people being independent in their retirement and having good, solid retirements-people who would normally not have the capacity to access the income or funds that would provide for them in their retirement years. So Labor have always been the builders and have always had the visionary policy to deal with these issues, and I do not think anything has changed today. Labor are still committed to superannuation and we believe it should be much better than it currently is. The nine per cent is tainly a good position and a good start, but we certainly need to move forward from that. I, as a Labor member, the Labor Party itself, the people who have supported us and ordinary people should be very proud of the work that Paul Keating did that very much led the super debate. He worked hard to try to get people to understand how important it is to save for your retirement, to put something away to make sure that you are not left to your last resort, the pension. Thank God the pension is there, but living on it is a meagre existence and a difficult position for most. People lucky enough to have paid off and own their home, to have their own vehicle and to have no other debts to speak of can get by on the pension, but we know it is very difficult to do so. All of the members of this House, whether they are on this side or I on the government side, fully appreciate the difficulty that people on the pension generally have in trying to still lead a normal, decent life while being on the bare minimum. So I think it is opportune that this bill has come up tonight. The bill has a number of purposes. One is that it revises and consolidates the governance arrangements for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSAP, and that will take effect from 1 July this year. The bill enters the House in response to the Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. This is part of the Uhrig review, which reported in mid-2003. The Uhrig review was appointed to look at the governance practices of statutory authorities and office holders. Of particular interest to the review were those agencies which impact particularly on the business community. While it was not a completely widesweeping review, it was still an important cer- one that identified a number of very important aspects and discrepancies in the accountability, management and operation of those super funds that I have mentioned. In particular the objective of the review was to identify issues in relation to existing governance arrangements and to provide policy options for government to gain the absolute best from their statutory authorities and office holders in those authorities and to deal with the accountability frameworks and how they operate within those particular funds. The review found that the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should be applied to statutory authorities, and ommended that these organisations be governed by a chief executive officer. The review also found that the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 should be applied to statutory authorities and that these organisations should be governed by a board. These are sensible recommendations and I do not think anyone would question them, and certainly we support them. The review also found in general terms that agencies that exclusively manage Commonwealth appropriations should be represented and governed by a CEO and board structure. That was favoured in terms of a strong commercial focus towards an organisation or if the agency happened to be an intergovernmental agency. The main recommendation of the Uhrig review was in relation to the optimal size of statutory authority boards. The review recommended that a public sector board size should be between six and nine members. Currently the boards overseeing the Commonwealth's superannuation schemes are all different. There is no consistency in how they operate and there are a number of inconsistencies in the sizes of the boards. For example, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board has seven members and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board has only five members, and the PSS board is responsible for the operation of the PSSAP as well. Following the release of the Uhrig review, the Department of Finance and Administration recommended that the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board be increased from five to seven members and that consideration be given to the establishment of a single board for the CSS, the PSS and the PSSAP. Again, these are good, sensible proposals. The proposed merger of the CSS and the PSS boards has several advantages. A number of things that will be of benefit will be the reduced complexity and the dilution to a it recsimpler and much more accountable board with a better format and a much more transparent and accessible style of operation and administration. The simplified administration is very important. If you made a comparison with industry super funds, you would see that they are certainly run well. I do not think there are any particular issues in terms of their practices, but certainly inconsistencies and a number of management and administrative issues could always be improved. If you have a look at the performance of industry super funds, and there are quite a number of them, you can see that they are exceptionally well managed, particularly some of those that are run by unions. They are excellent funds and are models within the superannuation schemes and funds industry. I think there are some good lessons to be taken from the way that unions run their schemes and how effective and profitable they are for their membership in the services they provide. There are lessons in the way they are administered and the way in which their boards are run. It always gives me great confidence to know that these funds are managed in the way they are. Another area of importance relates to conformity and pulling Commonwealth superannuation investments into line with the best practice principles identified in the Uhrig report. That link between what happens in industry funds and what happens in Commonwealth superannuation investments needs to be strong in terms of how they are administered and their performance. The Uhrig review dealt with those issues. Concerns were raised in relation to assets of the three schemes that would be joined together and managed as one trust. The government has given assurances that this will not happen. So the government has looked at this issue and we are confident that that will be the case. It is also important that the investments of the three schemes are separately managed as the age profiles and the rates at which members of the various schemes retire are different. There are different needs in the different schemes. The schemes really are unique in their provision of services, and I think it is important that this unique provision of services be dealt with separately. They should have their own management and their own boards, and they should be accountable in that fashion so that there can be no question on the transparency, the complexity or the issues that arise because of differences in the way they are administered. Consultation on this bill has been conducted and an agreement reached that satisfies all members of both the current boards. The bill has no financial implications for the Commonwealth, which I am sure the Commonwealth is very happy about. Labor supports the bill, which I said earlier and other speakers have also said, and it does provide us with the opportunity to look at superannuation more generally. Quite interestingly, in relation to the budget, with which I started, there are sweeping superannuation changes from the government, in particular to the 15 per cent exit tax. It is thrown at us every day that this is a great change from the government. It is certainly applauded and it is a good change, but I think there could have been a better change. More interesting than that, though, is the number of people that it will affect. That is certainly a key point here. The impression I got on the day was that this was a massive change that affected everybody-that it had a 100 per cent impact. On closer examination, if you dig just below the surface, you will find that most Australians are not affected at all by the 15 per cent exit tax. I will be very generous and say that we were slightly misled; certainly, we were not led in the proper direction on this. The truth of the matter is that around 85 per cent of people never pay the exit tax-and it is important that we note that. Most people do not have enough superannuation to meet the cut-off limit of $129,750. So, even though they might have been rubbing their hands together on budget night and thinking it was all solved and done, they are not affected by it. It is not just the complexity of the Australian superannuation system that is a problem. The day after the budget speech, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, said: … you don't need a financial adviser to get into superannuation … can I say to you one of the reasons why people have been going to financial advisers is the end rules have been so complex. Once we sweep those away then I don't think you will need a financial adviser at the end of the superannuation chain either because you will know this one thing, that your superannuation will come out of the fund tax free. Mr Murphy-You can't trust him.",102
121,Mr RIPOLL,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I think you are right. You cannot trust him on this. However, as my colleague Senator Sherry quite rightly pointed out, the new rules for contribution limits-that is, $50,000 a year for those under 50-create new uncertainty and increase the need to seek financial planning advice. So I do not think this is going to make things simpler or easier for anyone else. Then, of course, there was the outrageous 15 per cent surcharge, which was introduced back in 1996. Mr Murphy interjecting",104
122,Mr RIPOLL,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The government promised at that time that there would be no new taxes, but, two months later, we saw a new taxand we have seen a whole heap since then. So it is not always as it seems on the surface. The government are so confused about their own superannuation changes that they cannot even get it right among themselves. We have been hearing it in question time in the House of Reps. The government have been saying, ‘Will you back our super changes?' We have been saying, ‘We'd love to if we knew what they were. You don't.' Although they have made an announcement, the government do not have policies yet. It is quite usual, in terms of a budget, to make an announcement and put an aggregate costing on it-I think the figure is about $6.2 billion-and not break it down so that we can see where the money is being spent. Again, a bit of shenanigans is going on there. Just six days after the Treasurer, Mr Costello, proclaimed that you do not need to get a financial adviser, Chris Pearce, the liamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, said, ‘I would have thought it would have been quite the opposite.' So I think the Treasurer and his parliamentary secretary will have to have a bit of a talk and see who is right on this issue. It is certainly an area of concern. This bill is not controversial. This bill Labor's support. Labor have always supported proper and correct moves to enhance Australia's superannuation regime. We will continue to do that not only because we built the system but also because we are supporters of superannuation. We think superannuation is a very important part of a person's retirement and that it should be supported. There are a number of other things which are important to note when discussing these matters. The government said that about 100,000 people are expected to retire next year, implying that this is how many people would save a massive amount of money on the 15 per cent exit tax. But, if you break that down, it is quite misleading, because that is just the number of retirements. It does not go into the detail of who will benefit from it. If you are a CEO retiring on millions of dollars there will be a huge windfall-not that you would need it. But for an ordinary person who is retiringMr Murphy-David Murray is going to do well.",104
123,Mr RIPOLL,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"David Murray will do very well. There is no question about that at all. Another change in the budget which is a good idea and supported by Labor is that self-employed contributions-those covered by the co-contribution scheme-will now be given the same general tax treatment and limitations as employees. I think this is a good move and a worthwhile change. But, if you break it down and take out the 15 per cent, this is the only new measure, in terms of self-employed contributions, that directly Par- encourages higher contributions to the system. I think that is key. What we should be doing is directly encouraging higher contributions-if the government had the gumption. Senator Minchin said a number of times in interviews that the real kicker, the real bonus, would have been on the way in. Anyhas body who has done basic maths 101 would understand that, if you save the 15 per cent on the way in, the accumulation over a lifetime to retirement gives you a much bigger outcome. That can easily be demonstrated by anyone who sits down and does some simple arithmetic on this. Of course, the cheaper option, the easier option, is to do it on the way out. I think that is what the Treasurer was talking about when he said this is less complex. Yes, it is less complex for government, but it is not necessarily less complex for those who are about to retire. So there are a range of issues. The government has finally taken some notice on superannuation. The greatest tragedy is that, with the size of this budget, the government, in raining down dollars wherever it could, missed the mark. The government missed the opportunity to make visionary changes where they were needed the most. For me and a lot of people I have talked to, that is the real miss in the budget and the super changes. People were pretty excited up front, and I think this is why the government missed the point on this. They thought they would get a great week or two out of their budget, but it only lasted a few hours because people worked out very quickly that there were more politics than good measures in what the government had done. Labor support this bill, but we think the government has a lot more work to do. (Time expired).",105
124,Mr GEORGANAS,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I too rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The purpose of this bill is to consolidate and revise the governance arrangements for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, or CSS, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, or PSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, or PSSap, with effect from 1 July 2006. Before I speak on the substance of this bill I would like to place on record my views of the government's superannuation changes announced in the budget-particularly, the Treasurer's contemptuous attitude to every Australian saving for retirement. The budget announced that the 15 per cent exit tax on superannuation payments would be abolished. The first point I would like to make is that this does not help many Australians. Why? For the simple reason that it only applies to those with savings over $129,751 and the majority of Australians do not have this kind of money when they retire. I see many people in my electorate of Hindmarsh, where 25 per cent of the population are 65 or over, and, believe me, many of those people are retiring on very little super or none at all. The second point I would like to make is how ridiculous-in fact, reckless-was the Treasurer's statement that there is no need to get financial advice on superannuation anymore. The Treasurer said on 10 May: ... you don't need a financial adviser to get into superannuation ... Can I say to you one of the reasons why people have been going to financial advisers is the end rules have been so complex. Once we sweep those away then I don't think you will need a financial adviser at the end of the superannuation chain either because you will know this one thing, that your superannuation will come out of the fund tax free. This is clearly nonsense. In the very same budget there are changes which make the superannuation system even more complex. Take the planned new rules on contribution limits. The limit of $50,000 a year for those under 50 creates new complexity. Some of the rules are backdated and are not finalised due to the need for transitional provisions. In fact, the Treasurer's own assistant, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Pearce, stated last week: ‘I would have thought it would have been the opposite.' This superannuation system is so confusing the that the Treasurer and his assistant cannot agree-or maybe it is just that they do not talk to each other. I have to agree with the Treasurer's assistant on this occasion: the changes in the superannuation system make it more complicated, not less. The bill enters the House as a result of the Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, which reported in mid-2003. In November 2002, the government appointed Mr John Uhrig to conduct a review of the corporate governance of Commonwealth statutory authorities and office holders. The objective of the review was to identify issues in relation to existing governance arrangements and to provide policy options for government to gain the best from statutory authorities and office holders and their accountability frameworks. The Uhrig review recommended two templates for government statutory authorities to ensure good governance: agencies should be managed either by a chief executive officer or by a board structure. The review states: Two templates have been developed incorporating these governance principles. A ‘Board Template' is proposed where government takes the decision to delegate full powers to act to a board, or the Commonwealth itself does not fully own the assets or equity of a statutory authority (that there are multiple accountabilities). The ‘Executive Management Template' is proposed in other cases. The review found the following: firstly, that the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should be applied to the statutory authorities and that these organisations should be governed by a CEO and, secondly, that the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 should be applied to the statutory authority and that these organisations should be governed by a board. The opposition supports this bill.",106
125,Mr NAIRN,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"In summing up, I thank members opposite for their contributions on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The amendment moved by the member for Hunter was obviously a nonsense amendment that was simply designed to allow a number of members to talk on superannuation but had nothing to do with the bill itself. The member for Rankin spoke on the bill for about 30 seconds and then proceeded to talk on other matters. I think it came as such a surprise to members of the opposition that the superannuation measures in the budget were so good that they felt they had to grab every opportunity to try and regain some ground on superannuation as a result-and, unfortunately, they have used this bill to do so. The bill is straightforward. It brings together three schemes under one board. As I said in my second reading speech, it is a sensible bill and follows recommendations made in the Uhrig report. The consolidation of the governance arrangements for the three schemes under one board will provide significant opportunities for efficiencies in the where management of the schemes. It will also offer an opportunity for the new board to adopt is, one investment mechanism for the ongoing management and investment of the three funds. This is particularly significant for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, which has been closed to new members since 1990 and has a decreasing contribution base. I commend the bill to the House. Mr Murphy- Mr Speaker, I just want to put on record that I think the member for Rankin made an invaluable and lasting contribution to the superannuation debate.",107
126,The SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question is now that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading,107
127,Mr NAIRN,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA,107
128,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.00 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. East Timor",108
129,Mr SNOWDON,ADJOURNMENT,"Lingiari) (9.00 pm)This afternoon and this evening in Dili, in Timor Leste, a council of state has been meeting. A council of state includes the President of Timor Leste, Xanana Gusmao; the Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri; and the foreign minister, Jose Ramos Horta. I am sure that we all hope that they can come to some conclusions and to an agreement about the way ahead for the governance of Timor Leste in this time of some crisis. It is worth recalling Australia's involvement in East Tmor since 1999-indeed, our ongoing historical association with the people of Timor Leste primarily as a result of their protecting, harbouring and working with Australian troops in World War II. We should also be mindful that, in May 2004, when the United Nations took a decision to downgrade the number of military and civilian personnel wearing the blue berets, from 3,000 to 700, it took a conscious decision about the future of Timor Leste and the progress of that community. It also took the decision knowing that it had representations from that government to extend the length of the stay for the United Nations and to increase and maintain a higher level of military and police presence. That was not to be, so the United Nations took a conscious decision to change the way things were. Last Sunday the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, said in Guatemala that post conflict countries like East Timor needed more support to avoid descending again into chaos. She said: Countries emerging from warfare have to receive more support if they are going to cope. rent situation in East Timor signals the need for the recently constituted UN peace building commission. I say, ‘Hear, hear' to that. I also want to commend the Australian government for its response to the call from the government of Timor Leste for support. They are our friends, and we should be proud to maintain the strength of our relationship by showing them the support they greatly need. But I think it is too early to talk about failed states. There are many commentators who have written off Timor Leste in the last 36 to 48 hours. Some, who are most notable Australian foreign correspondents, have made quite outrageous assertions about the nature of the Timor Leste government. They ought to sit back and allow the council of state to work with the United Nations, and their friendsAustralia and the other nations who are providing forces, Malaysia and New Zealand in the first instance-to come to some reasonable agreement and arrangement as to how to progress things from now on. We should also recognise that, within a fairly short space of time, there are to be elections in Timor Leste. If, as has been asserted by many, principally from outside the country, there is a lack of confidence in the government, at that election-if, as in Australia, people express their will for a free and democratic process-they will have that opportunity to pass judgment. No doubt, if the judgment that has been asserted by many is determined, we will have a new government in Timor Leste. But what we do need to do is to sit back a bit, take a deep breath and stop the external commentary that has been taking place-including, sadly, from our own Prime Minister. We need to work with these people. We need to make sure that the government of Timor Leste are a viable government by showing them the support they richly deserve by working with them. By all means, The curmake sure they are accountable, but we should not see, as we have seen in the last little while, a consistent undermining of the government's attempts to try to maintain some sense of order-a sense of order which we all require and which will be assisted greatly by the presence of Australian troops who, once again, are doing a magnificent job. Australian Labor Party",108
130,Mr TICEHURST,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express my disgust at just far the Leader of the Opposition, the Labor Party and union officials have gone to attempt to increase their profile in my electoracross ate of Dobell. They blew into Terrigal last Saturday like the dark cloud of a thunderstorm-plenty of noise and lots of hot airbut it ended as a fizzer. The Leader of the Opposition was there to address a forum on Work Choices, along with Senator Hutchins, John Della Bosca and Health Services Union National Secretary, Craig Thomson. The forum ran from 11.30 to 12.30. Thomson, as president of a new group to represent locals, invited me and others to the launch of the so called independent Coastal Voice Community Group. He promoted free fun for the whole family to meet the patrons, the mariners and other local politicians. They were going to have a sausage sizzle, face painting and jugglers. Conveniently, it was to start 12.30, right across the road from the forum at which he had a starring role. He did not mention that none other than the Leader of the Opposition would do the launch. The hotel at Terrigal has a long history for the Labor Party, but Thomson would not know that-he was a blow-in from Victoria a few months ago. When Bob Hawke was Prime Minister, he held a national conference at Terrigal. There was a famous swim in the pool with certain ladies, as I recall. Then the Terrigal faction was formed. those days the ‘Florida'-which was the name of the pub-was more in keeping with the local pub, not the five-star top class status for headlining comrades as it is now as the Crowne Plaza. In addressing the House tonight, I must say that I am hesitant to give the ALP ploy any oxygen; however, I feel it is right for the Central Coast community to know how they have been hoodwinked. This so-called community group, Coastal Voice, purports to how represent Central Coast residents. Specifically, it purports to do this through lobbying for more government attention and funding issues such as transport, health, crime and youth and by ensuring accountability from the elected representatives of the Central Coast. This group is not the genuine apolitical community group that it pretends to be. It is in fact an Australian Labor Party front, with most, if not all, committee members affiliated with the Labor Party, including former Labor councillor Bill Thompson and former Labor candidate for the last council election, Kerry Stratford. Its recently distributed glossy brochure includes four ‘concerned residents' who outline their reasons for joining. These concerned residents are all ALP members. National Secretary of the Health Services Union, Craig Thomson, is president of this ALP at front. I am shocked to say that Craig Thomson sees nothing wrong with blatantly misleading local residents. To add insult to injury to the people of the Central Coast, this group deceived our local soccer team, the Central Coast Mariners, with regard to their intentions. They convinced them to become patrons of their so-called community group. Thankfully, the group's true identity was exposed, and I understand the mighty Mariners have withdrawn their support. One of my constituents struck up a conIn versation with one of the group's members at the barbecue launch on Saturday and was told: ‘Our plan is to hide behind other groups to get our policies out there.' This is Labor in action. I am proud to be a member of the Liberal Party and people know where I stand. To be so blatant in trying to deceive people by hiding this group's political affiliation is not the way things are done on the Central Coast. We say what we stand for; we are up front. The union representative who blew in from Melbourne a few months ago cannot pretend to understand the issues of the Central Coast, much less the way things are done locally. I have been on the Central Coast since 1977. I have watched and been active in the growth and protection of this beautiful part of Australia. Never in my 29 years on the Central Coast have I witnessed such a manipulative scheme to fool local residents. Graham Richardson's ‘Whatever it takes' is not the way to gain trust. Abraham Lincoln said, ‘You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.' Mr Thomson, my challenge to you is: come clean, stop scamming the people of the Central Coast and disband this ALP farce. Some residents have already discovered the true colour of the group. One resident, who emailed me last week, said: I noticed with interest the flyer (the third so far) that has come through my letterbox unauthorised featuring Mr Craig Thompson. Who is this man? I am a swinging voter, but smelt a rat, and set about finding out. He goes on to say: My problem is, how dare he now call himself the voice of the Central Coast? He is not from the Central Coast, and has only moved here to further his political ambitions. What would he know about the Coast and its people, and what they want? He continues: At least if you are going to run a political lobby group, be ethical about saying who you are. (Time expired) Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club Year of the Surf Lifesaver",109
131,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"On Saturday, 27 May, I was honoured to be invited to the annual awards of the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club at their new premises on the Glenelg foreshore. I was very thankful for their kind invitation to attend the awards last Saturday evening. It was very special for me to be involved, even if only in a small way, in the activities of the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club and to present some of the awards on the night, together with the Mayor of Holdfast Bay, Mr Ken Rolland, and the state member for Morphett, Mr Duncan MCFetridge. It was a very special and important night as it was the first award dinner in the club's brand new premises-a magnificent building with great facilities and overlooking the Glenelg beach on the former site of Magic Mountain. Members from South Australia would all be familiar with Magic Mountain. The Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club clearly deserves this great new building, these fantastic premises, for the magnificent work it has provided to the community and for the number of lives it has saved over the years at Glenelg beach. The club is currently growing, with over 400 members, and plays a significant role in our beachside suburbs. Glenelg is one of South Australia's busiest beaches, attracting beach-goers from all over the state. The importance of the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club cannot be overemphasised. In fact, the efforts of surf-lifesaving clubs Australia wide in rescuing people have been first class, as has been their provision of first aid assistance to thousands of people over the years. The Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club has created a sense of belonging for people in the area. It gives them an opportunity to connect with and to care about each other. Clubs like the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club get young people involved, out of their homes and active in the community and, in doing so, create a sense of community. This is what gives an area like Glenelg its identity and makes the people in the area proud to be part of the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club. At the same time, the club is doing great work for the South Australian community at large by saving many lives. I take this opportunity to congratulate the president of the Glenelg club, Mr Shane Daw, and all its committee members on their fantastic work and contribution to the community. I also take this opportunity to note with concern and sadness the large number of drowning deaths on beaches around Australia over the years. No doubt the number of drowning deaths would have been much greater if not for surf-lifesaving clubs around our nation. Australia, like that of Glenelg, and their members. Nevertheless, it is imperative that we all redouble our efforts to reduce this unnecessary and entirely preventable loss of life. I am pleased to see that next year we will be celebrating the Year of the Surf Lifesaver to promote the excellent work that surflifesaving clubs do and have been doing for the Australian public for many years. I look forward to assisting all the surf-lifesaving clubs by getting involved in my electorate in the promotion of this event. I would encourage all other honourable members who have a coast as a boundary to their electorates to also get involved in any way that they can in assisting the promotion of next year's Year of the Surf Lifesaver. I will certainly be involved in some way with four major surflifesaving clubs in the electorate of Hindmarsh. Somerton, Glenelg, West Beach, Henley Beach, Grange and Semaphore are all within my electorate. I would like to encourage even those members whose electorates are landlocked to get involved with the Year of the Surf Lifesaver next year, as they too will have constituents who visit beaches and who may need the assistance of surf lifesavers one day. Today I had the honour and pleasure to  ject Manager for the Year of the Surf Lifesaver. Mr Bruce briefed me on what is being proposed for next year's Year of the Surf Lifesaver. Some of the events sound very exciting, such as gala dinners to be held in every capital city, a national history book to be launched by the Governor General, an Australia Day presence of surf lifesavers across the country and many more events on Australia's coasts. Once again, I congratulate the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club and all surf-lifesaving clubs around Australia on their tremendous work and contribution to Bonner Electorate: Community Water Grants",110
132,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with a sense of pride that I rise this evening and confirm that, as a result of eight local community water projects, approximately 9,250,000 litres of water will be saved each year from now on in the electorate of Bonner. The Community Water Grants program has delivered thousands of dollars in funding to each of these eight local projects and I wish to acknowledge the local community groups and schools that have demonstrated their enthusiasm and commitment to saving our precious water resource. The proposals that will now be implemented are practical and community orientated and, most importantly, they will prove that a real measurable difference can be made when we, as a community, are conscious of every drop of water used. Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee, Clairvaux Mackillop College, First Contact Aboriginal Corporation for Youth, Manly West State School, Marshall Road State School, Manly Lota Scout Group, Villanova College and Wynnum West State School all designed outstanding projects that will not only improve water efficiency but also enlist local community participation and communicate the benefits of wise water use. In particular, I would like to make special mention today of two community water grant recipients: Marshall Road State School and First Contact Aboriginal Corporation for Youth. The Marshall Road State School rainwater irrigation project will receive $42,945 to replace the school's current irrigation system with a more efficient underground automatic system that will save water by allowing night watering and thereby reducing evaporation loss. In addition, the school will also save by linking the irrigation system to a rainwater tank ensuring that 1,370,000 litres of water are saved each year. The project has been led by the school's deputy principal, Mr Geoff Howatson, who deserves congratulations for the way in which he has involved the students, their families and the teachers in understanding just how important our water resource is. The way in which the school has embraced the Community Water Grants program is admirable and, as always, the school has led the local community by example. Students are enthusiastic about doing all that they can to preserve our vital resources, and the environmental awareness that Mr Howatson has fostered amongst students and their families is outstanding. On World Water Day I had the great pleasure of experiencing first-hand the positive effect that community water grants have also had on community groups. First Contact Aboriginal Corporation for Youth is an organisation from the south side of the Bonner electorate, and on Wednesday, 22 March, business, government and community representatives from throughout south-east Brisbane gathered on Mount Gravatt Mountain to acknowledge the funding of $48,445 that has been awarded to First Contact for the Echidna Magic Kiosk and Cafe project. Mount Gravatt Mountain is of special significance to both the local Indigenous community and the wider southside community. First Contact works tirelessly for the Aboriginal youth in and around the area and for too long the organisation's plans to establish an environmentally friendly community kiosk and cafe facility on the mountain have had to remain untouched due to the lack of funding and resources. The Community Water Grants program, however, offered the perfect opportunity for First Contact to incorporate an effective water-wise management program within the Mount Gravatt prowater ject. Organisation chairperson, Mr Robbie Williams, recognised the opportunity and he deserves congratulations for subsequently securing a community water grant of nearly $50,000 to implement the first stage of the project. A water efficient kiosk and cafe will be established and a tank installed to collect rainwater to irrigate a native plant revegetation. It is expected that through the project 1,400,000 litres of water will be saved each year. Just as importantly, the grant has rejuvenated the First Contact Corporation and its members and the community will be working together to ensure that an environmentally friendly and water wise facility is provided for the community by the community.

133,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (9.20 pm)Tonight I again raise my deep concerns regarding the rising violence in Sri Lanka, particularly the killing of civilians, including the most vulnerable of victims-children. In what could be a result of the international community's neglect, apathy or willingness to turn a blind eye, Sri Lanka has been marred in needlessly wasteful interethnic tensions since the late 1950s. It has not been uncommon for the civilian Tamil population to be the target of tragic extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and arbitrary arrest. Whilst the 2002 cease-fire agreement between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam brought hopes of peace for all parties involved in this intractable dispute, it appears the island of Sri Lanka is yet again engulfed in the sort of ferocity that once brought the needless death and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. It is a situation that all Australians hoped would be at an end following the 2002 cease-fire. Such was the optimism that many, me included, were looking forward to tangible steps being taken towards the resettlement and rehabilitation of Tamils in the wartorn north-east of Sri Lanka, as well as Tamil self-determination. Sadly, these commendable goals now seem further away than ever. This is not a surprise, given that the antecedents to peace are being systematically destroyed. A Reuters report dated 11 May 2006 notes that Sri Lankan troops have been involved in the killing of ethnic Tamil civilians in the island's north. Whilst the Sri Lankan government has denied such reports, this is contrary to advice from 60 unarmed monitors from Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland. Of concern is a report on 16 May 2006 from Amnesty International that states, inter alia, that there has been: ... a disturbing pattern of incomplete or ineffective investigations by the government, with the result that perpetrators of such violence generally operate with impunity. If ever proof were needed that the cease-fire now only exists on paper, that is it. This afternoon I attended a peaceful demonstration, organised by the Australian Federation of Tamil Associations, on the lawns of Parliament House and restated my support for a negotiated peace with the Tamil people. I also had the opportunity today to speak to local Tamils from my electorate of Lowe. Many have been paralysed by the recent turn of events in their homeland. There must be an end to this unnecessary bloodshed. There can be no doubt that all reasonable people in Sri Lanka-be they Tamil, Sinhalese or Muslim-demand a peaceful solution from their government. Following the deaths of over 60,000 people over more than two ferocious decades, the people of Sri Lanka surely deserve peace. No political, cultural or religious dispute can be worth so many wasted lives. On 1 June 1999 I stood in this House and called on the Australian government to take urgent action to press the Sri Lankan government to (1) withdraw its security forces from the occupied Tamil homeland, (2) lift the embargo on essential food and medicine, (3) seek a political solution to the conflict with the Tamil people that would enable them to choose their own political and national status and (4) recognise the Tamil right to self-determination as stipulated in article 1 of the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights. I reiterate that call again tonight. I also make reference to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states: All people have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. This must apply equally to the Tamil people as it does the Sinhalese. However, it is a truism that the building blocks of self determination may only be laid upon a foundation that comprises a cease-fire which is fully adhered to by all parties. It is with this in mind that I again call on the Australian government to make a concerted diplomatic effort to persuade the Sri Lankan government to implement the cease-fire agreement in full, with particular reference to the disarming of the paramilitary forces as agreed to in Geneva. The previous inertia shown by the Howard government to the bloodbath in Sri Lanka lies in stark contrast to the untiring efforts the Norwegian government to facilitate peace. The Howard government must seize the opportunity, albeit belatedly, to play a leading role in bringing the Sinhalese and Tamil communities together. Of course, apathy towards the situation in Sri Lanka may remain an option for the government. However, such a course would ensure that Australia is implicitly participating in the destabilising influence of Sri Lanka yet again, melting down into further decades of protracted civil war. Such a civil war can only destabilise our immediate region. The Howard government has an obligation to the thousands of Tamils in Australia, and the million Tamils worldwide, to help bring about a peaceful coexistence that is vital for peace and prosperity in Sri Lanka-as well as our immediate region. Australia can start by lobbying the Sri Lankan government to fully implement the 2002 Norwegian cease-fire agreement. Share Trading",112
134,Mr ANDERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Gwydir) (9.25 pm)The member for Wills last week in this place again effectively claimed that I had engaged in insider trading when my wife and I sold AWB shares last year. I again categorically deny any such impropriety. His clear intent is to imply that I must have had inside information about the contents of the Volcker report. He is wrong; I did not. Mr Thomson makes several claims in an attempt to justify his position. For example, he says I have given contradictory reasons for my wife and I determining to sell our shares. This is patent nonsense. I have consistently indicated that I formed the view a couple of years ago following a conversation with my accountant that my wife and I should diversify, and we further formed the view that we would let the shares go if they reached or exceeded $5. The fact that I did not immediately sell them of the first time they hit $5 reflects a couple of simple realities. The first is that I did not feel comfortable about diversifying through the purchase of new shares while I was a cabinet minister. The second is that I neither employed a share broker, who might have alerted me to the movements in the value of the shares on a regular basis, nor spent time as a minister poring over share registers on the internet or anywhere else. It was in fact only after I left the ministry that I began to turn my mind to the issue of succession planning-there are a couple of people from farm families in this place and they will know how important that is for farm families-and resolved to act. On checking the price in early October last year, my wife and I decided that the time had come to enact the in-principle decision that we had made long before, and so I placed an order with e-trade to sell my B-class shares. Indeed, the market-it is very important to note this; it is an interesting point-was not at all concerned by the contents of the Volcker report. The AWB shares rose consistently through the months building up to the first Cole hearings. So if I had had an inside tip it certainly was not a very good one. Mr Thomson further claims",114
135,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member will refer to other members by their seat.,114
136,Mr ANDERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Wills further claims that there is something untoward about the fact that I have not listed any new investments in my statement of pecuniary interests. In fact, my wife has over recent days begun to purchase some new shares, as I have advised the Clerk today. Further on the matter of Julia's shareholdings, I accept that during one interview on the Insiders program I must have temporarily overlooked two small parcels of shares that Julia held while I was Deputy Prime Minister. These were recorded in my pecuniary interest statements, which is of course how the member for Wills knows about them. In my early years as a cabinet minister, following a fuss in the Senate, Julia determined selflessly to sell off her portfolio at considerable disadvantage, even though she had owned them since before we were married. I do not believe that my mistake in this instance has any material bearing whatsoever on the substance of this matter. It should be noted again that although, as I have acknowledged, I was late in recording the sale of AWB shares-and I am embarrassed about that it was in fact I who told the Australian newspaper that I had done so. I was not asked, nor was I in any way forced to confess as a result of some discovery by others. I volunteered the information. The two brief meetings with the Prime Minister and other colleagues that I have referred to in the past and that the member for Wills seeks to misinterpret in no way alter the simple reality that I had no inside information on the report. My wife and I sold the shares for the reasons that I have consistently outlined. The member for Wills also refers to a claimed meeting with the Chairman of the AWB to discuss Volcker that was widely reported in the media some weeks ago. As he would be well aware, I made it plain that my diary did not refer to any such meeting, that I did not believe it had happened and the Chairman of the AWB confirmed my recollection in evidence to the Cole commission of inquiry the day after that news hit the headlines. As I have said outside this place, if I had been warned that there was serious trouble coming, some impropriety in the wings, I would have felt obligated to retain the shareholding. I make the point, and I make it quite emphatically, that should the member for Wills entertain any serious belief that I am guilty of insider trading he must exercise his responsibility to refer the matter immediately to the appropriate regulator, which happens to be ASIC. That is what he should do. Needless to say, ASIC would enjoy my full cooperation. A failure by him to do so will confirm that he does not believe his own imputations and has been using them for purely political purposes, in which case he, frankly, clearly owes me and my family an apology.
