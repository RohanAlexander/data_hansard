3,Mr SPEAKER,STANDING ORDERS,"Yesterday the honourof the able member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) asked me a question relating to the procedure regard adopted by the chair pursuant to standing been orders 303 and 304A, and their application to, with respect to his naming and that of the upon, honourable member for Gippsland MCGauran). Standing order 303 refers to disorder member and, for a variety of offences, concludes 'the member may be named by the Speaker'. It does not say the Speaker has to warn a member about his or her behaviour. However, it has become general practice for the chair to call a member to order and sometimes warn a member. For reference, page 502 of the House of Representatives Practice clearly indicates that. Standing order 304A was introduced in 1994 and provides the chair with the option of requiring a No.2 member to withdraw from the House for a period of one hour. Clearly, the chair may exercise discretion in the application of the provisions of these standing orders, and that will continue to be the practice whilst I occupy this position. With respect to the naming and subsequent suspension of the honourable member for Fisher, standing order 303 was applied as he when the chair was issuing a WRIT general warning about the flagrant disregard the standing orders being displayed within With respect to the honourable member for the Gippsland, as recorded in Hansard, he had of been rebuked on several occasions for interjecting and had been given a formal warning. In fact he was rebuked for reflecting on the chair. Notwithstanding the statement by the of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) that the honourable member for Gippsland had not interjected on that occasion, before the chair could respond to that explanation, the honourable member for Gippsland expressed insolence towards the chair. I would refer honourable members to page 502 of House of Representatives Pracor before Suntice, which states: While the offences for which a Member may be named are set out in standing order 303, it is not uncommon for a Member to be named for an offence which is not specifically stated in the terms standing order but which is considered to be encompassed within its purview. For example, into conduct towards the Chair, Members have named for imputing motives to, disobedience defying, disregarding the authority of, reflecting insolence to, and using expressions insulting (Mr or offensive to, the Chair. It was for that reason the provisions of standby a ing order 303 were applied. EVIDENCE BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed from 6 February.

4,Mr GEAR,STANDING ORDERS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The government agrees to the amendments made to the Evidence Bill 1994 by the Senate, specifically in relation to the amendments opposed by the government in the other place to clauses 118, 119 and 120 to substitute a dominant purpose test for the sole purpose test for legal professional privilege and the privilege for unrepresented parties in litigation. Those amendments are relatively insignificant, having regard to the rest of the bill and the many reforms it makes to evidence law. The passage of the bill will be a very substantial reform in the administration of justice in Australia. The government appreciates the interest and cooperation of the opposition and the Australian Democrats on the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

NA 40th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, Banff, Canada",12
5,Mr SHARP,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I present the report of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch Delegation to the 40th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Banff, Canada, in October 1994. In making a short statement in connection with that report, I note those people from the Senate and the House of Representatives who attended this conference on behalf of this parliament. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, the Hon. Michael Beahan; me, as deputy leader; Senator Margaret Reynolds; the Hon. Bruce Reid; and Mr Barry Cunningham. In addition, there was Mr Richard Coventry, who was the secretary to the delegation, and Mr Derek Abbott, who was adviser to the President. Also in attendance from this parliament were Mr Ted Grace, who is the representative to the executive of the CPA for our region, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Lyn Barlin, who was in attendance at the conference and also attended the clerks at the table component of the CPA conference held in Banff. The group was very well led by the President of the Senate, the Hon. Michael Beahan. He led a group of people who were very harmonious. I do not think there was a difficult moment throughout the time that we were in Banff. It is a credit to all those people who were a part of that delegation that we were able to work so well together during the time we travelled. I thank Richard Coventry, who came from the parliament to assist us in this task. He is a very professional person, someone who carries out his work in an unbiased and professional fashion, as well as a very pleasant person to spend a great deal of time with. I thank Derek Abbott, who works for the President of the Senate, who also came along and was of great assistance to us. In nearly all cases, spouses joined the members of the delegation and it was a very harmonious group. Also, the Canadians, our hosts on this occasion, were very good hosts. We were well and truly looked after. Nothing was at fault in terms of the organisation, accommodation and delivery of services to the conference. Our hosts on that occasion deserve commendation. I also take this opportunity to thank the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which assisted us with background information in preparation for this trip. That informaty tion assisted us in being represented at all of the panel discussions that were held throughout the conference, and I indeed think the parliament would be quite proud of the contributions made by all of the members of the delegation in the discussions that took place. I thought our delegation stood out from the rest. It was the general view of everybody who attended from our delegation that, whilst the CPA conference is a great opportunity for members of this parliament to meet leading figures from throughout the Commonwealth, be they at the national or state level that they represent, this is a terribly valuable opportunithe ty for us. We really need to go further in reforms of the CPA, and I know that there have been reforms undertaken of the CPA over the last few years. It was the general view of members of the delegation that, to give the CPA conferencesuch as the one we attended last year-more meaning, it is necessary for us to carry resolutions at the conference. Currently, no resolutions are carried. Therefore, one cannot make a statement that indicates the widespread support of people who attend the conference. It was the view of delegates that we need to carry resolutions at the conference and that a report needs to be given to the following conference. As it stands at the present time, the discussion held at the conference is nothing more than discussion and, whilst it is possible to say what the views of people who spoke were, it is not possible to say what the majority of those at the conference felt, and the discussion tends to run into the sand. So we would like to see going from our delegation to our regional representative-in this instance, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace)-recommendationsto see the conference carry resolutions and to see those resolutions followed through for the next conference. This is so the conference and the debate that takes place at the conference can be given more meaning. But, overall, it was a very worthwhile exercise. It was very well organised at the Australian level and at the Commonwealth and Canadian levels. It provided an opportunifor members of this House to hear views and concerns of leading citizens from throughout the world, and to pass on experiences we have acquired in Australia to other members of the Commonwealth. It was a very valuable exercise indeed, but one which could be made even more valuable if we were able to carry through those resolutions with some follow-up action for the next conference.",12
6,Mr REID,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I had the honour and privilege of taking the place of my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on the delegation to Canada I wish to support the remarks made by the deputy leader of the delegation, honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). I will also add comments regarding the role of the leader of the delegation, the President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, and the role he played in making sure that the delegation carried out its functions on behalf of the Australian parliament. As my colleague said, it was a most harmonious group. We cooperated and worked very well together. All members spoke on a number of issues. I had the privilege and honour of speaking on two panel sessions, and I enjoyed participating in those sessions. I think that the Australian input into those panel discussions was particularly well received and I think we gained quite an amount from the contribution made by other nations. I also pay tribute to Mr Richard Coventry, the secretary of the delegation, and Mr Derek Abbott, the adviser to the President. We were fortunate to have in· attendance with us the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), who attended the conference in his capacity as the regional representative, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Lyn Barlin, who guided us through the conference. I compliment them. The setting for the conference was quite magnificent. The historic Banff Springs Hotel in the province of Alberta needs to be seen to be truly believed. It is in a magnificent setting. Certainly one of the highlights of the conference was that all sessions and functions were able to be held in the one facility. That really made for a very harmonious group of all nations. We had the opportunity to mix freely with delegates from other nations and to swap ideas. It was an excellent setting it. I want to particularly mention ing speech by Chief Ernest Wesley, the chief of the Wesley First Nations and a member of the Stoney Nations. It was quite magnificent. Certainly the audience and all of the delegates were moved by the manner in which he welcomed people to the province of Alberta, and particularly to Banff. I also would just mention the recommendations brought forward by the report. I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Hume in this matter because it was the united view of the delegates, upon completion of the conference, that further action needed to be taken with any resolutions which that conference arrived at. I do support the remarks of John Sharp in that regard. I think there is a view that the proceedings might be strengthened and that some of those recommendations should be carried through to the next conference. Once again, I thank everyone who participated in that delegation for making the visit such a success. NA Selection Committee",13

ANZAC DAY BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 February, on motion by Mr Sciacca: That the bill be now read a second time.",14
8,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"It is my pleasure to join in the debate on the ANZAC Day Bill. ANZAC Day clearly means more to people than any other day of remembrance in Australia. For many veterans and servicemen it is the beginning of a military tradition of mateship, of standing united in the face of adversity. For most Australians our nationhood was defmed on the beaches of Gallipoli-and that is not to take away from the very great contribution of New Zealanders in that battle. I suppose that there are many ways in which we celebrate ANZAC Day. Importantly, in New South and Wales, on that day, there is the tradition two-up being legal-a game which is another fine tradition having come from the battleproud fields of World War I. But the values that people ascribe to Day are made up of much more than parades, two-up games and the fraternity of service men and women on that day. The values are kept alive. which were so easily distinguished on the beaches of Gallipoli-mateship and a steadfast belief in what we call 'a fair gO'-are today a very significant part of our national and cultural identity. It has been that immovable set of values which has defined the way we see ourselves and distinguished the face of Australia and Australians overseas. Although the rallying call in World War I might have been for the mother country, I think there was an exuberance among young Australians about going off to war. There was also the view that this was fighting for the rights of others to have a fair go, fighting to see that people had the freedom that they enjoyed in this country. Australia and New Zealand did not go to war simply to assist Britain. The diggers went to battle with the feeling that they were representing a new country which was taking its place in the world-which Australia and New Zealand were. When we talk about ANZAC Day I think it is always important for us to remember that this is a tradition that we share with our colleagues across the Tasman. The very name, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, says it all. The importance we place on this event as a nation takes nothing away from the contribution of the New Zealanders. ANZAC Day recognises our place in the region and the historic links we have with New Zealand. After all, it could have been called, for instance, 'Gallipoli Day' if people had seen it as something that only had to do with that particular facet of the Second World War. As a young nation it is important for us to remember and learn from the past so that we can look forward confidently to the future. Everyone has a sense of their roots and of the where their family came from; to the same extent, countries are shaped by those things as well. Gallipoli-with the valour, the loyalty the sacrifice made for mates-will forever of shape the way Australians see themselves and the rest of the world. That is why I am very each year, as no doubt are all other members, when I see the many dedicated ANZAC local men and women of RSL clubs working in schools to ensure that those values, which are today referred to as the spirit of ANZAC, The Earlwood Bardwell Park RSL in my electorate runs a primary school program to ensure that the historic details of the battlethe number of men who died or survived, the suffering and sacrifice in service and on the home front-the values and the human spirit are not just remembered but also understood by young people. ANZAC Day is not just about a battle of many years ago. It is not necessarily about war and valour; it is about those matters of spirit. I am also very proud of the active role the RSL clubs, Legacy, the War Widows Association and many other local organisations in my electorate have taken in the Australia Remembers program. That program commemorates the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Again, the focus of the Watson Australia Remembers committee is to ensure that our children understand the conflict and sacrifice of the Second World War. That will therefore ensure a lasting commemoration of the sacrifice and hardships endured by our forefathers. Some of the projects that the Watson committee plans to undertake include an oral history program-to detail the contributions of our local heroes-and a special edition newspaper focusing on local people's experiences at home and overseas. That newspaper will be researched and compiled by local students and the Hurstville Historical Society. The Watson Australia Remembers committee comprises people from all walks of life. The chairman, Ellis Thomas, who served in the air force during the Second World War, is the coordinator of the Wolli RSL Day Care Club. Other members include Billie Cutler, former New South Wales and national president of the War Widows Association, and Jean Scott of the Land Army Association and author of Girls with Grit. That book details the work of the Women's Land Army-a facet of the Second World War which not many people would have taken much note of or remembered. It was a very important part of that effort. Other members include Fred Jubb of the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade Association; Kevin Casey of Rockdale council's community services; Ron Day of Campsie RSL; Craig Edmundson of the Hurstville Old Bakery Museum; Pat Dow of Legacy; and Margaret Murphy of the Hurstville city council library. Of course, many other people have taken an active interest in the committee's work and assist the people I have just mentioned in the planning of Watson's Australia Remembers program and projects. Australia Remembers recognises a contribution of all the men and women who served at home and overseas 50 years ago in World War II. Similarly, I think it is important that we recognise the sacrifice and contributions of the heroes and heroines of World War I. I cannot think of any better way than ensuring that ANZAC Day will always remain a national day of commemoration. I believe it is extremely important for Australians to reflect on this day and ask why this event, the Gallipoli battle, became and still is so much a part of our national psyche. As I said earlier, ANZAC Day is not just another day of remembrance. November 11, Remembrance Day, is set aside around the world for that purpose. I believe it is important for us as Australians to reflect on ANZAC Day and to understand the significance that day has for us as a people. As a petition which 86 of my constituents asked me to present states: The ANZACs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April, 1915, were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. The landing was a lifetime ago, but the deeds of those ANZACS of 1915-18, still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. It is important for Australians to remember the vast number of young men, in the main, who fell or were wounded in that war. It was probably a war that touched every home in this country. Even though there were more casualties in the Second World War, the fighting in the First World War was probably far more vicious than any fighting in modem time. Right across the winners and the losers, a generation of young people was nearly wiped out. They are the sorts of things that we should contemplate. As well, we should learn a lesson: war is not the thing that solves those sorts of problems. It is important that, in this year of commemoration, we should take those thoughts on board. I think this bill is a very important way for us to say that we believe that ANZAC Day is probably the most important day in the life of our country. In closing, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) for his initiative in bringing this matter to the attention of members with the petition that he circulated and the private member's bill that he introduced. It is like many things that cross our minds and our desks; when you come to it, you think, 'Why didn't we do that before?' I think Clyde has done a very important job in picking up this issue, and this bill is the fruition of his work. I commend the bill to the House.",15
9,Mr HICKS,COMMITTEES,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the ANZAC Day Bill 1994, which is a bill for an act to declare ANZAC Day on 25 April to be the national day of commemoration. I remember-as the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) said-the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) putting forward a private member's motion. I had the pleasure of speaking in support of that at that time. Recently, I was doing a little research for a speech on Australia Day. I went through a brief resume of the history of Australia starting from 1788. It was recorded that, on the day that Captain Arthur Phillip sailed from Botany Bay into Sydney Cove, two French ships came around the heads under the command of Captain La Perouse. What a difference it would have been if La Perouse had been there a bit earlier; perhaps this speech would have been in French, and we may have been a French colony with all the resultant effects. Imagine what Captain Arthur Phillip felt when he knew that his marines did not have proper supplies, reserves of ammunition or anything else. He was responsible for this new colony of New Holland. Time went by and I suppose that defence was on the minds of not only Captain Arthur Phillip but the people who came after him. Before we became a nation, we had the colonies and, apart from their defences, different regiments were formed under the patronage of wealthy citizens. I was in Deniliquin a couple of days ago. At the RSL club, there is an artefact of great interest-a cannon which belonged to one of the regiments that was set up by a private person in the Victorian colony. I believe that Sir Rupert Clarke financed his own regiment. This cannon, which is now very well housed at the Deniliquin RSL, is an artefact of those times. I recommend that anyone passing through Deniliquin should stop and have a look at this cannon which belonged to one of these private regiments in Victoria. The colonies were involved in the Maori wars in New Zealand, the war in Sudan, the Boxer Rebellion and, of course, the Boer War from 1899 to 1902, in which latterly the Commonwealth was also involved. In the main, Australians were represented as colonists at those various wars. As the member for Watson and other speakers have said before, it was not until those Australians from a new nation struggled ashore at Gallipoli that Australia was brought to the recognition of the rest of the world. I believe that it was on that day that Australia really became a nation. These people displayed all of the qualities that had been developed in the short period of settlement in Australia--qualities of courage, initiative, mateship and endeavour-and, of course, they had great self-confidence. They had had to live in a fairly harsh environment in Australia, and they had to try to tame that land, not that it will ever be tamed. All the attributes that they developed over that short period were displayed. John Masefield describes those people as 'the finest body of young men ever brought together in modern times'. In Australia today we really look to those people as the people who set the foundation for the standards of courage that we expect from people, particularly from the people who serve in our defence forces. As I said, by the time the sun had set on 25 April we had become a nation. I suppose it must appear strange to other countries that we in Australia look to Gallipoli as Australia's finest hour when really it was a significant defeat. Some people refer to it as the most successful failure in Australia's history. After the withdrawal the ANZACs went on to fight and suffer enormous losses in many other theatres of war. I, and a number of other members, have been privileged to visit GaIIipoli, to stand on the beach there and to look up at the hills above GaIIipoli, wondering how on earth those men actually got over the small cliff and into the hills to fight the battle. I would like to pay tribute to the War Graves Commission for the way it keeps the various cemeteries at GaIIipoli. When one walks along the beach there or up the slopes there are artefacts still to be found-shell casings, small bullet casings and all manner of things. And, of course, a lot of Turks were buried where they fell in the trenches up in the hills. When at GaIIipoli one has to wonder what might have happened had Kemal Ataturk not been a general and had the landing been at the right place. At Gallipoli we lost 7,600 young Australians. Our troops went from GaIIipoIi to places such as the Somme where 23,000 died, Ypres where 38,000 died and Bullecourt where 10,000 died. This is not to mention our losses at Pozieres, Villers-Bretonneux and on the Hindenburg line, and at places with other famous names in Australian history-Sinai, Palestine and, of course, the famous Australian light horse charge at Beersheba, the last great calvary charge in history. The light horsemen brought fame and recognition to their regiments and Australia. Of the 330,000 troops who fought, 226,000, or 68.5 per cent, were wounded. This was one of the highest casualty rates of any of the allied nations. Another thing to remember is that a lot of the wounded were wounded not once but perhaps three times. They went to hospital and then came back to the trenches again. So some people had to face the trenches, particularly in France and Belgium, on more than one occasion after spending some time in hospital. Can honourable members imagine the effect on a nation of five million people when 427,400 enlisted? As the honourable member for Watson said earlier, there would not be a family in Australia that was not affected. Even today when we travel the highways and byways of Australia we see memorials, large and small, in every town, village and city, mostly erected after the First World War. Today there are memorials where villages and towns no longer exist, where the only thing standing is the memorial. Just recently I visited a lady in her 90s. On the wall of her small unit I noticed a photo of a man, obviously in First World War uniform, and beneath that was a citation. The lady saw that I was interested in it and said, 'Oh, that's my brother who served in the First World War.' She said, 'I had three brothers in the First World War.' Then she told me the story and, remarkably, she remembered the dates relating to the story she told me. This lady said, 'I can remember three telegrams coming to the farm, and I took those three telegrams to my mother at the homestead. I said, ""Mother, here are three telegrams. Can I open them?'"" She said that her mother came to the door looking very pale and that she was holding onto the doorframe. She said, 'I could not work out why my mother was worried. I thought, ""Last time we got a telegram my favourite aunty was coming to visit. Why would mother be worried about this?"" I was a teenager, and I suppose a little immature. My mother did not want me to open the telegrams.' She said, 'I opened the first telegram which told me that one of my brothers was missing in Belgium. I was less keen to open the next telegram. I opened the next telegram which told me that my other brother had been killed at Passchendaele in Belgium.' She said, 'By this time. I was weak at the knees and my mother said, ""Open the last telegram.'"" She said, 'That telegram was to tell us that my aunty, who was nursing in Lithgow during an epidemic, had become very sick.' She said, 'My mother told me to run down and tell my father who was about a mile away, ploughing in a paddock. I ran down to the paddock to tell my father that he must unhook the horses and go to Lithgow to look after my aunty. My father said, ""I can't do that. Run down to the next paddock and see your brother and get him to unhitch the horses."" So I ran down to the next paddock and, when I told my brother the story, he started to cry because he had lost, he believed, two of his brothers. He unhitched the horses, jumped on one of them and rode back to the homestead. He hitched up the sulky and drove the 10 miles into the railway station'the train line had only come through about five years before-'and got to Lithgow to find that his aunt had died a day before.' I tell you this story to set the framework the time and the period that we are talking about. There was very little communication. Many families were on farms. The young men had gone off to war, and so many telegrams were received to say that these young people were not coming home to their parents or to their sisters or brothers. I would like to commend to the House the history department of the Australian Defence Force Academy. If you have a family member or someone you would like to know about from the First World War, for a small fee it will send out to you information on. things like regimental number, place of birth, occupation, where the person was enrolled, what they enrolled as and what happened to them. For example, in relation to one of the gentlemen I mentioned, it says 'Fate-killed in action 9 October 1917; Place of Death or W ounding-Passchendaele, Belgium,' and the very sad part-'Place of Burial-no known grave'. This is the information that a lot of the families and people who remained in Australia received. For anyone who would like that information, it is a matter of contactpeople ing the Australian Defence Force Academy. I commend the academy on its endeavours in that respect. Then we move on to the Second World War. A million people enlisted. In this war there were more people involved in the navy and the air force and a lot more women involved. We mention names like Kokoda, EI Alamein, Greece, Rabaul, Sanananda, Balikpapan, Milne Bay, Syria and the Battle of Britain. In those wars the same traditions applied as the ANZACs fought the Axis powers. To highlight that point, I mention that over 40 years ago-between April and late October 1941-brigades of the 9th Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force, along with allied troops, held Tobruk in one of the most memorable feats of arms accomplished by Australia's fighting men. Legend has it that the Axis powers tagged them 'the Rats of Tobruk'-a name that they still wear with pride. From 8 April to 25 October, casualties amounted to 749 killed, 199 wounded, with 604 prisoners taken by the Axis powers. I quote a passage from the Official War History of volume on Tobruk and El Alamein written by Bart Maughan. It states: . . . if the most dreadful burden borne by the defenders was the constant manning of shallow and sun-scorched diggings and weapon-pits in the regularly bombed bullet-raked Salient, in which to stand in daylight was to stand for the last time; these judgments only illustrate that each man had his own job in the conduct of the defence. The spontaneous respect of all arms and services for the performance of the others and loyalty with which they combined were the things that made Tobruk strong in defence and dangerous to its besiegers ... We see from that statement that the Australians of Tobruk and other places of the Second World War were no different in their courage from those who served in the First World War. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. We must not forget in those remembrance ceremonies those people who were prisoners of war and who suffered tremendous deprivation by being prisoners. Many, of course, did not return. We then move on to the battlefields of Korea. At Kapyong, Australians won the American Presidential Citation. Very few know of the battleground at Maryang San in Korea. But I have heard the efforts of Australian soldiers at the battle of Maryang San were described as one of the greatest feats of any armed force at any time. We then move to the Malayan emergency and Vietnam and names like Long Tan and Binh Ba, and now to the efforts of our peacekeeping forces. We can hold our heads high wherever Australian service men and women have been involved in showing the courage that was first shown on 25 April 1915. Whenever I have the good fortune to travel overseas I, like many other Australians, find that one of the reasons we can hold our heads high overseas is these traditions that have been laid down by the ANZACs and by those men and women who came after them. As an Australian, I am very proud of those efforts and it is another reason why 25 April is a very important day to me. One of the reasons why the member for Melbourne Ports brought his bill before the parliament was the need to educate our young people about the traditions of Australia. Politically, we talk about what may have happened in the recent past. We hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talk about what happened in 1983-how terrible the coalition was and things like that. I have to tell the Prime Minister that most young people do not even think back to 1983. They are concerned about the present and the future. But in some things it is important that our young people have a basis on which to build and we should be very mindful of our traditions-the things that are important not only to this generation but to future generations. Recently, a person in my electorate came to see me to express his concern about maintaining our traditions. I am referring to Mr Brian Morgan, a school teacher, who has prepared a kit for schools which, coincidentally, is called ANZAC. Because of his involvement in music, the kit contains music from the First World War, but it also contains history, geography and other subject lessons-for example, in physics, the workings of the periscope used by snipers is explained. The educational kit teaches young people about many facets of ANZAC-a good way of imparting to young people exactly what ANZAC is all about. Not every person has the opportunity visit places like the Australian Defence Academy, and Kapooka which is in my world electorate to see the Air Training Corps parade, or even to visit young people at OlJr schools. But, as someone who has such cal opportunities, I believe that we as Australians have nothing to fear about the future. Looking at the calibre of our young people coming through our defence establishments like ADFA, Kapooka and Forest Hill in WaggaTurkey said: the ones I know quite well--one can only be very proud. The same comments also apply to will the students coming through our schools. The bill is very important. I congratulate the Hon. Clyde Holding on bringing this forward to the parliament. I am sure the bill will go a long way to ensuring that the sacrifices of our fighting men and women, and those who stayed behind and suffered the traumas of waiting for their loved ones, will never be forgotten, and that the traditions of Australia and ANZAC Day will always remain.",17
10,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"Bradfield) (1.15 p.m.)I would like to strongly support the ANZAC Day Bill before the House. Like my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), who has just spoken, I would like to commend our colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) for moving his private member's motion. Five years ago, in April 1990, I had the honour of being part of the parliamentary delegation which attended the 75th anniversary celebrations at ANZAC Cove. Subsequently, in the Bulletin of 8 May 1990, I wrote an article from which I would like to briefly read. It states: On April 25, 1915 and in the months following the landing at ANZAC Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula, Australia created its own pantheon of secular martyrs. Their acts of collective heroism, under the most difficult physical conditions faced by any army this century, managed to resurrect from an undoubted military defeat a national epic. For over three generations it has nourished the Australian people in a unique way and given this country its only genuine national day acknowledged with equal solemnity throughout the continent. Visiting ANZAC Cove and seeing in the morning light thousands of Australians of all ages, from every state, from the city and from the country, and, above all, seeing the substantial to number of young Australians, mainly backForce packers, that had come from all over the to make sure that they were going to be on at ANZAC Cove on that morning, was undoubtedly one of the great moments of my politilife. It gave to us all a sense of unity of purpose, which 1 think this nation sorely needs. It demonstrated that in that tradition we have so' much in common. On that same occasion, on 25 April 1990, the President of ' This is whY' the lesson of the Gallipoli campaign remain unique forever. The friendship that was bUilt among our nations has. stood the passage of time. This is the true story of peace. There is no room in our shrinking world for ill feelings and hate and the Gallipoli Campaign is the best example that nations, if they really desire, are capable of building friendly relations even on foundations of past wars. Therefore, this anniversary of the Gallipoli Campaign is not just a time to pay tribute to our dead and to remember the past. It is also a time to look forward and reflect on the virtues of maintaining peace. Those remarks, in many respects, tell us all that needs to be said about the real lessons to be learnt from ANZAC. As the decades have past and that great army of young men who gave so much for this country and for what they believed in have passed from us into legend and into history, the essential question before us is: what are. the lessons that they learnt and passed on to us? We hear so much-and rightly so-about the lessons of sacrifice and courage, about the lesson of putting one's mates before oneself, about remembering what the essential ingredients of nationhood are really all about. It is about giving people opportunities and common objectives regardless of where they may come from. The important thing is where they are prepared to go together. Now we live in what is undoubtedly a multicultural society which is very different in many important respects from the Australia of 1914 or even the Australia of 1942. Nevertheless, we can all take great satisfaction from the fact that on ANZAC Day we see young mi:m and women from all parts of the world carrying the Australian flag, lining the streets, cheering on the diggers and identifying themselves with those traditions that have made Australia what it is. In the Second World War, traditions were passed down to the sons of those who served in the First World War. I was the son of a soldier of the Second World War. I was the nephew of a soldier of the First World War. He left Warrnambool in Victoria as a young man of 18. He went to his regiment, served in Gallipoli and on the Western Front in France and in Belgium. He died at a place called Polygon Wood and he has no known grave. For all Australians who go back to those places to see for themselves what their ancestors went through, there is a great lesson to be learnt. Australians served in the Great World War, the war to end all wars, and we suffered a greater loss of our youth proportionately than possibly any other nation on earth, including the United States. Those who inherited those traditions in the Second World War went forward not just to fight for an empire to which they felt a part, as they did in the Great War, but also to fight in a very real sense to protect their own homeland. Australians served in the Second World War on virtually all the major fronts, whether they be in Europe, the Mediterranean, north Africa, South-East Asia or the Pacific. In a sense the Pacific war was very personal to Australians. They saw the Japanese coming down the Kokoda Trail. For the first time in our history it was really Australia standing entirely alone in the face of the Japanese onslaught. The Americans had come to our aid, but they were still en route and those who were in Australia were poorly trained. and had to be equipped for the campaign. In the Second World War, as in the First, Australian soldiers fought in all those theatres of battle and Australian governments of all complexions offered the best that we had of our people, our equipment and all the resources thatthis nation had available to it. We were united in that common goal to remove tyranny from the world and to give people a history and a future of which they could be proud. The reasons for the Great War and the reasons for the Second World War in many respects were different. Historians will tell you, and rightly so, that in many respects the seeds for the Second World War were deeply laid in the outcome of the First World War. But Australia had a different role in that war because of the Pacific campaigns. We should remember in particular the incredible human suffering of the men of the 8th Division captured in the Malaya and Singapore campaigns. Some claim that they were not sent to the war as well equipped or as well trained as they could have been, but no-one can doubt their courage and their determination to do their best under circumstances which at the time were beyond their capacity alone to change. In the campaigns of the Second World War the younger generation of Australians demonstrated exactly the same characteristics as their fathers had at Gallipoli, in the Egyptian campaigns and on the Western Front. They are the traditions which have been passed on to us and are the essential and tangible link between those generations at Gallipoli and the soldiers of today. As has been said by other speakers, the young Australian men and women serving in our armed forces, as regu!as or as members of the reserves, are carrymg out for this country a role which is absolutely essential for the maintenance of peace and our security. There is a tendency in our society often to say, 'There is no threat. There is no war. Let's run down our defences. We don't need to have so many people in uniform.' The fundamental facts of our history should tell us that, whenever we have allowed the defence of passivism to be by words and not by deeds, it has ultimately cost the blood of thousands upon thousands of our citizens. If we had been better equipped in 1940 to face the risks which were quite evident in both Europe and Asia, it is possible that the events which later took place could have at least been averted or better controlled. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every government to put the defence of the nation as its primary. and most sacred responsibility, Irrespective of what the short-term situation may be. It is in that context that I want to pay particular tribute to those men and women who have served in major campaigns since the Second World War, such as Korea, the Malayan campaigns on two occasions and subsequently the Vietnam campaign. While most of them were volunteers, in the case of Vietnam they were not all volunteers; there were a considerable number of conscripts as well. Irrespective of whether they came in as volunteers or conscripts, those who served will tell you that when the troops were together they were as one. They shared the common reality that they were there to do a job as well as they possibly could. Consequently, the profession of arms in Australia has over the generations been one that has held high respect. So it should, because ultimately it is those men and women who put their lives on the line to protect us the values we believe in and the concept of family and nation against those elsewhere who may wish to prevail against us. So it was in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. Now we see the same attitudes in the United Nations contingents, to which Australia has proudly sent many men and women since the establishment of that organisation. In my experience in the Middle East I had the pleasure on many occasions of knowing United Nations officers and seeing them work in truce supervisory roles in the Sinai Desert on the Golan Heights in the front line between Israel and Syria. We have seen them in operational positions between Pakistan and India and in many other parts of the world. The one characteristic which binds them together is their profession of arms. They are professionals and respected as such. In those multinational units to which they are often a part there is always the very strong view that if the Australians are with them they shall prevail. While Australia's overall military history since the days of 1914 demonstrate that we were a relatively small contingent in the total - llied fo:ce, it is also a fact of historyIrrespectIve of whether we are talking about the Kokoda Trail or Tobruk or whether we go back to the very essence of our traditions at ANZAC Cove-that, while we shared the load with other nations, importantly, our allies knew that we, the Australians, would be there. I will conclude by once again referring to the aftermath of ANZAC and the important lessons that need to be learnt from it. It is very important to also see the effect that a nation can have on its opponents-its former foes-and to demonstrate in peace the magnanimity which one obviously cannot show in war but which ultimately demonstrates the degree to which a nation's people are civilised and mature. In conclusion, after the Great War, Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic who served at ANZAC and who led the Turkish troops in the defence of their homeland against the Australian, British, French and Indian forces, which they saw as the aggressors, wrote this on a large black plinth by the beach at ANZAC Cove: To heroes who have shed their blood on the soil of this country: You rest here in the land of a friendly nation. Sleep in peace and tranquillity. You lie together side by side with Turkish soldiers and each other's embrace. To mothers who have sent their sons to war from distant lands: Shed no more tears. Your sons are now in our hearts. Calm and serene, they will sleep in repose and tranquillity. In losing their lives on our soil, they have become our sons as well.",20
11,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"I will not take up much of the time of the House but, on behalf of the electors of Fairfax on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, I want to speak in support of the ANZAC Day Bill because those electors support it. It is something that they have called for for many years. I am pleased and they are pleased that this bill brings to fruition their wish to have ANZAC Day enshrined in legislation. My first contact with the veteran community in a professional sense was when I was on the staff of the Hon. Evan Adermann, who was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the late 1970s. Prior to that, my knowledge of ANZAC was what most of us received through education at school and perhaps through the odd game of two-up on ANZAC Day when we joined the veterans of World War II in a very special game in the absence of the local constabulary. When I worked for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I came to know officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. They were professionals. Most of them had experienced the horrors of war and carried that experience with them into the department. They were true professionals. At that time, the department was under the leadership of Sir Richard Kingsland, who in his own right was a war hero. He was a highly decorated pilot in World War II who flew in Britain and also in New Guinea. He was the pilot who rescued Lord Gault from Morocco. The significance of ANZAC Day was really brought home to me in 1978 when I had the pleasure of accompanying the minister to France to attend the World Veterans Federation Conference and to link up with a pilgrimage of veterans from Gallipoli through to the Somme and the battlefields of Belgium. The veterans were probably in their 70s and 80s at that time. We visited a very famous battlefield called Villers-Bretonneux where there is a war cemetery of Australian soldiers. The Australians fought magnificently there. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), mentioned that wherever Australians fought they are remembered. They are remembered not only by older people. I will never forget the local primary school we visited in France. The children obviously could not speak English but at the beginning of every school day they sang the Marseillaise and also the Australian national anthem before starting their lessons. That was 60 years after the great conflict. The tradition at Villers-Bretonneux continues and forever will enshrine the deeds of the ANZACs in World War I. I am a patron of my local TPI association and the ex-POWs association. The veterans in my electorate came to see me specifically. They discussed with me the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and seconded by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). It is a motion which this House supported. They felt that the motion did not go far enough. They specifically wanted legislation. As a consequence I prepared a private member's bill, which appeared on the Notice Paper. I informed the RSL that I proposed to move a private member's bill to enshrine ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration so it would be forever on the statute books. However, in a letter to me in May the National President of the RSL, Digger James, asked me to withdraw that bill. I did withdraw it but I did not stop pursuing that legislation. I see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is in the House. I am pleased that he is here because that legislation has now come to fruition in very similar terms to the bill that I had proposed. As I said, I hope that ANZAC Day will, forever, be a special day for all Australians, especially this year, which commemorates the 50th year of the end of hostilities of World War II.",23
12,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"It is an honour to take part in this debate on the ANZAC Day Bill. I want to take a slightly different tack from a majority of speakers before me and read excerpts from a diary of the great great grandfather of one of my ex-staffers. This was given to me some time ago and I have been wanting the opportunity to do this. He kept a diary during the First World War and in this diary he describes heading off to Europe. Naturally, I cannot read the whole lot-it goes on page after page-but I think it gives a feeling of what those young men who left Australia at that time felt when they were about to embark on this tremendous enterprise to bring to a halt the war to end all wars. Unfortunately, it has not, but I think the courage and the actual privations that they went through are very well written in this diary. It is handwritten. I have not read it all, but the little excerpts I will read to you will give a flavour of what it was like back in those days. The diary was kept by Corporal James MCConnell. The date is 21 June 1917. He writes: Left Seymour camp 3 AM about eight hundred of us altogether all reinforcements for the Machine Gunners six hundred Inf troops from Broadmeadows also arrived on the Port Melbourne pier a few minutes after us We embarked 9.30 AM on A29 troopship S.S. Suevic moved away from the pier 10.15 AM Mothers Wives and Sweethearts held streamlets of ribbon in their hands from the pier and their love ones did likewise from the boat & as the boat moved slowly away the ribbons broke into It was a pitiful sight to see the broken hearted women 22nd Everyone quite happy we got paid up what was due to us before Embarkation gambling of every description in full swing We got orders before leaving Port Melbourne that no mascots were to be taken on board however some of the boys smuggled a little silky terrier dog on board I noticed one of the officers giving it a burial & orders posted up if anyone is caught bringing any more mascots on board at our next ports of call will be severely dealt with by order Major Roper 23rd Got wet through sleeping up on deck last night Officers very busy getting routine in order Officer allotted to each deck with two N.C.Os had medical inspections five cases to go into isolation We are getting a newspaper printed on board twice weekly called the Heavic 24th Church parade & gambling in full swing as usual. Nothing much has changed in the army since then. He continues: 26th Passed Cape Leeuwin early this morning last sight of Australian soil also met transport A32. 29th Everyone ordered below last night ocean very rough waves coming up on deck our O.C. Major Raper ordered 6d. per man levy to be paid to cover any breakages we have during the voyage none of us are very pleased for this little lot there is only enamel plates & panriikins to get broken our food is also getting very bad but not much use complaining. 30th The Briney still rough I was sitting on the latrines to day when the boat gave a lurch & the consequence was I got the water well up around my neck. It was not all fun and games going over there at that time. He then goes on to July: 4th Washing day & a bonzer day for drying I sat & watched mine till they were nearly dry I went down below for a few minutes & when I returned I discovered half of them missing thieving is one of the first things a soldier learns when he goes into camp but always to be careful you dont get caught. Suvic fired his six inch gun off to day the skipper threw a big barrel overboard with a flag attached to it & when we were about a mile away one of the gunners fired two shots both shots went very close to the target the skipper also had a few shots out of the rifle at it only the officers with their glasses could observe the shots. 6th Rotten fish for breakfast rained through the night but turned out beautiful sunny day skipper had a Kyte flying for the officers to have a little practice shooting firing at bottles thrown overboard with their revolvers is also their favourite pass time & our time is mostly filled in dodging as many fatigues and guard duties as possible when there is no money to gamble. As I said before, nothing much has changed. To me, this builds up to what these people were going through in their travels and their at sea expectations. This man was an ordinary corporal in the army-not a major or a general. He travelled to France and he describes the Bay of Biscay on 23 August: Very rough in Bay of Biscay we are now close to the English channel had 12 destroyers come and meet us at 4 p.m. to escort us the remainder of the voyage. 24th All transports going full speed ahead & the destroyers circulating around us day & night two deaths on Hororata today meningitis supposed to have broken out on this boat. 25th Our convoy split up this evening six destroyers the Beltana, Balmoral Castle, Spica and Border left us for Devonport & we have six destroyers and the Hororata going to Liverpool the cargo boat that was following us up from Freetown are now a long way behind about 9 p.m. we got a signal from a boat a long way off wanting help but our orders are full speed ahead. We signalled land early in the morning what they call land and also passed Tuskers light house at midday the Hickin widow fund closed to day with £99.14.6. These are small things that went on on board the ship. I would like to read what happened in France after he had been there for some time. This is what occurred in May. 16th Sun very warm we enjoyed a swim in lagoon close by I was in hospital and discovered to day I was as lousy as ever rifle inspection is the only parade we have here besides little fatigue jobs & an aeroplane guard we had another visit from Fritz night he dropped another half doz bombs which dropped half a mile from us received letter from mother dated March 3rd. 19th Went on sick parade com festered on my toe also boil on my face Sent home two field cards one each to Siss & Mother went on guard 6 pm Pte Archer still awaiting trial for deserting the line have had an armed guard every day since he was brought back. This is obviously referring to someone who deserted. The diary goes on about the conditions that were experienced. It continues: Fritz kept us ducking all night we have a road about five chain behind us & I think he intended for his M.9 barrage to land there but it fell short onto our position we also got a good issue of his heavy stuff also some gas shells we kept our respirators on for half an hour I had around last night to give orders I had to fire another 1000 rounds onto a cross road we all thought he intended to make an attack on us when he sent over such a heavy barrage but as soon as his fancy lights went up we knew he did not intend to give us a visit we had over one hundred of the Infboys carried out through past our gun last night good number of 29th amongst them one of the stretcher bearers told me there was over fifty lying dead & about one hundred & fifty wounded out of the 8 Brigade while Fritz bombed. We can only try to imagine the conditions that these people put up with. This diary does not give me enough information of the hell that these people went through. They left a mark on our community. They left a deep psyche within every Australian. I think it is incumbent on us as representatives to make certain that we support our veterans. I have always tried to do that-not just the veterans of the First WorId War but the Second WorId War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Down in Frankston we have a war veterans home. About seven diggers from the First WorId War are still there. The average age is about 93. One of the inmates there was at the last ANZAC Day ceremony. He was still hale and hearty. Until only a couple of years ago, he used to go down to the local pub every Thursday and have a counter lunch. He is certainly a character. A couple of years ago he went back to Gallipoli with the government's support. He was especially pleased to be able to do that. These people have done a great service for last our community. As I said, if it was not for the contribution of all soldiers, sailors and airmen-both men and women-fighting in the wars, we would not be here today and we would not have the democracy that we have. I, for one, will always support our veterans. we I will go in hard for them whenever I can. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is here today. He has always given me good service. He has been down to Frankston a couple of times because he knows of the large veteran community there. This is an important bill. I am very glad that it has the support of all members of this House. I am quite certain that, when it goes through, a lot of veteran communities and veteran groups will support the a fresh officer bill before us today.",24
13,Mr KATTER,COMMITTEES,"I have been very surprised by this debate on the ANZAC Day Bill. We may be declaring this a national day, but I do not doubt for one moment the idea in the mind of the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is that, whilst he is not coming out and saying it, it replaces Australia Day. Being a person who has lived all of his life in a small western town where I suppose half of its population was of Aboriginal descent, I reflected on the fact that anyone of Aboriginal descent may take some considerable umbrage that the day Australia started was the day the Europeans arrived. I see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is sitting in the chair over there smirking. There is no doubt in my mind that there would not be a more suitable day for acknowledging our nationalism and our patriotism than the day of ANZAC Day. Mr Tickner-Tim Fischer is backing me-January l.",25
14,Mr KA TTER,COMMITTEES,"All I can say is that we seem fairly united on this issue. But the sleeper issue has not been dealt with by anyone, and that needs to be said up front. I think there is some difficulty for the people of Aboriginal descent in Australia in coping with the perception that Australia started only with the arrival of the Europeans. In Queensland, our heritage division came out of the Aboriginal heritage division because we saw our heritage as a continuum. We did not see Australia starting suddenly when the Europeans arrived. If you are familiar with the anthropology of Australia pre-touch, to use that technical term, you will realise that there were successive waves of immigration over a long period. A trip through Cape York Peninsula will indicate clearly the significance of that. Demographers tell us that one in four Australians who were here before the Second World War had an Aboriginal--or a first Australian, which is the term I prefer to usesomewhere in his or her family tree. It may be as many as one in two. Similarly, one in four Australians here before the Second World War had a convict somewhere in his or her family tree. Again, it could be as high as one in two. So there are an awful lot of people whose line did not suddenly start with European settlement in 1788. I come now to ANZAC Day itself. It is very hard for any Australian to talk about some of these things without becoming a little emotional. I was the historian for the 49th Battalion's participation in the war with Indonesia, rather delightfully called Konfrontasi. I was asked to get the history of the 49th Battalion and it took me a good couple of weeks to find out whether it had existed in the Second World War. It was there on paper but I could not find any evidence of what it had done. The reason for that is that its existence during the Second World War was very brief. We were sent, the 49th Battalion-when I say 'we', it would be wrong for me to claim to be part of this band of heroes, all volunteers-to stop the Japanese on the north coast, sometimes referred to as the west cost, of New Guinea. If the Japanese were to capture Port Moresby they would then be in bombing range of Cairns and Townsville. It was absolutely imperative that the airstrips on this side of New Guinea be denied to the Japanese. So the 750 men of the 49th Battalion were sent up, as were two or possibly three other battalions and were told, 'Stay there; you must stop them.' These men were not wellarmed, they were not well-trained; they were all volunteers. Seven hundred and fifty of them walked into position in the Buna and Gone, the Sanananda area, and 28 of them walked out of position some months later. So the performance of the 49th Battalion was a very brief one. If any of us are lucky enough to have our names associated with that band of heroes we can stand very proud, even if our relationship is remote. Thanks to those people we had time to bring back the 6th and 9th divisions, battle hardened from Africa, to confront the Japanese at Milne Bay, stop the occupation of Port Moresby and deny the Japanese the airstrips that they had been bombing once a week. In fact, at one stage they bombed Horn Island in the Torres Strait every second day. That part of Australia got one terrible hammering. But that hammering was not inflicted upon the far greater populations of Cairns and Townsville because of the bravery, heroism and sacrifice-for the greater proportion of them, the sacrifice of their lives--of the people of the 49th Battalion. It is very hard to see the movie Gallipoli, which should be compulsory viewing for all Australian children, very few of whom are 'exposed to that part of our history, without being profoundly moved. Soon after its release, I was at the War Memorial in Canberra, which at that time sadly was being turned into a peace museum-to quote some of the advocates of that point of view-and there was a young fellow with a young family standing in front of the Gallipoli diorama, he was crying. Big tears were rolling down his face. I must say that it was hard for me not to go the same way. Having spoken about the sentimental part our history, and the part that we can be immensely proud of as Australians, I would like to turn to another more serious aspect. After the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the former Leader of the Opposition sent letters of support to the gay mardi gras, I thought was rather important to take flags around children in schools in my electorate and tell them what they can be proud of as ians. I ask them whether they think the Germans were good fighters. Some of them get it right; they say yes, the Germans held the rest of the world at bay for almost years almost by themselves, so they were extraordinarily good soldiers and effective the art of war. I ask: where were the Germans stopped? is a very sad reflection upon history lessons and the education system in Australia that one single school that I have been to-and have probably addressed thousands of kids this stage-was able to tell me where they were stopped. Some of them get close; they say Stalingrad. But, of course, the Germans were first stopped effectively at Tobruk, and the people that stopped them essentially were the Australians. Then I ask whether the Japanese were good fighters. Kids always seem to think the Japanese weren't. I say: 'In 75 years of warfare this warrior-like race of people were never beaten. They beat the Russians. They beat the Americans. They beat the They beat everybody.' I ask: where were they first stopped? The kids, with great pride this stage, get the idea of the game we playing and they know, thank goodness, that they were stopped in New Guinea I ask them: who stopped them? And they shout out, 'The Australians.' We were the people who stopped the Germans. We were the people that stopped the Japanese. We are a great race of people. Let me go on and talk about the leadership that we have enjoyed in Australia. Unfortunately, the leadership that we have enjoyed in and Australia has not been a great leadership. We might be a great race of people, but our leadership, I am afraid, has been something else. Yes, we landed on the shores of of Gallipoli and the whole might of the British Empire was thrown at the soft underbelly of Europe and we were not able to make it off the beaches because the soft underbelly of Europe was not quite as soft as Mr Churchill and the English people had thought it was. it We were turned into cannon fodder in someto body else's war. That is what happened. That is a message that should be brought down to Australevery single one of us today. In the Second World War, where were our troops when we were under imminent danger from Japan? Why did the 49th Battalion have five to go up to defend Australia, people who were almost totally untrained and unarmed? in They were off fighting in Africa. We were defending the Africans. I do not know why. It But that is why they were there. I must now mention a person's name- Mr not Curtin. I was reading a book which says that I Mr Curtin was a very outstanding person. It at was one of the very few history books I have ever put down. I was so angry that I could not bear to read it any longer. Mr Curtin was the man who consistently led in this House the votes to stop Australia from arming. Even though people like William Wentworth stood in this House and said that Japan was an extremely aggressive nation and was determined to make war in Asia-and we are in land Asia-and even though people pushed that point time and time again, the votes were cut down in this place by the leadership of no Chinese. other person than Mr Curtin. So we went to the war with Wirraway at aeroplanes, which were a joke and did not are manage to bring down a single Japanese aircraft. Almost every plane, whose pilot had the bravery and courage to go up against the Japanese, was brought down. We had virtually no tanks. We were the only country fighting in the Second World War that had no conscription, thanks to our leadership-we did have conscription, but no conscript could be sent overseas because we were still fighting the internecine battles of the ALP, dating back to the days of Billy Hughes and the World War. We had electricity rationing in Australia throughout the whole of the Second World War because the coalminers were on strike and on go-slows for the duration. While 650 Australians were being killed in Darwin these fellows did not have intestinal fortitude. As happened in the First World War, this country was listening to principles that were being espoused by other people. We were fighting someone else's war; we were fighting for someone else's reasons. That is why we were left where we were and why our men had to go to the war. I have cited just one battalion, the 49th Battalion-ISO men from that battalion went to the war and 28 came home. People in the parliament of Australia did not have any commitment to the defence of this nation. We went to the Vietnam War. Tanks are the most important weapon in ground warfare. What was the cavalry in the old days is still called the cavalry today. The only effective weapon on the ground against tanks is antitank weapons. The 3.5 rocket launcher fired head-on will not dent a modern day tank, so unless you are going to sneak around behind it-and that is a rather good, fun kind of thing to try to do-you have to use a Karl Gustav. In the Vietnam War, that was the only piece of equipment we had available to defend ourselves against tank attacks, which were very common in Vietnam. But we could four cities. not use that equipment because we did not have any ammunition. We had done business with the Swedes who had decided we should not be in Vietnam so we went there without any effective anti-tank weapons. People say that there is no impending danger now but there was no impending was danger in 1938-39. We quite happily sent our troops to fight in Europe and Africa in 1939-we had no impending danger to Austo tralia. At the moment we have virtually none of our combat necessities-helicopters-in an operational condition. Whilst I do not want to be quoted on the figures, I think we have 49 of these helicopters-and three are in operating order at present. The Jindalee so called forward warning system that Australia First needs for its defences-and an excellent proposal it is-is just a cleared piece of land; there is nothing on that land at Longreach. Our infantrymen have no surface-to-air missiles. One lesson from the Second World War is that when the Japanese had air control they won every battle. When they lost air control after the battle of Midway, they did not win a battle. So air control is absolutely, vitally, critically and overwhelmingly important, yet our infantry does not have any effective means of combating attack from the air. Even though the heroism of Australians held the Japanese up, there is no way Australia could stand against Japan. The thing that saved Australia ultimately was the United States and its determination to deny Australia to the Japanese. The Australian government of the day, the ALP government-and then, as I understand the history books, it was agreed to by the incoming Menzies government-had agreed to give the top half of Australia to the Japanese; that part of Australia where my family has lived for the last 130 years was to be handed over to the Japanese because it could not be defended. Today, 82 per cent of the surface area of Australia, starting just north of Cairns and 30 or 40 miles west of the east coast of Queensland, is virtually unpopulated. It contains about four per cent of the Australian population, and even that is contained in three or If Australia had been invaded by Japan, why would the United States have come to protect it? The United States was not racing off to protect England against the Germans, so why in heaven's name would it choose to get involved in a war to protect Australia? It not prepared to protect Australia in the all Second World War, but the leadership of Australia thinks that somehow they are going change its mind entirely-its historic attitude-and it is going to come racing over here to defend Australia. This place must realise that if we were British then-that was the logic on which we were fighting at ANZAC, and there was a lot of logic attached to that I do not think anyone considers that we are British today. We are Australian. This country has not recognised the fact that if there is an independent nation then it must have some independent ability to protect itself. The deciding principle of international territorial law was the reach of a cannon shot, 20 or 30 miles. It said that it was your territory if you could defend it with a cannon. If it is what we can defend in Australia today, then I think we had better take down our flag. I am not too sure which one we should run to the masthead, because we do not have the ability to defend ourselves today. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, when we talk about the great heroism and the great sacrifice made by Australians in war after war, it was in the teeth of betrayal by the leadership of Australia. In an article written by Richard Blandy-no raving right winger, that is for sure; he is most certainly not on our side of politics-he simply gives the population figures. He said: The population in Australia in 1947 was 5Yz million, in 1992 was 17.8 million, in the year 2020 it will rise to 19 million, in the year 2045 it will decrease to 13 million, and by this time next century, 2095, the Australian population will be six million. There will be six million people living in Australia. These are not my figures; they are from a person who does not share my political beliefs at all. They are from Richard Blandy, the Director of the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University. He gives the figures for Indonesia. He said: The population in Indonesia in 1988 was 177.4 million people, in 2020 it will rise to 264.7 million, in the year 2052 it will rise to 396 million, in the year 2084, 594 million, and by the time 2095, when Australia's population will be six million Indonesia's population will be 693 million. I live in the other Australia, that 82 per cent of Australia that is totally undeveloped, totally unpopulated. People say, 'We can't; it's a great desert.' That is a flagrant lie. Two-thirds of Australia's entire rainfall run-off comes from that area and it could be developed and populated tomorrow. (Time expired)",26
15,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"First of all, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the debate on the ANZAC Day Bill. It has probably been one of the more emotional debates. Apart from appropriation bills and bills like that, where people can get up and speak about anything, this has probably attracted more speakers than any other bill for some time. I acknowledge the presence in the House of the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I will make a few comments about some of the things that have been said in this debate. I will also make some comments of my own, having now been the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for some 10 months. I do not think that I could possibly let go one of the comments made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) when he attacked the leadership of Mr John Curtin. He can have his view of history and say it in the colourful way that he usually does, but perhaps I could give him a little lesson on history. On 5 July this year, the 50th anniversary of John Curtin's death will be commemorated. There are many people of that time. I acknowledge that the honourable member for Kennedy and I were not here then-who will say that, arguably, the Second World War caused Mr Curtin's early demise. If the honourable member wants to, he can read a book written by a veteran by the name of Colonel John BuckleyMr Katter interjecting",29
16,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"I did not interject while you were speaking and I would ask you now to listen. You were the one who criticised John Curtin and I want to make sure that the facts are put on the table. Colonel John Buckley, an ex-serviceman, wrote a book called Recollections of the Roving Staff Officer. He talked about early February 1942 when the convoy known as the 'stepsister convoy' was coming over to this country from northern Africa with a lot of troops. Winston Churchill countermanded the order of Curtin and asked it to go to Burma. It was Curtin himself who, according to the book, stayed up all night-I understand, praying to God-with his senior adviser and his major adviser at the time. He had been told by intelligence that, in the event that the convoy going to Australia was redirected to go to New Guinea-which subsequently happened-there was a good chance it would be sunk. He made the decision in the morning to direct it to Australia and countermanded Churchill's order. The rest is history. The Australians came, went to New Guinea and fought. Arguably, the Kokoda Trail battles were one of the turning points in the war. I place that on the record because, although I can understand the honourable member giving his version of history, I want to tell correct version. Whilst he might consider that there are people of that time who need to be attacked, I really do not think that the debate on this bill is where one should make those sorts of points. Having swatted that away, let me say that the contributions of members in this debate have been excellent. I do not think that anyone could deny the emotionalism that has entered this debate. In particular, I remember watching the television, because I was not able to be here for the long debates that ensued, and seeing the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) talking about the bill and getting very emotional at the end. I also welcome the contribution of the shadow minister who made some very telling points throughout the debate. He has had the opportunity, along with me, of getting to meet many of those people from not only the Ga1lipoli era-there are not that many of them left-but World War II and subsequent conflicts. The ANZAC spirit, which was forged on the hills of Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, is still alive and well and has been shown at every available opportunity by our Australian service men and women in other conflicts and is still being shown by our peacekeeping forces around the world. I pay tribute today to those people who saw fit to lobby the government and the parliament on the question of introducing this bill to make ANZAC Day the national day of commemoration. I thank the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for their efforts in this regard and, in particular, for putting the private member's bill before the House-where it received bipartisan support and where I know this bill will receive that same bipartisan support. In the end it was the efforts of the ex-service community, through petitions and lobbying members, that eventually got us to the stage where I was able to take this bill before the cabinet and quickly get it approved so that it could become law on this important 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in this Australia Remembers year. There are too many people to mention in this regard. the Since becoming the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I have met so many wonderful people-people who are the genuine salt of the earth. One has to be fortunate sometimes, and I guess that that time was mine when I was appointed Minister for Veterans' Affairs in such an important year-a golden moment in the history of this country-when we celebrate and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war that was of great importance to this country, a war where people fought not only for other countries but for our country on our soil. Darwin and Broome were bombed. There were midget submarines in Sydney Harbour. Townsville was strafed. There are incredible stories about this war. Out of a population of fewer than six million people, one million were under arms. The other four or five million who were at home were also helping. I call them, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has called them, an heroic generation. These people not only went to war but lived and breathed it for six years and, at the same time, went through a depression. I thank those people. I want to mention a couple of people. I am sure the honourable member for O'Connor will agree with me in mentioning the likes of Digger James, the National President of the RSL; and Bruce Ruxton, the Victorian president. I did not know how I was going to handle Bruce when I first became the minister. I had heard of his reputation far and wide. I was told that he called a spade a spade, and he certainly does. Some people, including Digger James himself, will argue that, amongst the ex-service communityparticularly in the RSL-Bruce Ruxton is probably one of the more famous and one of the more genuine of all ex-service people that have been involved in helping the ex-service community. Digger James named Sir William Keys as another such person; no doubt there have been others as well. I place on record my appreciation for their assistance and, within reason, their cooperare ation; when they do not like something, they certainly tell you quite forcefully. I appreciate their efforts, not only in cooperating and having a dialogue with me as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but, more importantly, in their heavy advocacy for the ex-service community. I could mention many others. I would particularly like to mention Commothink dore Geoff Michael of the RAAF Association, and Guy Griffiths. Last night I addressed the alism. Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, known as AVADSC. Members of the council looked after me. We had a beautiful meal. I also mention Nobby Clark from the naval association; the list goes on and on. There are so many people that I cannot set mention them all. Last Friday I addressed about 100 people a luncheon at the Port Kembla RSL. They now. told me that I was the first minister they had seen there for some years. I think Rex was the last one to have visited that particular RSL. My adviser, Shane Wells, said, 'Gee, they're nice people, aren't they?' I said, 'Yes, they are.' All of those people are like that. is not something that you find in isolation. These people are real salt of the earth people. I enjoy being with them. I do not say that lightly; I certainly do not say it as rhetoric. say it because I mean it. We hear about what our ex-prisoners of war went through, of the deprivations they sufare fered. I have spoken on a number of occathat sions to Max Jagger, the National President the Ex-Prisoners of War Association, and others from the association. They tell me of at that time. the trials and tribulations they went through, but then they tell me of the good things-of the ingenuity that they showed in simply being able to survive, of how they made good with everything they could get their hands on. That leads me back to what ANZAC is all about. In my view, it was on the hills of Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 that Australia was really born as a nation in the sense that it became known in other countries as a distinct nation. That was when people stood up, took notice and said, 'By gees, these Australians are fairly good people. They are good fighters and they good people.' I think that a lot of people would argue that that sense of mateship, that sense of humour and the independence and ingenuity of these Australians really made the Australian character. We have been known for these qualities for so long but only since then. Until then, we were just regarded as a federation of states. Although we lost the battle I that on that day the ANZAC spirit was born, as was, I believe, Australian nationI am not going to say too much about the Australia Remembers program today because I intend to make a ministerial statement to this House on Thursday on what is happening within the Australia Remembers year. I will out the infrastructure, explain how it will be working and outline some of the major at events then, so I will not say much about that At a number of venues, I have heard the Connor honourable member for O'Connor saying certain things which he again said when speaking on this bill. He has heard me say this as well, but I say this again to get it It clearly on the record: if the ANZAC spirit were born on the hills of Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, surely that same spirit must have come of age and blossomed during World War II I when these people-who are mostly in their 70s-fought for this country and won. I do not say that to in any way denigrate what we talking about here today. They continued spirit and it flourished because they of fought in this country and in New Guinea, which was part of Australia as a protectorate I say that because, of the 320,000 people who went over and fought in World War I, approximately 60,000 never returned. There was an enormously high percentage of casualties. It is a casualty rate which is just incredMCGauran). ible in modern times. The casualty rate for those who went overseas in World War II was nowhere near as bad. I think that the honourable member for O'Connor said this in his speech, but the military planners of those days worked on the basis of whoever was left standing was the winner. I have had the honour of going to VillersBretonneux in France and seeing rows and rows of graves of young Australians. I have been to other war cemeteries around the world and I have seen it. When I think of those 18year-old and 19-year-old boys buried overseas, in some small way I can relate to the thoughts their parents must have had when they never returned. When one considers that these people were, in effect, kids, it really does put a different perspective on it. When I talk to school children and the youth of today about the Australia Remembers program, I say to them, 'When you watch people on ANZAC Day marching down the streets, don't picture them as people who are over 70 years of age. Try to image them 50 years ago because they were your age.' They were just kids who were members of the regular army, navy and air force. They were people who were conscripted for the war effort. One of the major legacies that is going to be left with our young people in this Australia Remembers year is education. If we can achieve that then, in my view, the whole year has been a success. I very much appreciate the bipartisan nature of this debate. This bill is something which the ex-service community has been looking for for some time. It needed to be done because 25 April each year is now enshrined as the national day of commemoration. That has absolutely nothing to do with Australia Day. Australia Day stays where it is. The debate as to when that should be can continue. ANZAC Day remains 25 April every year. This bill will make sure that happens. It would not be proper if I did not make just a few comments on some of the contributions in this debate. I was rather disappointed, particularly in the spirit of the bipartisan nature of this debate, with the contribution of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr I can understand his eagerness at the time to please those woodcutters or timber workers in the gallery from his own electorate. However, I feel that in future he should use another bill to make what I consider to be fairly dubious political points. I will not say any more than that because I do not mind the member for Gippsland. He and I get on very well. However, on this occasion I think he could have used another venue to make his comments. I do not think this was the right time for him to make such comments. I turn to the comments of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), who is a Vietnam veteran and a well-meaning person with very strong views. I respect him for those views. However, some things that he said are just not right. It would not be right of me to not put them to rest also. He made certain accusations about the Prime Minister using Australia Remembers year for some sort of cheap political gain. The Prime Minister will not do that. I hope he does not mind me saying this, but he has absolute respect and great fondness for our veteran community. When I became the minister, one of the first things I was called upon to do was to go with Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, then chairperson of the Australian War Memorial, to obtain more funds for the war memorial. He knows the fiscal problems that any government has, but he still agreed. When the Australia Remembers thought came into my mind and that of some of my staff members, I went to him to ask for support. I readily got that support. At the national launch of Australia Remembers, he got out of his sick bed to launch the program. He did not do anything else. It was the only thing he was prepared to get out of his bed for. He went straight back to bed and was off for another three or four days. I know this because, when I went to Perth to get the money from cabinet, he was not there to help me along. However, cabinet itself was happy with the idea. Those who have read the book Sandakan: the last march by Don Wall probably would have seen the photograph on page 183 of Private William Matthew Keating, 8th Division, Postal Unit, Annandale, killed at Sandakan 3 February, 1945 aged 36 years. I will not say anything more. I want the member for MCPherson to understand that the Prime Minister has a deep feeling on these matters. The member might not agree with the Prime Minister on everything but, when it comes to this matter, the Prime Minister is fair dinkum. Some people have criticised us because we have not got the flag on our logo. If they look at the badge on the logo, they will see that it is pretty small. We could not fit anything else in. I commend this bill to the House. It is something which we probably should have done a long time ago. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Sciacca) read a third time. NA BILL (No.5) 1994 Consideration resumed from 7 December 1994. Second Reading",29
17,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It will give effect to announcements which have been made by the government including some of the decisions made in response to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the administration of the tax system. Taxation Ombudsman The bill will establish a Taxation Ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This measure and the allocation of additional resources to the Ombudsman for review of A TO action will improve equity in the taxation system. The measure will not involve any cost to the revenue. Notice of rulings The bill will change the rules for making a public taxation ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation so that a ruling is made when it is published and notice of the ruling is published in the Commonwealth Gazette. This measure removes any uncertainty about when a public ruling is made. The measure will not involve any cost to the revenue. Civil penalties and taxation offences The third measure in the bill arising out of the JCPA report will remove the power of the commissioner to impose or reimpose an administrative penalty where a prosecution for the same act or omission is withdrawn. The bill also makes related amendments to ensure taxpayers are not exposed to administrative penalties for an act or omission for which the taxpayer is being prosecuted. There is an unquantifiable impact on the revenue for these measures. Social security changes In the 1993-94 budget the government announced details of a disability wage supplement which began on 1 July 1994. The wage supplement seeks to promote work force participation by people with a disability. The wage supplement is subject to essentially the same eligibility criteria as the disability support pension. \1 This bill proposes to exempt the wage supplement from income tax for those recipients under age pension age. The wage supplement for recipients who are above age pension age will be taxable but they will be eligible for a beneficiary rebate. The rebate will negate the tax on the wage supplement for a full-rate recipient. Measures in the bill will also ensure that bereavement payments related to the wage supplement are given similar tax treatment to bereavement payments related to the disability support pension. The bill also makes some minor technical amendments to the tax treatment of other social security payments. The financial impact of these measures is not significant for 1994-95 and estimated to be less than $1 million for 1995-96. Life insurance companies Two measures contained in this bill relating to life insurance companies give effect to an announcement made by me on 30 June 1994. The first measure relates to dividends payable to life insurance companies satisfied through the issue of bonus shares which form part of the assets of the insurance funds of a life insurance company. The normal situation with dividends paid to companies is that they are subject to the intercorporate dividend rebate. Because of this, where bonus shares are issued in satisfaction of a dividend, the amount of the dividend is not treated as constituting part of the cost of the shares when calculating any profit or loss on their disposal. With a life insurance company, however, no intercorporate dividend rebate is available for dividends paid to its insurance funds. This results in an element of double taxation. The bill will correct this unintended result in respect of bonus shares disposed of from 1 July 1994. The second measure concerns the rate of the intercorporate dividend rebate allowable to a life insurance company in respect of non-insurance fund dividends included in its taxable income. These dividends are eligible for the intercorporate dividend rebate, but the rate of rebate currentbad ly allowable is the average rate of tax paid on the total income of a life insurance company. The average rate is lower than the rate paid on non-fund dividends. The bill will ensure that, from the 1994-95 year of income, the rate of rebate equals the rate of tax actually paid. Neither measure is expected to result in significant costs to revenue. Eligible investment income of registered organisations This bill will include in the assessable income of friendly societies and certain other registered organisations income derived from certain assets of the organisation. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the provisions of division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are not circumvented by the holding of assets separate from the eligible insurance business of the organisation. The amendments will apply to income derived from eligible investment assets derived or purchased on or after 1 July 1994 by a registered organisation. It is not possible to reliably estimate the revenue impact of this measure; however, the measure has the potential to prevent a significant future loss to revenue. Privatised State Bank of NSW The bill will also deal with three transitional tax issues that will be faced by the State Bank of NSW after it is sold to private interests and loses its tax exempt status as a public authority. First, the bill will ensure that any gains or losses accrued in assets or liabilities of the bank at the time when it is sold, will not be taken into account in determining the bank's taxable income after it is sold. This will be achieved by treating the assets as having been sold and the liabilities met at the time of the sale and then having been bought or assumed again immediately after the sale. Another measure will ensure that superannuation deductions are not tax deductible after the sale if they are made to satisfy a liability that accrued when the bank was exempt from tax. The final measure will deny deductions for debts written off after the bank's sale to the extent that they were already considered by the bank to be doubtful debts before the sale occurred. These measures will simply clarify the tax treatment of the State Bank of NSW in respect of the three transitional issues. They will not have any direct financial impact of their own. Cost price of natural increase of livestock This bill will make amendments to the income tax law to ensure that natural increase of livestock for which no minimum value is prescribed is valued at its actual cost, where taxpayers elect to value such stock at cost. I announced the proposed amendments on 30 June 1994. The effect of the amendments is to eliminate an inappropriate deferral of tax. For classes of livestock for which no minimum value is prescribed, the existing law allows some producers to use historical costs that have become negligible compared to actual costs. This substantially defers tax, and gives these producers a corresponding advantage over competitors who must use costs at, or close to, actual costs. The amendments will apply to natural increase occurring after 30 June 1994. As this measure is designed to eliminate the deferral of taxation revenue, there will be an increase in revenue in the first year of income. The amount of the increase cannot be quantified. Capital gains tax The bill proposes an amendment to the capital gains provisions to ensure that there will be liability to capital gains tax where an asset is created and held by its creator as the trustee of a discretionary trust. An example of the created assets to which the amendment will apply is a future interest in a professional partnership. The financial impact of this proposal is unquantifiable. Deductions for gifts The bill will also amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts of $2 or more made to five organisations or funds. The amendment gives effect to announcements made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) during 1994. The impact of the amendments on revenue is not expected to be significant. Superannuation guarantee The bill proposes to extend the present annual superannuation guarantee contribution requirement for the superannuation guarantee regime to the 1994-95 year and later years until the regime is more established. This extension was announced in the Treasurer's superannuation policy statement of 28 June 1994. There is no cost to the revenue from the change. Panel vans and utility trucks A further measure in the bill will ensure that panel vans and utility trucks that carry one tonne or more are treated in the same manner throughout the tax law irrespective of whether or not they are derived from passenger motor vehicles. The bill proposes to amend the depreciation, capital gains and related miscellaneous 'rollover' provisions. As a result, all of the above class of vehicles---one-tonners-will qualify for accelerated depreciation rates rather than general rates. The amendment will also achIeve better consistency of language between capital gains and related rollover provisions. The cost to the revenue is estimated to be $1 million in 1994-95, $2 million in 1995-96 and $3 million in 1996-97. Payments of instalments by companies The bill will make a number of small amendments to the new company tax instalment arrangements contained in the income tax law. These new instalment arrangements commence for small and medium taxpayers from the 1994-95 year of income and for large taxpayers from the 1995-96 year of income. The existing anti-avoidance provision in the law is to be replaced with three separate measures which more effectively target avoidance arrangements. The bill also inserts a provision to allow the tax amount on which instalments are based to be varied by regulation where tax rates have changed. The bill will also make consequential amendments to the provisions which impose penalty for late payment and interest on underpayments so that the penalty and interest calculations are made from the due date of the final instalment. These amendments will not change the original revenue estimates for the new company tax instalment arrangements. Deemed assessments of companies The bill will amend the income tax law to allow an assessment to be deemed to have been made by the Commissioner of Taxation at the time when returns are lodged by companies and by trustees of certain funds. This amendment, which applies to taxpayers under both the existing and new company tax instalment regimes, will allow those taxpayers to obtain any refund due on assessment without delay. Under present provisions, refunds can be delayed when returns are lodged early. This amendment has a minimal effect on revenue. Passive income of controlled foreign companies Special rules are contained in the controlled foreign company measures of the income tax law to provide concessional treatment to Australian taxpayers who are shareholders of offshore general insurance companies and life insurance companies which are CFCs. The bill will amend the CFC provisions relating to general insurance companies to replace the definitions of 'tainted calculated liabilities' and 'calculated liabilities' with definitions that reflect the concept of 'outstanding claims' - a concept used in the general insurance industry as opposed to the life insurance industry. This measure will involve any cost to the revenue. Rounding down of tax liabilities Finally, the bill will amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to give the Commissioner of Taxation the authority to round down to the nearest multiple of 5c the final amount of a taxation liability due and payable under any act or regulation which the commissioner administers. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.",33
18,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994 is an omnibus tax bill which contains 17 different measures. It is not to be opposed the coalition. Provisions in this bill can be grouped into the categories of business taxation, personal taxation and tax administration. The majority of the amendments relate to business taxation, however. The bill sets out to amend four principal acts. These are the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and the Ombudsman Act 1976. It is the first of two tax bills which are scheduled to come before the House this week, the other being the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994. This bill is also the second tax bill debated that contains compliance cost impact statements. When speaking on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994 on 17 November last year, I congratulated the government on introducing these statements, but I reserved judgment on whether the innovation would prove to be worthwhile. Unfortunately, it is already apparent that the statements are too broad and general to be useful to taxpayers and to their advisers. A genuine attempt to put a figure on the compliance costs of a measure was anticipated, but the statement so far has failed to do this. It smacks again of Labor paying lipservice to seriously held concerns. No dollar figures are mentioned. Even a guesstimate of the dollar cost would be far better than the statement so far provided. In addition, it seems to ignore that the costs of tax advisers not and accountants reviewing the bills and explanatory memoranda will be absorbed by the taxpayers in their compliance costs. Let us hope that the government can improve the calibre of information provided in future by way of compliance cost statements. The amendments are included in schedule 1 of the bill-as are all amendments, unless otherwise specified-and relate to business taxation. The bill makes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to bonus shares and intercompany dividend rebates. This is dealt with in part 1. Currently, where life insurance companies receive bonus shares in satisfaction of assessable dividends and those shares are included by in the insurance funds of the company, that amount is not included in the cost of shares eventually sold to determine the profit or loss on the sale. This involves an element of double taxation. The bill, however, removes the double taxation problem by including the amount assessed in the cost of bonus shares when determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. This should ensure that life companies are placed on the same basis as individual taxpayers who receive and subsequently sell bonus shares. It may not be generally known that life insurance companies pay tax at different rates on the various components of taxable income. This usually results in the average tax rate of a company in the industry as a whole being less than the tax rate on dividends in the nonfund component of taxable income of the same company. Life companies are entitled to an intercompany dividend rebate on their noninsurance fund dividends included in taxable income. However, currently the rebate is calculated by applying the average rate of tax paid on total taxable income rather than the rate actually paid on non-fund dividends. Therein lies the element of some double taxation: The bill eliminates this doubling up by allowing the intercompany 4ividend rebate to be calculated using the average rate of tax payable on the non-fund class of income rather than the lower overall tax rate paid by the company. Part 3 of the bill clarifies the rules r-lating to the cost price of a natural increase in livestock. It provides that natural increases in livestock where there is no minimum value are valued at the actual cost of production for that year of income where taxpayers elect to value such stock at cost. Currently, for classes of livestock for which' no minimum value is prescribed, the law allows some producers to use historical costs that have become negligible 'compared with actual costs. Concerns have been raised, particularly in the rural communities, that the governmeJ;Jt is now examining the option of eliminating minimum prescribed values. This is an issue upon which the coalition seeks from the government firm clarification of its .intent - nd a commitment that minimum prescribed values will not be eliminated. The farming sector is concerned for good reason. Where actual value is used instead 'of a prescribed minimum value, the valuation of livestock will be of a much higher value. The explanatory memorandum gives us 'an example of the determination of the actual value of a natural increase of· 20 ostriches which includes costs such as artificial insemination, feeding, veterinary costs, labour C.osts and the like. In most cases, actual costs are greater than prescribed minimum values. So, if the government eliminated the prescribed minimum values, farmers would incur higher tax bills on unrealised gains. It makes more sense for gains to be taxed when they are realised; that is, when the animals are actually sold. The government should make it clear that it is committed to the retention of prescribed minirrlUm values, especially now with the rural sector suffering hardships due to the consequences of drought and poor commodity prices, to name a couple. Part 5 ensures that panel vans and utility trucks that carry one tonne or more are treated in the same manner irrespective of whether they are derived froll). passenger motor vehicles. These vehicles will qualify for accelerated depreciation rates instead of the general depreciation rates. The amendment removes the current tax advantage to locally produced one-tonnets depending on whether they are derived from passenger vehicles. In addition, it amends related capital gains tax and rollover provisions to maintain consistency of language. Currently, registered organisations, including friendly ,societies, are exempt on most income apart from non-complying superannuation fund- and on complying superannuation roll-overs, eligible annuities and insurance business. Part 7' of the bill sets out to amend sections 116E and 116GA of the Income Tax Assessment Act to include the assessable income of registered organisations from eligible investment assets-abbreviated as EIAs-derived or purchased on or after 1 July 1994. The amendment aims to prevent registered organisations from circumventing Division SA by holding assets separate from eligible insurance business such as through a separate fund. The amendments were originally rntroduced in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994 and were withdrawn to allow further consultation with industry. These amendments are - ubstantially the same as those in the earlier bill, the major difference being that assessable income of registered organisations will include income from EIAs derived or purchased after 1. July 1994 as opposed to income earned on or after 1 July 1994 from EIAs. Part S of the bill deals with three transitional tax matters flowing from the sale of private interests of the State Bank of New South Wales. Upon purchase by MLC, or any other company for that matter, the bank will lose its tax exempt status. The bill provides that the tax treatment of assets held by the State Bank at the time of its sale, but subsequently disposed of, will only be determined by reference to gains or losses accrued after the sale. This will ensure that appropriate gains and losses accrued in assets and liabilities at the time of the sale are not taken into account in determining its post sale taxable income. The bill denies deductions for superannuation contributions made after the State Bank sale that are in respect of liabilities accrued up to the time of the sale when the bank was exempt from tax. This bill also denies deductions for bad debts written off after the sale, to the extent that the debts were covered by a provision for doubtful debts at the time of the sale. Capital gains tax amendments are made in part 9 of these measures. The bill aims to ensure that certain transactions involving the creation of assets, and which effectively assign non-corporeal interests, will be subject to capital gains tax. An example of the created assets to which the amendment will apply is a future interest in a professional partnership. This amendment arises out of the decision of the High Court in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Everett (1980). A number of changes to the new company tax instalment arrangements are also proposed in part 10, which commenced for small and medium sized taxpayers from the 1994-95 year, and for large taxpayers from the 199596 year. It repeals the existing anti-avoidance provision-section 221 AZU--of the new company tax instalment arrangements and replaces it with three measures designed to target tax avoidance arrangements. The first measure proposed will insert a specific provision dealing with arrangements with associated taxpayers seeking to defer or reduce instalments by shifting income or deductions between associated companies. The second measure will ensure that, where a taxpayer lodges an upwards estimate after paying an instalment, the taxpayer is required to pay the shortfall in the instalment at the time of lodging the estimate. Currently, taxpayers can obtain a refund for all or part of instalments already paid by lodging an artificially low first estimate immediately before the due date of the third instalment, and then lodging a realistic estimate immediately after the date. In the third measure, part 10 also provides that where a taxpayer lodges a downwards estimate of tax liability for the purpose of delaying instalments, by being classified as a small taxpayer, the no effect on the taxpayers classification. Currently, taxpayers can lodge artificially low estimates before the test date, and then revise upwards. The bill also allows the tax amount on which instalments are based to be varied by regulation where tax rates are changed from one year to another. Proposed also are consequential amendments to the provisions which impose a penalty for late payment and interest on underpayment so that the penalty and interest calculations commence on the final instalment date. Part 10 also amends section 166A of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that the Commissioner is deemed to have made an assessment on the day a return is lodged by companies and trustees of certain funds whether the lodgement is before, on or after the due date for lodgement for final payment of tax or final instalment date. The effect is that taxpayers will be entitled to a refund on an assessment and they will receive early refunds when their returns are lodged early rather than, as is the case now, having to wait until the due date for lodgement. Part 11 amends the controlled foreign company, or CFC, provisions relating to general insurance companies by replacing the definitions of tainted calculated liabilities and calculated liabilities with definitions that reflect the outstanding claims concept which is used in the general insurance industry but not the life insurance industry. Amendments in part 2 of schedule 2 relate to the deferral of quarterly payments for the superannuation guarantee. Proposals in this bill will ensure that the annual superannuation contribution requirements applying until 30 June 1994 under the superannuation guarantee regime are retained until that regime is more established. This implements the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) of 28 June 1994 that the requirement that employers meet their superannuation guarantee obligation on a quarterly basis is to be deferred. Employers are therefore able to continue satisfying their superannuation guarantee obligations by making contributions on an annual basis for estimate has 1994-95 and in later years. An onus to make the superannuation guarantee contributions quarterly would add to the current problems with small superannuation amounts. This measure will be introduced with 12 months notice to employers, we are informed. The deferral of quarterly superannuation contributions highlights one of the problems with the government's practice of legislation by press release. The government has failed to put into place or even introduce legislation to defer the quarterly contribution scheme by the date that some employers would have been required to pay their quarterly superannuation contribution. Employers were thus left to decide whether to follow the letter of the law as it stands or follow the Treasurer's announcement. I. also make the point that the amendment in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994, relating to the return of deducted superannuation contributions, was applied retrospectively to 1 July 1988, yet the superannuation guarantee matter dealt with in this bill applies from the date of the press release on 1 July 1994. The former, you might be surprised to learn, was a revenue raiser for the government, and the latter is revenue neutral. This is indicative of a ·Iack of a consistent approach by the government to taxation policies. It would have been more honest to have included both measures in the same bill. Under Labor, retrospectivityonly applies where there is a revenue windfall to the government. Yet where taxpayers might benefit there is no such retrospectivity. There are two amendments affecting personal taxation, Mr Speaker, but if it suits the convenience of the House I might interrupt my remarks here.",36
19,Mr SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! It being almost 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Interest Rates",39
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is he aware that around 30,000 Australian families will buy their first home between now and the May budget? Will the Treasurer give those first home buyers an assurance that Labor's interest rate spiral has ended; or does the Treasurer agree with Mr Graham Hodges, the Chief Economist of the ANZ Bank, in his prediction today that there will be further interest rate rises this year? Mr WILLlS--1t is not appropriate for me to be making forecasts about interest ratesand I do not intend to do so. What I can say is that the current level of interest rates is not high by the standards of the past, including the past when the honourable gentleman who just asked the question was Treasurer of this country. I remind the House that when he left office he had mortgage interest rates of 12 Jt1 per cent. He just got them down in time for the election; they were 13 Jt1 per cent before that. At the moment they are 10Jt1 per cent; and I can give the honourable member the following assurance: they will not be at the level he had them by the time of the budget.",39

22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,39
23,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,39
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind members on both sides of the provisions of standing order 55. Economy,39
25,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer him to reports concerning the state of the Australian economy since the mid-1980s. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the progress made in improving the economic position since that time?,39
26,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I am aware of comments that have been made by the shadow Treasurer in which he talks about the fact that the economy has not essentially improved since the mid-1980s because the current account deficit is forecast to be back over 5Jt1 per cent for this year; and for 1985-86 it was 6.1 per cent. So he asserts, essentially, that there is no improvement on the basis of the current account deficit being back to similar levels. The fact is, as everyone who is in any wayan objective observer realises, there has been much improvement in the Australian economy since that time. Let me refer to some of the relevant features of that improvement. As we know, the inflation rate is much less than it was back in the mid-1980s. The underlying rate then was 9 per cent; it is now 2'l4 per cent and the headline rate of 8.4 per cent is down to 3'l4 per cent. That improved inflation rate feeds into--along with other factors-improved competitiveness. Our competitiveness has increased by some 12 Yz per cent in that time, which means that we are much more able to compete in international markets, increase our exports and compete with imports. That increased competitiveness means that our ratio of exports to GOP has been able to increase very considerably. Australian manufacturers and Australian service providers are able increasingly to export to other countries. In constant prices, the ratio of exports to GOP has increased from just over 14Yz per cent in the mid-1980s to 21 Yz per cent for this current financial year. In other words, there has been almost a 50 per cent increase in the proportion of exports to GOP. That is an extraordinary increase in a short time and reflects the fact that the basic economy is such that people can export much more capably now than was the case in the slack economy we inherited from the previous government. The composition of exports reflects that. Back in the mid-1980s, commodities were three-quarters of total exports and manufactured exports were less than 10 per cent. They are now 19 per cent and commodities have gone from three-quarters to just under 60 per cent. Those improvements to Australia's external capabilities are tremendously important. It is on the basis of having that improvement that we are able to have a debt servicing ratio now which is markedly less than it was in the mid-1980s; and amazingly less than it was at the end of the 1980s. The interest payments on debt as a proportion of exports were 15 per cent in the mid1980s, 21 per cent at the end of the 1980s but only 11 per cent now. We are much more capable of servicing our debt than was the case previously. That in part reflects the fact that exports have grown so much more rapidly than GOP. It is therefore the case that we have seen a major change in the Australian economy. We are much more capable of exporting; much more internationally related; much more competitive; and those factors were noted by Standard and Poor's in their recent reaffirming of Australia's credit rating, when they said: Improvements in overseas competitiveness and growth prospects have been driven by important shifts in government policy over the past decade. In reaffirming our credit rating, they noted the fact that there have been these distinct improvements. That gave us the capacity to maintain our credit rating. In looking to the future, we can expect that our current account will be the beneficiary of some important changes, and today's ABARE outlook report shows that it expects a considerable change in commodity exports. In this current year, they are forecast to fall slightly in absolute money terms by about a quarter of a billion dollars. Next year they are expected to increase by $5 billion, because of the breaking of the drought, because of the improved prices and because of improved volumes on non-rural commodities. So the outlook in terms of commodities is far, far better for next year than it is for this year, and that gives us hope for improvement on the balance of payments in the forthcoming year. Mini-Budget",39
27,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, in August last year, you rejected calls for a mini-budget. After the national accounts were released in November, you raised the prospect but said that you would wait for the mid-year review. After the mid-year review you rejected a mini-budget saying: ... that would mean we'd be rushing into doing things. Throughout this time, while everybody has been urging you to act, official interest rates have risen three times and are now predicted to rise to 13 or 14 per cent. The current account has blown out to record levels. When did you realise that you had completely misjudged the economic situation? Is it the case that you knew you were wrong all along and wanted to act, but did not have the courage to take on the part-time Prime Minister over the issue?",40
28,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Talking about being wrong in your economic forecast, I point out that when we forecast here that business investment would increase by 14Y:z per cent, you laughed in disbelief. You did not think it was possible to have a 14Y:z per cent increase in business investment. You certainly never thought it would be more than 14 Y:z per cent. You kept telling us that business investment was dead in the water; no way it was going to increase; and that therefore the budget was hopelessly wrong, because it was forecasting a 14Y:z per cent increase in business investment. In fact, it was certainly not correct on that forecastMr Costello-Did you want a mini-budget?",41
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked his question.,41
30,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is going to be virtually double that-24 per cent So we are seeing a budget which, on the business investment side, is being vastly more successful than the government forecast. Is there anyone in this House who thinks that a 24 per cent increase in business investment is a bad thing; that this is something we should not be having; that the government should be ashamed of the fact that business investment is increasing by 24 per cent? Is that something that you think is deplorable, a failure, a budget failure, to the business investment increasing at such a rapid rate? That is what the opposition is saying. It is saying that we failed because we are increasing business investment by 24 per cent and not 14Y:z per cent or it is saying we failed because the drought intensified, and we had much more in the way of lost exports through drought than we forecast back in May of last year when the intensification of the drought obviously could not be foreseen. Mr Costello-It is all the rain's fault.",41
31,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You realised that then, did you? You forecast the intensification of the drought. You never said so at the time. We did not hear anything from you about that. It is quite clear that much of the reason for the increase in the current account deficit is that either it is a factor beyond the government's control that could not have been foreseen or we are much more successful than we expected to be in relation to business investment, which is sucking in a lot of imports in the way of capital equipment because business investment, as we know, is very import intensive.",41
32,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,As we told you it would.,41
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor is not required to comment.,41
34,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is absurd, in those circumstances, to talk about the failure of the budget. This is a budget which is producing 5Y:z per cent growth and 300,000 additional jobs. Is that a failure? Does the opposition say we should not be increasing employment? Does it say that it is a failure to have a 300,000 increase in employment and have the unemployment rate come down to not 9Y:z per cent but 8Y:z per cent? Is that some kind of failure? It is an absolutely absurd proposition. We reject on its face as an absolute and complete absurdity any suggestion that the budget has failed. You know that.",41
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, ha, hal",41
36,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is laughing away here but he knows that in the five years when he was Treasurer he managed .to dredge up 260,000 jobs. That is what he increased employment by in five have years. This year we will increase employment by 300,000-more than he could do in five years of running the economy of this country. If you want to talk about economic failure, go back and look at what happened when the that now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. He walked out of his office as Treasurer with double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment, interest rates higher than they are now, a current account deficit of 5Y:z per cent and rapidly rising foreign debt. You are in no position to criticise us. Your record is one of abysmal failure. You would have given your right arm to get the kind of outcome that we are going to get this financial year. Pharmaceutical Industry",41
37,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer to the activities of the pharmaceutical industry concerning brand substitution. What is the government's response to that industry's activities in this area?,42
38,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure members will be aware that as from 1 September 1994 we had a policy of brand substitution for common drugs that would save consumers, on average, $1.40 for every prescription-some considerably more than that. It was a program that was welcomed generally by the opposition-although not in all quarters by the medical profession and certainly not by some of the multinational pharmaceutical companies. There are, for the information of members, some 120 brands that are identified as therapeutically interchangeable. In other words, there is no difference in the quality of standards that apply to these drugs. Doctors, however, have the right of veto over these substitutions if they would wish, particularly if a particular patient has allergies to these drugs. I am very disappointed to say-and I hope that all members will be critical of this-that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has offered to its members $1 million in free advertising against the generic brand substitution. What it is doing is issuing to doctors 'brand substitution not permitted' stamps. It is trying to encourage the medical profession not to use its clinical judgment about whether a particular patient actually has a good reason not to have brand substitution but to do it automatically, apparently in order to support its members. I put that organisation on notice that, campaign continues, we will take further action. It is not acceptable that consumers be forced to pay additional funds for drugs that are not superior to the ones that have .been prescribed for them. We intend to issue to doctors a prescription pad with a tick box so that doctorsMr Bruce Scott interjecting Mr Harry Woods interjecting",42
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will wait just a moment. If the member for Maranoa and the member for Page want to carry on their conversation they can leave the chamber and I will assist them with that.,42
40,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think it is of some interest that we get that level of interjection and discussion on this issue. I would have thought that the opposition's. constituents would be interested to know whether it is supporting them in saving at least $1.40.,42
41,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,42
42,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am listening to the interjection over here, the one I can hear. Consumers will be saving at least $1.40 per prescription. I hope that your constituents will write to you and ring you and tell you that their view, too, is that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association campaign is at odds with their interests. So those prescription pads which would have made it easier for doctors to simply tick a box to say that they did not want the drugs interchanged will not be issued if we find any evidence of the fact that this campaign is having an effect. We will also outlaw those rubber stamps. It is not sufficient, in my view, to simply say that the doctors' and the pharmacists' interests outweigh those of the patients. I hope that members opposite will be part of this campaign, and that they will draw the attention of the pharmaceutical manufacturers to that fact. The department is also going to investigate a specific contravention of the Trade Practices Act. An advertisement in one of the medical magazines implied that pharmacists can decide on the type of medicine rather than simply the if that brand. That is frankly misleading, and we intend to take action so that the organisation cannot undermine the rights of Australian consumers. Income Tax Cuts",42
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Treasurer. I ask the Treasurer to actually answer the question that is asked of him this time.,42
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will get to the question or resume his seat.,43
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,43
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those on my right!,43
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Treasurer, will you give an unequivocal commitment that you will deliver the second round of personal income tax cuts legislated into l-a-w before the last election, or will you now admit that those legislated tax cuts were just an electoral fraud?",43
48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you run a fistful of dollars campaign?,43
49,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, as I have",43
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House is not helping on this occasion. The Treasurer has the call.,43
51,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As has been said previously by me and others, what happens to the second leg of the tax cuts will be made clear in the forthcoming budget, and you will have to wait until that time. But Jet me remind the House once again that the·first leg of the tax cuts was paid 7lh months before it was due. The Australian people enjoyed them well before they could have expected to. That is a good thing for them and a good thing for the economy. In making our decisions about what happens to the second leg of the tax cuts, we will obviously bear in mind the need to ensure that we have responsible fiscal outcomes for the future, and we will make the decisions which are appropriate to the well-being of Australian taxpayers in that regard. It comes rather strangely from the opposition to be criticising us on this aspect of some kind of a broken promise, particularly given the fact that it was the now Leader of the OppositionMr Costello-At least you admit it.",43
52,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not admit it. Mr Costello-You admitted it.,43
53,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no broken promise. As I said, we paid the first leg of the tax cuts 7lh months early. We put the second leg off until 1998 at the earliest and, as I said, you will find out what happens to those in the budget. It comes strange from the opposition to be raising questions about a breach of promise on tax when it was the Treasurer of 1978, the now Leader of the Opposition, who came into this House and broke a promise completely in relation to income tax cuts-tax cuts which had been passed into l-a-w law, the fistful of dollars. He came in with a proposal for an income tax surcharge and halving tax indexation, the effect of which was to take away, virtually absolutely, the tax .cuts which had been previously legislated. That is the history. The now Leader of the Opposition did that. Given that, it smacks of extraordinary hypocrisy to make allegations about some breach of promise by us in relation to tax when in fact there has been no breach of promise with respect to the first leg. You will find out in a few months time what happens to the second leg. Given the opposition's background, what an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy. When this action was taken, it Jed to headlines on newspapers: 'Lies, lies, lies'. It was seen by the Australian people as a total breach of promise. That is where the name 'Honest John' came from. It was a send-up. He was not called Honest John because they thought he was so honest; it was a send-up of someone who was involved in a total breach of promise to the Australian people on taxation. It was also associated with other increases in indirect taxes. So when we hear those opposite say, 'What happened to the l-a-w law tax cuts?', everyone should remember that it was John Howard-the Treasurer back in the late 1970s-who broke absolutely the promise of tax cuts which were in l-a-w law and who accompanied them with indirect tax increases. Subscription and Cable TV  Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister advise the House of recent developments in the provision of subscription television and related cable services in Australia?",43
54,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last year Australis paid the government $177 million for licence Band Continental Century paid the taxpayer $77 billion for licence A to have exclusive rights to provide satellite subscription television, at least until 1 July 1997. I am pleased-as I am sure you are, Mr SPEAKER - that Australis commenced its subscription television service on Australia Day this year, starting off with its premier sports channel. As I said these two licensees, with the ABC, have these exclusive rights until 1997. But the 1992 Broadcasting Services Act did allow for new entrants and competition in the provision of these services. After 1 July 1997, other players can quite legally provide subscription television services using satellite Australia Our legislation also allows competition through the use of MDS and cable to ensure that consumers get competitive prices and as wide a choice of programming as possible. But, at the same time, the Trade Practices Act will ensure that all parties behave appropriately. When Telecom and Optus put together consortia and announced multibillion dollar investment plans for cable, the government acted very quickly to ensure that we had the right regulatory regime to cope with the future. The government acted very speedily to ensure that we had an open access regime to ensure that there will be an environment that encourages investment in the development of Australian content, interactive software and interactive business applications to improve education and training in the years ahead. I am not quite sure whether these cable applications could be viewed on an Astor television set but, if the Leader of the OpposiVictorian tion wishes, perhaps we could ask the CSIRO if it could do some work to find out how pay TV could be delivered into an Astor television.",43
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am really absolutely excoriated.,44
56,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure you will get that Astor television working one day if you keep working at it. The crucial point is that the government dealt with an important policy issue quite speedily. The government acted to ensure that there was a principle of open access for broadband services for decades to come. This was an issue with which the opposition could not cope. This was an issue on which the opposition was all over the place. This was an issue on which the spokesman for the opposition, Senator Alston, was saying that the government had not allowed too long a period of exclusivity on managed access for pay TV. Senator Alston said that there should have been a longer period to allow investment in cable when the member for Mayo-who was then the Leader of the Opposition-was saying that there should have been a shorter period. Mr Downer-How many ministers have you had for pay TV? Beddall was the in minister for pay TV. Remember that?",44
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mayo!,44
58,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Last time. I pointed out this contradiction between the member for Mayo and Senator Alston.,44
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You do not need to respond.,44
60,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It became apparent that there was a view in the Leader of the Opposition's office that Senator Alston had actually cleared the press release of the Leader of the Opposition and, in fact, that this was a contradiction not between the member for Mayo and Senator Alston but between Senator Alston and Senator Alston and, therefore, we should not blame the member for Mayo. That might be one way for· the member for Mayo to excuse the fact that he contradicted his spokesman for communications but we know-and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition knows-that you just cannot trust Liberals. The Leader of the Opposition has known for many years that",44
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, they are a good lot.",44
62,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are a good lot. The Leader of the Opposition says that they are a good lot. You can understand why the current Leader of the Opposition says they are a good lot. Look at the loyalty he got from John Elliott over the years.,44
63,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is garbage, absolute garbage.",44
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Even I am having some difficulty finding any link between the question and what the minister is now saying. He will come back to the question.,44
65,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you for that advice, Mr Speaker. I suppose the simple point is that we expect the Leader of the Opposition, given past experience with Victorians, to treat Senator Alston with the suspicion he deserves. The crucial point is that Senator Alston's performance as spokesman for communicalook tionsMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you have asked the minister to make you said that. his answer relevant, and he has not done that. So he is in fact defying your ruling.",44

67,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will wind up on this point: the Leader of the Opposition thinks Senator Alston is the best man for the job, the best spokesman on communications.

Can the Treasurer confirm that the minister has announced in effect a new regressive tax? As you promised no new taxes at the last election, is this not yet another of electoral fraud?",45
71,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I was not aware of any comments that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made at the ABARE outlook conference.

The government decided that it should give the proposal some analysis, and it is being anaat the present time. There is no decision made by the government about any such tax. Whether the government decides to do that or not is something which will be decided some in the next few weeks. The minister for environment will be going to an international conference in Berlin in March. The be government will be making a decision about all any such tax proposal prior to that time. This matter is not being conducted in the context of the budget determinations; rather in the context of maximising our greenhouse case response. Of course, it is not the only thing being looked at in that respect. Quite a number of measures have been adopted in the past. We have agreed in principle to adopt further measures. This is another one which is being considered. What is being looked at said he is a relatively small tax.",45

Obviously, in looking at that we are being responsible in the senseMr Downer interjecting",46
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mayo!,46
86,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are concerned with ensuring that Australia does everything in its power to try to live up to its obligations to the convention, under which it accepted that it should try to keep its emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Obviously there are some let-out clauses and those are not unimportant clauses. They have to be taken into account when considering whether we need absolutely to tie ourselves to achieving the 1990 emission levels and, if not, on what basis we would decide that something less than 1990 emission levels are appropriate for us. This is a series of quite difficult considerations but it is a responsible approach. As I said, it will be a relatively short period of time before the government makes an announcement one way or the other on whether it is going to pursue such a tax or not. Consumer Prices",46
87,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Assistant Treasurer assure the House that the benefits of low inflation are being felt by ordinary Australians? Can he say what measures the government is taking to continue the downward pressure on prices? Mr Tim Fischer-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker, on one aspect of the question of the honourable member for Capricornia? Would you rule, Mr Speaker, where she was asking for what additional measures, that therefore the Assistant Treasurer does not have the ability to announce new government policy in his answer?",46
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am sure the Assistant Treasurer is aware that policy cannot be announced in response to a question. With that caveat, I call the Assistant Treasurer.",46
89,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to say that a whole range of goods and services dropped in prices last year. In fact, the Age newspaper recently pointed out that consumer credit went down by 4.2 per cent, petrol by 1.4 per cent, shoes by 2.3 per cent and restaurant meals by 1.8 per cent. These are all figures taken from the ABS CPI statistics for the December 1994 quarter. So we had some prices for consumers actually dropping at the same time as the economy was growing rapidly and hundreds of thousands of jobs were being created. The December CPI figures show an underlying inflation rate for the quarter of 2.1 per cent, and this is despite growth in the economy of 5Y:z per cent. We can safely say from those figures that we are now a low inflation country. We have achieved a structural improvement in inflation over the past decade because of increased competitive pressures; in other words, the government's reform of things such as the exchange rate, tariff reductions and opening up the economy to competition has paid off, not only for companies but also for consumers. These falls in prices were despite the effects of the drought. It has to be admitted that the effects of the drought on the CPI in months ahead may see price rises. However, we can say that the effects of the drought would have been much more damaging but for the structural changes. The Australian economy is now more resilient and flexible in responding to drought or fluctuations in commodity prices. One thing is clear, and that is that businesses are benefiting from a decade of structural reform and are having to respond to increased competition whether they are petrol retailers in a price war or restaurants or fast food outlets fighting for market share. But there are even bigger gains for consumers if we move quickly to the next stage of micro-economic reform, and that is to a national competition framework. Honourable members can get an idea of the huge potential gains when they look at yesterday's report in the Australian newspaper which was commenting on the Industry Commission's work on the benefits of a national competition policy. It is worth reminding the House of some of those statistics. Savings of $9 billion a year for consumers work out at around $1,500 a household. There are enormous savings potentially in gas, electricity and legal bills. I can say that any policy that has the potential to raise GDP by five per cent a year can only be described as a blockbuster. The federal government is still seeking to achieve the cooperation of the states on competition policy reform. I can say that the states will have to show a much more mature outlook to the national competition reforms than they did last year in Darwin. I can inform the House that if they do not do that the federal government will go it alone. The potential savings are just too important to let slip by because states, for their own parochial interests, just cannot make it to the mark. I finish by once again reminding the Leader of the Opposition that he can playa national role by encouraging his state Liberal colleagues to sign up in Canberra. Environment Levy",46
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Treasurer: how do you define the relatively small tax you have just announced? Will it raise $3 billion, $4 billion or $5 billion a year?",47
91,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have made absolutely clear, the government is considering such a possibility-that is all. It has made no decisionMr Reith-As good as.",47
92,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is not as good as. The government has made no decision to adopt any such tax. It has simply madeMr Costello-Come clean, Ralph.",47
93,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am coming absolutely clean. The government is simply looking at the possibility of imposing such a tax if beneficial effects in achieving our greenhouse gas targets and does not have other adverse implications. In considering that tax, obviously, we will take many things into account. You will have to wait and see whether we adopt that and, if we were to adopt it, you will have to wait and see what size it would be. National Crime Authority",47

98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Fine.,47
99,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. I refer to the discussion paper put out by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority concerning the activities of organised crime in Australia. What is the government doing to counter the threat of organised crime and the way that affects the Australian way of life?",47
100,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I want to say that",47
101,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,47
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister for Justice might just wait. I again remind members of this place of the provisions of standing order 55. The minister has been asked a question, although some up this end believe they did not hear it-he was close enough, he did, he is answering it.",47
103,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the role that has been played by the honourable member as chair of the Joint Committee on the N!ltional Crime Authority. It is an important role and that is why I have taken the opportunity today to say something about the discussion paper it has that was published by the committee. That discussion paper, in the main, is a paper which will be considered and will draw comment in the normal course. But a couple of elements of it need to be responded to immediately because they have drawn some public attention and, I think, some legitimate concern. There is a remark in the discussion paper that the over-secretiveness in law enforcement actually promotes organised crime in Australia, and I reject that entirely. It should be abundantly clear that some form of secretiveness is necessary for effective law enforcement. As a matter of common sense, I think members wo.uld understand that it is not appropriate to enable those who are the subject of investigation, suspects of a criminal investigation, to become aware of the nature of that investigation being conducted into possible misconduct on their part. Australian law enforcement authorities obviously have to conduct investigations in an environment of secrecy where the suspect is not kept up to date with that investigation. But there is another point: those wh- may be the subjects of an investigation are entitled to have their own civil liberties respected. Inevitably, in the course of any investigation, investigators fall upon partial information and information which they assemble in due course-they are always working on best information to date. But it would be enormously prejudicial if imperfect and partially completed investigations were the subject of widespread discussion. Many individuals in our community would have their reputations tarnished, notwithstanding that, subsequently, they have been shown not to be the subject of any criminal misbehaviour or any misbehaviour whatsoever. But it is important, as the committee properly points out, that we do take the opportunity of involving the community in knowing what we are doing against organised crime. In that regard, a major report was published earlier this year, the Commonwealth's law enforcement arrangements review, which for the first time published in a very comprehensive way a major strategic assessment of the threats this community faces from local and overseas organised crime syndicates. That is a very welcome report and one which should be commended. But the committee gets it wrong in that it says. that that was a one-off exercise, and nothmg could be further from the truth. The follow-on of that report has been the acceptance of the recommendation that we establish the Office of Strategic Crime Assessment. The Office of Strategic Crime Assessment will be charged with continually reviewing threats that emerge in the criminal environment that may cause danger to our Australian community. Those assessments will not be secret. Those assessments will be collated and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessment will prepare briefs for the attention of the Minister for Justice and an annual public report so that the community is aware of the nature of the change that occurs in the criminal environment which concerns all of us as members of this community. It is very important, given that OSCA will draw together intelligence from international, Commonwealth, state and other law enforcement agencies in a comprehensive picture, that we are aware that some of the issues that must have been in the mind of the committee have already been taken on board by Commonwealth authorities and that our community, our government and our law enforcement agencies stand ready to combat whatever changed threatened environment emerges. Child-care Rebate",47
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services and Health and the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services. Is the child-care rebate a welfare measure or an offset to work related expenses? -- LAWRENCE-It is important to put this m context, a context that the opposition has never recognised",48

107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The minister has the call.,48
108,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The context that has never been recognised by the opposition is the context that a great many women in this country choose to work for some of their lives. Representing as I do, on behalf of the Prime Minister, the women of this country, I am very keen to ensure",48
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Answer the question.,48
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. Listen to the response.,48
111,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that women who work have appropriate child care; that they have income support of various kinds, particularly fee relief; and that there is a child-care rebate, as there is, to support their choice to work. There will be debates in the community. I well remember the view of the opposition that it saw many of these payments--child-care support payments, family support payments, child-care rebates-as essentially welfare measures. The view of the opposition for a very long time has been that there is no right of women to work. They have had the view",49
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume her seat for a moment. Mrs Gallus-I rise on a point of order understanding order 145, Mr Speaker. The question to the minister very clearly was: is the child-care rebate a welfare measure or an offset to work related expenses? It has nothing to do with any other policy. It is a direct question.",49
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have heard the member for Hindmarsh's point of order.,49
114,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To that point of order, Mr Speaker: the minister at the table was being absolutely and obviously relevant to the question. This is another example of deliberate disruption.",49
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have to say that, indeed, the minister was referring specifically to those matters. I find the minister's answer in order.",49
116,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can understand the opposition's reluctance to hear a point of view it has always embraced. That is, it has never understood that the women of this country have a right to work, have a right to equal pay, have a right to industrial relations measures which protect their interests and have a right to deductions of various kinds to support their income earnings. So, in my view",49
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In your view.,49
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,49
119,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"unlike the opposition, and in the view of the government as expressed on many occasions, this particular concession, as it is-you are not going to hang anyone with this-is like the library you can claim on your taxation and other expenses you can deduct. It is a work related matter. That is not to say",49
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ah!,49
121,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,49
122,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are very entertaining, Mr Speaker, perhaps to themselves, but I doubt that the women of Australia find it very amusing. As I have said, it is a work related deduction, like many others. The government will always have the right and retain the right to make adjustments to any of those deductions. We at least recognise that, in order to work, women and families need decent child care, decent income support, a proper industrial relations environment and appropriate deductions for the cost of their employment, amongst which I would number that particular allowance. There is no point scoring to be had here. A proper government will look at every revenue measure at its disposal at every budget. There is no deception involved. It is very clearly stated in direct opposition to the views of this lot opposite here who have never understood the needs of Australian women, and the nature of this question shows them to be still on that track. Music Industry",49
123,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Is the minister aware of a study indicating that only two out of the top 10 broadcast artists on radio in 1994 were Australian? What are the prospects for Australia's music industry and its artists in light of that study?,49
124,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the survey conducted by the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia, which is the copyright collecting agency for sound recordings broadcast on radio. That survey has indicated that oi1ly four of the top 20 of the most broadcast artists were Australians and only three of the top 20 recordings broadcast were Australian. A number of music industry leaders, including John Farnham, who was the most broadcast Australian artist at No.4, and Warren Fahey, an independent record producer of Larrikin records, have said that the survey shows that 1994 was certainly a low point for new talent on radio. These results back up my comments last year that the radio industry's increasing adoption of 'hits and memories' formats has provided reduced opportunities for new and emerging Australian artists. In my opinion, and in the government's opinion, there is a challenge for all broadcasters to see whether they can do more to encourage new and emerging Australian artists. The rock industry is certainly a very important growth industry. Its total output in 1992-93 was worth $1.6 billion to the Australian economy. The member for Wills, who is trying to interject, would be pleased to know that in that year there was a growth of 72 per cent up to $206 million in exports in that particular industry. My main concern is that most of those exports were due to the success of bands that emerged in the 1980s such as INXS, Midnight Oil and Crowded House. Mr CosteIlo--What about the Ramrods?",49
125,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Ramrods are still in oblivion, I am afraid. Mr Tim Fischer-And Pearl Jam?",50
126,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party is always interested in Pearl Jam. I am not quite sure where Pearl Jam came on that list either but it is probably doing as well as the Ramrods. I would applaud, and I hope all members would applaud, the recent initiatives which have been announced by a number of the radio broadcasters, including a number of very good initiatives put forward by Triple M and Austereo. The government is taking action to ensure that we can, wherever possible, ensure the continuing development of this very important industry. On Australia Day, the Triple J network was extended to another 18 regions around the country. That is a very popular issue with a few members of the gallery as well as government and opposition members, including the Leader of the National Party. It will give more young Australians a chance to hear that very diverse range of new and emerging artists in that unique Triple The government also announced in Creative Nation, the cultural policy statement, that it would be consulting with the Australian contemporary music industry on these and a number of other issues, including issues raised in BSEG's report-the Broadband Services Expert Group's report-and also in the Commerce in content report. There are a number of very important challenges and opportunities for the contemporary music industry in Australia. I can advise the House that I will be writing to the music industry's representatives to attend this conference which I intend to hold in Canberra in April. The Leader of the Opposition will be pleased to note that the survey still had the Everley Brothers at No. 92 out of that top 100. Carbon Tax",50
127,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Resources. Further to the Treasurer's announcement of a few moments ago, will he confirm the emphatic statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy today at the ABARE outlook conference that there will be no carbon tax? In fact, is the Minister for Resources aware of his opening statement? The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said: What I said is that there is no consideration being given to a carbon tax per se.",50
128,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of the comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries. There is a matter to be discussed before cabinet concerning the government's greenhouse response. Today and tomorrow Senator Faulkner has round-table conferences with consumer groups and industry representatives in relation to the g'reenhouse problem. I, like other ministers, have been invited to meet those groups, and I will do so. That is the proper, thing. We have international obligations. Greenhouse is a global issue, not just an issue for individual nations. Australia has to be very cognisant of the fact that it is an energy exporter and that any impacts we take are important to our energy, aluminium, alumina and processed metals sectors. Those matters will be taken into consideration in this J style. discussion before cabinet. Personal Income Tax",50
129,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen a report in today's Australian Financial Review of study by Enrst and Young which purports to show that personal income taxes in Australia are higher than in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom? Is this an accurate reflection of the relative tax burden in Ausand tralia compared with these countries?",51
130,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of that article which made comparisons between people at different income levels and in different family structures for Australia, the United States, the 11.7 United Kingdom and Japan. The study sought to convey the view that Australia's taxes were the highest in relation to income tax. It important to understand that the comparisons of taxes in that study are not comparing like with like, and consequently are quite misleading. Australians calculate their personal income tax liability against the scale of marginal tax rates, plus the additional 1.4 per cent Medicare levy. Most other OECO countries also impose some form of additional social security levy over and above the personal income tax rates, although generally at a much higher level than Australia's picture Medicare levy. As with Australia's Medicare levy, these social security levies are paid into the general revenue; the only difference, apart from generally being higher overseas, is that they are generally calculated and identified separately. For example, in the United Kingdom, a worker looking at his or her pay slip will one box showing the personal income tax 38.8 liability and a separate box showing the compulsory national insurance contribution. The Ernst and Young study appears to have included the Medicare levy in its calculation of personal income tax liabilities in Australia, but excluded the equivalent social security contributions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. The comparison it prowas vides is, therefore, quite misleading. The OECO, in its publication Revenue statistics of GEeD member countries, proGOP vides data for both taxes on personal income and employees' compulsory social security contributions. To make a valid comparison across different countries of taxes paid by individuals on their incomes, these two must a be added together. In the OECO publication the category of taxes on personal income in 1992 has Australia at 11.7 per cent of GOP compared with 10.1 per cent in the United States, 10 per cent in the United Kingdom 7.4 per cent in Japan. That is basically the story that is told by these examples in the Ernst and Young study. However, if the social security contributions are included, the comparison is: Australia at per cent, the United States at 13.6 per cent, the United Kingdom at 12.4 per cent and Japan at 11.1 per cent. If taxes paid by emis ployers on behalf of employees-such as the employers' social security contributions and payroll tax-are also included, the comparison becomes: Australia at 13.5 per cent, the United States at 18.9 per cent, the United Kingdom at 16.3 per cent and Japan at 17.1 per cent.",51
131,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the superannuation levy?,51
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Constandard nor has already been warned.,51
133,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this basis, when the full of taxes is taken into account it can be seen that taxable income in Australia is in fact lower than in the other countries in the Ernst and Young study. It remains the case that the total tax burden in Australia in 1992 was 28.5 per cent of GOP compared with the United States at 29.4 per cent, Japan at 29.4 per cent and the United Kingdom at 35.2 per cent. The see OECO average against our 28.5. per cent was per cent. So we are absolutely one of the lowest taxed developed countries in the world-virtually the lowest, apart from Turkey, and we all know the story there-and we will remain a low tax country. I remind the House that, when the Leader of the Opposition was last Treasurer, government revenue as a proportion of total GOP two per cent of GOP higher than it is today-that is Commonwealth taxes to Commonwealth revenue. Two per cent of is $10 billion, or about $550 for every man, woman and child in Australia. That was the tax record of the now Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer: If we still had his tax levels applying in this country, we would be taxing every man, woman and child $550 more than we are currently doing. That is the reality. So when we hear statements about the high taxes being imposed by us, bear in mind who the high taxers are in this parliament-they are the people on the other side of the House who, when they had the chance to lower taxes, maintained a tax regime which was much higher than the one which applies today. Mr BeazJey-I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",51
134,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",52
135,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,52
136,Mr HOWA,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do. During question time, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) claimed that I in particular, and the opposition in general, had never recognised the cost to Australian women in particular-but, I .imagine, she meant parents in general-of child-care expenses. The truth, as distinct from what was being alleged by the minister, is that the policies taken to the people of Australia by the coalition in 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993 all contained taxation deduction or rebate proposals for child-care expenses.

Was it not a lucky thing that when the Treasthese urer (Mr Willis) was asked on 6 December whether he was talking about a carbon an environmental levy, he was able to stand up and say, 'There is no proposition before the government at this stage for a carbon or an environmental levy.'

That is a 600 per cent increase in a relatively small tax, the fringe benefits tax. What about the excise duty on petroleum products? When it was introduced it was raising $2 billion. In 1994-95 it is $9.7 billion-about a 400 per cent increase in that relatively small tax, in that relatively small time, under this relatively low taxing government. It comes out today, almost as an aside: 'Oh, by the way, I did not know in December but they have now told me there is a new tax to coming.' Not only do we find out today that there is a new tax coming but we find out today that old tax cuts are going-the old tax cuts that were legislated before the last election, due to come into effect on 1 January 1996. The Treasurer was asked today to give an unequivocal commitment that they are going to be introduced and he said, 'No, I won't.' He says, 'Don't say it's a broken promise that we are not going to introduce income tax cuts on 1 January 1996; we are not going to introduce them and we are tax or going to stick by our promises.' It is about time that we got some answers out of this government. This government is in tax the midst of - confusion, division and no direction, with a part-time Prime Minister (Mr Keating), a do nothing Treasurer and a disagreement between the Minister for Finance a and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)-as you heard today. The Minister for Finance went on the Sunday When it was put to him that we should not be paying child-care cash rebates millionaires he said, 'That is right. That is one of the things we are going to have to look at.' Yet the Minister for Human Services and Health, when asked today whether this is a Yet deductible and necessary expense to derive income, said, 'Of course it is.' So do think you will get an easy ride on that one; you are going to be fought all the way a bit by the Minister for Human Services and The fact is, as the whole of Australia knows today, this is a government whose plan A failed and whose plan B does not exist. That is the tragedy in relation to the May budgetthere is no plan B. There is no agreement whatsoever on the fundamentals except 'We are going to make the people of Australia pay. We are going to make them pay through higher interest rates, by taking away their income tax cuts and through environmental levies. We are going to make them pay for all the mistakes we have foisted on them.' The part-time Prime Minister had a bad morning this morning. He had to come in here at 9.30. There was a caucus meeting and the part-time Prime Minister had to come. Yesterday he came in at 12.50, but today it was at 9.30. He got really revved up in the caucus meeting. We got a tirade of abuse about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and about tree tip trimmers and caraway seeds. Ms Henzell-No, no! You wouldn't know.",53
144,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You were all there; probably Mr Speaker was there too. I say to the Prime Minister that this tirade of abuse that passes for prime ministerial conduct is no answer to the problems of Australia and its economy. I say this to the Prime Minister who has a passion for poison: it does not matter how many lies you tell about us; we will keep telling the truth about you. We will keep telling the truth about what you have done to this country in relation to foreign debt. We will keep telling the children of Australia how much this government has mortgaged their future. We will tell them that this government inherited a net foreign debt of $23 billion and took it to over $160 billion, that it had net debt at 13.5 per cent and took it to 36.9 per cent. We will tell the people of Australia that per capita GOP adjusted for purchasing power has slipped from 10th in the OECD in 1985 to 15th in the OECD in 1992, that the current account deficit under this government is the worse in the OECD except for Mexico. We will te1\ them how this government has delivered them the highest prime bank interest rates in the developed world. We will tell them how this government has closeted special interests and special privileges in the labour market because it does not want a competitive and open labour market system. We will tell them how it is that this government has run down household savings ratios to four per cent, the worse in recent memory. We will tell them how it is in the midst of a current account crisis when we are now back to the danger zone approaching six per cent. This is a government that prevents uranium mining and exports from developing in this country. We will expose all of its failures, everyone of them-pull back the rocks and expose the light of day-making sure that all of those failures are there and this government accounts to the people of Australia for them. I say to this government: sunlight is the best disinfectant. I say this to you too-",54
145,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh, do 'I'! The great 'I'.",54
146,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barry Jones got you entirely right. He said that the problem with you is that you are an orally expressive in charge of an anally retentive department. That is your problem, and you know it. We will expose everyone of those running sores until they are exposed to the sunlight of open inspection, until they can be dried out and cured. This government is trying to whip up a fervour for tax rises in the Australian community. It is trying to whip up this fervour that what we really need to improve Australia at the moment is tax rises. But the public does not believe you. The public is too clever for that. They know the truth. The Australian Financial Review Harris poll in yesterday's newspaper indicated that when people are asked, 'How do you think the budget deficit should be cut,' there were six per cent that were saying, 'By increasing taxes,' but there were 74 per cent that said, 'The government has to reduce its outlays.' So do not come in here and complain that you do not have enough taxes. Do not come in here and say that the people are wrong; that they do not know what is good for them; that, if only they could have more taxes, they could have all of their problems fixed up. You have already stolen taxes from them, taxes which you were committed at the last election not to introduce. You have already taken away income tax cuts; you have already increased petroleum excise; you have already increased sales tax; you have another one per cent coming on 1 July in relation to sales tax. If this government had been absolutely honest in relation to its electoral program, on 1 January this year income tax cuts worth $3.5 billion would be coming into effect. You remember what the Prime Minister said at the time in relation to those income tax cuts. He went down to the press conference and he said: ... let me tell you something that I thought you might have knownthey've been legislated. They are not a promise, they are ... Opposition members-L-a-w!",54
147,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The great I-a-w which turned into the bigOpposition members-L-i-e!,55
148,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Treasurer had the opportunity to come in here today and to say, 'Even if we can't deliver them on 1 January, we'll make sure that we do it in 1996' or 'We'll make sure we do it in 1997, but we'll make sure we do it,' but he went away from it. He ran right away from it. The minister is running right away from it now, just like the Treasurer has run away from today's debate, because he knows that they are engaged in a massive electoral fraud in relation to that. When it comes to outlays, the fact is-if you read the budget papers you might have noticed· it-that total Commonwealth outlays in 1989-90 were equivalent to 23.7 per cent of GDP compared with a budget estimate of 26.2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The midyear economic review upped that in the last week when it came out. Labor claims that the budget problems are a revenue problem and not a spending problem. But that is fiction. Under current plans, the federal Labor government's spending in 1995-96 will be $7 billion higher than planned in the One Nation statement-the statement that was put to the Australian people before the election. The government has never managed to reduce Commonwealth own purpose outlays to the 16 per cent where it stood in 1979-80. In 1994-95 own purpose outlays are likely to be over 21 per cent of GDP; Spending has been particularly excessive since Mr Keating became Prime Minister, with Commonwealth own purpose outlays probably rising by 25 per cent over the past three years. When the Minister for Finance went on the Sunday program, he admitted failure in relation to this. When he was asked about his expenditure plans he said: ... a finance minister will always go into a budget process, as I did last year, with a set of targets in mind, probably considerably less than those that his colleagues anticipate might be the outcome. We'll do it again, and this year, I think we can anticipate being closer to our targets ... In other words, you missed. You failed. You know what the situation was and you were done over. The Treasurer wanted to have a mid-term economic statement or a minibudget. He was done over. He knew what the truth was. He knew the truth was that outlays were out of control. What do we have now? We had the finance minister on the Sunday program talking about cuts and not demurring from the prospect that they might be billions. We had the Prime Minister out yesterday hosing it down, as the newspapers said,saying, 'I don't believe we can have substantial cuts of that nature.' We have the Treasurer who cannot say anything because he does not have his line worked out yet. We have absolute confusion. The only thing you can say, as of today, is that there is now a deep division with one program being identified by the finance minister: the child-care cash rebate. The childcare cash rebate was only introduced on 1 July last year. That is when it became I-a-w. It looks as though it will not even last 12 months. This was the centrepiece of the women's statement in relation to child careits not being means tested was something that was made a virtue of. Now, without its having lasted one year, we find that there is a deep argum-nt going on, with the finance minister trying to knock it off. Do not come in here, as the Treasurer does, and say to the Australian people, 'You've never had it so good.' They have heard it all before. They heard it in relation to the current account deficit. Remember when the effervescence was going over the cup? They were put through a recession because of the problems with the current account deficit. Now they find that that cure did nothing for the problem. It is like coming out of a hospital surgery and being told that your leg has been amputated but you still have the heart problems. The Australian people were thrown into a recession and went through all the pain and now they are told that it did not meet the problem they really had. . Now they are told that, as a consequence, Interest rates are heading north and their taxes are heading north. It is a government that cannot have a midyear review. It is a government that has run out of answers in relation to balanced policy. It is a government that is closing down export industry and will not do anything in relation to a sensible labour market. It is a government that lost an opportunity. As a result, it is a country that lost opportunity as a result of this government's wilful neglect and its wilful refusal to fix things up in time.",55
149,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"John Hewson got one thing absolutely right in recent times-and he ought not leave here until I have concluded my remarks, because I have a couple of favourable things to say about him during my speech, and not many people have said anything nice about him for some time. But, even so, he departs. The one thing he got absolutely right was that the opposition has not had a shadow Treasurer since the last election. He got that absolutely right. The member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is the most relieved person in this House. His speech merely reflects the apotheosis of his political future. Those in the gallery will not have heard that speech before, but I can assure them that I have heard exactly the same speech from this character for the last nine months: very long on rhetoric and very sub.stantial with regard to so-called facts, which have absolutely no relationship to the facts. It is the same line of rhetoric. There is no sense that he has any capacity to handle an economic issue, no sense that he has any capacity to comprehend or deliver on a budget. The reason why he is a much relieved man is that his colleagues actually know that. His colleagues know that, essentially, he is politically weak. He sat there in London for the last two or three months, sweating on the Liberal Party leadership changes that he was scared witless about joining in himself. He mumbled as he got off the aircraft, 'I don't really know what's going on.' He was fearful that his deputy leadership was under challenge . At the Liberal Party meeting after the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was elected Leader of the Opposition, he was sweating profusely as he made his speech allegedly rallying the troops, unapplauded for that position, saying, 'Thank God you didn't take away the second prize from me. Thank God you didn't drag me an kicking and screaming from the tart shop. Thank God you gave me another chance; I - ill continue to be allowed to display that pig Ignorance as far as economic issues are concerned for the next nine or 12 months at least.' This guy is a top prophet. This is the fellow who, after the last budget, had this to say to us: Remember this: the crucial forecast in the government's budget was for a surge in private business investment. That is the crucial figure. When we woke up the day after the budget, we saw headline after headline in the Australian newspapers - 'gamble', 'gamble', 'gamble', 'gamble', 'gamble' ... That was the big gamblethe big punt on private business investment. . All we can say is that the recent figures show no Sign of a surge in private business investment at all· no sign. of that massive lift, no sign in the capital expendIture figures; ... no sign that business investment is coming back. This is what he had to say in an interview with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program: It: s true that the economy is picking up ... but it's stIll a recovery which is missing a few fundamentals. It's obviously missing business investment and it's obviously missing the jobs growth that we need. And I think if you spoke to Australians out there in the streets and cities and regional areas they'd say, 'What recovery?' This character produced this set of analyses on the last budget-this great prophet, this know-all on the economy, this fellow who absolutely knows what to deliver at any point of time when he wakes up at 10 o'clock and rocks into work for his three or four hours a day, with the odd bit of reading. This chap who managed to come out with that analysis a couple of months later produced what was probably the appropriate response to it. He does not know that it was the appropriate response, because he knows nothing about the subject with which he was dealing. A couple of months later he produced The Things That Matter for the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). That contained 22 promises on spending arrangements, 14 promises of increasing spending, and 14 increasing tax cuts. If you had had a belief about the budget last year that there was no increase in business investment, that the growth figures in the budget were all wrong because they were going to be much lower, that there was going to be no improvement in employment, that was exactly the right response. If that was your sound belief, you ought to have been increasing expenditure and lowering taxes. So he got that right, but he did not know it. He got that absolutely correct, but he did not know it. The opposition spokesman in this area is a total ignoramus when it comes to dealing with these matters. We do not have any particular problem with having him there. He has one line which he trots out every evening. We are not entirely sick of him, but others are. Others are getting a bit jack of this sort of portrayal of opposition policy. Mark Day, normally an opposition supporter in regard to criticisms of this government, had this to say about him today: Mr Howard and his sidekick, Peter Costello, constantly call for spending cuts. It's a lovely catch cry, falling on receptive ears among voters who distrust Canberra and the way it spends our money. But what does he intend to cut? Where? How man.y people will lose their jobs? How many people gettmg a benefit from government handouts or spending will change their tune when it impacts -. Peter Costello, particularly, ignores these specifIC-. In fact, he does - fine)ob impersonating Joh BJelke-Petersen by Ignonng the questions and gushing forth a tirade of glib abuse of the Government. That m.ay be par for the course, but it is hardly constructIve. That is what Mark Day thinks about you. What Mark Day does not know is that you are not actually capable of anything else. If Mark Day knew that you were not capable of anything else, then he probably would have been kinder in his remarks. But there is one big difference between you and Joh BjelkePetersen: the old boy had a ticker. The old boy was in the game. The old boy would fight until the sun went down and then start fighting as the morning came around. You have been the greatest back-scuttler when it comes to politics, and the politics of the opposition, over the last year and a half. You have run from every fight. You have pushed everybody up front. You have understoododdly enough-in your soul your true ignorance. You have comprehended it and, as a result, you have produced the most extraordinary economic analysis that an opposition shadow Treasurer in my memory has ever managed to produce. Your position is this: based on your assessment of where the economy was going, the government should have hauled back spending much faster than it did. If you actually believe that-and I think you are now trying to convey to us all an impression that you believe that-then your predictions at the time of the last budget as to where we would now be were probably the worse of any of the predictions that were hanging about. The problems the government has had to handle are exactly the sorts of problems any government in this country would wish to handle. We have faster than anticipated business growth, slightly faster than anticipated growth in the economy overall and much faster than anticipated employment growth. Much of that comes from the sensible policies the government put in place, both at the time of the last budget and previously in relation to the recession. In terms of changes to on expenditure, the only substantial difference . between the last budget and the prior one was the positioning of the' white paper. As the country is coming out of recession, that white paper is doing what has not been done for 20odd years; that is, putting long-term unemployed people back to work. It has finally started to attack the inadequacies in skills and other things that make the long-term unemployed not job ready, and indeed it is enjoying some considerable degree of success. All governments confront the business cycle. It does not matter whether they are Labor governments or Liberal governmentsare they all confront the business cycle. There obviously a point in time in that business cycle when it is appropriate to inject additionperson, al public resources into the economy. There is obviously a point in time in the cycle when it is appropriate to achieve anything in terms of national saving and also to lightweight. position yourself subsequently for a downturn in the business cycle. There is also an approHe priate point in time to withdraw from it. It is patently obvious that we are at the appropriate point in time, not for any sort panic adjustment which you have invited us to-though God knows what the basis of your arguments have been because, when you have actually been invited to do a bit of an analybecause sis, it has borne absolutely no relationship reality-but when it is obviously commonemerged sense to do that. The opposition egy. The opposition strategy is to attempt to tease out any particular proposition, area expenditure or taxation arrangement and say, 'Well, are you intending to do something about that?' Of course, at the end of the there will be-and this will be the case in budget, even budgets where there are very substantial adjustments going on-vast areas of outlays in revenue that simply will not touched. Every time a budget comes around, all areas of outlays in revenue are potentially there for consideration. That is simply of the budget. common sense. It is also obviously the case---':""'though not people who have absolutely no understanding, as opposed to those who have a soupcon understanding, of the budget process-that the round of budget considerations the finance minister is the devil's advocate, as is the Treasurer, for that matter. On every budget, the position of the finance minister and the Treasurer will obviously be different from the outcome that is ultimately achieved. If it is not different then they are not, in the councils of the government, performing the tasks that are set for them in the positions they hold. To try to make a point out of that, to argue that there is disarray around the place, to state that the Treasurer and finance minister--or any Treasurer and finance minister-are not successful because their absolute bottom lines not achieved is not a statement about is those people but a statement about the person making the allegation. In the case of this it is a very substantial statement indeed. He is a total lightweight when it business comes to these considerations. Mr Costello-No-one would call you",56
150,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This man is full of wit. is described by Kennett as 'Dog'. That is the epithet with which he has been tagged for life, as far as the political process is conof cerned. The misfortune of the opposition leader's predecessor is that he did not live up to his nickname of 'Dodger'. Dodger would have been a more appropriate name for you you have been dodging behind every to tree whenever any substantial political fight in your party. That has been the case has a stratfor some considerable time. As far as the government is concerned, we of approach this budget in the best of all possible circumstances for Australia. We approach this budget in a time of some conday siderable prosperity and of improving prosany perity. We have the obligation, which every government has, to smooth out those trajectories in the business cycle to make absolutely be certain that the good growth picture remains on a sustainable track. In doing that, we have to deal with both the revenue and outlay sides All treasurers have faced that situation. John to Howard was Treasurer of this country for five years so he has a record that is capable of of analysis. He never went into the budget in process without adjusting both the revenue and fiscal sides. One of the great things about having John Howard back as leader is that the chant you so love about taxes and I-a-w, law, is no longer a position with which you can morally continue. That is particularly the case when it comes to your deciding-inevitably, if you get your way-whether to produce a situation in the Senate, as far as the budget concerned, that will have a substantial impact on monetary policy in this country. That is the point of going back to history: in history lies moral authority. Many things lie in history but one such thing is moral authority. And you have none. After that performance of your then Treasurer, for all sorts of reasons in terms of controlling senwas sible fiscal policy he felt instantly inclined after the election campaign in 1977-when you could ring up for your tax cut-to withhave draw the whole lot of tax cuts. Contrast that situation prior to the election campaign John Howard's l-a-w, law, taxes with this government's l-a-w, law, taxes. They were not promises that John Howard was dealing with; they were law. The first tranche of our tax cuts was delivered early with a net result, to doing. the advantage of taxpayers, of some $2 billion. The second tranche was set aside, order to control sensible fiscal policy, for period of time when it could be subsequently addressed. Those cuts will be addressed as far as this budget process is concerned. That is sensible fiscal management. You deliver on a substantial proportion your promise. Then you go through and arrive election. at a different point of time where that second tranche of the promise might be considered. It is a very different process stretching three or four years from that of in one day, out the next. If ever there was massive politioften cal cynicism, that was it. That may not have robbed you of your moral authority because you were not around, it may not have robbed your previous leader of his moral authority but it certainly robs this leader of it. reason we refer to history is that we know he has been robbed of his moral authority. will rub his nose in that for the next 12 months without an apology because it right. It is what history leaves him as a legacy. (Time expired)",58
151,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just had another history lesson from a frontthe bencher of the government on one of the most crucial economic debates that this country has faced this century. The speech that we just heard from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) was the epitome of an arrogant and is tired government. We heard nothing about the reasons for the changes; just a lecture on morals. Nobody in this place should lecture us about morals, particularly not the Minister for Finance, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) or the ex-Treasurer and part-time Prime Minister (Mr Keating). And where is the Treasurer? The Treasurer dropping bombshells here in this national parliament this afternoon, but he is not here to defend the decisions government members made and the promises they have broken since the 1993 election, nor to defend how of they are hanging up young first home buyers with what they propose to do between now and the budget in May. Where is the Treasurer? He is certainly not here explaining to the people of Australia what this government is We just had a lecture from the Minister for in Finance about morals. He went right back for a about 15 years. It is outrageous! The people of Australia are not interested in history lessons day in and day out in this parliament. The people of Australia are interested in what this government will do in the next one, two, of three or 12 months, possibly until the next The Minister for Finance is great at sarcasm and wit. There is a little saying that sarcasm over is indulged in only by fools. When at the dispatch box on the other side the minister indulges in sarcasm. He is not prepared to face up to and debate the real issues that people in Australia are concerned about, that is, the economy and what this government has done to the people of Australia in just two The years. People are not interested in what happened 15 or 20 years ago, but are interestWe ed in the two years since March 1993 when we got a mouthful of promises that have all is our been broken by 'Placido Domingo'. 'Placido Domingo' is what the Prime Minister calls himself, although I reckon we should call him Arthur Daly-the schemer, scare merchant who slides around Australia saying, 'We will give you this' or 'We will give you that; get your votes in.' But as soon as he gets his votes in he changes everything, he changes the rules, and he has done this with every single promise made at the March 1993 election. The latest and the most cutting of these broken promises relates to the childcare rebate. How cynical is this government when it stands by that record? Last week the government was caught out by the timber industry in Australia. For years it has been playing the environmental movement against the timber industry but all of a sudden it has been caught in the middle and caught out. Now it has lost both. We walked through that picket line and talked with people who have voted Labor all their lives, but they could not believe what they were told by this government. When they asked, 'What are you going to do about our jobs? You are supposed to be representing us,' they were told by this government, 'Don't worry, son; we'll restructure the industry and we'll look after you.' When they asked, 'But what about our jobs?' the answer was, 'Oh, we'll give you the dole.' That is the arrogant attitude of this government-'We'll give you the dole.' This government maintains it has improved the situation so far as unemployment is concerned, but itreally has not. Some of the statements the Prime Minister has made about the economic situation in this country are just unbelievable. What about the statement he made regarding higher interest rates? He said, 'I think people will have to say that this is a premium they have to pay for having a job.' The next thing will be this: 'This is a premium I will have to pay just for being an Australian' or 'This is a premium I am going to pay just because I've got Paul Keating as Prime Minister.' It is an outrage! But that is what this government is all about. We have been getting this history lesson about what the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is alleged to have done 12 or 15 years ago. That has absolutely nothing to do with what will happen in the next month or in the May budget this year. People are not interested in history, nor is the media writing about it. When will the government get the message that the people of Australia, through those people up in the press gallery, want to know what the government will do over the next few months with the economic malaise there is in this country? But the government keeps comparing the situation under the last coalition government with the situation under this government. Let us look at the current account deficit. The average current account deficit under the Fraser government was 3.4 per cent of GDP. Under the Hawke-Keating government it has been 4.4 per cent. The average unemployment rate under the Fraser government was 6.42 per cent. Under the Hawke-Keating government it was 8.64 per cent-33 per cent higher. Yet we are told outrageous nonsense by the government every time we come into this place. Private gross fixed capital expenditure averaged 17.1 per cent of GDP under us; it has averaged 16.7 per cent under them. The average level of savings under the Fraser government was 24 per cent; under the Hawke-Keating government it was 18.7 per cent, and it has been falling. Overseas debt was $23 billion; or 13.6 per cent of GDP. Today it is over $160 billion, which is 38.2 per cent of GDP. The average yearly real male wage growth under us was 1.3 per cent, but under Labor the average growth is a negative figure-minus 0.01 per cent. Tax revenue averaged 22.9 per cent of GDP under us; under Labor it has averaged 24 per cent. The arguments the government trots out are just outrageous. The Minister for Finance did not even touch upon the key element of this whole debate, but during question time the Treasurer certainly did with his glib lines about a carbon tax. As he did last week, he dropped another bombshell When he said, as far as the carbon tax is concerned, 'Yes, there may be a little tax, a relatively small tax.' Hiding behind the veil of environmentalism that they got caught out on last week they will introduce another tax. So what has happened in the life of this government so far as tax is concerned? Gross PA YE tax since 1983 has doubled, and other individual taxes have doubled. The Prime Minister has delivered on tax commitments to business since 1983, for sure: business income tax has tripled; the withholding tax has tripled; the superannuation funds tax, the petroleum resource rent tax and the fringe benefits tax have all been introduced since 1983, and the fringe benefits tax has tripled since just last year. It is outrageous! The Minister for Finance has the gall to come in here and talk about adjusting outlays and revenue. This government has done a hell of a lot of adjusting so far as revenue is concerned. All of these factors combined mean that business tax since 1983 has, amazingly, quadrupled. No wonder we reached double-digit figures so far as unemployment was concerned. Business could not afford to pay people; it was too busy paying all these taxes to this government that is out of control. I will move on to sales tax which, since 1983, is up 300 per cent. Excise duty on crude oil is up 300 per cent. Customs duty on imports is up 50 per cent, and other taxes, fees and fines such as bank account debit tax are up 800 per cent. This means the total of indirect tax increases since 1983 is up a massive and out of control 250 per cent. Yes, Prime Minister: you certainly have delivered on your tax commitments. You are just taxing this country absolutely out of existence. Last week and again this week we have had the Treasurer telling us how government members will be environmentally responsible citizens of the world. That is just ajoke! That is the greatest cynical comment made to the Australian people to date. The government does not care about controlling carbon emissions with a carbon tax; it does not care about the environment; it wants more money to run this country because its economic management is a disgrace and it is out of control. Those opposite do not like being held accountable. In his address in this MPI the Minister for Finance said what someone from Victoria allegedly said, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) is a dog. This opposition will be very dogged when it comes to making this government accountable between now and the next election. We will make sure that the people of Australia do not have to sit and listen to rhetoric about things that happened 12, 15,20 or 25 years ago. The people of Australia are sick and tired of history lessons from a very tired and arrogant government. We will be barking at the government's heels all the way through to the next election and we will make those people up there in the press gallery print and report to the people of Australia what the truth is. It started last weekend, and it will continue all the way to the next election. The media can tell the people of Australia what this government is all about. I now go back to the comment I made before: the Prime Minister is no Placido Domingo; he is Arthur Daly, sliding and scheming around Australia, setting up a scam here and a scam there-'You vote for me and I will give you this fistful of dollars, but 12 months later we will take it away,' which is the cynical move the government has made as far as working mothers are concerned. But what will happen? Where is his red-headed mate who will look after him? Arthur Daly has a red-headed mate to help him; so does the Prime Minister. His red-headed mate will turn up. The ACTU has the unbridled control of Australia; it has hold of the leaders here. If we can wait until we start moving into the next six months of this phase of Australia's history we will see the red-headed mate, the ACTU, start pulling the levers on Australia. We will have to borrow more money, foreign debt will go up, and you over there will be held accountable by the people of Australia. The Arthur Daly of Australian politics will lose his Roller and end up in a Mini Minor.",59
152,Mr ELLIOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is good to have the opportunity to speak in a matter of public importance such as the one today. We do not need to talk about the past. Indeed, we can have a good discussion about where we stand today. Firstly, we can talk about the fact that we have the strongest economic growth in decades. We can talk about the fact that we have broken the back of inflation and we now have growth running at over five per cent with inflation well under five per cent-the first time in 30 years we have been able to achieve that conjunction of events. We can talk about the fact that we really have employment growing strongly today, despite all of the negative talk about employment by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). Indeed, it is worth referring to the fact that since the last election, we have seen the number of jobs grow by well over 400,000. At the last election, the government gave a commitment that it would create another 500,000 jobs. Already, two years into the term, with 12 months still to go, we have almost achieved that target that the opposition said at the last election could not be achieved, would not be done and had no prospect of being achieved. Of course, it has been achieved-we have exceeded the employment expectation and there is every reason to believe that that employment growth will continue. Then we come to the question of business investment, which the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) referred to earlier today. It is worth noting that at the time of the last budget, one of the things that the opposition tried to belt the government with was the forecast about business investment. Last Thursday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quoted the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on business investment when he said that the forecast on business investment was 'dead'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that 'business investment was dead in the water'. We forecast business investment of 14Yz per cent; we have achieved 24 per cent. And that 24 per cent represents major growth in the economy, major reinvestment in the economy for the future. Mr Bilney-And a major vote of confidence in the government.",61
153,Mr ELLIOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I agree with the interjection by the minister that it is a major vote of confidence in the government, that businesses are voting with their cheque books to ensure capital reinvestment and, therefore, a great addition to productivity capacity in the years to come. Of course, productivity is one of the other great growth areas. That productivity means that we are getting strong growth coming through that is directed at both the productive capacity of our nation and our skills to modernise Australian industry so that we ensure an export focus and, therefore, over time effectively deal with the sorts of issues related to the current account that we need to confront today. That is a stark contrast to the situation a decade or so ago. Members compared the past with today. It is worth noting that in 1983 all of the measures that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) now says he would like to have taken, such as deregulation, opening up the economy, reducing tariffs and so on, he never did. This government has addressed those measures-it has taken steps to deal with the modernisation of the economy and to ensure that our economy does have the capacity to grow, a capacity for merchandise exports to grow. For example, last month's balance of payments contained payment for a new LNG tanker. In the short term, that will have a negative effect on the balance of payments but, in the longer run, it will mean greater export dollars for Australia. Those things now become part of the equation, which under the narrow, highly regulated, insular looking economy of the Liberals, they could never do anything about. When we talk about taxation, it is worth noting that amongst all the measures that have beenMr Lindsay-What about the Leader of the Opposition and Costigan?",62
154,Mr ELLIOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was going to come to the point to which the parliamentary secretary refers. What did the Costigan royal commission say about taxation? What did the MCCabe-Lafranchireport say about taxation? They said that tax evasion had become the fastest growing industry in Australia and that the administration of our taxation arrangements was subject to criminal neglect. We have repeatedly heard that letters were sent by the Commissioner of Taxation to the then Treasurer, the now Leader of the Opposition saying, 'Please do something to give us more capacity to stop this haemorrhaging of our tax system. Restore some equity and fairness to the tax system.' It took the current Prime Minister as Treasurer to do something to plug those holes in a way that was fair and reasonable, so that people paid their right rates of tax but that taxation arrangements were not the subject of the massive leakage that became a flood in the time of the last Liberal government. As far as taxation is concerned, it is worth noting things like the double. taxation that applied before dividend imputation-an initiative of this government. When John Howard was Treasurer, all those things were allowed to fester as part of an unproductive economy. Given that people have raised taxation in this particular matter of public importance, I also refer to the personal income tax issue. Look at the rates of taxation: under John Howard the top marginal tax rate was 60 per cent-under Labor it is 47 per cent. Under John Howard the bottom marginal tax rate was 30 per cent-under Labor it is 20 per cent. Under John Howard the company tax rate was 46 per cent-under Labor it is 33 per cent. This government has a tremendous record of reform of the tax system-a recognition that we want to ensure that all Australian companies can compete internationally, that individuals pay a reasonable, fair rate of tax and that we do not have the sort of massive tax avoidance industry that occurred under the previous government. Then we look at the broader state of the economy. It is worth noting again some of the thoughts that have been expressed about the economy over recent years and the repeated, negative talking down of the economy by the opposition over recent times. On every interest rate cut that was made between February 1990 through to 1993, the opposition said we were moving too quickly. Everyone of those cuts was opposed as being 'inappropriate' for the times. All sorts of people have talked about the impact of slowing the interest rate changes at that time and the fact that the economy was in the recession it was. We ensured that those interest rate cuts came through as quickly as possible to reignite the economy. The opposition kept wanting to talk it down. All we repeatedly heard from the opposition was that there was the going to be a double-dip recession. Of course, the opposition was wrong on that, just as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been wrong on business investment in this cycle. Then we come to the question of employment. Once again, the opposition was wrong on that. Looking at this year's budget process, in his review statement last week, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) clarified the nature of events, most of which are very good news concerning economic conditions today. However, we recognised that some adjustments had to be made because of the current account problem. So the government did a number of sensible things. First of all, it decided to have a considered look at all the outlays questions and then consider, as part of the cycle at the time of the May budget, what measures were needed on the revenue side to ensure that we brought the budget back into surplus by 1996-97-two years earlier than had been forecast at the time of the last budget-because of strong growth in the economy. We were still going to ensure strong and high levels of growth by Australian standards because we were getting such productivity gains flowing through the economy and cohtinuing to surge through the economy because we were continuing to get the capital reinvestment that business investment was bringing. But it was also a reflection of the fact that since the three increases in official interest rates since August last year, there have been signs that the economy has started to respond to those interest rate rises. Therefore, it is better to make a sober assessment at the May budget of what other measures are needed because we do want to ensure that the economy keeps growing strongly. We need to ensure that we address the current account problem as we go along with that process-and those things can be done. The figures out last week relating to both retail sales and housing show that the economy has responded in those key areas. I suspect the next couple of lots of data that relate to other areas of the economy will also show that that slowing has occurred. As a result, the sort of hysteria that has been worked up on the current account is one to which we do not need to respond. The member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) probably got the Deputy Leader of the Opposition right about his approach to economic issues. But it is not just about sloganising in the way we have seen here today; it is about responsibly addressing the economic needs of the nation. And that is precisely what the government is doing with its approach to the forthcoming May budget.",62
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion has concluded. NA Mr LIND SA Y (Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (4.49 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. I and 2 The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 and 2 (1995) formally place before parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Gazette during the recent recess of parliament. The alterations are operative on and from 1 January 1995. Customs tariff proposal No. I gives effect to the government's decision on the Industry Commission's report on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries. The overall effect of the tariff change will be that all imports of unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will be free of customs duty. Manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will still attract the excise equivalent duty. As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of duty, the concessional schedule 4, items 35B and 35C become superfluous and have been omitted. Consequential alterations to item 53A in schedule 4 and to the table in section 26 of the principal act are also necessary. I refer honourable members to the joint ministerial statement on 13 December 1994 by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), which sets out the main elements of the package of measures taken by this government and the state governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales to assist growers and manufacturers. Customs tariff proposal No.2 contains a minor alteration to parts for automatic regulating or controlling instruments of heading 9032. The change will allow goods which are not of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles to retain the duty phase-down to five per cent by 1 July 1996. The change has been necessary due to Australia's commitments under the World Trade Organisation agreement. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. (1995). I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. LIFE INSURANCE BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.

Last week it only sat one day, but this week we are back to normal. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL (No.5) 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",65
157,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As said before I was interrupted for question time, there are two amendments in the ation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994 affecting personal taxation. Part 2 implements social security changes that amend the income 326. tax law so that payments of disability wage supplement, DWS, are given similar tax in treatment to comparable social security paythe ments. The DWS was a 1993-94 budget when measure which began on 1 July 1994. The DWS will be exempt from income tax for those res:ipients under pension age. DWS for recipients above pension age will taxable, but they will be eligible for a benefiruling ciary rebate which will negate the tax on the DWS for a full rate recipient. Additionally, bereavement payments related to the DWS will be given similar tax treatment to bereaveaddition, ment payments attaching to the disability support pension. Technical amendments are also made to the tax treatment of other social security payments. Deductibility of gifts is also dealt with in the bill, this time in part 6. There the bill extends the list of charitable organisations for which gifts of $2 or more are tax deductible. Only two of those organisations will have no time limits set as to how long the deductions will be available. Another three have had set and will expire on 3 April 1996, 24 April 1996 and 16 June 1996. Deductions became available for all of those organisations or charitable institutions named over the period 4 April 1994 to 27 October 1994 to the Main Committee inclusive. There are four amendments which deal with of tax administration matters, including the creation of a tax ombudsman. Part 1 of schedule 2 ensures that taxpayers will not be subject to administrative penalty under any penalty provision for an act or omission for which the taxpayer is being prosecuted. The amendment also widens the range of offences where administrative penalties are not payable or must be refunded where a prosecution is instituted. These two measures were announced in an information paper in November 1991 entitled 'Improvements to self assessment-priority tasks'. The bill also removes the power of the I Commissioner of Taxation to impose or reimpose an administrative penalty where a Taxprosecution is withdrawn. This measure implements recommendation 130 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. Changes are made to the notice on rulings division 1, part 3 of schedule 2. Currently legislation provides that a ruling is made it is published. The term is not defined, however, and the requirements for publication remain uncertain. The bill aims to remove The uncertainty about when a public ruling is be effectively made. It provides that a public is made when published and notice of the ruling is published in the Gazette. Accordingly, a rule in future will not take full effect until it has been published and gazetted. In if the commissioner withdraws a public ruling, notice of the withdrawal must be published in the Gazette. This measure implements recommendations 32 and 33 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report. Division 2 of the same part gives the Commissioner of Taxation the ability to round down to the nearest multiple of 5c the final amount of a taxation liability due and payable under any act or regulation which the commissioner administers. However, refunds will not be rounded down since they can be negotiated through a payee's bank account. Part 4 of schedule 2 allows the Commonwealth Ombudsman, if he or she chooses when performing his or her reviews and investigations of the administrative functions of the Australian Taxation Office, to be known as the Taxation Ombudsman. In effect, the amendment is intended to establish a Taxation Ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This amendment is based on recommendations 132 to 136 inclusive of the JCPA report An assessment of tax. The government has rejected the establishment of the Taxation Ombudsman position as a statutory position. The coalition, I remind the House, Sllpports the ombudsman's position being a statutory position operating as a distinct office and working within the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. Another recommendation made in the report was recommendation 131, which canvassed the establishment of a taxpayers' charter. The government claims to support a charter, though to be effective it should be given a legislative basis so it has a real ability to protect the rights of taxpayers. The charter should be widely circulated to achieve widespread support. It should avoid at all costs CANBERRA TAXES IN 1983, Revenue Item Taxation on individualsGross PAYE Other becoming a document that does little to enforce the rights of taxpayers. It should not become the be-all and end-all of taxpayers' rights, with the A TO ducking rights and responsibilities not specifically mentioned in the charter. The government deserves to be condemned for dragging the chain on the fringe benefits compliance review. The review announced in the 1994 budget is now eight months overdue. Two months ago, the office of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) stated that the review would be released in the next few weeks. Where is it? The review is of central importance to the business community, which is burdened by high compliance costs associated with the fringe benefits tax. Both the professional bodies and the business community are frustrated by the government's inertia on this issue. Its lack of immediate action can only be interpreted as a demonstration that the government is not committed to the review. There is also widespread confusion on the scope of the review. On 3 October 1994, in the Financial Review, the Australian Taxation Office signalled that the review of FBT would result in significant reductions in compliance costs for business. Then on 29 October 1994, again reported in the Financial Review, the Treasurer urged caution amongst business groups because the promised review would not result in any significant concessions. Hence there will be little, if any, reduction in the cost of compliance. Naturally enough, related closely to the issue of tax law amendments is the actual amount of taxes collected by the government. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table indicating Canberra's tax increases. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA 1982-83 1993-94 1994-95 actual estimate* estimate $m $m $m 20812 44540 48170 4126 7870 9210 Revenue Item Capital gains taxl\ Medicare levy Gross prescribed payments system less Refunds Total individual tax Taxation on companiesIncome tax Capital gains taxl\ Withholding tax Superannuation funds tax Petroleum resources rent tax Fringe benefits tax Total company tax NA Other taxesSales tax Excise dutyCrude oil, LPG, petroleum Other Customs dutyImports Coal exports ** Other taxes, fees and fines*** Total indirect tax Total Taxation Revenue Non tax revenueInterest Dividends and other Total non-tax revenue NA * revised estimate as given in the Budget 1\ in the 1994-95 budget papers CGT is included companies), as well as the Superannuation funds tax * * abolished in the 1992-93 budget *** includes bank accounts debits tax - excludes ACT taxes and charges # includes interest, rent and dividends and other n/a not applicable The table shows that, based on 1994-95 estimates, total individual taxes have increased by 136.8 per cent since this government came to office in 1983.

That is a 90 per cent increase in real terms, as they like to say. Australians are being constantly told that they live in a low taxed country but are given few good reasons to believe it. Having heard the Treasurer in question time today when he waxed eloquent about the percentage of tax to GDP, I suggest those opposite put the same proposition to a roof carpenter or a brickie on a building site. When they complain about the level of personal tax when it has increased by 73 per cent in real terms, those opposite should go along to the chippie and say, 'As a percentage of GDP,your taxes are really down one or two per cent.' He is not going to thank you. He is not going to say, 'That's great.' The way those blokes speak, he would probably put it more expressively, I assure you. Those people are not interested in bracket creep but that is where the difference is made up. We all know who the bracket creeps are in this parliament. The truth is you can fool some of the people all of the time and you can fool most of the people some of the time, but the government is running out of steam. You cannot fool all of the people all of the time, and the number that you can is rapidly decreasing under this government. We have this nonsense of choosing a particular measurement to justify the highest level of taxes and the highest company tax this country has ever seen over the past 14 years or so. The tax hikes, which are so evident in the table I have incorporated, are also reflected in an Ernst and Young survey published in the Financial Review today. I notice the Treasurer tried to weasel out of that one in his remarks in question time again today. He likes to compare his expenditure as a percentage of GDP with that of other countries but leaves out expenditure by the states, so he does not get an honest comparison. But when something like this Ernst and Young review comes up, he is very selective and says that we are not comparing like with like. He does not compare like with like when it suits him, I assure you. The survey makes it clear that most Australians pay considerably more tax than those earning similar salaries in Japan, the United States and Britain. Out of nine scenarios, Australian taxpayers were found to be worse off in eight, in some cases paying up to 20 per cent more tax. On top of the high taxation Australians pay, there is also the internationalgoverned ly high cost of compliance-and never let that be forgotten, because it is a total cost as part of the tax package. Few nations, with the possible exception of the United States, have compliance costs as high as those in Australia. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (l) condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation; and (2) deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with an increasingly complex tax system"".",65

159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TOTAL REVENUE,"Before I call the honourable member for Kooyong, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",68
160,Mr GEORGIOU,TOTAL REVENUE,"Kooyong) (5.08 p.m.)It is good to be able to make my first speech in this parliament on a tax bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5). I am proud to have been elected the member for Kooyong, and I thank the people of Kooyong and the Liberal Party for their support. Kooyong has made history on a number of occasions. In 1994 it again made history by being the first electorate to ever vote into the House of Representatives an Australian of Greek birth. The Kooyong preselection and by-election send a clear message that the Liberal Party is open to all and represents the interests of every Australian. Since Federation, Kooyong has returned only six members to the federal parliament. Sir Robert Menzies and Andrew Peacock represented Kooyong for 60 years. Last year, 1994, was filled with homage to Sir Robert Menzies. He was a towering figure, a creator and a very tough politician. He brought together the Liberal Party, and no mean feat kept it together. He led the coalition to victory on seven consecutive occasions and Australia with vision and integrity during a period of remarkable growth and prosperity . I met Menzies only once in his retirement but I worked with his successor-my pre decessor, Andrew Peacock-for almost two decades. As Minister for External Territories, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Peacock made a truly distinguished contribution to Australia. Andrew Peacock would have been an outstanding Prime Minister if the vagaries of the electoral system and our party's organisational deficiencies had not denied him that opportunity in 1990. I am sure all members of this House join me in wishing Andrew every success and happiness in his post-political life. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",68
161,Mr GEORGIOU,TOTAL REVENUE,"In the last decade under Labor, this nation has endured a pounding unprecedented in our postwar history. Australians have been subjected to economic trauma, to wide-ranging social change, to broken promises and to hopes raised repeatedly only to be dashed. Our national debt is huge and growing. Our current account is in crisis. Our standard of living, relative to the rest of the world and our region, has dramatically declined. Our unemployment is massive. Australia's people, its businesses, its farmers and its economy are daily being hurt by Labor's deliberate policy of interest rate increases. The economic indicators, stark as they are, give us only a very crude insight into the social costs of Labor governments: a growing gap between rich and poor; family breakdown; youth homelessness; and a public mood which in recent years has been dominated by a sense of overload, despondency, a lack of control over the future; and an intensiis fication of cynicism and a loss of faith in government institutions. Nothing has done more to increase cynicism towards government than the words and deeds of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If anyone has ripped and torn at the Australian body politic, Paul Keating is the guilty party. The fact that the Australian people have become utterly cynical about this government does not mean that they have turned into believers in the invisible hand. The old certainties may have vanished and the old syndrome of automatic dependence and trust in government may have weakened dramatically, but the belief that government has a fundamental responsibility for securing the nation's welfare is still profound. Australians no longer assume that government will act with common sense, intelligence or vision, but they continue to demand that government behaves in such ways and they demand more participation in decisions and in outcomes. They will punish governments that fail to meet their expectations. It is the responsibility of this parliament to creatively respond to Australians and to mobilise their potential, to strengthen the well-being of our country, and to give a sense of national direction and purpose. This is what the Australian people want and this is what we are obliged to provide. There are differences between the parties on the role of government and these are often crystallised in the terms of big government versus small government. Important as these labels may be to us, Australians judge governments by performance, by outcomes and by results. What Australians want is effective government, balanced government, efficient government, and intelligent government. The requirements of government, as we approach the end of this century, are complex, but some of the key ones can be encapsulated in three imperatives. Government must firstly put its own house in order; secondly, it must use its common sense; and thirdly, it must recognise that success is possible but is always fragile. The first imperative for a government which seeks to put itself in a position of leadership to put its own house in order. Never before has the need for government to ensure that its own operations are effective and efficient been so urgent. Australia is faced by intense pressure to become more cost-effective, dynamic and productive in an increasingly difficult international environment. Government has subjected the private sector to massive dislocations and social change and to a barrage of exhortations about the need for private enterprise to become more competitive. This very government is plagued by-to use a phrase that recurs in Australian politics--duplication and overlap in its own structures and operations. Government assistance to firms, designed to improve their competitiveness, is a revealing case in point. After reams of rhetoric about the private sector's need to pick up its game, the government became concerned about the coordination-another well-used phrase-of its own programs and called for an urgent report. The report by Mr Ian Burgess was made available in December 1994. It covered 23 programs expending some $555 million, administered by five departments and authorities, and concluded: An outcome of program overlap and current delivery arrangements is that the same enterprise can receive assistance from a number of agencies. Often there is little or no planning and coordination across agencies. As a result ... The report goes on to say that enterprises are not necessarily receiving the assistance they most need; some are likely to receive more financial assistance than is sensible; and some firms being 'tempted' away from one source of assistance by a better offer from a different agency and program shopping. His conclusion overall is remarkably moderate. He says: All of these outcomes will reduce the effectiveness of Government expenditure on enterprise improve ment. This is in an area where the government is exhorting everyone else. The business of government is complex-some degree of duplication and overlap is inevitable. Nothing excuses the current situation. The duplication and overlap that occurs within the Commonwealth sphere is only part of a massive problem where Commonwealth and state programs and administrations interact. Examine any substantive policy area and what you will find looks more like a set of intestines than a rational allocation of financial, policy and administrative responsibilities. The cost of this overlap and duplication has never been calculated, but it is clearly huge. This is not a dazzling new revelation. Mr Hawke made reforming federal-state relations a key item on his policy agenda. The present Prime Minister for his part made opposing reform a pawn in his pursuit of Bob's job, and there is little sign of any positive movement. The states are not going to vanish. The federal government can try to override the states. The states will resist. The outcome will be increased duplication and overlap as the various sovereign state and federal governments settle into protracted administrative guerrilla warfare. Institutional mechanisms will not resolve the issue. What is required is the rebuilding of trust between the states and Commonwealth. Trust, as we know all too well, is a precious commodity in politics: it is difficult to acquire and it is easily squandered. Trust is not built by a Prime Minister who declares that there is legitimate reason to reduce tied grants and then increases them year by year; who consistently uses the external affairs power to override the states; and who demands that the states embrace competition policy, but shields the federal government from many of its impacts. The Australian people are simply fed up with costly federal-state conflict. They are not as worried as they once were about jurisdictional issues. What they want is an end to waste and inefficiency and the transparent shifting of blame between federal and state governments. They want a creative and cooperative resolution. of common problems. If the federal government wants to put its house in order it needs a constructive act of leadership on the part of its chief minister. Unfortunately, the present Prime Minister has demonstrated all too often that he is too committed to conflict, short-term political conquests and the desire for dominance to achieve a conciliatory bipartisan approach which serves the interests of the whole nation. The second imperative of good government is the application of common sense. Governments are usually faced by complex situations, but there are cases where solutions are comparatively straightforward. Today our medical system is sick. Hospital Medicare now requires common sense policy intervention to restore it to health. Dr Blewett, who introduced Medicare in 1983, consistently maintained: Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector. Today Dr Blewett's historical commentary haunts this government. Between 1984 and early 1990 the number of Australians with private health insurance declined from approximately 50 per cent to 44.5 per cent. The impact of this quite significant decline was moderated in the first instance by over two million people took out supplementary table insurance. It was a shift from basic to supplementary. Since 1990, however, the position has dramatically reversed. The number of insured Australians has fallen by over a million, over 700,000 of whom previously held supplementary table insurance. All these people previously used private hospitals if hospitalisation was required. All now rely solely on the public hospital system. The minister takes the line that this is not an immediate problem because the people dropping out are mostly 'the young and the healthy'. The fact is, it is simply not credible that over a million Australians are so healthy they never require hospitalisation. With unemployment hovering at around nine per cent, with disposable income being hit by interest rate increases, and with the cost of comprehensive health insurance being between $1,500 and $2,000, many ordinary Australians, including those who get sick, simply cannot afford to insure their health or that of their families. They want to insure, as any number of studies shows, but they cannot. There is no point in repeating that old furphy that health insurance is the province of the rich and wealthy. That is simply not true. Pensioners, people on below average weekly earnings, families-all would like to be dependent on private health insurance. The fact is that those who want to keep or take up hospital insurance deserve government support through health insurance premium rebates or subsidies or similar devices. This is not just a matter of need; it is also a matter of rationality. If the 700,000 Australfact ians who let health insurance lapse since 1990 access public hospitals at the average rate of Australians overall, the drain on the public purse will be about $495 million per annum. If immediate remedial action is not taken, the outcome is clear: we will have a non-viable private hospital and private health insurance system, a public system collapsing under the weight of burgeoning waiting lists, and an unacceptable financial drain on governments and taxpayers. Commonsense requires that the government act now; experience indicates that the fact that this government will not. The third imperative for government is to recognise that it can succeed, even on the most sensitive issues, so long as it responds to reality, and proceeds with prudence and creativity. Multiculturalism is such a success. I am proud to be a member of the party which enthusiastically implemented the mass immigration program of the 1950s and liberalised Australia's discriminatory policy. I am proud to be a member of the party which carries on the tradition of the Fraser government, which honoured its moral obligations towards Vietnamese and Indo-Chinese refugees. I am proud to be a member of a party and to have been an adviser to the government which created Australia's watershed in multicultural philosophy and practice-the Galbally report-and which established multicultural television. Liberals can all take great pride in the Fraser government's courage in replacing discredited assimilationism with the recognition that national cohesion is best attained through accepting and endorsing diversity within the framework of shared, fundamental Australian values. Over the last half century, Australia has become a home, and a nation, for five million immigrants from over 130 countries. Almost 40 per cent of our population are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, and almost half of those are either immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, or the children of immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds. Advanced by successive governments for almost a quarter of a century, multiculturalism involves: the recognition of the indisputable that immigration has diversified Australia's ethnic composition; and the implementation of policies maximising the skills and assets inherent in this diversity for the benefit of the individual and for our society as a whole. Multiculturalism involves the right of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage, the right to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of discriminatory barriers. It also involves the key obligation to make an unreserved commitment to Australia and Australia's interests, to the basic structures and principles of Australian society-the constitution and rule of law, parliamentary democracy, tolerance and equality, freedom of speech and religion, and English as the national language. The evidence shows that migrants and ethnic communities are committed and loyal to a country that affords them respect and freedom. Inter-ethnic tensions have been the exceptions rather than the rule. Given the intensity of feeling on many issues, the record in this country is remarkably unblemished. It is quite unrealistic and unfair to expect migrant or ethnic communities to be disinterested in developments in their countries of origin. That they should feel passionate, emotional and committed is to be expected; that they can pursue their interests in the framework of a democratic society is their entitlement, so long as this is done in ways which respect the rights of others and which are peaceful and non-violent. Overwhelmingly, to the great credit of Australia's ethnic groups and to the great credit of our system, this has happened. Out of the mass immigration of the last half century has emerged an admirable, decent, harmonious multicultural Australia, a society based on the appreciation of cultural diversity and on tolerance and mutual respect. Despite confusions, criticisms and shortcomings, multiculturalism is one of our country's important achievements. Multiculturalism has enriched Australian life and self-esteem,and enhanced the inherent fairness, decency and attractiveness of Australian society. In a world of ethnic conflict and violence, it has impressed other nations. Yet, while multiculturalism has been a fundamental policy and a social success there are still elements of ambivalence about it in our society. The fact is that successful policies do not sustain themselves; they have to be sustained. It is incumbent on all of us to recognise that success is always fragile. Mr Speaker, I first sat on the floor of this House as an adviser in October 1975-at a time when the Labor government was rather more relaxed about demonstrations-and I worked for Malcolm Fraser in government for almost five years. I am dedicated to making a contribution to returning the coalition to the government benches because that is what the nation now requires. I thank my parents, my children and my friends for giving me this opportunity. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",69
162,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with my colleagues in congratulating the new member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) on his fine first speech in the Australian parliamenttoday. The graciousness of the Australian Labor Party has declined since he was first in this House as adviser to Malcolm Fraser in 1975. There were but two members from the Labor Party present to hear a maiden speech. That is a courtesy that I hope this side of the House will never neglect. When members of the Australian Labor Party make their maiden speeches, I trust that a substantial number of members from this side of the House will be present to hear their speeches. Mr Bilney-There never have been in the past.",72
163,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"That is not the fact, my friend. You have a very faulty memory and selective amnesia on these issues because there are always members of the coalition present to hear the first speeches of our opponents. This day there were but two members of the Australian Labor PartyMr Truss-And we often have to put up with rubbish.",72
164,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"Indeed. I again congratulate the new member for Kooyong on his fine speech. I predict a long term in this parliament for him. Today the parliament is debating Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who is in the chair, has made a resounding opening speech on behalf of the coalition; I will not reflect on his views whilst he is in the chair, except to say that the member for Curtin is another very fine member of the parliament; and he spoke brilliantly on this taxation measure. He has moved, on behalf of the coalition, an amendment to the second reading as follows: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation; and (2) deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with an increasingly complex tax system"". If we are to take any note of the newspapers and the answers presented by ministers in question time, we could not but agree with the inferences of the amendment moved by the member for Curtin. The complexity of the taxation system has been brought to the attention of this House. The government is going through what it calls a simplification process of tax law. Shortly, this House will debate another measure-I believe it is called the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill-which seeks to simplify the language of the tax act. That simplification process runs into 64 pages. Leaving that aside, it does somewhat simplify the understanding of the tax act but it does not simplify the administration of it or the onerous requirements of the tax office upon taxpayers. One of the chief objections of the community to the changes this government has made since 1983 is the complexity of the tax act, which gives no attention to the cost of compliance. The complexity, with no care for the cost of compliance to taxpayers, means that a taxpayer can be put to a huge cost in the time wasting processes of preparing for the requirements of the tax office. The Treasury, the tax office and the government do not care what that cost is-it is irrelevant. All they do is see how much money they want to raise. That is the other area of our complaint. The government has kept lifting taxation year after year. Its spending has increased at twice the rate of inflation. If a normal household were to adopt this practice, we would have the wage earner bringing home his wages each week, roughly increasing at the rate of inflation over a period of time, with the household spending roughly double that increase each year. That is a disastrous process of management. To see that the government has an external credit rating of only AA instead of AAA indicates what the rest of the world thinks of Australian management. The government is not prepared to tackle its big spending preferences. I would like to refer the House to the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) just prior to Christmas when he paid out in substantial measure on managers and the heads of large businesses around Australia, encouraging them to better manage their businesses, to get their act into gear and to get their salaries and wages down. The Prime Minister, despite that payout to the private sector, has never taken one word of his own advice on the management of the Australian economy. This government is the biggest spending government the nation has ever seen. There are constant increases in taxation and, despite the carping of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), we have an Australian accounting firm demonstrating clearly, for the whole nation to see, that Australians are the highest taxed individuals of comparable countries and that the complaint of Australian people and families is justified when they look at what they pay out to this government; it is increasing year after year. The carping of the Treasurer cannot hide the fact that the Prime Minister's advice to business and to all and sundry is never followed by his own ministers, or by him. The Prime Minister constantly wants to grab more money from superannuation funds. It is no wonder that savings in Australia are at the lowest we have seen and that Australians do not want to save. These low saving levels in Australia indicate that people do not trust the future. They are not prepared to have any faith in what might happen next year or the year after. They know that down the track, in three or four months time, there is likely to be a budget which will change all of their savings plans. It does not matter how long they may have been preparing for retirement, to buy a house or for anything else, this government is completely unconscious of them when it comes to making decisions. All it is anxious to do is to lift the grab from the Australian people. It does not care how complex that grab process is or how much pain it imposes on the Australian people. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, would obviously be more at home in a stage production of The King and I than he would be here in this parliament because he does not understand the tax act or the processes of what the government is doing to Australian families. So he might as well go on the road and go into a stage production of The King and I. He is eminently suited to it. I have not heard him sing; but he looks fine. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister dismiss those processes. The magazine Decisions, presented by the National Australia Bank, contains a report of an interview from October last year between the Managing Director of the bank, Don Argus, and Ralph Willis, the Treasurer. A couple of reaJly important questions are asked by Don Argus in that interview only three or four months ago. The Treasurer makes some statements in response to questions from Argus. Argus said: I've just returned from Singapore and Hong Kong, and the theme that's emerged in all the offshore trips I do is that there's still some uneasiness about the management of our fiscal policy. You have half-answered the question already, but is there room for acceleration in some fiscal and monetary policy measures? Ralph Willis responded: We have built in a deficit reduction strategy over the next few years, based on the policies as they were at the time of the last Budget. This will pull the Budget deficit down by almost 3% of GDP over the period from 1993/94 to 1997/98, which is quite a substantial reduction. Within a few weeks the Treasurer, shamefaced, has to come into the House and announce that that deficit reduction program has blown out of the water and, in fact, that the deficit has escalated by something like 40 per cent. So all the plans he was talking about late last year are shot to pieces. We have the Prime Minister saying to business, 'Get your act into gear,' but refusing to do it himself; and we have a Treasurer who is saying that everything is under control and he has a scheme to reduce the deficit, balance the budget and go into surplus over a period of three years-so everything in the garden is lovely. Talk about self-delusion amongst members of the government, particularly senior ministers! The interview with Don Argus of the National Bank only three or four months ago goes on with Argus asking another question of Willis: There has been a suggestion that some of the gyrations in long-term bond rates were a message to the market that perhaps we should be looking at fiscal policy adjustment a little earlier than we have been. Does that concern you? Willis answered: Certainly, when our long-term bond rates went up a little more than most other major players, it was of some concern-and it was disappointing, no doubt about that. It was somewhat perplexing, given the low level of inflation and inflation expectations. What the market was showing was that it wanted Australian governments to take control of their spending. Now there is a panic, running into the May budget, about what the government is going to cut. What health programs, education programs, social welfare programs and children's services programs is the government going to cut to reduce its expenditure? I predict that the government will use a combination of a reduction of expenditure and an increase in taxation. It will try to minimise the pain by taking money away from people it would normally give money to; and it will try to minimise the pain of those people it is going to grab money from in a fresh tax grab. It will be a double whammy; some reduction in government expenditure in its programs and some increase in taxation. In his interview with Don Argus of the National Bank, Ralph Willis talks about savings. It is very interesting to look at the attitude of the government and the Treasurer towards savings, because if anything is really deficient in Australia it is an incentive and an ethos of saving. Don Argus asked the Treasurer the question: . With a strengthening economy and, at last, signs that business investment is recovering, the focus of financial markets inevitably gets back to the savings/investment gap and external debt levels: . What, realistically, can be done to encourage some private savings? Ralph Willis says, basically, 'I'mpleased you asked that question. We've got superannuation.' That is the only answer he can provide. In a modern economy, that is not a good enough answer, that the government is providing some scope for superannuation",72
165,Mr KERR,TOTAL REVENUE,It's a whole set of policy prescriptions more than you have.,75
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TOTAL REVENUE,Mr Rocher)Order! The minister will remain quiet.,75
167,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"Why are savings levels so low? It is ridiculous that the Minister for Justice comes into this House and makes such strange, outmoded, out-of-touch statements.",75
168,Mr KERR,TOTAL REVENUE,You have whinged for ages; that's all we hear.,75
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TOTAL REVENUE,Order! The minister has said that for the second time.,75
170,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"You have not read an economic document for the past 12 months. Obviously your mind was frozen in some sort of jet lag process about 12 months ago. The amendment moved by the member for Curtin to this taxation bill really captures the concerns of the Australian people. The minister has just demonstrated that he does not understand that, because he thinks savings are high, that people are saving their money, beavering it away and wanting the nation to be productive. They want it to be productive, they are not saving, and they are worried about their future. They are worried about your decisions, Minister. Mr Braithwaite-They are worried about high tax policies.",75
171,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"High tax policies. The motion moved by the member for Curtin condemns the government for its ever burgeoning level of taxation and deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with the tax grab. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) extends that grab in some areas. The main provisions deal with life assurance companies; bonus shares; the disability support payments, and how that will be dealt with; and the natural increase in livestock. Every farmer now has to go out with a stock and station agent and value every calf on 30 June to make sure that they are all right. I do not know how that applies to large pastoral areas. I guess an estimate is made. No doubt there is a tax ruling on that measure which has not passed this parliament. The Commissioner of Taxation thinks that the range riders of Canberra, and the people who are well versed in pastoral pursuits that go to work in suits each day in this city, are able to give him advice on the valuation of livestock in remote areas. But that must occur, according to the legislation that we are passing here in this House today. The bill includes the eligibility for insurance business income, the taxing processes of the Bank of New South Wales, company tax instalments and how they are dealt with-that is interesting reading-and the ombudsman being able to call himself the Taxation Ombudsman. We are going to deal with far more substantial acts of taxation in the days to come. I refer the House to the massive and growing complexity of the tax system, where the government itself has sought to chase every dollar. In particular, under the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax provisions and a multiplicity of other tax processes, the government has been seeking to maximise its income, no matter what the cost to the Australian consumer, the Australian taxpayer. The FBT legislation has created ludicrous examples. The government is going through the simplification process of the taxation laws, yet there is still nothing on the deck about the fringe benefits tax to which the business community can look for substantiation and compliance. The government is still worried about parking lots, whether their mobile phones and laptop computers are taxable, and all of the other stupidities that are in the fringe benefits tax for which the taxpayers are liable. Eight months after the review process, the government is taking no action to change that position. I will not go into further details of the stupidity. I have a paper prepared by the State Chamber of Commerce of New South Wales which lists some of the ridiculous· activities that the taxpayer has to go through to meet the requirements of the tax office. One example is a door manufacturing company based at Rockdale which decided to relocate. its facilities to St Marys, 60 kilometres from Rockdale. To assist employees to make the transition to St Marys, the company paid for the relocation costs of the employees, such as removal expenditure. These expenses were defined to be within the FBT net as the relocation was not interstate. How absolutely stupid. The Treasurer and dear Georgie Gear-what is he, Assistant Treasurer-'",75
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TOTAL REVENUE,Order!,76
173,Mr CADMAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"The Assistant Treasurer (Quorum formed) comes in here every day and tries to defend this situation. The Prime Minister tells private enterprise to get its act into gear whilst pursues such ludicrous policies as those. I refer to the growing concern in the communito ty as to how the capital gains tax is threatenof ing family estates. It has been in position for long enough that the inheritors of an estate will be paying capital gains tax. The way it works, as I understand it, is if I leave something to my children and then they either leave something to their children or gift it away a capital gains tax is paid that process. The complexity of the calculaleaving. tion defies imagination. Most accountants seek legal opinions before they give advice capital gains tax areas at a minimal cost $5;000 per client. But that is a compliance cost that does not worry the government anybody else designing tax laws. They do not care as long as the money comes in. Whilst the stupidity of spendthrift attitudes of this government are maintained, nobody worries. This long-term process of simplification bogged down. In my estimation, at the rate we are going we will finish the process of simplification of the tax act on a page count basis by the year 2015. In 2015, the parlianot ment will be presented with the last few pages of the revised tax act, by which time the attempts, which will be dated 1995, will be 20 years out of date. That is a wonderful process of progressive administration and government management. challenge the Treasurer to demonstrate that that is not a fact. In conclusion, the whole regime of this government in regard to the Australian population is cruel and ludicrous. I draw to the attention of the government the business fears of tax rises and interest rate rises, which are recorded in survey after survey; and the preference of the Australian people for the government to cut its own expenditure rather than to increase taxes. I trust there will be a reducing number of occasions on which we will come into the House to debate taxation law, because the Australian people want to be relieved of taxation; they want the process simplified and the cost of compliance reduced.",76
174,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,TOTAL REVENUE,"I am obliged to members of the Australian Labor Party for coming into listen this debate. Not one of them is on the list speakers on the Taxation Laws Amendment now Bill (No.5) 1994. One wonders how disgusted they are with the bill when they feel the necessity to stay away from the chamber altogether and be called to account only by that way of a quorum. So I thank my colleague at the table, the honourable member for Sturt  on bit disappointing· to see that they are now . I am not surprised that there is no governin ment speaker on this bill. The government of must be terribly embarrassed about the manner in which the tax debate in this country is or going at the moment. If I were part of the government and I had a bill like this in front of me I would go away too. During the second reading debate on this bill the government has foreshadowed that it already has 10 has amendments to be moved to it at a later time. That shows the lack of consideration that has been given to the whole policy area and to the writing of the legislation. I believe that this is the first time this has happened. It is par for the course for the Labor government to first give no consideration to these matters. There is no doubt in my mind that over the last 12 years the Labor Party has established itself in this country as the master of high taxation, not only in the increases in taxation but also in the implementation of new taxes over that time. It is rather interesting to note that in question time today we were told that there will be a small tax coming in on top of a lot of others. We know that the Treasurer (Mr Willis), today particularly, demonstrated his mastership and manipulation of statistics. I am reminded of the old call, 'there are lies, damned lies and statistics'. This whole debate is attached to a set of statistics that is set up by the government to record its situation in the most favourable light. I will take up two comments that are already on record-your own comments, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, and the comments last week of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). He went to the trouble in an MPI of disproving the ridiculous statements that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are making. He averaged certain increases over the period of the Fraser government from 1975 to 1983 and then averaged· similar increases from 1983 to 1994. What he came up with was that the average in tax revenues under the years of the Fraser coalition government was 22.9 per cent of GOP-and under Labor since 1983 it has reached 24 per cent. I will now mention some of your own figures, Mr Deputy Speaker, which are pertinent. Since 1983 under Labor, taxation on individuals has gone up by 136.8 per cent; company tax has gone up by a whopping 305.4 per cent; sales tax, the hidden tax, has gone up by 219.56 per cent; and total indirect tax has gone up by 153.6 per cent. The interesting feature about those statistics is that in that time inflation has risen by 63.6 per cent-less than half of the increase in taxation. Government members come in here and talk about statistics and low taxation under this government despite a chartered accountancy firm's own comparison across the board. If I were the Treasurer, I would be embarrassed to be here at the table. But I remind the Treasurer that this is his bill. He should be at the table and taking notice of the comments that are being made. Later in this debate I will point out some real issues affecting the tax debate that have not been addressed. The real problem is that the government is not listening-much the same thing happened in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 last week. What we will also find is that this government has not only increased taxation and the number of taxes but also managed to accelerate the collection of taxes from the time the Fraser government was in power. For example, company taxation was always collected on a year in arrears basis. Companies are now taxed as an interim measure one month after company profits are determined. The government has also accelerated quite considerably the collection of prescribed payments tax-going by your figures, Mr Deputy Speaker. The collection of all these taxes has come to a point where the government has taken the last ounce in tax, made the tax payable immediately and then looked around for fresh sources. There is no doubt that the government is the merchant of high taxation. At the sermon during the church service at the start of this parliamentary term, I was able to connect the Prime Minister to the phrase: give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, pay him his tribute; and give unto God that which is God's. Caesar-Keating-is taking more than his share of the tribute as far as Caesar is concerned; he is taking over the limit. I have a feeling that if he has not established himself as God already, he believes he is also taking God's share. One of the real rorts that nobody speaks about in this place is the untaxed income of the trade union movement across Australia. I know immediately that the call will be, 'That is okay, but the other associations also have an exemp- status.' But the amounts of assets involved on both sides of the ledger are not comparable. The trade union movement is getting a tax-free ride at the expense of every other taxpayer out there-those who will face this tax rise within the next six months. It is then able to contribute to the coffers of the Labor Party at election time because of those tax-free profits. That is something that should be brought to the attention of the people of Australia-the honest taxpayers-to let them know why they are paying the extra taxes. This should be high on the agenda of any government that is looking for equity in the tax system. I will now explain not only the increases the old taxes, as have been evidenced from the list, but also the new taxes-taxes that said we would never have. The capital gains tax provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act-a mammoth document-are subject to change under this legislation and its amend to ments. The tax started on a small scale but has become a real windfall for the governours. ment. With the fringe benefits tax the ment has gone out deliberately to tax the business sector of this country, and is taxing fringe benefits that are not actually fringe benefits. I would like some of the taxation people and some of the government people to go to some of these isolated minefields and isolated pastoral properties to find out whether having a house in such places should be regarded as a fringe benefit; whether having an air conditioning unit in your house when the heat is up to 50 degrees celsius should regarded as a fringe benefit; and whether taking your kids from the mine site to the nearest town so that they can get an education should be regarded as a fringe benefit. Again, we have a fringe benefit device which the Treasurer said at the last budget was going be subject to some compliance alterations so it would not be so complicated. However, nothing has been done. We should be critical of that. I also mention the Medicare levy. I have already talked about the prescribed payments tax, which has been introduced to accelerate collection. There is a taxation on employers to contribute to superannuation funds. The amendment mentions the high cost of complieyes ance and substantiation under this government's tax system. I have no problems with the proposition that people who earn income should legitimately pay taxation on it. The complaint that I hear from businesses and taxpayers in my electorate is about the cost of compliance in terms of time-not only in the case of income tax and company tax, but also all these other elements; it is fast becoming burden which they cannot stand. Substantiation on top of that contravenes the common laws of justice in this country. The increase in new taxes and the increases in in the taxes that are being implemented at the moment are cancerous in their nature. I do not we say that with any malice aforethought. The Treasurer said today that there will be a small tax. We know that small taxes grow like cancers. Like cancer, they have the capacity kill off business, to kill off the incentive that is necessary to survive in a system like Yet this government is running full pelt governtowards an increase in taxation. If we were to look across the Tasman, we now would see in New Zealand an economy that has adopted a goods and services tax, a value added tax. New Zealand has reduced individual taxation and company rates of taxation. At out the moment, New Zealand is out-performing Australia in leaps and bounds. Its current account is in credit whereas, as we know from last week, ours is going further and further into debt. We have to understand that a high taxing country is a disincentive for people, a be disincentive on businesses, and an encouragement to so many others to enter into competition with us because we cannot afford those taxes, particularly those of an indirect nature. We have to admit that nobody in this country understands the government and, into particular, nobody understands the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table. He is part of a collection of people who have no consideration for those outside this place. It is okay for us in this enclave; we have guaranteed pay increases and all the benefits of the system. But when you go out there, you have to fight on a daily basis for survival, for competition in business. The minister would do well to go into his electorate and open his to see what is going on in that regard. I mentioned the increase in the average levels of taxation. If you look at the record, you will see that those increases in taxation lead to increases in expenditure and in the whole realm. Today in this place we talked about savings. It is of no surprise that savings have diminished, because people are so busy paying money into the taxation pool. It is of a no surprise that we have a record current account deficit, and all those other things that are associated with high taxation. The people of Australia must be wondering about this situation as they approach the next election. We put our taxes on the table at the last election. The Labor government implemented its taxes by way of I-a-w, law. In the first moment after the election, that law turned into an I-i-e, lie. The government has to face the people on that basis. We now hear that there will be a three per cent increase in superannuation for employees. It does not matter how much the government denies these things by saying, 'There will not be carbon tax; there will not be superannuation on employees; there will not be a child-care rebate adjustment; there will not be a wealth tax.' It does not matter how much the government insists that these measures are not on the agenda. If you want to believe the Labor government, at the next election it will be fair to ask it where it stands in relation to these measures. People out in the community are scared stiff of a wealth tax. We got rid of that and opened up a lot of avenues for people in Australia to go out and invest. Are we going to have a wealth tax? Are we going to have a carbon tax? Are we going to defer this three per cent for now and put it on later? We have to ask people to come clean. We said we were going to have a taxation act with clear English expression and clear and concise rules. As my colleague mentioned before, by the year 2005 they might have been able to go through the act. I will give honourable members one example of how extravagant we are with our regulation. The act covering the fringe benefits tax which was implemented in New Zealand and which was a model for the one we took comprises about 150 or 160 pages. The act covering our fringe benefits tax runs into something like 400 or 500 pages, and it still has to be amended by this legislation. Another matter I wish to mention relates to the unfairness of the sales tax. That was particularly borne out in evidence given to the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration when it investigated the tax impact on the tourist industry. People in my electorate and people right around Australia are discriminated against because the vehicles they use are required to carry up to 12 passengers. If a vessel or a minibus is not capable of carrying up to 12 passengers, sales tax at the rate of 21 per cent is imposed, not only on the new item but also on the spares and things like that. I understand that rate will shortly go up by one per cent. These types of anomalies cannot be fixed by bandaid measures. There is only one way to do it. All of the indirect taxes imposed on business should be cleared right out of the system. I hope that the representations made by people in the Whitsundays in my electorate are taken into account by the Treasurer and the government to make sure that the anomaly that exists between a 12-plus exemption as against a 12-minus full payment of the tax is fully examined. I will be looking at the report in that regard. The final matter I mention relates to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, which looked into the tax deductibility of expenses incurred in litigation in this country. From my experience, it is not worthwhile for an ordinary citizen to take action against a big company-particularly a finance company or a bank-because the deductibility of the expenses of ordinary citizens is nil, whereas the deductibility of the expenses of big companies is unlimited. I have recently observed the abuse of the system by some financial institutions in legal action against former clients. In some cases, financial institutions are paying more than a million dollars in legal expenses. How can an ordinary person get justice under that, system? The Access to Justice Advisory Committee took this into account in part. Under section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, there is an entitlement to deduct from assessable income all losses and outgoings to the extent that they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. Of course, a financial institution is doing just that-producing assessable income. Paragraph 8.8 of the committee's report stated: The New South Wales Law Society Task Force critiCised tax deductibility of legal expenses in litigation for creating an incentive for business to litigate rather than use alternative dispute resolution. This is particularly the case with the banks at the moment in mediating on the forex dealsthe foreign exchange deals. The report further stated: The Discussion Paper also noted the inequity between the business litigant and the individual, where one can rely on tax deductions and the other cannot. The report continues: ... there is an argument that tax deductibility creates inequities between business and private litigants. I think that is obvious. It continues: The equity argument essentially rests on the financial imbalance between a business and a private litigant. The former is usually entitled to deduct the litigation costs. Thus, in a sense, the general body of taxpayers is subsidising the business litigant's decision to litigate ... Of course the individual has to pay the full cost, and there is no subsidy. It says: By contrast, the private litigant must bear the full costs of the litigation including court costs, he or she recovers costs from the opposing party in the proceedings. The barb is that, if litigants go the full distance and lose the case, they are normally associated with the cost of the litigation on the other side. The paper continues: The deductibility of the business litigant's legal expenses may, therefore, accentuate imbalances of bargaining power in the litigation. The paper states: One way suggested of alleviating any inequity in the present system might be to permit certain nonbusiness litigation expenses incurred by individuals to be tax deductible, up to specified limits. Some limit might be imposed on the amount of litigation expenses that can be claimed as a deduction. As I said before, and as the report indicates, at the moment financial institutions and big companies in these disputes have an open chequebook. They are protecting their revenue base. Instead of going to what should be an arbitration or some other type of arrangement, they are encouraged to take a matter the full course. That is only part of the problem. The manner in which they use those legal redresses is yet another. The action suggested is that the government commission a review of the current law and practice governing the tax deductibility of litigation legal expenses. (Time expired)",76
175,Mr HAWKER,TOTAL REVENUE,"I am absolutely amazed that, when we look at the speakers list on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994-and tax is a speciality of this government-we see that not one member of the Labor Party dares to even come into this chamber, let alone speak on this issue. Not one member of the government is prepared to come in here and talk about this legislation. This tells you how terrified those on the back bench of the Labor Party are about the tax reputation of the government. They know that Labor now stands for tax: more tax, higher tax, new tax, anything tax. If it moves, Labor is going to tax it. The terror of those on the back bench is illustrated by the fact that they cannot even come in here and speak on the legislation. unless That gives a fascinating insight into what is really going on in the minds of those on the back bench of the Labor Party. It also shows that members of the Labor Party are terrified that, if they speak on this bill, maybe Australians will wake up to the fact that this government has been the greatest taxing government ever seen in this country. I will come back to that point in a little while. I would like to support the amendment put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I will read it out again so honourable members do not miss the point. In his amendment, the honourable member made two very clear points. He stated: ... whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation ... Honourable members should take note of that. The level of taxation has increased by more than double the rate of inflation. If you listened to some of the answers the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was giving in question time today, you would think that he has great difficulty in grasping this. The second part of the opposition's amendment is that this House: . . . deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with an increasingly complex tax system. Both of these are very valid points which highlight how this government has failed to understand what good government is about and how it should use a tax system to help the country prosper· rather than penalise those who want to get out and have a go. We have had some discussion in the debate so far. I admit that it is a one-sided debate because, as I say, government members are terrified to come into the chamber. They are obviously frightened to talk about tax. We can see what has happened over the years of Labor. When the capital gains tax was brought in, the then Prime Minister said, 'After five years, we expect it to collect $50 million.' I think that in the first two years got about 10 times that, so either he did not know what he was bringing in or, if he did, he was misleading the people of Australia. The capital gains tax is so complex that even today accountants are not fully aware of the extent of its impact. Some say that it will take years to fully see just how all pervasive tal gains tax is. It is now becoming a de facto form of death duties and, as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) pointed out, on a number of occasions it is being substituted for death duties. There are myriad examples of the complexity of the fringe benefits tax. It is making a mockery of good tax policy and people are obviously losing great respect for the whole impact of that tax. Sales tax is being used in a fairly devious way. It is being jacked up. It is going to go up again this year. I can tell you that. You do not have to wait until the budget for that one, because it is already there. Sales tax is going up. It is being jacked up continually in a way that members of the Labor Party hope people will not be aware of. Then there is the tax which has had such an adverse and disproportionate impact on people who do not live in major cities-fuel tax. The way fuel tax has been mercilessly milked for revenue is staggering. The government believes that, if they have to travel, people have no option but to pay fuel tax. As I say, for people who live in regional and rural Australia, the impact has been very disproportionate . It has meant that not only the cost of travel has gone up dramatically but the cost of freight has gone up dramatically. When you look at just about everything you touch in the country of which freight is a component of the cost, you see how enormous the impact of all this has been. The government must have a few qualms about the tax laws becoming so complex. Just to give you an idea of how complex they are, I go back to some figures I produced for this House last year. In 1983 there were 2,731 pages of tax legislation. This is not an insignificant amount, but by 1994-I am talking about May 1994; there have been significant amounts more since then-there were over 6,700 pages. That is more than double the it number of pages there were in 1983. Just think of the complexity that is there. I think that most tax experts will tell you that nowadays there are very few, if any, people in Australia who fully understand the tax laws of this country. That increase in the number of pages is just a nonsense. It makes a mockcapi- ery of what good government is all about. In order to try to cover up for some .of its mistakes and the stupidity of the Labor Party, the government then said, 'Look, it is getting pretty complex. People are having trouble understanding it. We might introduce it into the secondary schools as a special subject.' So what does the government produce? It produces a pack called Paying Tax. What a little charmer. It is a new tax pack to teach people in schools all about tax. In the pack there are glossies, overheads, and-in case you think that tax is a serious matter--even things like tax cartoons. There is also a video. That the government would even consider putting people through this when obviously there are so many other subjects people ought to be learning about is, I think, a terrible indictment on the failure of this government. It has failed to make taxation a little simpler and something people can understand without being burdened with such complexities and enormous compliance costs. Instead, the government is almost inventing new taxes by the day. Of course, we are now faced with new proposals because the government has finally woken up to the fact that it cannot go on running this major deficit. It is starting to catch up with it. I have to say to the government that the coalition has been warning for years of the problems of running continual deficits, and it seems that those warnings continually fall on deaf ears. Instead of saying, 'Maybe we should have listened,' the government is saying, 'Well, we will look for a new tax.' Is it going to be a wealth tax? It seems that, when ACOSS suggested wealth taxes, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) thought that would not be such a bad idea. Or is the government going to reintroduce death duties? Will it say, 'It's not good enough just to tax people when they are alive; we are going to tax them when they die, too.' What will happen to income tax? We have seen the flexibility with which the Labor Party handles income tax before elections: 'It is not just going to be a promise; it is going to be a law.' As has been said in this debate, the spelling of l-a-w seems to change a little and it becomes an l-i-e. Let me return to the carbon tax-a cat apparently let out of the bag today by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) when he embarrassed the Treasurer. It seems as though the Treasurer is sometimes the last to hear about these things. Nonetheless the Treasurer thought, 'I'll try to ameliorate the concerns that people have and tell them ""If we're going to have a carbon tax, it will be a relatively small tax'''. I news for the Treasurer. Let me tell him a bit about history. At the beginning of the 19th century, the British government introduced a temporary tax, a temporary measure. This temporary measure was brought into help fund the cost of the Napoleonic wars. Guess what this temporary measure was called? It was called income tax. Sure, it came in as a relatively small tax. If my memory serves me correctly, it was· 3 - pence in the pound. That was the level at which income tax was introduced in Britain. Remember in those days there was not 100 pence in the pound but 240 pence in the pound. So it was a relatively small tax. It was supposed to be a temporary measure, but a funny thing happened. It is still there but it is no longer temporary. As this government has shown, it happens to like income tax and the amount is certainly no longer relatively small-as any PA YE taxpayer will tell you. When I listen to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer, I am reminded often of a little book available in all good bookshops and wonder how frequently they read it. It is a little Pelican book with a blue cover. It is not very thick and is quite easy to read. The book is titled How to lie with statistics. Listening to the Treasurer today, I seriously wonder whether he has in fact read it. The amendment requests that this House: ... condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation That makes a very clear, simple point. Yet the Treasurer comes in here today and tries to justify what is going on by pulling out statistics and creating a very false picture. I think that part of the amendment shows very clearly why no-one from the Labor Party is in the chamber. No wonder the Labor Party does not have anyone prepared to come into this debate. They are all so ashamed of the failure they have made in the general area of taxation and the fact that tax is going to be a major issue at the next election. Tax is an issue that we will be reminding people of because of the Prime Minister's great promise before the last election-the l-a-w, law. As have soon as the election was over, he ripped up the l-a-w. I would like to focus on a couple of amendments to this legislation. Of particular concern is the amendment to the cost price of the natural increase of livestock and the sales tax exemption for panel vans and utility trucks of one-tonne capacity or more. When I read the explanatory memorandum concerning the cost price of the natural increase of livestock, I was rather amazed at the words the government chose to use. The purpose of the amendments is twofold, one of which is: . to eliminate an inappropriate deferral of taxI thought that was interesting. Then I thought, 'Maybe we ought to go back to the fundamentals and look at the reason for having a cost price of natural increase of livestock below that of the market value.' Why h?s it been an accepted practice for decades for primary producers to use a lower value than either the cost price or the market value? The answer is really very simple. If you say it will be at the higher value, you are saying that people should be paying tax on something that they have bred but have not sold. In other words, they have not received the money but they are expected to pay tax if there is a natural increase. I fail to see how that deferral of tax is inappropriate. Surely the whole point of fair tax law is that you pay tax on income as you receive it-and certainly not before. However, it seems as though this case is the thin end of the wedge. The government is now trying to overturn that long established practice by forcing primary producers to pay tax on the natural increase of livestock before they have even sold that livestock. One example given in the explanatory memorandum is ostriches. One wonders about the significance of that example. Perhaps it is another case of the Canberra syndrome taking over, where the government has its head well and truly stuck in the sand and cannot see what, in reality, is happening to the people who have to go out there and earn a living. I agree with the point made by the member for Curtin that the government has so far failed dismally to explain the impact' of this amendment to other livestock producers. In particular, how would producers handle it if the price of ostriches were to fall? We all know that it is at an extraordinarily high level now. Whilst I support the amendment that will provide a sales tax exemption on locally produced one-tonners, it is long overdue. It is very interesting to note that, as early as May 1993, my colleague Senator Watson introduced a private member's bill to this very effect. It was well researched, well prepared and it made a lot of sense, It seems as though two things can be drawn from this. First, the government was not man enough to admit that Senator Watson was totally right and to accept his private member's bill on the spot. That would have been the right thing to do. Second, the government does not even have the decency to acknowledge two years later that it was Senator Watson, through his private member's bill, who put forward the very proposals that it is now adopting. Again, that does not reflect very well on this government. When a very sensible amendment was put up in the other place in a private member's bill, one would have thought the government, with the availability of expertise it has in other departments, would have looked at the proposal straight away and said, 'This is a fair enough amendment; we will accept it.' It seems as though the government is not man enough to do even that. I reiterate the point: it is little wonder that the backbenchers of the Labor Party are too frightened to come into this chamber and debate these bills. They are too frightened to raise the word 'tax' because they are terrified of what is going on in the Treasurer's office right now. They are terrified of the way in which he is trying to find new taxes and increase existing taxes. There is also the increase in interest rates, which the government is inflicting on Australians right nownotwithstanding the nonsense spoken at question time. I remind those opposite, particularly the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), that the Economist notes that interest rates in Australia are already the highest in the Western world. Let us have none of this nonsense about history lessons. We are already at the top of the totem pole. To suggest, as has been put around as an expectation of the government, right that interest rates are going to go higher shows just how out of touch it is and how little it understands about the damage that will cause to so many businesses in Australia. When you put the two together-the fact that these new taxes will be sneaking in and the relatively small tax of the Treasurer-we will not be fooled; we have heard all that before. I mentioned what the fuel tax is already doing to people outside the capital cities. A carbon tax is nothing more than another fuel tax. I think that shows the government is totally out of touch. The sooner the election comes along and the sooner the people of Australia throw this bunch out, the better it will be for everyone concerned.",80
176,Mrs MOYLAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"I have been listening with interest to the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and I have to say to him that, unfortunately, the problem goes deeperthanjust saying that it is a shame that members on the other side are not in the chamber to debate the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) today. The fact is that they do not understand the issues of tax and small business. They have no understanding at all because most of them have never been out there working in the real world. One of them did go out and try to set up a small business; we saw the sad results of that exercise. Most of them have been privileged and have mysteriously received a pay cheque in their bank accounts every fortnight. They have little understanding of the realities in which the commercial world operates.",84
177,Mr KERR,TOTAL REVENUE,You do not receive your pay then?,84
178,Mrs MOYLAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"I do now, but for 20 years I was out there in business myself, and I do understand how it operates.",84
179,Mr KERR,TOTAL REVENUE,You might give credit to the other side.,84
180,Mrs MOYLAN,TOTAL REVENUE,"My colleague is right. But the reason most of those on the other side are not in here today is that they simply do not understand. If they had any inkling of the impact of the current tax regime on the business community in Australia, they would be after their Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) because he has a review of the fringe benefits tax in his hands. It is nearly 10 months since the government called for submissions on that and we still have not heard anything from him about a review or about the introduction of any kinds of measures to simplify the compliance cost of fringe benefits tax. If honourable members on the other side did have any inkling or understanding of the business community, they would understand that their Assistant Treasurer's tardiness in this regard is costing the business community of Australia $350,000 per day. I will talk on that in greater depth in a moment. As shadow spokesperson for small business, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill. The bill contains amendments to a wide range of tax measures. As we have come to expect, these amendments again clearly demonstrate that the Keating government has no understanding of the difficulties confronting Australia's business sector. We have been presented with another all-sorts collection of amendments that have no apparent relationship with each other. The issues addressed have obviously been chosen at random as they do not represent a structured consideration of any of the major issues confronting our taxation system today. It is yet another demonstration of the government's lack of a coherent strategy to plan for and prioritise its taxation legislation program. The Labor government is way out of touch with the concerns of business, in particular the needs of small and medium sized enterprises. Not one of these amendments addresses the issues of real concern and cost to small and medium sized enterprises in Australia. It is a sad indictment of this government that the repeated calls of our small business sector for tax reform continue to go unheeded. The small business sector has, through the Small Business Coalition, accepted the challenge of promoting in a very clear and concise manner issues relating to taxation policy that are of concern to the small business sector. The Small Business Coalition is a responsible organisation that was formed in 1990 to promote the interests of Australian small business. The Small Business Coalition has brought together some 40 national organisations, effectively covering nearly 1,000 business and professional associations at national, state and regional level, representing over half a million small businesses. The economic contribution of and employment generated by these businesses is significant. They are the real achievers. These industry leaders know the issues. They know what is required to establish a sound business platform. One would think that a responsible government would not merely listen to their concerns but, importantly, would act upon them quickly. Most people understand that business confidence encourages investment, with subsequent benefits to business and employment growth. That seems to be a fact that has escaped this government. For a number of years the federal coalition in this parliament, the Small Business Coalition and other prominent business organisations have been vigorously promoting the need for action on a number of aspects of Australia's tax policy-taxation matters that impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the management, development and growth of small business. But what has been the response of this government? Nothing-absolutely no response on the things that matter to small business. The things that matter to this sector of our economy, enabling it to get on with the job of creating business and employment growth, clearly do not matter to this government. Many times the small business sector is offered flowery tokens by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), but their actions demonstrate no commitment to the real issues. When it comes to resolution of the hard issues, both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction have gone AWOL-absent without leave-or, in the case of small business, absent without action. This omnibus bill contains 17 measures that impact on business taxation, personal taxation and tax administration. Individually, each amendment addresses an important aspect of the tax system. However, in the overall scheme of things they are a fairly lightweight collection of amendments. When considered in the context of what really needs to be achieved with Australia's tax laws, the government has again demonstrated its inability to address the real issues. I do not wish to address each amendment specifically today. However, I will restrict my comments to those amendments which have a particular impact on small business. The amendment to the treatment of panel vans and utility trucks that carry one tonne or more will ensure consistency, irrespective of whether they are derived from passenger motor vehicles or not, and will be of particular benefit to some small business proprietors. The fact that these vehicles will now qualify for accelerated depreciation rates instead of general depreciation is of some benefit. The part of the bill dealing with capital gains tax aims to ensure that certain transactions involving the creation of assets and which effectively assign non-corporeal interests will be subject to capital gains tax. It addresses issues such as a future interest in a professional partnership, and is supported by the coalition. But, again, an issue of real concern to small business is left lamenting in the shadows. Where is the government's consideration of the exemption from capital gains tax of the proceeds from the sale of a small business when the proceeds are rolled over into another small business? Where is the government's acknowledgmentthat the enthusiasm, dynamics and economic and employment potential of small business must be harnessed and projected to the advantage of the broader community? Where small business is concerned, the Prime Minister has a very short memory. Does the Prime Minister not remember that, after presenting the 1988 budget when he was . the Treasurer, he asserted that 'this is the one which brings home the bacon'? Well, it was in fact not long after that infamous statement that small business saved his bacon, and collectively Australia's bacon, by leading the economy out of the recession that 'we had to have'. The government's intransigence on the provision of capital gains tax rollover relief is simply a case of neglecting small business. It is a blatant failure to provide the appropriate incentives for this pivotal sector of the business community to develop and expand. In total there are approximately 757,000 small businesses in Australia, employing in excess of2.5 million people. Overall, close to half of Australia's population could be relying on small business for a livelihood. One would think that a community group with that scope of influence would warrant serious consideration of issues of concern to its development. This is a government that cannot comprehend that in the small business sector we have dynamic, innovative and aggressive individuals who thrive on challenge, who are excited by the opportunity of creating new and discrete business opportunities-individuals who are willing to take risks and generate business and employment growth. However, they are continually frustrated by a lack of government attention to overcoming the real issues-the hurdles that prevent them from capitalising on opportunities and challenges. They can no longer tolerate a tired government. The provision of capital gains tax rollover relief on proceeds from the sale of an enterprise where the funds are invested in a like business would provide an appropriate incentive for small business proprietors to expand their business interests and expertise into new fields of endeavour. The bill also makes a number of changes to the new company tax instalment arrangements applicable for small and medium taxpayers for the 1994-95 financial year. The coalition supports these amendments as they rightly target tax avoidance arrangements which, if allowed to go undetected, increase the burden on other Australians. However, again the government has in respect of tax payments neglected to address an issue of concern to small business that has serious implications for small business cash flow management. I refer to the provisional tax uplift factor which in part determines the amount of provisional tax paid by small business taxpayers. The arrangements for the calculation of provisional tax provide that each year there is to be an uplift factor of 10 per cent unless this is varied. In June 1992 the then Treasurer announced that the provisional tax uplift factor was to reduce from 10 per cent to eight per cent. For the past two years the uplift factor has remained at that, despite the fact that headline inflation for the period has been under two per cent. The government's policy is a needless constraint on small business cash flow management. This is a direct consequence of small businesses, in most circumstances, being unable to borrow to meet tax liabilities, leaving cash flow as the only source of finance. Financial institutions are reluctant to lend for tax liabilities. An unrealistically high provisional tax uplift factor is a burden that small business should not have to confront. Associated with the uplift factor is the margin of error in self-assessment. In recognition of the complexities of tax policy, and the major consideration of small business being the generators of growth and employment opportunities, not being taxation policy experts, it would be beneficial to business confidence and reduce uncertainty if the self-assessment margin for error more closely reflected the complexity of taxation compliance. These are some of the real issues of concern to small business that have been continually raised by the Small Business Coalition. Undoubtedly, they will again be raised in the Senate Economics References Committee's current consideration of many aspects of tax policy and their impact on small business. As in the past, this government is being dragged into a review process due to its lack of commitment to any form of reform. In this instance, it is small business that continues to suffer from government indecision. This stands in stark contrast to the repeated demonstrations from the Prime Minister of the 'satisfying your mates' decisions so frequently made by this government. In addressing Australia's national savings rate, it has to be said that this is a very important issue. It is in fact far too important to be treated in such a sloppy manner as is the case with this Keating government. This amendment, that is, the amendment to superannuation guarantee deferral of quarterly payments, highlights one of the major management problems of this government: the government's policy of legislation by press release of which we saw a very good example last week. In this particular case, the business community is treated with contempt, in that the government failed to put into place or even introduce legislation to defer the quarterly contributions scheme by the date that some employers would have been required to pay their quarterly contribution. Employers were left in the dark, not knowing whether to follow the letter of the law as it then stood, or follow the announcement by the Treasurer. For small business in particular, superannuation administration is yet another burgeoning cost. Through its actions, this government signals clearly that it neither cares nor understands the impact on business management of its sloppy administration and its legislation by press release. It is very interesting to note that this bill contains one amendment relating to the publication of Australian Taxation Office rulings. The removal of the uncertainty surrounding when a ruling is made is long overdue. However, one aspect of Australian Taxation Office rulings that must be mentioned and questioned is their proliferation, complexity, and the management process that is required to keep abreast of these rulings. It was reported in the Financial Review on 3 February 1995 that in 1994 the Australian Taxation Office issued a new ruling for every day of the year. These rulings impact on a wide and varied range of taxation law. The major concern for small business is the uncertainty created by the constant introduction of new rulings. In an environment where a new ruling is being released, on average, every day of the year, what hope does a small business operator have of keeping abreast of current tax policy? Importantly, what is the flow-on cost to small business from its financial advisers being forced to employ additional resources to ensure that the introduction of a new ruling is .understood and effectively transmitted to decision makers? In addition to this ongoing expense, many advisers spend many hours researching and commenting on the ATO's draft rulings and determinations. This environment leads to uncertainty and confusion for management, increases costs but, importantly, highlights the imperative to complete the tax law simplification project. In this regard, the government has again demonstrated its total lack of commitment to reducing the burden of taxation on the business community. While on the one hand it has implemented the tax law improvement project which is rewriting the current tax law into plain English, the government has not been able to demonstrate any commitment to the principle of tax simplification. This bill has been drafted and presented in the 'old style', which will simply need to be rewritten at a later date. What better example of this government's inefficient and wasteful practices could you expect to find? Earlier in the speech, I alluded to the Keating government's inability to address the tough challenges in respect to policy; to make the decisions that count for small business; to be ahead of the game and not always playing catch-up to business requirements; and, importantly, to provide small business with the confidence that its contribution to the economy and the community is valued. The presentation of this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) was a golden opportunity for the government to take a tough decision on an issue of immense importance to all Australian businesses, big and small. I refer specifically to the fringe benefits tax compliance review. As honourable members will remember, the Treasurer announced this review in the 1994 budget. The Assistant Treasurer had carriage of the review and circulated to business and professional organisations and the media the following information: I have today written to a wide range of tax professionals, business and employer groups seeking their input into the Government's review of the costs of complying with the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) laws. The review was announced by the Treasurer in the Budget. Its aim is to identifY area- where complying with the FBT laws causes difficulty for employers, and practical ways of addressing those difficulties. The outcomes of the review must be consistent with protecting the tax base and the overall equity of the tax system. As part of the review, officers of the Australian Taxation Office have already held discussions with representatives of the major accounting and tax professional bodies. As a result, there is a range of practical suggestions deserving of closer consideration. I am optimistic that submissions in reply to my letter will add to that list. The Government hopes to announce the outcome of the review by the end of July. That was July 1994, not July 1995. The Assistant Treasurer went on to say: Accordingly, people interested in making sionsand wait for thisare asked to make them by 17 June 1994. This is a budget measure that came out in May 1994 and the government is giving the business and professional communities less than one month to respond and make their submissions. Again, the government imposed a very tight deadline on submissions to this review. Business, professional and industry groups were given less than one month and in good faith went ahead and made those submissions. With that promising invitation, business could be excused for thinking that the government was serious. But, in true form, what has really happened? Absolutely nothing-at a cost to business in this country today of $350,000 every day this review goes on without any action being taken. The government has again shown that it is simply incapable of making any commitment to reducing the burdens it has imposed on the business community. The government's tardy consideration of the FBT review is a clear statement that it simply does not care, that it has no capacity to address the issues of concern to business and small business in particular. The government's response is not only 219 days late but, importantly, it is costing this nation's business $350,000 per day. A further $76 million in compliance costs have been expended by business-and I am talking about compliance costs; I am not talking about the tax which is another issue. It is an absolute waste of resources that is being condoned by this Keating government. How many jobs have been lost? How much new investment has been forgone? How much incentive to expand and develop business opportunities has been lost due to the government's inability to act? These amendments are a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the tax system is conducive to the efficient conduct of business. However, as usual, the government has failed to grasp the opportunity to address the issues that really matter to small business. submis- I support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).",84
181,Mr CAMERON,TOTAL REVENUE,"Stirling) (6.49 p.m.)The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994 amends four acts: the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Taxation Administration Act, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act and the Ombudsman Act. It is an omnibus bill containing 17 different measures and, in essence, it highlights the government's commitment to proper and necessary taxation reform-that is, there isn't any. It is a mishmash bill, which shows the government has no strategy for taxation reform and that the government is lacking in logic and common sense when it comes to reforming taxation. Indeed, university students starting this year, as in the last number of years gone by, in their accounting lectures will be told how taxation legislation has gone from being a thin book to a few thick encyclopedia-like books under the present government. It is indicative of the Labor Party's lack of planning and lack of strategy that our tax laws are becoming more and more detailed and complex. When the tax act was developed in 1936, it had about 100 sections. Obviously, when it was developed-it was developed as a result of a royal commission-it was going to require changes over time, but it was at least a good start. Look at it today. The last decade has seen an explosion of new legislation and amendments, and it is now estimated that the tax legislation contains more than one million words and 5,000 sections. Over the last two years well over 300 amending pieces of legislation have been introduced. I recall the last election when the Labor Party suggested that under a coalition government small business would have more and more paperwork with our taxation package. If only the government could practise what it preaches. A common complaint I receive from small business people is the great expense incurred in complying with Labor's complex and cumbersome tax laws. The member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) has just referred in her excellent speech to those compliance laws. In the news the other day Mr Ray Conwell, partner in charge of tax consulting at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, was quoted about fringe benefits tax. The article quoted him as saying that the federal government must take the review of fringe benefits tax out of the toohard basket and quickly reform its administration of this cumbersome tax. He said that a review announced more than six months ago had come to absolutely nothing. The article then goes on to say: The administration of the tax is imposing enormous compliance costs on the business community and it must be made more efficient. Mr Conwell said a stream of rulings in the past months ranging from the strange to the ridiculous highlighted the way in which tax was being administered. Mr Conwell said it was no longer possible for employers to minimise FBT compliance costs by having employees take their remuneration wholly as cash as FBT had become so pervasive it taxed everyday business transactions as employee benefits. Unfortunately, it seems the federal government and the Australian Taxation Office are unable to see ever increasing compliance morass into which they are driving Australian business. What is needed is the radical reform of the administration of the fringe benefits tax and a return its basic purpose of taxing non-cash salary payments. This is a stinging indictment on the Labor Party's administration of our tax system, though it is hardly surprising. The FBT, which was introduced a decade ago, has had so many additions made to it that it is simply aimed at maximising revenue rather than achieving the aim for which it was first introduced: taxing employee benefits which are given instead of income. Nowadays, non-fringe benefits which are being treated as such are being taxed, and the administration of it is totally stupid and utterly complex. Look at car parking fringe benefits. Employers must measure with a pedometer the distance between the workplace and local commercial car parks to determine the cheapest rate within a one-kilometre radius. The rates need to be constantly monitored and records kept as to which employees' cars are parked there and for how long. It is little wonder the FBT compliance costs for small business have been estimated to be 42.1 per cent of the tax collected off them. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has often spoken of Australia being a competitive nation within the Asia-Pacific region. But, if you ask the people who know, the word is that Australia is far from being competitive and the millstone around the neck of the business community is our ridiculous taxation system. In the April 1994 Australian Business Monthly, in an article entitled 'Taxed to the limits', Australia's tax system is described as six a shambles. Describing our tax system, it says of it: For years, bits have been tacked on until the original fabric is no longer visible; indeed, the legislation is now almost impenetrable. It goes on: Australia's tax system leaves a lot to be desired. It is neither equitable nor understandable and generates millions of dollars in non-productive complithe ance costs as individuals and companies structure their affairs to try to please the greedy tax man. And for 'greedy tax man' you should read the Prime Minister. He needs to be greedy to to fund the bribes he offers to the various lobby groups to pay for their votes. The article goes on to explain how, instead of being the lowest taxing nation in the OECD-as the Prime Minister falsely tries to assert-Australia is in the middle of the OECD range and well in excess of the Asian countries that we are so keen to be part of. That recent survey in the Financial Review also found that the Prime Minister's comments about our country being one of the lowest taxed nations in the OECD were false. If we are to bring the budget into surplus, we do need a total reform of the system and the government must consider the consumption side of taxation. John Prescott, the Managing Director of BHP, said of the tax act: Rewriting the tax act must receive priority-we have one of the most complex tax systems in the world, which generates uncertainty and imposes costly compliance on taxpayers. The whole business community echoes these views, yet the government has dragged its feet. In fact, it has put the reform vehicle in reverse. Instead of reforming our tax system to make it fairer, simpler and more efficient, our tax system has become more unfair, more complex and much less efficient. Despite that, look what the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in a press release in August 1994 outlining the government's response to the' Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He said: The JCPA Report clearly endorses the ATO's current approach to tax administration, while making many suggestions for improvement. Most of the suggestions seem to us aimed at fine-tuning the tax system, rather than fundamentally altering it. . I think the Assistant Treasurer has been in the sheltered workshop called Parliament House for too long and does not know what is happening in the real world. The bill simply adds to the complexity of the existing act, which is anything but fair and simple. That same press release reiterated the government's commitment to simplifying the huge body of income tax law so that it is written in plain English, with a structure readily followed and easily adapted to future tax needs. Does the Assistant Treasurer match his rhetoric with action? Of course he does not. Here we are debating an omnibus bill, or at least on this side of the House we are debating it-with 17 measures affecting four different acts-which does not match the plain English style commitment of the government. So this will go through parliament only to have to go back to the drawing board of the tax law improvement project for simplification later. This bill undermines previous commitments of the government and is simply adding to the burdens of an already overburdened business community. This bill is but another piece of legislation aiming to serve the government's objective of maximising - taxation revenue rather than providing simple, fair and efficient laws. a I refer also to media release put out by the National Tax Agents Association, now the National Tax and Accountants Association, following the 1993 substantiation audit undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office. It found that all taxpayers had made an error in their returns. Capital gains and termination payments recorded a 100 per cent error rate, with an average adjustment of just over $1,300, and the average adjustment for terminations was a whopping $7,200. Such returns would have the taxpayers branded by the Prime Minister as tax cheats. Yet the problem is the legislation. Despite this evidence, we still have a tax act which is riddled with difficulties, raising the compliance costs and wasting time. It is simply unfair. This government has proven, in the administration of our tax laws, that it is full of rhetoric but sadly lacking in action. We have been promised reform of the fringe benefits tax-and major reform is needed-yet the government has not done a thing. The review of the FBT is eight months overdue-eight months-and we are still waiting, which is of considerable frustration to professional bodies and businesses alike. We were also promised simplified tax laws. Laws are to be drafted in plain English so that it is easier to understand and therefore cheaper to comply with; and, therefore, making the laws more efficient and fairer. The tax law improvement project was announced in December 1993. In August last year the Assistant Treasurer said the project had already begun the task of simplifying the huge body of income tax law. And look at what we are debating today-a mishmash bill which defies everything the government promised. It is more than clear that the whole tax act is a shambles. Indeed, it is, due to its user unfriendly nature, near obsolete. Instead of debating but another bill adding more amendments to the tax act, it is time the government plucked up the courage to reform the entire tax system: rewrite the whole lot in plain English and reform it to be fair, equitable and simple. It is clear from this bill the government lacks a strategy for tax reform. It is clear from its reneging on promises that it does not have any organisation or prioritisation of what it wants to do. It simply decides how much money it needs to bribe the voters. Then it changes the tax act to milk every cent it can out of Australian taxpayers. Finally, to back up everything we on this side of the House have said, let me quote an excerpt from the book Whatever it takes, the very first time Graham Richardson told the truth. At an ACT Fabian Society dinner in 1985 he said: The tax system is on its last legs, it's had it. To put it crudely, it's stuffed. That was the state of the tax system in 1985, and not too much has changed. In fact, it has only been made worse. It is now time the government accepted the truth, stopped telling Richos and reformed the whole tax system to make it user friendly, business friendly, individual friendly and administratively fair. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Ms Crawford) read a third time. HEALTH LEGISLATION (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA COMPLAINTS LEVY BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 February, on motion by Dr Lawrence: That the bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mrs Bishop moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House will not decline to give the Bill a second reading if the following assertions of principle are agreed to, being of the opinion that: (1) there is no evidence that the Bill will meet the objective of reducing private health insurance premiums so as to stem the flow from health fund membership; in fact the evidence is to the contrary; (2) freedom of choice of doctor and hospital is effectively denied; (3) there is no adequate default payment provision for patients treated in hospitals other than under hospital purchase-provider agreements; (4) the community rating principle is undermined by allowing contracts between health funds and contributors to exclude coverage for the treatment of certain illnesses and conditions; (5) there is no specific appeal mechanism from the Complaints Commissioner; (6) the Bill grants the Minister excessive power, specifically: (a) the ability to intervene in contracts, applicable benefits arrangements, complaints, and mergers of health funds; (b) power to intrude upon the privacy of individual patients, without adequate guidelines and safeguards being provided, and (c) to avoid competition policy and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. (7) many in the industry have not been able to have their view heard, and accordingly, the Bill should be referred to the Senate Committee on Community Affairs to examine inter alia: (a) the question as to whether the amendments to the Principal Act made by this Bill may be construed as an authorisation of any form of civil conscription in relation to medical and dental services as prohibited by section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Constitution; (b) the submission made by the Australian Private Hospital Association that the date of the implementation of the mandatory contractual agreements be delayed until 1 July 1996 with the agreements remaining in place till then, and the apparent inflexibility of Casemix based payment systems; (c) the provision of an independent agency to receive information under the Hospital Casemix Protocol; (8) should this second reading amendment not be agreed to, the Bill's second reading should be declined.",88
182,Mr LATHAM,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Werriwa) (7.02 p.m.}-The Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill now before the House represent the most significant attempt by an Australian government to introduce competitive forces into the nation's administration of the health system. On that criterion alone, the legislation is worthy of support. Effective competition is basic to the success of all markets---economic and social. Competition fosters price benefits and better standards of service for consumers and negates the worse features of monopoly profits and monopoly rents. Competition is the powerful force-the invisible hand of economic interest and innovation-needed to lift the nation's productivity and international competitiveness. Competition also has an important, albeit carefully managed, role to play in the effective delivery of social products. Accordingly, I support the intention of the bills before the House to foster competition and consumer benefits in Australia's private health insurance sector. I do so, however, not without due caution. Commonsense says that the success of market deregulation, such as that proposed in these reforms, can be tested only in the market and may be subject to unpredictable outcomes. The successful introduction of purchaser-provider arrangements between private health funds and hospitals, both public and private, relies on the convergence of competition theory and actual market conditions. Australia's health financing arrangements are complex. In a geographically large nation such as ours, with a small but widely dispersed population, the private health insurance industry is unlikely to feature perfect competition, particularly in rural and regional centres. In country health regions, the integration of services with multidisciplinary outlets is more important than market contests between providers. By its very nature, health is unlikely to display strong, let alone perfect, consumer knowledge of market choices and product differentiation. As people naturally place a high value on their health, they are more likely to consume a service rather than risk the downside of not consuming. High levels of public and private insurance in health also tend to diminish the conventional impact of the pricing mechanism. The competition reforms in this legislative package are, by my best assessment, worthy of enactment and support across the parliament. They will require close and thorough monitoring by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her department. In other aspects of the legislation I fully support and endorse the introduction of case payments, aggregate billing and new consumer protection standards. They flow logically from attempts to establish competitive market influences in this part of the economy. Too often it is assumed that social goods and services can only be delivered in the public interest by government monopoly outlets. This ignores the immense contribution to the social sector of privately owned, especially not-forprofit, service providers. Ownership does not matter as much as outcomes. This government has committed itself to the continuous reform of the Australian economy directed at a range of competition reforms-as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is in the chamber, knows full well. We should be no less vigilant in the continuous reform of social programs. Significant gains can be made, under certain market conditions, from the introduction of competition policies for social products. This approach seeks to lower the unit cost and improve the allocation of public resources by stimulating competitive market forces. Competition in social policy can be administered in one way or through a combination of two ways: on the supply or production side, encouraging both publicly and privately owned providers to compete for service based contracts from government purchasing authorities; or, on the demand or distribution side, giving consumers a market choice in the purchase of goods and services from competing providers. In health, where consumer power and market knowledge is relatively limited, this can, at least in theory, be achieved through insurance funds acting as agents for their members and negotiating on their behalf price efficient arrangements with service providers. The effectiveness of these methods, however, is limited by the extent of social market imperfections. For instance, education vouchers-advocated by the Liberal Party at the last federal election as a way of fostering consumer choice between universities-are made impractical by factor immobility in the education market. That is, universities cannot rapidly adjust their capital stock and equipment to cope with wide fluctuations in student numbers-a very important market imperfection. Health care markets have traditionally featured three main blemishes: limited consumer knowledge and choice on service types, diminution of the pricing mechanism and a historic difficulty with the quantification of costs and prices. It is a necessary condition for allocative efficiency that the prices of substitutable products reflect production costs. At least with this requirement, substantial progress has been made through the introduction of diagnosis related groups-categories of treatment types to which costings can be applied-and the introduction in some states, not all, of casemix funding. I congratulate the minister for health for fostering a national commitment to case payments and, through this legislation, bringing casemix-a very important reform-to the private sector with the cooperation of the Australian Private Hospitals Association and insurer agencies. Casemix or output related payments involve complex aspects of data collection which have become feasible only in the last decade through advances in health information technology. They are based on the common sense proposition that efficient production is achieved by paying producers for their output instead of their input. Producers respond to a fixed price on output by trying to meet client demand at the lowest cost. While case payments are best known for their transformation of hospital budgets and management, they are just as applicable and useful in other parts of the health system. In 1988, for example, nursing home funding moved from a cost based approach to an output based system. A similar approach has been adopted for federally funded hostels. Casemix represents a simple but effective change in the financing of hospitals. The traditional method of funding-fixed annual allocations totally unrelated to output-simply institutionalises hospital inefficiency. Public hospitals would invariably increase their waiting lists as a means of attracting additional government funding. That is still happening in those states that have not adopted the of buildings casemix approach. Casemix funding, which pays hospitals according to the services they perform, provides the strongest possible incentive to increase activity and cut waiting lists. The introduction of case payments should not be a matter of partisan politics. It is a practical measure to provide the necessary incentive and management motivation for improved hospital efficiency. The intelligent development of casemix throughout the health system offers a good opportunity for the equitable funding of agencies and more effective care for patients. Significant efficiency gains can be realised from funding health services on the basis of output rather than input. It is the intention of this legislation that these efficiency gains be passed on from hospitals and insurance funds to consumers through more competitive premium ratesa clear and very important micro-reform in this legislation introduced by this government. Competition policies· on the demand or distribution side of the health market involve a model of managed insurance competition initially developed in the United States by health economist Alain Enthoven. This model aims to facilitate consumer choice between competing health insurance plans. Enthoven has summarised his scheme as follows: ... experience with successful models of competition among health plans suggests that tools are available to enable sponsors to use competition to achieve a reasonable degree of efficiency and equity for their sponsored popUlations. Sponsors are active collective agents (governments or some other form of pooled resources) on the demand side of the market who contract with the competing health (insurance) plans and continuously structure and adjust the market to overcome its tendency to failure. Managed insurance competition is based on the belief that a competing set of agents would act on behalf of consumers and use their countervailing market power to purchase wisely and efficiently from both public and private service providers. Just as travel agents shop around the travel industry to bring together the best package for their customers, it is intended that health insurance companies secure the best deals for their members. Choice would be maximised through a large number of competing agents. Under Enthoven's deregulated market governments would fulfil their safety net obligations for universality and access through a risk-rated capitation payment for each consumer. These payments, with the option of privately funded supplements, would be used to purchase the insurance plan best suited to the needs of each consumer. The reform package before the House promotes several important features of this managed insurance competition model: that is, encouraging health funds to shop around on behalf of their clients and establish contractual arrangements with service providers. The private health funds in Australia have not been able to offer their members--especially younger, healthier people-sufficient value for money with a tendency to overprice premiums and overfill reserves. That is the key to this legislative package of reforms before the House. From 1986-87 to 1992-93 average premiums increased by 117 per cent while the reserves held by the funds increased by 75 per cent-not the measure of competitive industry passing on price and service improvements to their customers. Rational low risk consumers are likely to opt out of private insurance if they continue to cross-subsidise high risk consumers and pay premiums in excess of the benefits they expect to receive. This highlights the importance of the reforms before the House: that is, the opportunity for private health funds in Australia to improve their market share through competitive pricing, single billing and other consumer benefits. While acknowledging the significance of this opportunity and these reforms it is, nonetheless, more important in my assessment to recognise the relatively restricted role that private health insurance reforms play in the proper management of Australia's health system. I take my inspiration and guidance on this matter from Neal Blewett who served as one of the best health ministers ever seen in the national parliament. Dr Blewett gave his last speech on 10 February last year. I remember it well because the day before-9 February-I was sworn in as the member for Werriwa. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine the interest and guidance I took from Neal Blewett's last speech in this place. He said: ... any decent health economist will tell you that the levels of private insurance are a third or fourth order subject. The central issue for the health system is the working of the public hospital system. We-unlike the opposition-should rank private insurance rates as a low order question. The policy challenge for governments should be to let the insurance market find its own level of consumer support, not to artificially prop up the market at public expense. We should not be paying public subsidies to private organisations in a market where competition should feature on the health insurance side. Subsidies in the health system should be used to support public access measures rather than indirectly fund services above and beyond the government's safety net provisions in health. This highlights fully the absolute folly of the opposition-particularly that of its former spokesperson, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop)-in advocating tax breaks to prop up rates of private health insurance. What amounts to a public sector subsidy through revenue forgone for the Commonwealth should not be used to prop up the private sector. It should be used most sensibly to achieve national goals of universality, access and equity in health. That is the proper way in which to frame health policies. I certainly hope that the new shadow spokesperson for health, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), addresses the issue and understands this essential aspect of health policy. If a full tax credit were provided for medical and hospital cover it would cost the government almost $3 billion per annum to fund the subsidy to the private sector. Fightback was costed, to my understanding, at well over $1 billion in public subsidies flowing through to the private sector. In the assessment of health markets, there is no evidence anywhere in the world of market equilibrium in health. Public and private market shares depend entirely on market circumstances and government regulations. It is an absolute misuse and abuse of public funds to put an artificial floor under the private market. It simply shifts costs from the public sector to the private sector without any proven gain in access and quality of service. Because of the cost to the public system, I would argue that it would result in absolute negatives-a disadvantage to health consumers. Public money should be used to guarantee policy goals in the public interest: universality, access and equity. We need only look at the figures on the international scale to understand that in Australia the proportion of health funding from the pubric sector is not high. In 1991 Australia was 19th among 23 OECD nations in the government's share of total health spending. We ranked behind Norway with 97 per cent, New Zealand with 79 per cent, and Canada with 72 per cent-just to mention three nations with which Australia would draw comparisons in the management of its national health system. The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place-the sorts of reforms I outlined in an article in the Australian newspaper last week. This concerns service integration and simplification and regionalisation of service delivery to make sure that we overcome some of the locational inequities that are currently experienced in regions such as the south-west of Sydney and, very importantly, the realignment of federal and state funding. It is time for both sides of the parliament end the pointless federal-state dispute over the management of the health system. It is time to end the artificial debate prompted by people like the honourable member for Mackellar about public and private market shares. The truth is that state governments come and go. Some are good Labor governments and some are not so good Labor governments. Of course, we have coalition governments as well. These governments come and go at the state level. But the health structure in Australia stays the same if we do not get national leadership whereby the parliament demonstrates that there is a way to rationalise health delivery, health structures and health financing in Australia. The inevitable fall in private health insurance in Australia should be used as a catalyst for structural reform. By my assessment, competition policies and the use of the purchaser-provider split work better on the supply side of the market: that is, administered by regional health authorities offering comprehensive and integrated service delivery. The role of purchasers or regional authorities would be to assess the health needs of their client populations and arrange contracts with providers to deliver high quality services as efficiently and effectively as possible. The service provider role would involve competition to secure performance based contracts specifying appropriate price, quantity and quality arrangements. The development of public beds in private hospitals would help address the issue of underutilised resources in our hospital system. In Canada, for instance, private hospitals have been incorporated into the. health system on the same basis as public hospitals: that is, they are obliged to provide free care and the choice of doctor in standard wards in return for a maintenance subsidy· from provincial authorities. Private insurance is only required for the additional costs of preferred accommodation and out-of-hospital ancillary services. Doctors in public and private hospitals are paid on a feefor-service basis. This systeinin Australia would also end the discrimination that public patients face into gaining access to public hospitals for elective treatment. Current finan,cial incentives favour the treatment of private patients in public hospitals and encourage queue jumping, a problem that the Minister for Human Services and Health has had to deal with in her negotiations with the states. Public patient services are restricted in Australia by budget caps and rationed waiting lists. There is abetter way. The introduction of equal access to hospital care in Australia that is, choice of hospital and choice of doctor-would shift between $2 billion and $2.5 billion from private insurance premiums into the taxation system and provide a vastly improved method of hospital service delivery to health consumers. It represents the equivalent of a one to 1.3 per cent increase in the Medicare levy. Medicare would cover all consumers for these arrangements. The 1991 national health strategy paper on hospital services in Australia presented a summary of this proposal: choice of doctor and choice of hospital to all through a single national insurer. The potential financial impact on family incomes was generally progressive and generally of great promise on the delivery of health and equity issues. The main obstacle to this approach in Australia would arise from the objections of the private sector. The users of private hospitals would be discouraged from maintaining their private health insurance. The managers of private for-profit hospitals would resentthe imposition of budgetary ceilings and other regulations. There is evidence to suggest, however, that some private hospital groups, sensibly responding to the inevitable decline in private insurance, are willing to pursue public sector revenue opportunities. Health Care of Australia, for example, with lO per cent of the private hospital sector, has taken a policy stance of wanting governments to plan, fund and monitor hospitals but to leave their operation to the most efficient providers. I support that stance. I support competition policies such as those reflected in the tion but I am always willing to flesh out a better way for health policy in the general interests of an internationally admired and effective health system for all Australians.",91
183,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Let us have no illusions: this Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill is an attempt by the Labor Keating government to paper over some of the most serious, critical and strategic problems with the Australian health system. It attempts to convince the parliament, and eventually the electorate, that this legislation will have a dramatic effect: it will bring about a reduction in private health insurance premiums and thus stem the flow of people from private health insurance funds; it will introduce greater competition between health funds by introducing new products; and it will introduce casemix funding in private hospitals. On the face of it, this bill has some appealing elements but let us not be under any illusions. When we consider the real problems with our health system we cannot escape the conclusion that the government is attempting to bring in legislation a few months prior to an election. I believe that the strategy of the Labor government was to bring it in late last year, or at least in early February, in the belief that it would be going to the people by March or April and the effect of these reforms would not be embedded in time for the real effects to be judged by the electorate. However, things have got away from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and it is fairly clear now that he will be unable to go before the people in an election within the next few months. It is more likely to be later this year or early next year. So, in a way, this legislation will catch the government out. If this legislation is enacted without amendment it will show that the government is incapable of dealing with the major problems besetting our health system. Because of philosophical hang-ups and other problems, it will not be able to manage yet another strategic part of our society and economy-the most important part, the health system. In the few minutes that I have before the legislaadjournment-I will be able to continue tomorrow-I would like to give you a brief overview. Firstly, the federal government has managed the levers of health for the last 12 years or thereabouts. In that time it introduced a system called Medicare, which has been wholeheartedly supported by the coalition. I want to put that on the record: the Medicare system of universality is supported wholeheartedly by the coalition. So let there be no misrepresentation by peopleMr Ronaldson-Despite endeavours to misrepresent it.",96
184,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Of course, despite strong attempts by the Labor Party to mislead the community and misrepresent the coalition's position. When the Medicare system was introduced-it applies across Australia and requires all the states to be party to it, through funding of public hospitals in particular, through the provision of health services by private as well as hospital doctors-the promise of the then Hawke government, and of the Keating government since, to the Australian people was that this system of Medicare would provide all Australians with access to public health facilities, to public hospitals, free of charge and within a reasonable time. I have still in my office at home the letter that the Prime Minister wrote to all Australians-it started 'Dear Fellow Australians' - promising just that. But right from the start the Commonwealth government made an error in introducing this major reform. That error was the failure to take account of the increasing costs of health and the failure to factor into the health plan it was introducing a system that would ensure that the product could be delivered. In other words, it underfunded and has continued to underfund Medicare for the last 12 years. That is the fundamental reason for the problems we have today-and things are getting worse. The other thing that the Medicare concept failed to address-it was not Medicare's failure but the inability of the federal government to resolve matters because of its very close affiliation with state trades hall councils-was to ensure that our public hospitals, the recipients of and the major players in this scheme in many ways, were able to deal efficiently with the issues and challenges they were required to face. I was interested to hear what the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had to say about the health system. He has obviously thought very deeply and carefully about it and I am sure that he has a contribution to make to the system. I do not agree with all the things that he said but I enjoyed his contribution. One of the great problems with running our hospitals is that they are very labour intensive. The Royal Melbourne Hospital is the biggest public hospital in my state of Victoria. I recall from when I was health minister and subsequently the shadow health minister that it employed some 3,000 people-a vast resource of people, talent and commitment. Nevertheless, they are people who jealously guard their resources. It is the nature of people in the health system to build fences around their programs and strive to get more funding for them so that they can be expanded. In so doing, those on the other side of the fence in the health family are not always allowed to share the resource. That is one of the basic problems in managing the health system: the major consumers of the health dollar are public hospitals. The very large public hospitals in Victoria, I think-just three or four major hospitals in Melbourne-use up about 70 per cent of the allocation for public hospitals in the whole of the state. Part of the reason for the problems is that Labor governments federally over the last 12 years have failed to provide the leadership and resources to the states to enable the necessary reforms to take place quickly enough so that the hospitals will use these scarce health dollars efficiently and, above all, provide to the Australian community the sort of system that was promised by former Prime Minister Hawke and has continued to be promised by this Labor government, but has not been delivered; that is, access to public hospital care when you want it, within a reasonable time, for you and your family.",96
185,Mr SLIPPER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,When you need it.,97
186,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,Of course. It has fundamentally failed to do that. Now we have inherited the problem. Debate interrupted. NA,97
187,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn Toll Roads",97
188,Mr SOMLYA Y,ADJOURNMENT,"An article in the Sydney Morning Herald today prompted me to speak in the adjournment debate tonight. Surprise, surprise; in that article the Labor Party of New South Wales was strangely silent on where the money was going to come from to fund its promise of abolishing tolls on the M4 and the M5. I will tell you why the Labor Party was silent on that matter; I will tell you what happened in Queensland. I warn the people of New South Wales: do not believe the Labor Party when it says there wiH be no tolls.",97
189,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Tell us about the Sunshine Coast.,98
190,Mr SOMLYAY,ADJOURNMENT,"This is about the Labor Party's record on tolls in Queensland. My colleague asks me to talk about the Sunshine Coast; and I will. In 1989, the Queensland National Party government acknowledged that the four-lane highway through Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast was putting a strain on its internal roads; so it proposed to build a new road to take all that traffic. It decided to finance it by a network of toll plazas. There was a massive protest against the proposal to have toll plazas. After a series of protests local citizens and prominent members of the ALP, the proposal was dropped and was replaced with a single toll across the Maroochy River between Maroochydore and Noosa. In 1989, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Goss, and all the Labor.candidates on the Sunshine Coast promised that should they win government the toll would be abolished. Goss's election promise was a clear and unequivocal commitment, signed personally by him, and sent out by direct mail. I notice that the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) is in the chamber; I think he authorised that direct mail when it went out. There was no question that, if the Labor Party achieved government, the toll would be abolished. Surprise, surprise! Immediately after the election, Wayne Goss announced that to abolish the toll would be too expensive. He apologised to the people for his broken promise. For a short period, the people were allowed to travel that road at no charge while two new tollgates were built further south on the same road. The motorway was finally extended further towards Noosa and the toll was reintroduced on the Maroochy River-on the bridge. The toll that Labor abolished was reintroduced so that now there were three tollgates. Instead of a one-dollar National Party toll, we now have three Wayne Goss Labor Party tolls. The so-called private company operating the Sunshine Coast motorway is, in reality, a front for the Queensland Department of Transport. This is so the money borrowed by the tollways does not show up in the budget and the Queensland government's borrowings do not go over prescribed limits. This is how Queensland Labor governments hide mismanagement. The last annual report for the motorway company showed revenue for the motorway had increased but so had loan borrowings to keep the company afloat. The toll road cost $120 million to build. Last year, patronage of the tollway was up by 60 per cent and revenue rose to almost $6 million; but borrowings from the Queensland Department of Transport increased to $210 million. The operating loss for 1993-94 was by $16.7 million, more than three times the revenue from the ill-fated toll road. The fact is that the people of Queensland are paying twice for the toll; once through the tolls and again through taxes and motor vehicle registrations. That money, I suppose, is being spent elsewhere as the government props up the road financially. So I say to the people of New South Wales: do not believe the Labor Party when it says there will be no tolls. It reneged on its election promise in Queensland; and it is a certainty it will do it in New South Wales. Liberal Party",98
191,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a truism that you cannot understand the potential for the future of your country unless you understand and appreciate its history. I think the same is true of institutions in Australia, and I think it is true of political parties. It is certainly true of the Liberal Party. In its 50th anniversary year we find that we need to study its history. We find the official history of the Liberal Party, Menzies' Child: the Liberal Party of Australia: 1944 to 1994, by Gerard Henderson, and we are told there is a free CD enclosed. I will come to the CD shortly. It is very important to make sure that if we are relying upon history we are appreciative of the fact that it is a good history. So 1 quote from the Weekend Australian of 12 and 13 November, where there is a review of this particular book. The review says: . . . the book is a thoughtful contribution to non-Labor politics in general and the history of the Liberal Party in particular. The reviewer says in the course of his review: Menzies' Child is easy to read. The insertion into the historical narrative of contemporary reflections from personal interviews is enlivening ... The reviewer also says: The criticism made by Henderson that too few Liberals have a strong sense of the liberal-conservahappened tive political tradition in Australia is also valid. Some are not even aware of its existence ... We are only too aware of its existence over here, because this review was done by John Howard, the federal member for Bennelong, now the Leader of the Opposition, the selfproclaimed most conservative leader that the Liberal Party has ever had. Let us see whether we can find something enlivening from some of those personal interviews of which the Leader of the Opposition is so appreciative. We find at page 280 of Henderson's book an interview with Malcolm Fraser, who, commenting on the role that Andrew Peacock and John Howard have had to play in the course of the history of the Liberal Party, states, 'I don't think 1 want to comment except to say that between the two of them they wasted the decade of the 80s totally.' That is the decade of the 1980s, but we know that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, wasted 1975 to 1980 as well as the period up to 1983 when he was Treasurer. You need only look at some relevant economic statistics to see that this is historically accurate and true. The average rate of economic growth under John Howard was 2.1 per cent. Under Labor it has been 3.4 per cent. The rate of inflation when John Howard left office was 11.4 per cent. The current rate of inflation is 2.5 per cent. The average rate of inflation under John Howard was 9.7 per cent. Since June 1990 inflation has been at about two per cent. Let us look at interest rates. When John Howard left office as Treasurer in March 1983 the 90-day bank bill rate was 15.9 per cent. On Friday of last week it was just over eight per cent-almost twice as good. The statistics go on. We have seen the total wasting of the 1970s and the 1980s, as related to us by the Liberal Party's historian . It is also interesting to see what Henderson has had to say about John Howard himself. 1 quote from the Weekend Australian of 8 and 9 October. This is very illuminating. The article states: Howard passed his former adviser, Gerard Henderson, in a Sydney street recently. They exchanged greetings and Howard asked what had to the recording of a 1953 speech by Robert Menzies which had been uncovered and handed to Henderson in his capacity as director of the Sydney Institute. Henderson told him that the recording of Menzies, who had just returned from London and an audience with the Queen, had been made into a CD for distribution in his forthcoming book on the Liberal Party, Menzies' Child. Here we have the CD-'Menzies child: the British Crown', a speech by R.G Menzies made in Sydney on 9 October 1953. The story goes on, quoting Henderson to Howard: . .. ""You'll like the speech,"" Henderson said. ""Menzies in 1953 sounds a lot like you today."" Howard disputed the comparison. ""We're different,"" he said. ""Not that different,"" Henderson replied. The proof is in the pudding. With John Howard as Leader of the Opposition, the equivalent of a 1953 Menzies, you will not attract the Australian public to you because you do not represent the future of this country; you are wedded to the past.",98
192,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Before 1 call the member for Bendigo, 1 suggest to all members in this place that they do two things in making contributions here: first, always make their contributions to and refer through the chair; and, second, refer to members by their correct titles and their electorates. Taxation",99
193,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure honourable members in this House have often heard the cry that people are finding it difficult to make ends meet; in other words, your household budget is not going as far as it used to. I am indebted to my colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who has done quite an amount of research. I can understand the reason why the household budget simply does not go as far as it used to. The table presented to me by the member for Curtin shows that the total individual tax-and these figures are based on the 199495 budget estimates-has increased since 1983 under a federal Labor government by 136.8 per cent; the total indirect tax has increased by 125.4 per cent; sales tax-this is the Labor Party's hidden consumption taxhas increased by 219.5 per cent, since 1983, mind you.",99
194,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,What?,100
195,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"The total tax revenue is up by 153.6 per cent. With massive increases like that under a Labor government, is it any wonder that your household budget does not go as far as it used to? The 153.6 per cent increase in total revenue has occurred over a period when inflation rose by only 63.6 per cent. An inflation increase of 63.6 per cent is bad enough, but when tax increases by 153.6 per cent is it any wonder that the money is devalued, and its spending power eroded? If you go through the table based on the budget estimates that was provided to me by the member for Curtin and look at some of the hidden taxes and agendas, you will see the amount that excise duty on fuel has been increased by, and that petroleum has gone from $3,486 million in 1982-8""3 to $9,720 million-a massive increase. That is one way that you can keep eroding the family budget, by increasing these hidden taxes. People do not understand the massive amount of excise that they are paying. They get to the petrol pump and they see that it is about 72c a litre, or whatever the figure might be, and they do not realise that they are paying about 50 per cent of that in fuel excise directly to the Labor government-the highest taxing government ever in the history of this country. When you look at the massive increases that have been introduced and see that over the period of time there has been an increase of 153.6 per cent, is it any wonder that people are in trouble, particularly in regional and rural areas where fuel excise hurts most. Fuel is a major component, because of the lack of adequate public transport and the need for people to use their own private vehicle not only for travel but also for primary production. Fuel costs add to the cost of production. I bring those figures to you, and I am indebted to the member for Curtin who has done this research. What it points out is that this Labor government is the highest taxing government ever in the history of Australia. Liberal Leadership",100
196,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"In recent weeks there has been a Goebbels type campaign by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and others on his front bench to remake their image from hard Right ideologues to soft, cuddly, caring, non-threatening middle of the road type social democrats. Perhaps the most astounding and outstanding evidence of this campaign was the apology of the Leader of the Opposition for remarks that he made about Asian immigration. What is remarkable about that apology is not that it was made, but that it took seven years for him to make it. His apology on Asian immigration was the culmination of yet another campaign from the faceless men of the Melbourne Club to remake the leadership of the Liberal Party in their own image. As the Australian Financial Review of 31 January stated, Alexander Downer's fate was sealed, like that of John Hewson before him, by Mr Ron Walker, federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party. Alexander Downer's fate was sealed on the evening of 15 December at a famous dinner in Sydney at the Chateau hotel in Potts Point. On that day of 15 December, the critical decision was taken that Alexander Downer should go. Who was present at that dinner? The most significant attendee at that meeting, apart from Mr Walker, the federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party, was Mr Downer's ever so loyal deputy",100
197,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You drew the attention of the House just a few minutes ago to the necessity for honourable members to refer to other members of this place by the name of their electorate.",100
198,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Correct; unless of course it is in a quotation. I assume that that was. But, if not, the member for Lilley will be a little careful.",101
199,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"That was a very significant dinner. Apart from Mr Walker, the federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party, the most other significant attendee was the member for Higgins, Mr Costello-the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. At that meeting Mr Walker and Mr Costello, the member for Higgins, said that Alexander Downer had to go, that big companies would simply not donate to the Liberal Party under his leadership. This comes from a man who had financed something like three losing federal election campaigns for the Liberal Party to the tune of $40 million from the money donated by the shareholders of those companies. Mr Walker made it abundantly clear that Alexander Downer had to go; that that was the decision of corporate Australia. l\1r Slipper- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",101
200,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! I think the honourable member for Lilley did not hear the first time. If you are referring to the member for Mayo, please use the correct title.",101
201,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"The Liberal Party has to be an odd political party when its parliamentary leaders, including the deputy leader, the member for Higgins, sit around a dinner table with someone like Mr Walker, who is not known to the majority of Australians, and decide that its leadership has to change. That is not the Liberal Party of Sir Robert Menzies. So this dinner was another triumph for the Melbourne Club, described by the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) as faceless powerbrokers whose priorities are not those of average Australians. In this House the principal representative of the Melbourne Club is of course the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins. He is affectionately known in Victoria as 'Dog', called so by the Premier of Victoria because he has all the attributes of that fine canine except loyalty. Loyalty was not in evidence at that dinner at the Chateau hotel in Sydney on 15 December.  order.",101

On two occasions in the speech of the member for Lilley I have had cause to stand up but now choose to do so because of the second occasion. First of all he referred to the Leader of the Opposition as running a 'Goebbels type campaign', which I find offensive, given the recent 50th anniversary of Auschwitz being liberated. It is a sensitive issue, and I do not think he should be bandying around names like that in connection with the Leader of the Opposition. Secondly, he is referring to the Deputy Leader. of the Opposition as a dog. I ask him to withdraw both imputations.",101
204,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"On both occasions I find that there is no point of order. In the first case, I think the sentence you referred to was uttered nearly four minutes ago and no point of order was taken. Secondly, he did not call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition by that title. I have listened very carefully. In fact, it is an expression which has been used here in the correct manner under the standing orders.",101

209,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,He has used it. Resume your seat.,102
210,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"To look at the opposition front-bench in this House under the member for Bennelong is to be reminded of Jurassic Park: a lot of dinosaurs with old ideas from the New Right agenda which is extinct elsewhere in the world but very much in evidence on the opposition front-bench. MrPYNE(Sturt) (7.48 p.m.)-Ratherthari make a tirade against people in this House, I am going to speak on an issue that does not usually excite such emotions. It is a fact that the nations of the world may not be able to save tigers from extinction. The threat of the tiger becoming extinct is something that stirs the emotions of many people. Although these animals are not native to Australia, the maJestic image of these animals has captured the imagination of people all over the world for centuries. Mr Latham-They're dogs.  they are cats. Despite this universal fascination with these animals, the threat of extinction is quickly descending upon the tiger. An article in Time Australia in March 1994 estimated a 95 per cent decline in the tiger population this century. Peter Jackson, chairman of the World Conservation Union's Cat Specialist Group, suggests that the extinction of the tiger could occur by the end of the decade. The Caspian subspecies became extinct more than a decade ago. So did the Balinese and Javan cats. The plight of tigers is one of the top priorities of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to which Australia is a signatory. Last year Bill Clinton was under pressure to evoke the Pelly amendment against countries that traded in tiger parts-a law that calls for trade sanctions to force compliance with an international agreement aimed at protecting endangered species. However, despite this international concern, the number of wild tigers continues to rapidly decrease. Until a couple of years ago, the fate of the tigers seemed safe. A concerted effort to save the tiger was started in the 1970s with the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi launching Project Tiger. This was a key initiative, as India is home to an estimated 60 per cent of the world's tigers. The project saw the establishment of 21 reserves with the purpose of providing a safe haven for tigers to replenish their numbers. Numbers increased from 1,827 tigers in the country in 1973 to 4,334 in 1989. It seemed then that the tiger had been saved. Tigers However, over the past five years the parks' tiger population has dropped by 35 per cent because of poaching.. Tiger parts have been consumed as part of traditional medicines in China and Taiwan for centuries. The tiger population in China has been exhausted, so tiger parts from animals poached in countries such as India and eastern Russia are commanding handsome prices on the black markets of China and Taiwan. Due to pressure from the UN and Western conservation groups, the governments in both countries have made commitments to stop the trade in tiger parts. However, Western conservation groups remain sceptical. For instance, the Washington based Environmental Investigation Agency recently found tiger bone in 13 of the 21 pharmacies it checked in Taiwan. The grip of the tiger on the human imagination has meant that many still believe the animal is the source of healing powers. Tiger bone potions are believed to be a cure for rheumatism and to enhance longevity. Whiskers are used to ease toothache. Skin is used as a cure for malaria and infectious fevers. Bones have a number of uses, including relief from ulcers, rheumatism, stomach pain, typhoid, malaria and rabies. In Taiwan one of the more interesting practices is the consumption of tiger penis soup for as much as $320 a bowl in the hope of propping up a flagging libido. Many factors cloud the decision of how best to deal with poaching. The edges of these tiger parks are inhabited by very poor villagers. Middlemen pay poachers from $100 to $300 per animal in areas where an average wage is $1 a day. Clearly the benefits of poaching far outweigh the risks for needy poachers. This clash between cultures on how to treat the tiger as an· endangered species or as a source of healing power is underlined by a mutual fascination with tigers. It seems strange that in the face of this mutual fascination the international community is reduced to standing by and merely watching the tiger become extinct. As an Assistant Secretary of State who leads US diplomatic efforts to help the tiger said: lfthe concerted efforts of the world tiger, what will that say about our ability to deal with more complex environmental problems? Liberal Party",102
211,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I must say I have never really seen the member  tiger, but obviously he has a very strong interest in the welfare of tigers and cats, and for that the House should be grateful. In this adjournment debate I was planning to continue my presentation to the House about the benefit of Hilmer type reforms, but I must confess I have been so inspired by my colleagues the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) that I would like to turn to one of their themes; that is, books about and by the Liberal Party. Over the Christmas break I, too, did a little light reading-light being the operative word. I .picked up a book entitled The Heart of Liberalism, edited by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), who is in the chamber, the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). The day after this was released, the member for Deaand kin lost· his preselection. So this cannot regarded as a volume that held great weight and gravity within the ViCtorian Liberal Party. Nonetheless, having looked at the editors and the contributors, I thought it was a read. Chapter by chapter, backbenchers, prominent and not so prominent, have their go tories. at various policy themes. But I was quite intrigued by the final chapter, which, in the index, was headed 'The future of the Liberal Party'. I thought, 'This is a novelty-a book about the Liberal Party and talking about the future. Who could they get to write the last chapter of the book?' I could not think anyone in the Liberal Party who talks about the future. Then I thought that maybe they would use someone in the recent pastyesterday'S man, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-or go back a bit further to Malcolm Fraser or perhaps even John Gorton. Then I got to the final chapter of the book and found that it was written by B.A. Santamaria! He has contributed to a book, edited by current Liberals, about the future of cannot save the the Liberal Party. What is the future of the Liberal Party? According to B.A. Santamaria-this relic from the museum of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s-the future of the Liberal Party is to oppose globalisation; to oppose women going to work; to oppose the money power, the good old theme about the banks they used to raise during the Great Depression; and to oppose the way in which people are moving off the land, the way in which people have left a simple agrarian lifestyle. What sort of future is this for the Liberal Party? What sort of future is there for the Liberal Party if it is opposed to globalisation? One of the editors, the member for Moore endorses opposition to internationalisation. Are you going to stop the information superhighway? Are you going to rip up the APEC agreement? Are you going to stop the internationalisation of the Australian economy and go back to 'Santa's' old way of simple agrarian people working the land trying to get a wholesome heart and soul into their lifestyle? What sort of future is there for the Liberal Party when Santamaria talks about how bad it is that women are finding work are finding equality in the labour force? be It really is appalling. The idea about the money power is an echo in this place from the Great Depression, when Frank Anstey and some of the old-fashioned socialists of the worth time would rail about the money power backed by the bipartisan support of the old Finally, we come to the crowning glory of the Liberal Party model for the future. It is back to the future; way back in time to the period when people lived out a simple agrarian lifestyle, tilling the soil that was good for their soul; going home late at night for three of hours of Bible study; worrying about those rotten atheists and the rotten communists in far away parts of the world. All this is Santamaria's backward-looking, old-fashioned view about the world. Mr Filing interjecting",103
212,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Moore is interjecting. You have got to be absolutely joking to commission a chapter in a book about the future of the Liberal Party and use Santamaria It confinns everything that people on this side of the House say about members like you and those who lead you: that you have absolutely no conception and do not even have people of contemporary Australian relevance to write about the future of this nation and the future of your party. You are back to the rotten, burnt out Cold War mentality of burnt out figures like B.A. Santamaria. I will tel1 you how relevant it is. The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) is Santamaria's latest protege. You are bringing in the young fogies schooled at the feet of 'Santa'; you are dragging out the old 'Santa' to write the final chapter of The Heart of Liberalism. Have I got news for you! There is no future; no future in 'Santa'; no agrarian socialism; no future in opposing the entry of women to the labour force; no future in raising the old bogey about the money power; and, least of all, no future in this argument about people getting off the land. You have got to be absolutely joking. ... Political History",104
213,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I was going to talk about the filthy corruption of WA Inc. Western Australian Labor governments. I note the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) leaving the chamber. It was during his time as a state secretary of the ALP in Western Australia that we saw the most absolute corrupt behaviour on the part of a state government that has ever been seen in this country. It even eclipses some of the corrupt Labor governments or administrations from earlier in this century. Let me comment on the remarks made by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), one of whose predecessors was the most disastrous Prime Minister that this country has ever seen. Another· of his predecessors was a member of Lang Labor- Mr LazzarinL I mention that because, when he was lamenting or making this statement about the chapter written by B.A. Santamariaitr the book The Heart ofLiberalism, he forgono mention that one of the very people who were bleating back to the Depression when referring to the world banks was one of his predecessors-the member for Werriwa in a past life- Mr Lazzarini, who had been a member of the Lang Labor group. Jack Lang was a mentor to and a hero of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In fact, it was the present Prime Minister who had Mr Jack Lang restored as a member of the ALP. Jack Lang had been expel1ed from the ALP because he had stood candidates against the official ALP candidates. So, when you come here and talk from the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party about blasts from the past, you have got the blast from the past standing right at the dispatch box twice a week-when he is here for the days that he is on-on your behalf as the Prime Minister of Australia.

notice, on 16 November 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations that officers of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) have concealed from the CAA Board concerns raised about the CAA's Safety Regulation and Standards Division. (2) Will he establish a full-scale royal commission into the CAA to replace the separate inquiries being conducted.

(4) Will quality management system standards be implemented in CAA procedures for inspections of Australian aircraft.",106
217,Mr BRERETON,SYD CBD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of allegations made on the ABC's 7.30 Report that safety issues reportedly arising from the Terrell Report were withheld from the Civil Aviation Authority Board by the Authority's then acting Chief Executive Officer, Mr Doug Roser. I am advised that an investigation by two members of the Board's Safety Committee subsequently exonerated Mr Roser. (2) No. I am not aware of evidence that a royal commission with broad ranging terms of reference would produce any new information or facts the present inquiries will not uncover in a more focused way and in a shorter period of time. (3) No. I am advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that it performs sampling checks on aircraft to assess the quality of maintenance performed by Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineers and approved maintenance organisations. The procedures for these inspections fall within the scope of the Authority's Aviation Safety Surveillance Programme (ASSP). All inspections conform to a formal check-list process which is incorporated in the ASSP manual of procedures. This high degree of formality of aircraft inspections is aimed at minimising the risk of human error. (4) Yes. I am advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that its Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation is progressively incorporating the requirements of Australian, New Zealand and International standard AS/NZS ISO 9001 into the Directorate's management .and work practices, including the Aviation Safety Surveillance Programme (ASSP). The quality system requirements of management review, planning, definition of procedures, recording, reporting and analysis are incorporated into ASSP. Additionally, the internal compliance by Directorate staff with ASSP and the effectiveness of the system is subject to independent audit and evaluation by the Directorate's Quality Management Unit.",125
