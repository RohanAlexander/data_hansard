21,Ms LEY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise today to La Trobe. I am surprised to hear the member coalition, about a secret agenda to return the coalition who had a certain view at a certain giant conspiracy theory around the issue of penalty rates. I was listening to the member for La Trobe, coalition policy is attacking the issue of penalty important part of the workplace landscape and not in some way make up for the time spent working unsocial hours. I see this as creating opportunity for the member for La Trobe to clarify it does contradict that of her colleague the stating his concern for the tourism industry claimed: I hope the bench of Fair Work Australia has given this context because I understand that is the I do not know if the member for La Trobe and main streets of their suburbs, of their regional public holiday in areas where tourism should be If so, they would have seen it is a fact tourism outlets cannot afford to open perhaps workers, that people who otherwise might be public holiday are not carrying out that activity. landscape that you must take into account parliament and you must say, 'We need to take concerns that are being expressed to us.' remove penalty rates.

While the majority of trustworthy, honest people who take their role is a reality that criminals will target law access to sensitive information.

One thing about this committee, with it, is that it has always acted in very are carefully crafted, as is the case here integrity measures within its jurisdiction. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law National Crime Authority, which became Australian Federal Police. With the changing mind for some time that that should be widened have access to either sensitive or specific information by serious and organised crime. And that is what those recommendations and enacts them-maybe the committee that the government is acting confidence in the integrity Part 1 of the bill enables targeted integrity exists in state and territory police jurisdictions Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. After having discussions with the various including the Police Federation of Australia Association, their issue was not about targeted associated with, if this was just going to be et cetera, and also it was a reflection on the authorities. Each of the organisations representing integrity testing because, as they indicated, preservation of integrity within their profession This legislation is not something that contravenes not something that is seen to be calling into than those who are suspected of acting in criminal charge attracting a sentence of I think professional standards organisations of the to suspect criminal activity is at play, that standards sections to go out and target and test who represent the police profession, this is corruption in the public sector and we urge the such corruption, which undermines the integrity to protect our communities and our borders. however, we reserve the right to move of the Senate committee when they the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Joint Committee on Law Enforcement on the Australian Commission for Law that the government has picked up these by the committee, as referred to by the at least as long I have been associated much a bipartisan fashion and its recommendations with regard to strengthening anticorruption and Enforcement's jurisdiction initially covered the the Australian Crime Commission, and the pattern of activity, the committee has been of a to encompass other jurisdictions that equally about operations that could be affected the bill does; it responds very positively to not in full but certainly enough to satisfy to do something specific to give greater of our law enforcement agencies. testing. That is something that I know now but to date has been foreign to the Australian organisations representing police officers, as well as the Australian Federal Police integrity testing; their issue was more at random, it could be tantamount to entrapment, level of confidence we had in the officers of those police officers were in favour of targeted the thing they value more than anything is the the application of employee rights; it is question the integrity of specific officers, other such a way that those actions could amount to a it is more than 12 months. This is where the law enforcement bodies already have good reasons this would enable senior officers of professional the integrity of suspected officers. For those seen to be a good thing. It is seen to further support the preservation of integrity within law officers who serve. There was also a recommendation to expand ACLEI oversight. Part 2 of the bill deals ACLEI oversight to AUSTRAC, which is the Centre; to CrimTrac, which is doing vital is being used by all states and territories Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. with them obviously there is a change in the Integrity in respect of his staffing and also wider based agencies.

67,Ms RISHWORTH,CONDOLENCES," This is in essence about fairness. This motion recognises government's refusal to index British pensions living in Australia under the United Kingdom's issue previously in the parliament. It affects and I am pleased to see that government ministers attention of this parliament The 2011 census shows that around 14 per Kingdom. Since I have been elected I have community raise this as an issue. I distributed response from well over 500 local residents. government continues to fail them in failing to discriminatory. As you would know, indexation ensures that same over time, accommodating increases in British government to index the pension payments means that indexation ceases from the point to Australia some years-or even decades-ago the ever-decreasing buying power of their able to keep up with rises in the cost of living or on means-tested assistance provided by The UK government's policy has resulted pensions of more than 250,000 British pensioners stories in my local community and in the broader considerable erosion is having on quality of life to Mr Kenneth Ball of Christies Beach in my while his wife, Frieda Ball, receives £25.27 same amount Mr and Mrs Ball received when 1995. Mr and Mrs Ball feel they are being national pension fund just like every other now, while other pensioners who continue to around the world-have had their entitlements same, the Balls have been denied this. The impact emigrated some time ago. For example, for retirement, the pension at that time was around £100 per week if it had been properly indexed. in making repeated representations to the address the issue of frozen pensions for British Services and Indigenous Affairs for her continued Government, most recently during her meeting of State for Work and Pensions; and recipients of a British pension equitably by fairly to retire, so that British pensioners can receive motion on the indexation of British pensions the significant impact of the British that have been allocated to British expatriates National Insurance Fund. I have raised this many people in my electorate. I will continue, have continued, to bring this to the and indeed the British government. cent of my constituents were born in the United on numerous occasions had residents in my a survey in 2007 and received an overwhelming They said that they believe that the British index their pensions and that this is unfair and the amount received in real terms remains the inflation and cost of living. The failure of the of British expatriates living in Australia of migration to Australia, so those who migrated have been severely affected. As a result of frozen pensions, some pensioners have not been and must rely either on their dwindling savings the Australian government where available. in the erosion of the purchasing power of living in Australia. I have heard many Australian community about the effect this for affected pensioners. In particular, I refer electorate. He tells me that he receives £42.26 pence per week. This is of course exactly the they first became eligible for the pension in treated unfairly, given that they paid into the Briton who is living and working over there. But reside in Britain-and indeed, many countries indexed so that in real terms they remain the is most significant of course for those who residents who emigrated 20 years ago upon £54 a week. That would now have been over One might ask: why is this unfair? These Australia. There are two main reasons why the British pension is unfair and discriminatory. British pensioners paid into the National Insurance a superannuation account than the sort of pension It requires compulsory payments from the salaries pension upon retirement. All British pensioners the same rules. So equity demands that they should now be allocated under the same conditions, Instead, the reality for some British expatriates they deserve, despite having contributed throughout and to the British nation. Second, the UK government's current policy expatriates living in Australia discriminates basis of the country they reside in. Regular increases are made to the pensions of British expatriates United States of America and the European Commonwealth countries, including Australia, means that British expatriates who choose entitlements are less than those of British expatriates the world. They are not, therefore, only pensioners who continue to reside in the UK who have decided to retire in a country which Through our own pension system, the Australian million each year to recipients of the UK supplement the shortfall created by the frozen significant burden for taxpayers, who would living in Australia were given the pension government has over recent years repeatedly frozen pension policy, to ensure that there is country and also to bring an end to this situation meet the shortfall-really created I would like to take this opportunity to been a long-standing advocate of this issue. her meeting with the UK Secretary of State recognise the continuing efforts of Minister the task of lobbying for pensions for British indexed, including by meeting his counterpart what I know he feels is a very strong case for This motion does a number of things. It firstly the effect that it really does have, which is are affected. It also acknowledges the impact does have to pick up the tab when it comes to be recognised. people have, after all, decided to emigrate to failure of the British government to index the First, it is important to recognise that these Fund of the UK, which operates more like system we are familiar with in this country. of workers in exchange for an allocated pay into the National Insurance Fund under should be treated the same-that their pensions regardless of where they choose to live. is that they do not receive the full benefits their working lives both to this scheme of not indexing the pensions of British in its treatment of expatriate pensioners on the in line with inflation and cost of living living in numerous countries, including the Union. But pensions are frozen in most former Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. This to retire in Australia are disadvantaged. Their who choose to retire somewhere else in at a disadvantage when compared with British but also when compared with British pensioners is not subject to the frozen pension policy. government does provide more than $100 pension who are living in this country to help pension policy of the UK government. This is a not have to carry it if the British expatriates they deserve. I know that the Australian requested that the UK government reconsider its fairness for British expatriates living in this where Australian taxpayers are forced to by the United Kingdom government. commend Minister Jenny Macklin, who I know has She has raised this matter most recently during for Work and Pensions. I would also like to Bob Carr, our foreign minister, who has taken up expatriates living here in Australia to be fully in the UK government earlier this year to put this discriminatory policy to be reconsidered. and importantly recognises the problem and widespread, as I mentioned: 250,000 people who that it has on the Australian government, which this issue.

The member for Kingston made mention that the British government in recent years with properly informed by the member for Pearce minister, Senator Jocelyn Newman, made repeated in pursuit of this matter. And so, I guess that, been a matter where there has been bipartisan has been unsuccessful bipartisan support over many years. One of the main responsibilities of government have worked in the interests of the nation. policy over many years. I believe it was the successive British governments have followed obviously.

But I was just then that former Howard government representations to the British government if anything, what we can say is that this has support over many years. The trouble is that it is of course to look after those people who However, the British government have had this Attlee government that first had this policy, and it, to the benefit of the British taxpayer, like previous British governments, has been two or three months ago, I did the right thing: I to tell him that I was going to say some things were not going to be kind. After I made those pass those on to the British government, and he for us to not only be prepared to go on the record criticism of the policies of, in this case, the are aware that their former citizens, those drawing pensions from their country, are inadequacies of British policy with regard Unfortunately, the circumstances of this remain the same and continue to have a negative including a number from my electorate of pensions, the British pension scheme is indexed effect makes sure that, in real terms, the pension This method of indexation is applied to British Kingdom to most other countries. The problem view and the view of British pensioners in honour what is nothing short of an obligation National Insurance Fund. Instead, the pension the pensioner migrates to Australia. The indexation frozen on the date the person leaves the UK pension, whichever comes first. UK pensioners on Australian income support because of the means that the value of the UK pension reduces has not in the past been made. I certainly completely disagree with the calls for the UK government to change that There are some 555,000 British pensioners worldwide, Australia and whose British pensions are contributed to our great country.

The gap is worsening, and the British has been made very clear to me in the past and the President of the British Pensions in pensioners group's autumn 2012 newsletter, estimate that the UK budget is some 3.1 billion many expatriate pensioners living elsewhere, lists as an offset to the cost of re-indexing British Treasury already takes that benefit, resulting a cost to it. So it is both unjust and wrong that support it gives depending on where its pensioners live. It is clear that the British pensioners are cost of living rises the inequity of their situation back in 2008 from Mr Beyfus, who served in his armed service as well as a 20 per cent disability a back injury.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate acknowledge the contributions that these people pensions rather than letting the taxpayers of their obstinacy.

Pensioners are struggling to costs are rising and the pension remains the pensioners are right in the middle of this. This through conversations with Shirley De Andrade Australia group, Jim Tilley. From the British one statistic really stands out, and that is the pounds better off in 2012 as a result of so which the British Pensions in Australia group their British pensions. It is disturbing that the in its perception of re-indexation as being the British government is varying the level of highly motivated on this issue, and each time the becomes worse. I remember hearing a story the Royal Navy and received a small pension for pension for that same service as a result of those pensions are indexed, yet he took the age pounds that he got then has not moved since. It is better off in indexation were paid. So it is a Australia to top up the UK pensions while not my view that the British government should have made to their country and index their Australia and other countries pick up the cost for is something that has bipartisan support. It is not that we all agree on on behalf of our Kingston in calling upon the UK government to and have continued to ignore for many years. It is is about time the British government got on with strong support of the honourable member for for bringing this issue before the House by way to but for her ongoing advocacy on this matterin 2007. She has spoken on this matter before by on 15 September 2008. So I thank her for her the UK pensioners across Australia. themselves in this situation, and they and their me. It is an almost incomprehensible situation when, in other countries that UK people have have taken up residence, they get it, but in they do not. So it just does not seem to I also commend Australia's ongoing efforts it should be the other way round. The UK Australia spends around $110 million a year who have become needy as a result of their rescind the policy. From what I can read, ever of those issues on which Australia has made representations. Foreign Affairs raised it with his counterpart, year, the Minister for Families, Community with the UK secretary of State for Work and Pensions. In the House the honourable member for Lyne She answered-and I am paraphrasing-that the Kingdom's policy of not indexing pensions Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, reside, to be unfair and discriminatory. I think people, has said either privately or when speaking really unfair and discriminatory. Who can forget the case of Mrs Annie Carr 2012. The article was titled: 'The 100-year-old a week'? It is unconscionable. Thank goodness which can cover that. I would like to put a few things on the being run by the International Consortium of British to resort to having to lobby on this issue, paid into a whole range of things and paid … 4.4% of pensioners … have their state pensions to mainly Commonwealth countries or when they have to those countries before retirement age. … Nearly 5.3% of pensioners … who emigrated countries, have their pensions indexed annually, Why can't it happen here?

This is a weak Prime Minister and a sold its soul to the Greens and is held captive rid of this government. The Labor Party needs a long one. Australia cannot afford to have government that is at war with itself, because another day that it is not focused on The coalition have a better way.

In those 90 years, debt. It was just $16 billion worth of debt in Hawke-Keating government actually increased amount each year for the next five years. So in 1996. So what took us 90 years to achieve, debt by that amount every year for the next five years. Of course, then we were elected. We had to government in 1996, just as Campbell Queensland and just as New South Wales have to do it again because not only have we passed government; we have actually gone to $167 million every day. I know a lot of people get confused and do million and a billion. We all know it has three difference between a million and a billion can 12 days but a billion seconds is 34 years. certainly worth a lot more than a million dollars. But this government do not seem to understand debt and they continue to hold out to us this surplus. They have not delivered a surplus government has delivered a surplus. I have every day Labor spends obsessing about itself is the real concerns of the Australian people. under the leadership of Tony Abbott will that Australians want a government that will want a government that can stop the boats. that keeps its word, lives within its means and happen should Tony Abbott become Australia's misogyny debate. We know that Tony Abbott is He has three daughters. He has a loving wife. I women. But this is the Labor way. They have through this so-called misogyny debate. We all is infamous for what he did during the Tony to debt. That is the Labor Party history. 90 years of this Federation, from 1901 to 1991, wars and a few other skirmishes in Malaysia, are very expensive to run and fund. We also and all the bureaucracies that came with it. We than had ever happened before, and we thank this country accumulated $16 billion worth of those 90 years. But for the next five years, the that 90 years worth of debt by the same we went from $16 billion in 1991 to $96 billion the Hawke-Keating government increased the to take the hard decisions when we were elected Newman has got to take the tough decisions in had to take the tough decisions. We will have the $96 billion that Labor left us when we took billion, and our debt is going up by about $100 not really understand the difference between a extra noughts, but, as I like to say to people, the be shown by this equation: a million seconds is That is the difference. So a billion dollars is the difference.

Regrettably, the electorate that I live in that is hardest-hit by losses on gambling machines. Victoria, three are in the city of Whittlesea. the influence of one of the big two supermarket Woolworths, through its ownership of ALH hotels, low-income areas, and three of these venues Plough Hotel in Mill Park, the Excelsior Hotel yearly losses on electronic gambling machines order that I read them out, is $20.2 million, that is not owned by Woolworths is the top venue Scullin. It is the Epping Plaza Hotel, where amount to over $21 million. I apologise that I will be using a lot of statistics illustrate my case. The total losses on electronic of which the southern end is in electorate of MCEwen, was $102 million in the year 2011-12. when the losses amounted to $94.9 million. gambling machine in the city of Whittlesea, the average amount lost was $152,000, to $164,000. period, the average Victorian loss per electronic $101,000 to $100,000 while the average loss Whittlesea increased from 2008-09, when it words, there was a 10 per cent increase in throughout Victoria remained static. If we compare the losses on gambling machines losses on machines in Victoria as a whole over it went from $79,500 per machine to $79,400 machine in Victorian clubs over the same period the evidence points to the fact that the machines hotels. But my concern is that, whilst they have been throughout Victoria, we have seen this great hotels in the city of Whittlesea. a proportion of citizens who think that freedom Problem Gambling traditions of a democracy I respect the right of and I will leave it to those who have listened and that most of what he said is codswallop. what I am grieving about is something that in the name of freedom-that is, gambling and, and represent is one of the electorates in Australia Of the five top hotel-gambling venues in I regret to say that part of my grievance tonight is chains, Woolworths, in this industry. has the five biggest gambling venues in are in the electorate of Scullin. They are the in Thomastown and the Bundoora Hotel. The at those three hotels in the year 2011-12, in the $18.6 million and $18.5 million. One hotel venue in Victoria, and it is also in the electorate of the total losses on electronic gambling machines here, but I think that I have to use them to gambling machines in the city of Whittlesea, Scullin and the northern end in the electorate of It had therefore increased from 2008-09, If we look at the average loss per electronic we see that it had increased from 2008-09, when What intrigues me is that, in the same gambling machine in hotels decreased from per gambling machine in hotels in the city of was $181,000, to $198,000 in 2011-12. In other Whittlesea over the period while the average in clubs in the city of Whittlesea with the period that I am talking about, we see that per machine, while the average loss per decreased from $71,000 to $69,000. So all on which the most money is lost are in the able to keep that at a static rate on average increase of 10 per cent over the period in the My concern is that in the city of Whittlesea, forum that has operated with membership including of the agencies that work with problem gamblers. results, I am sorry to have to report to the community groups have decided that enough because they just do not see the value in achieve results. The final straw was when, support organisations suggested to the representatives put a cap of $200 on withdrawals at ATMs in no agreement to even look at it. That was the with the Responsible Gaming Forum was that represented. Woolworths did not play a part in the forum. What then concerns me is that, if we contrast coalition about this issue, the coalition has analyse what the member before me was speaking freedoms and that people should be able to go and then go out into society and do all sorts losses. If they have to rob from a car to feed exaggeration, and I do not wish to base my something that the problem gamblers themselves through electronic gambling machines is something legal. So to those that say we are a nanny should be mandatory limits that people have say that this is state interference-I would existence because of actions of the state, responsibility of the state then we are denying individuals, the costs to their families and I think that it is about time that we step upset one point of view the most, and that we do.
