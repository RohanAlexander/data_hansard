1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Johns, for Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for Thursday, 2 February 1995, being as follows, unless otherwise ordered: 1. Members' statements. 2. Grievance debate (at 9:45 a.m.). 3. Notic;es and other orders of the day, government business (at 11 a.m.). 4. Questions without notice (at 3 p.m.). 5. Presentation of papers. 6. Ministerial statements, by leave. 7. Matter of public importance .. 8. Notices and other orders of the day, government business.",11
2,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The motion before the House is a relatively standard measure. Essentially, it makes up for lost time for private members' businesf5, and obviously the coalition supports the proposal. As this motion also refers to questions without notice being at 3 p.m. today, it is opportune to note that, under the new arrangements for question time in the lower house in the federal parliament, today is one of those days when, I believe, both the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister (MrKeating) are on their rostered days off. Quite frankly, this is a classic case of the new system failing to work. The system fails to provide the proper opportunity for the people of Australia, through private members, to bring this government to account. It is quite extraordinary that, the day after the . Treasurer waltzed in here and dropped a bombshell revealing the enormity of Labor's economic mismanagement, these guys are on rostered days off-part time. One would think it was a public holiday in the Treasurer's office and the Prime Minister's office. They ought to be in here to respond to the genuine questions that the Australian public want put to these them. They should not be cowered, off hiding in their bunkers, attemptBUSINESS ing to avoid proper scrutiny. It is our responsibility to put questions to the governmt'lnt, Orders and it is its responsibility to respond. I believe there ought now to be a full reconsideration of this whole arrangement. It is not good enough. The Prime Minister ought to be in here to take questions from the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I think most people are going to say, 'He has got to be chicken if he is not prepared to face up to the resurgent John Howard leading the opposition. ' We want to know, for example, the extent of expenditure cuts. We want to know whether Telecom is going to be privatised, instead of the bumbling answer we had this morning. We want to know what KST-Keating's sales tax-is going to be. We want to know how big tax increases are going to be. We want to know whether people are going to be slugged with income tax increases after having had promises made to them before the last election-promises actually being legislated as the law of the land. We want to know whether those promises are going to be broken. There are a lot of questions which we ought to be putting to the government today, and it ought to be man enough and have guts enough to come in here and answer a few simple questions about its economic mismanagement. The fact is that Australia's economic situation has now reached crisis proportions, and these guys do not have the common decency to come into the chamber and account for their gross economic mismanagement. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister being merely part-time holders of those offices is a fiasco. Soon they will not be part time; they will not be holders of those offices at all. By the time we get to the next election they will be ex-holders, with a bit of luck. The reality is that they ought to be here today. I hope that this fiasco of these people not being prepared to front up today will encourage people to support a change in question time arrangements so that ministers who are under pressure are required to turn up. When the changes were introduced, we were told until we were black and blue that if a minister was under pressure that minister would front up to question time and that the new procedures for question time would not be used as a barrier, as a means of putting up a shield to protect ministers from the proper scrutiny of the parliament. It is not good enough. I challenge the Prime Minister to front up today and answer a few basic questions. I also challenge the Treasurer to front up today and answer a few basic questionsnot to scurry off and hope for a pleasant time in a radio interview in Sydney and thereby avoid public scrutiny. It just shows the extent of panic-'P' for panic--on the government side. After the Prime Minister did the John Laws show yesterday, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), was on the same program to answer a few questions. The Prime Minister was in such a state of panic that he got on his car phone after leaving the radio station to complain about the fact that the opposition had something to say about his disastrous economic management. If ever I have seen a Prime Minister go over the top, that was a classic case. To get such an over-the-top reaction from the Prime Minister reveals the extent of panic, chaos and confusion on the government side about economic management. This is clearly not good enough. We object in the most strong terms about the government's continuing failure to account to the Australian people. The government treats this parliament with absolute contempt. When it treats this parliament with contempt, it treats the Australian people with contempt. In a democracy it is ultimately the government's responsibility to the Australian people to front up and answer a few basic questions. I challenge the Prime Minister and Treasurer again: front up today; do not be chicken and stay back in your offices; do not attempt to cower behind these new arrangements for parliamentary question time. If you front up today in question time, you will get a few decent questions.",11
3,Mr FILING,Unknown,"The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and I were dissenting reporters within the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, About time: bills, questions and working hours, in relation to the changes to sitting hours and the rostering of ministers. As the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has clearly elucidated this morning, it is clear that this system is not working properly, particularly in a week where there is no sitting Monday and where effectively the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will turn up for question time one day in the week. It is time that this matter was reviewed as a matter of urgency. The new procedures prevent the opposition from being able to properly represent the vast number of Australians who want clear and concise answers from the people within the federal government who hold the most responsible positions. As the member for Flinders clearly elucidated earlier, we want to hear from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in relation to the comments he made yesterday. We spent a considerable amount of time discussing how this particular process would work. I note that the Chief Government Whip, who is also a member of the committee, is present. I am sure he would agree with us that this whole process was designed to be an experiment. It was designed to be a trial to see whether there was some means of making the parliament, particularly the House of Representatives, work more effectively. The changes to the sitting hours-which, in my view, have worked reasonably effectivelyand the introduction of the Main Committee, of which I was an early critic, have turned out to be a success. The changes which came out of the historic report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, which the government responded to, have proved to be a failure. As the member for Flinders has said, it is time to have this matter reviewed. It is totally unsatisfactory that my constituents, back in Perth, who want answers to these important questions are unable to get them because those ministers with important responsibilities, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, are not present in question time today to answer them.",12
4,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"MoncriefÂ±) (9.39 a.m.}I rise to support the remarks made by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the member for Moore (Mr Filing), I do so also in my capacity as deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure. As the member for Moore indicated, he and I put in a dissenting report to the report entitled About time. At the time. I had a great feeling of unease regarding what was afoot. I think that unease has been more than justified by the way things have transpired. Along with the member for Moore, I was one who had worries about the Main Committee. I would say now that it is working quite well, not least because it is doing more than the report actually recommended. It is looking at things like reports. I hope that one day we might get ministerial statements back into this place, instead of ridiculous answers to questions which are pseudo ministerial statements. Those statements could be debated in the Main Committee,too. But that is a side issue to what is going on here. The. report About time took a great deal of members' time to write, in terms of meetings of the committee and informal meetings with other people. There were some worries about a roster, on principle, but we decided to recommend a trial. However, there was a very clear understanding that if there was an issue running that was important to the Australian people and that involved a minister who was not rostered on a particular day, upon request by the opposition, that minister would attend question time on that non-rostered. day. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) took that report and totally perverted it. He used selected parts of the report as a way of trying to emasculate this chamber. I am one who would like to see it a little less macho, but emasculaProcedure tion is something else. In doing so, he has betrayed his position of trust with the Australian people. This chamber is about the Australian people; it is not about prime ministers, leaders of the opposition, cabinet andÂ· shadow cabinet, and individual members of parliament. It is about giving the people a voice. If governments cannot be properly questioned in here, then the people have no voice. As the member for Flinders said, yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Willis) dropped a bombshell in here. He virtually made a ministerial statement. He certainly announced government policy in relation to tax. Then he scurried off and will not come in and answer any questions on it today. The Australian people want to know what this is about. What is going on? Have they been lied to again? Th-y need the detail. They want the information. It is not good enough that any government, whatever its colour, can pick and choose in this way. I have said previously in this place that I come from a state in which the state parliament was perverted-it is not much better now, I have to say-not least because it lacked an upper house; it lacked any chamber of review. That was the doing of the Labor Party. The Liberal and National parties, when they came into government in 1957, gave the Labor Party a bit of the stick that they had been getting under the Labor Party's gerrymander prior to 1957. It was a pity that the opportunity was not taken to make parliament work better, because in the end it was the people of Queensland who were betrayed. When you get a government that believes it is invulnerable to the people-not to the opposition in an election but to the people in an election-then it starts to treat people with contempt, and corruption is an absolutely inevitable flow-on. I have said a number of times in debates in this place that I grieve to see this chamber of this parliament apparently taking a leaf out of the book of Queensland. It has an appalling parliamentary history under all governments. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is getting daily more arrogant in his treatment of issues. The Prime Minister's treatment of the Committee report, and specifically his treatment of the issue of question time, reveals an arrogance that has been seen before in Australian history when it has had disastrous consequences for the Australian people. We in this place are entitled to know what the government plans for the people. Question time is, of course, the most important way of achieving that. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer hiding from their responsibility for telling everybody in Australia-through this chamber-what is going on is just an example of a government in decline. It is for that reason that I have riSen to speak most earnestly and seriously on this subject. The minister who will be responding is a newer minister, and also from Queensland. I know he has brought a fresh perspective to his position, but I hate to see younger ministers put in the position of having to defend the indefensible. When the Procedure Committee reviews the changes that we made last year, I hope that we might be able to do something about this problem. I wish to put on the record that earlier this chamber. year I put down a notice of motion seeking a review of those changed standing orders relating to question time. That action was fairly unusual in that it was done without reference to the committee because the government had left the committee inoperative by not appointing someone to replace the previous chairman-the former member for Hindmarsh, who was appointed to London as our High Commissioner-so we could not meet and elect a chairman. I had a fear that unless someone took some action the committee would remain inoperative. The Prime Minister had got what he wanted out of the committee-a report recommending some changes that he wanted-but he perverted the recommendations which sought changes that he did not want. That is why I as an individual took the unusual step of putting down that notice of motion. The committee now has a chairman, and a good chairman, and we will be undertaking a review. But this matter should not wait for the review, as the issues here before the parliament yesterday and today are major ones. Reviews take several months, and we want action today.",13
5,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I have no problems with the basic adjustments to private members business. The Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Mr Reith) indicated that he would have no problems with them either. But the fundamental areas addressed by other honourable members are problems that we as members have to address. The area that concerns me the greatest is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in looking at the process of question time, has chosen through the system to be in the House for only two days a week. Frankly, I think he should be here more often. For the Prime Minister to go outside and do radio interviews when the House is sitting-that is, to g-t media coverage-instead of being in here at question time to address the issues that the opposition and members of the government are concerned about is totally out of order. I believe there needs to be another look at the way question time is functioning and at the number of days the Prime Minister is in this The reality is that when the Prime Minister and other ministers are in here answering questions they really have the upper hand. As can be seen at any question time in this place, ministers can provide broad-ranging answers, giving them the upper hand in that situation. So there is no disadvantage for the Prime Minister or for any other ministers when they come into this place. The advantage for all members of this House would be that we would have the opportunity of questioning any particular minister on any particular day. The fundamental democratic process in this country is designed to make sure that people are represented and that those in key positions-prime ministers and ministers-are in fact accountable. The only effective way to do that is to ensure that they are here whenever possible to be questioned on issues that, people see as being of importance and significance. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) referred to the fact that some of the comments that come out in answers to questions reallyÂ· should be part of an economic statement. We understand why economic statements are not often made these days: by making an economic statement, the government is providing an opportunity to the opposition to respond, whereas in question time we do not get that opportunity. The fact is that yesterday some of the comments made went to fundamental changes in the economic condition of this country, but the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will not be here today to answer questions. That really indicates where we are now in this place. The situation is urgent: we must look at what has been done by the Standing Committee on Procedure and address these issues to enable not only the opposition but also the Australian public to call the government to account for some of the things that have been done and are being done. People come in here with various grievances. All you need to do is look around this building at the current time to see that the people in the timber industry have grievances. Ministers will be in the House on certain days for question time but not on others. Yesterday we questioned the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), but there will be days on which we will not be able to question him in this House. We really need to go back to the process that was in place in the earlier part of the government's term in office, whereby all ministers were present for question time all the time. The accountability process in this House is falling apart.",14
6,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe) (9.51 a.m.)Quite frankly, my problem with the motion today is that it just does not go far enough. is an absolute nonsense that only half of the government front-bench is here at question time when there are important issues before the nation in respect of which the Australian people need answers. The member for Flinders (Mr Reith) earlier pointed out to this House that this government is a government in chaos. Not only is the government in chaos; it just does not care any more. It has lost the plot. It has no interest in the issues with which it needs to deal. Yesterday in question time the Treasurer (Mr Willis) dropped his bombshell-$26 billion worth of debt. He has no mechanism to get us out of debt; he does not care. He will address it in the budget in May, perhaps for some action in July at the start of the new financial year, or perhaps in January 1996 or January 1997. We will then address these important issues. The banana republic foreseen by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is now apparently with us. So where does all of this debate regarding the failed Australian economy take place? We debate these issues outside the parliament. I have said on previous occasions, and I repeat, that the House of Representatives is no longer a house of representatives. It is becoming irrelevant to the polity of Australian life. The government treats us-the members, the representatives of the people of Australia with absolute contempt. Bill after bill comes into this place and is rammed through the House and taken off to the Senate. Who listens to the debate of members in this place? Only us, I daresay. The government is not interested in debate; it is not interested in learning about where its policy might be wrong, where it might be bringing Australia unstuck. No, it has got its agenda. Those in government have their small, fixed interest groups and they are going to continue to play that line to achieve the best they can in order to keep them in their cushy jobs. Then they are not even bothering to show up at question time. The front bench is only half filled with people. Today of all days is a day when we ought to be questioning the Prime Minister, the It Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) about what they are going to do about the economy of this country. What are they going to do for the poor long-suffering people of Australia who have had a fiveminute break from the worse recession this country has known in decades? Once again we are headed into economic gloom. Why are they not going to be here? Because the Prime Minister does not want to have to stand at the dispatch box and face the questions from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He does not want to face the member for Bennelong, because he is likely to come out of his tree again and then be perceived by the Australian public in an unfavourable light. So they hide the Prime Minister away in his office and let him have a nap every day. They hide him away from the timber workers, They hide him away from the conservationists. They hide him away from the people who are deafened by airport noise in Sydney. This place is surrounded by confrontation. Every day we have another one of the Prime Minister's special interest groups creating another demonstration. Not only do we have chaos but we have massive confrontation. Australian society is becoming confrontationist because of the very nature of this Prime Minister and the nature of his government. I repeat: this motion does not address the real problem; it does not go far enough. I call on the manager of government business, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), to bring back to this place the original.schedule for question time and to present to the public all of his ministers ready to answer questions that the public of Australia wants answered.",15
7,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"If this place were a battleground and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were a military officer, he would face court-martial for cowardice in the face of the enemy. The fact is that this country faces grave economic challengesinterest ratesÂ· have gone up dramatically imd taxes are about to rise. Where is the Prime Minister? He is not here. He is giving false and evasive answers to the people of Australia outside this parliament and no answers inside this parliament. Quite frankly, that is a disgrace. We all know that the Prime Minister not only faces grave economic challenges but also faces a grave political challenge because he is facing a Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)-every bit as tough, every bit as experienced, every bit as cunning as the Prime Minister, but far more decent and far more honest. Why is the Prime Minister not in here to face him? What is the problem? Is he scared that questions about his own financial dealings, questions about his mansion in Woollahra and questions about his economic management will come back to haunt him? I can understand that fear, but the fact is he should be here to master it. We all know how sensitive this Prime Minister is. Not so long ago, when proceedings in this house were first televised, he rang up to abuse a television station, not because of what the television station had said in its commentary but because the television station had dared to focus on the back of his suit-it was rumpled! The $1,000 Italian suit was rumpled and our dear Prime Minister could not cope with thafat all. Do you know what the real problem with the Prime Minister is? This Prime Minister thinks he can dominate parliament. The fact is he has been able to dominate parliament only by abuse. The Prime Minister loves Irish history. Let me give him a little bit. Henry Grattan, the famous Irish parliamentarian, once stood up in the Irish parliament that existed between 1780 and 1800 and said to an opponent who had just abused him in most unparliamentary language, 'Your problem, sir, is that you are incapable of being aggressive and parliamentary at the same time. Before I have finished, sir, I will show you how to be simultaneously severe and strong.' That is what the opposition can do now-we can be strong without. being abusive. So I say to the Prime Minister: come into this House and face the music. At a time when the rostered day off is thankfully dropping out of the Australian workplace culture, we do not need a Prime Minister who takes a rostered day off every time the pressure gets too much for him. At a time when part-time work is becoming more and more common in our economy, thanks to the failures of this Prime Minister, the last thing we need is a part-time Prime Minister. He should come back to this House and work full time on the difficulties of our nation.",16
8,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister. Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service MattersHlO.OO am.)-in reply-l guess that When an opposition has been bleeding to death for two years and the blood finally stops flowing you feel pretty good about it. I have to remind those opposite that the body is dead. Those opposite are finished; they have bled to death over two years and it is all over. But then the opposition comes in here on a motion which gave its members a grievance debate. Do you realise what the motion is about? We have given your members a grievance debate. You do not think we are denying them one, do you? We gave your members 45 minutes on Thursday for a grievance debate. You have just taken your grievance debate. You have just used it up, in a sense, so you are going to have a double whammy. The motion says that Thursday will give you a grievance debate. It seems to have taken most of you by surprise that we are still in the midst of a rostered question time system. The rostered question time has been going since February last year. If you have a look at the motion for the Procedure Committee in the Notice Paper today you will see that the committee's current inquiry-and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is deputy chair of that committee-is a review of procedural changes operating since 21 February 1994. The Procedure Committee was the committee that discussed the question and agreed to a rostered question time. That is the proper place in which to debate the issue which those opposite have been debating this morning. For the last 30 minutes you have been wasting this parliament's time. You can debate this matter in the Procedure Committee. You have the deputy chair of the Procedure Committee. The honourable member for Moncrieff can call a meeting of the Procedure Committee and have this debate. It. was not until this morning, when we offered you 45 minutes of grievance time on Thursday, that you chose to raise the question of a rostered question time. Why did we change to a rostered question time? Because both sides of this House realised that nearly all questions went from the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister. That was a concern to all members of the House, especially backbenchers who are sick to death of question time being simply a game of pingpong between a Leader of the Opposition and a Prime Minister. It was the backbench who determinedMr Leo MCLeay-They won't give their backbenchers a go.",16
9,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"They won't. They allow the Leader of the Opposition to have a monopoly over questions. The backbench on both sides of the parliament said, 'We would rather have a position where we could question the ministry more broadly.' There are 30 portfolios, and over two-thirds of those sit in this House: Your side wanted the opportunity to question all the ministers, and yesterday you were happy to do that. But you are angry today that, somehow, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) may not be available. The Treasurer's major statement was made yesterday in question time and you were available to question him. You had the opportunity to question the Treasurer yesterday, and you will have the opportunity again on Thursday-as you will the Prime Minister. The opposition, in conjunction with the government, determined that there ought to be a rostered question time. It is still a matter for review in the Procedure Committee, of which the opposition has the deputy chair and half the members. It has been sitting there for review for 12 months and you have chosen not to do anything about it. Today, in a panic, you took the opportunity to suggest that you want to have some debate about a rostered question time. This matter has been sitting on the notice paper for 12 months. Mr Reith-What is your view?",17
10,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"I am happy with a rostered question time. Do you know why I am happy? I am happy because you can question all the ministers in this chamber, and that is what you wanted. You wanted a system whereby you could question more readily all the ministers in this chamber. The purpose of the motion, which the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) supported, was to give backbenchers on both sides of the parliament a grievance period on Thursday, and that is what you have got. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA House Committee Membership Motion (by Mr Johns)--c--by leave-agreed to: That Ms Crawford be discharged from attendance on the House Committee, and that, in her place, Mr Cunningham be appointed a member of the committee. National Crime Authority Committee",17
11,Mr CLEELAND,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I present a discussion paper by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled Asian organised crime in Australia. Organised crime in the world today is endemic and growing. The joint parliamentary committee has determined to present to the parliament a paper looking at one aspect only of this growth in organised crime, and we looked specifically at what we describe as Asian organised crime. I do not want this paper to be seen as a particular attack on one group of people in the world-it is not. It arises from the interest in the murder of a New South Wales state member of parliament and the media interest in the associated criminal elements which may have been involved in that matter. Organised crime is a perfect example of capitalism. It is, in its purest form, the classic economic model of capitalism. The only difference between organised crime in its capitalist form and legitimate business is that organised crime is unregulated. There is no regulation whatsoever. It operates in the perfect market, in that it has demand on call. Demand for illegal drugs throughout the world is extremely high. Organised crime in the perfect capitalist sense, the economic sense of the term, operates to supply the demand marketplace. Today organised crime is structured in the way that corporations are structured. Some organised groups are so highly structured that they have boards. The tragedy is that, despite the best attempts of governments throughout the world-and I look at the United States in particular, where some $US40 billion has been spent in South America in an attempt to control the crack cocaine and cocaine tradethe simple fact is that the drug supply is increasing. Sadly, the supply of pure heroin in world marketplaces is increasing. I recently returned from the US, and heroin is now being grown by the South American cartels. We now have the Asian cartels and the South American cartels growing heroin and infiltrating world marketplaces with that increased Paper supply. I will give the House an example of the severity of this problem. Last year in San Francisco the narcotics people seized three tonnes of pure cocaine. That is a massive supply of pure drug. The results of that seizure were monitored over a three-week period, and the price of cocaine on the streets of America did not move. That tells us, of course, that supply is greater than demand. It also shows that we can seize three tonnes of pure cocaine, and it has no effect on the marketplace. That is not to say that we should not in this country, or indeed around the world, maintain an attack on organised crime. It does mean that we need to look more carefully at the way we handle the problem. In Australia, as in other countries, we have in the Asian sense various Chinese groups, usually referred to as triads, Vietnamese groups, and Japanese groups, commonly known as yakuza. There is some evidence of infiltration by Korean groups. Perhaps from the Australian perspective the most frightening thing is new organised crime groups, arising from the remnants of the old KGB, now known as the Russian mafia. They are very close to our shores in commercial terms, and I think that presents another new frightening front for us to tackle in regard to organised crime. Each of the groups mentioned in the discussion paper is firmly established throughout the world. The Chinese groups, in particular, have histories going back thousands of years. There is a lot of debate about whether the Chinese triads are structured in the way that some people perceive them to be. There is debate about whether they are more loosely organised groups that have legitimate commercial interests as well as dabbling in some criminal activity. Whatever may be said about that, the simple truth is that Australia faces an increasing attack from heroin supply within our country. From my perspective, even more frightening than heroin, which is a depressant, is the increasing emergence of crack cocaine. There is no doubt whatsoever that the most frightening drug available in the world today is crack cocaine. For those who do not know, crack cocaine is simply a mixture of baking powder and pure cocaine baked in a country microwave oven to produce a rock-like substance which can be smoked. cheap. You can buy what they call a rock on the streets of the United States for around $US 10. It is endemic in the United States. was recently told by various narcotic groups in the United States that the level of violence in the United States doubled in the 10-year period since crack first appeared on domestic marketplace in San Francisco 1985. It is said by the people I have spoken to the United States that crack addicts become insane. They are wild and uncontrollable. That is because crack and cocaine are stimuin lants, unlike heroin, which is a depressant. Crack raises the level of activity in the person taking it to heights which become uncontrolan lable by that person. Even more frightening is the level of violence which is becoming associated with the international drug trade. the United States I was told by every organiIt sation I spoke to that they are totally outgunned. They are trialling new weapons the United States, but they do will ever be on top. The challenge for us as a parliament and us as a country, in my view at least, is that we must spend more money on education. My view is that we cannot, no matter what we do, control the supply coming into our councontribute try. Supply throughout the world has never been stopped, despite the billions of dollars that have been spent trying to control it. Despite the best efforts of the United Nations, particularly the United States and South America, supply is increasing. If we do tackle the demand market-that is, if we do not educate people on the inherent dangers all drugs as well as illegal drugs-then will not win the fight. I think it is time this country and this parliament recognised that very simple fact. I ask members of this parliament to read this report. It is put forward to the parliament for information. I think every politician has real duty to learn about the major problems this country faces. They are not going to away. I hope the media has a good look and disseminates factually the problems this is facing with the increased infiltration of organised criminality. I commend the It is very report to the House.",18
12,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-My comments on the tabling of this discussion I paper entitled Asian organised crime in Australia relate to a number of important areas. The most important area is in the first part of the report and is the comment about the how the amount of information provided in publicly by Australian agencies contrasts unfavourably with that produced or provided in in overseas countries. For example, the discussion paper we have produced draws on the wide range of publicly available information the United States on Asian organised crime. In Canada in recent years the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has published annual report on organised crime. The report gives an overview of the extent of organised criminal activity in Canada and In highlights significant events during the year. is based on information provided by the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada. There in is no Australian equivalent to the Canadian not believe they annual report. It is the view of the Joint Committee on the for National Crime Authority that the Australian public is entitled to be given more information about the extent of organised criminal activity in Australia. Such information will to a more informed debate about how much the community needs to spend on law enforcement efforts to combat such activity and will assess the effectiveness of the agency's charge with that task. One of the side effects of a less informed public is a not tendency for stereotyping in the media of some of the people that are alleged to have of been involved. I think that is an unfortunate we side product of a less informed Australian that public. Unfortunately, in the case of the media, in some instances there is not sufficient expertise or depth of research undertaken before these articles are written to make sure that the public gets a balanced and a accurate picture of exactly what is going on. As a member of the committee, I have go indicated some serious concerns about some of the responses that have occurred since the publication last year of the Report of the review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements--quite a significant report. That review was undertaken to examine the Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements in their entirety. A number of recommendations were made as a result of the review. Amongst those recommendations were some changes to the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority, for those who are unfamiliar with it, is the body formed in the early part of the 1980s to come to terms with a serious increase in organised criminal activity within our nation. I suppose during the evolution of the National Crime Authority it was made perfectly clear in parliamentary debates that, because the authority had some very significant extra powers given to it by the legislation, it should be properly scrutinised by the parliamentaryjoint committee. The authority should be able to be properly overseen by the members of the committee. In the period from 1984, which was establishment, all the way through to more recent times-involving the appointment of former chairman, Justice John Phillips, to chairmanship of the National Crime Authorithat ty-the committee encountered a level of it secrecy that made it very difficult to perform its important function of overseeing activities of a very powerful body. Now, unfortunately, we are faced with a different problem. Because of the changes that have been recommended in the Report of the the review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements, we are seeing some changes the way in which the NCA is organised and the way in which it conducts its activities, particularly the activities regarding the positioning of NCA and Australian Federal Police. A menu of investigative areas was proposed in the review report, and it has been taken by the Commonwealth law enforcement board as something that the NCA should undertake. I have some very serious concerns about independence of the National Crime Authority, which is in my view a very important factor in its ability to properly undertake the important national battle against crime throughout the nation. That independence allowed the authority to undertake inquiries free, to a large extent, from the sort of political argy-bargy that occurs on a day-today basis within Australia. It allowed the National Crime Authority to undertake very important long-term investigations, of which the discussion paper into Asian organised crime is relevant. . This discussion paper, which is not a report on the National Crime Authority but a paper produced by the committee which does not attempt to representthe views of the authority at all, outlines the activities of three particular Asian organised groups within Australia They relate to Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese organised criminal activity within Australia. As has been indicated by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland),Â· there is plenty of interesting material in this paper for the information of all honourable members. I think that theÂ· most important facet of the its changes being proposed for the National Crime Authority is the retention of its core independence. I am concerned because of the the way in which these changes are being made the NCA will become emasculated; that will lose its ability to properly operate and properly direct its attention to the key areas the of organised crime within Australia. Earlier, I mentioned that part of the task of the committee is to look at, for instance, where money ought to be spent. I will give House some examples that 1""'ere raised in a Western Australian newspaper in late to December last year. Recently, the General Manager of the Geraldton Port Authority, Laurie Graham, admitted that it was almost coimpossible to police the movement of drugs and other illegal activities in and around the big bustling port of Geraldton. Recently, the authority asked the Australian up Customs Service to go halves in a $250,000 camera surveillance system, which would have given it an eye down every wharf in the Geraldton but, according to Canberra, $125,000 was too much. Even the offer by the authority to use now and pay later was denied. Police believe that, in the past tW9 years, more than $100 million worth of heroin has come through an area within a 100kilometre radius of Geraldton - and that is what they know of. Clearly, $100 million worth of drugs is an enormous amount of profit and stimulus for organised criminal activity, and that sort of nitpicking over $125,000 is very hard to understand. Western Australia, which has a large coastline that stretches 12,500 kilometres, is very vulnerable to the importation of drugs from South-East Asia. The report looks at some aspects of the importation and distribution of heroin and other drugs within Australia. I want to dwell on one particular aspect of recent developments. The National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police, in a joint venture, co-hosted a conference in November last year in Sydney on Asian organised crime. I was able to attend one of the days of that conference, and I must congratulate those responsible for what was an excellent conference. It came up with a number of conclusions onÂ· the nature and extent of Asian organised crime. I will run through that particular list but, before I do, wish to make one comment in relation to government policy. One very important facet of the ability to combat organised crime is communication, which includes the exchange of information. I am aware that there is considerable concern about the Australian government's policy that, in cases of people being charged with a capital offence in countries which have capital punishment-particularly those in South-East Asia, I imagine-information sought from Australian law enforcement agencies will not be forthcoming. That presents a very significant problem. Understandably, those who have concerns about the death penalty would be concerned about Australians contributing towards people being given the death penalty in other countries. If we looked at the use of the death penalty in our region, I imagine we would find that the place people have the most serious concerns about would be the People's Republic of China, where it is alleged they quite frequently resort to the death penaltyÂ· with alacrity, sometimes in cases of quite moderate offences. But the problem is that building an effective network to combat organised crime within our region-and we are a part of the region and we are affected by our proximity to the region, as we can see from just that one statistic from Western Australia-and preventing as a matter of government policy the free exchange of information about suspects who may be involved In networks of criminal activity within and outside Australia are clearly going to impede our ability to combat organised crime. For instance, a case may exist whereÂ·an offender has been charged with a capital offence and there are co-conspirators within Australia. However, because of that particular policy-which is a conscious decision by the Australian governmentinformation that may lead to the more efficient arrest and destruction of that particular criminal network would not be exchanged. I raise that point because it is something that really needs to be re-examined by the federal government. If we are going to have an effective criminal intelligence communicaI tion network within our region, that information ought to be freely exchanged. The constraints that have been imposed by the Australian federal government are impeding our ability to be able to stop such things as the . $100 million worth of heroin coming into Australia via Geraldton. I think that ought to be considered as a matter of importance. Finally, I will read the conclusions of the conference, which I think are important. They are as follows: 1. Organised crime is a major international phenomenon requiring a coordinated and dedicated international response. 2. To make a meijningful assessmentÂ·of future trends in organised criminal activity, it is essential that organised crime be viewed in the international <;ontext and the totality of the organised criminal activity. 3. As new economic and business opportunities are created in many countri-s, so the opportunities for the involvement of organised crime increase. 4. Organised crime must be understood as a serious threat to the fundamental human rights of citizens of all countries. 5. Law enforcement agencies need to understand and attempt to anticipate the ability of organised criminal groups to continually adapt to change by exploiting opportunities to expand into any profit-making activity. 6. The 90s offers an environment of greater diversity, interactions and partnership between organised criminal groups and an environment of unprecedented mobility and internationality, of unprecedented variety and profitability and potential for power. 7. Although Asian criminal groups do not tend to be formally structured and hierarchical in nature, as other criminal organisations like the La Cos a Nostra, the impact of the criminal groups can be just as severe. 8. At present the principal threats posed by Asian organised crime come from manufacturing, importation and trafficking of illicit drugs, money laundering, illegal immigration, extortion, commercial crime and counterfeiting, loan sharking and violence. 9. A significant common strategy of Asian organised criminal groups is to induce fear of reprisal into victims, thereby discouraging reporting crime and giving evidence in prosecutions. 10. As competition between organised criminal groups increases, power struggles are likely to be replaced by mergers to capitalise on resources, maximise profit potential and counter increased sophisticated investigation techniques. 11. Law enforcement knowledge of the extent of Asian organised crime is limited by the extent to which Asian communities have trust in those law enforcement agencies. That last point is very important. It is a of considerable concern to law enforcement officers and to members of Australian-Asian communities throughout the nation. I am aware of a particular problem in Western Australia which has a very signifiKeating) cant community. It is something that all coalition members at some stage ought to focus their minds on. Because of our proximity to the region, we are faced with probably unprecedented explosion of organised criminal activity, particularly centring around the manufacture and importation of drugs, that have known. If we look at similar examples in the United States and elsewhere, we see that the ability to be able to combat that pervasive criminal activity is limited in the first instance to extent to which the law enforcement are resourced and, secondly, by the ability of the communication exchange of information and, as I just mentioned, the confidence of people in the community in the law enforcement agencies to empower our law enforcement agencies in Australia to be able to work effectively. I commend the discussion paper to the members of the chamber and, of course, to all parliamentarians. As we face vastly changing times, this paper will become historic to the extent that it raises some very important matters that are likely to have a significant effect in our community in the future. NA (ORIGIN LABELLING) BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 January, on motion by Ms MCHugh: That the bill be now read a second time.",19
13,Mr CLEARY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Last night, when I was cut off-I thought rather rudely-I was exploring the question of whether 'Buy Australian' campaigns and origin labelling could in any way challenge or ameliorate the effects of globalisation. If we commit ourselves to trade in the dishonest GA TT World Trade Organisation mould we commit ourselves to a progressively deregulated paradigm, to a model which diminishes the nation state's power to protect and develop matter key industries and manage its economy. The great paradox about the coalition's attack on the government this morning is that it essentially supports the government's policies. Quite rightly, the Prime Minister (Mr should be in the House. But the has to be joking if it thinks that its commitment to free trade policies will in any way have any effect on the economic probthe most lems we face at present. The World Trade Organisation has no interest in instituting notions of fairness or we mutual benefit in trade relations. It is an organisation controlled by the USA, and a lever by which certain markets will be prised open to serve the interests of the big players-we have discovered that with APEC and the the situation with Japan, which will be there agencies to solve the US deficit. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in his speech yesterday cited the 142 occasions between July 1993 and March 1994 when food imports breached Australia's food safety or standard requirements. Where in the grand World Trade Organisation scheme of things is there a clause to outlaw or attend to this kind of practice? Social clauses are decidedly unwelcome in World Trade Organisation rules. Social clauses are decidedly unwelcome for most members of the coalition. Of course, in World Trade Organisation matters there will sometimes be talk about human rights. There will be talk about human rights in Cuba. Various countries that want to get into certain economies are very selective about human rights. There is not so much talk about human rights in Indonesia, for example. The honourable member's solution is for Australians to buy locally. The problem is that if your industries are decimated there be nothing to buy. Surely the actions of the United States show how dangerous an uncritical commitment to free trade can be. We need to ask the GA TTophiles whether, in the wake of the US government's decision to subsidise dairy products exported into Australian markets, they are prepared to rethink their commitment to so-called free trade. We need to ask this parliament whether it is prepared to rethink its commitment to free trade because we are so obsequious about it. The truth is that it is actions such as these and the plethora of tariff and non-tariff barriers, not the inadequacy of labelling laws, that explain why Australian goods are hard to find and Australian industry under so much pressure. If you ask average shoppers what it is like trying to find something truly made in Australia, they will tell you that it is becoming more and more difficult. What we need to think about-and what the government and the opposition should explain-is how we can put more Australian made goods on the shelf and how we can develop import replacement industries. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), to his credit, recently purchased a suit produced by the Wisco company in my electorate of Wills. I congratulate him on his very fine choice of fabric and his support for local industry. Unfortunately, as members of this House know only too well, consumer imports continue to increase. Between 1989 and 1993, consumer imports increased by almost 50 per cent. Tim Colebatch in the Age on Saturday, 13 November 1994 described the trend this way: The rising volume of consumer imports has been driven largely by low cost imports of cars, clothing and other goods replacing products formerly made here. Rapid tariff cuts have accelerated the trend. But, of course, you cannot talk about tariffs in this place. According to Colebatch's figures, in the September quarter alone the value of food imports was up 17 per cent on a year ago, imports of cars were up 24 per cent and clothing imports were up 22 per cent. When the Treasurer (Mr Willis), or one of the new right wingers on the make, crows about elaborately transformed manufactures, will he never talks about the loss of jobs that imports have created in these fundamental industries. Even the figures on the elaborately transformed manufactures are being questioned today. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) yesterday appeared to have a bob each way on the trade and labelling issue. With his usual passion, he castigated the Americans for subsidising their dairy industry but still extolled the virtues of adapting to the modern world as though it does not bring severe hardships locally and does not require sophisticated policies. Whereas the member for Wide Bay implied that origin labelling legislation was a means of combating free trade, the member for Gilmore, if I understood him correctly, was arguing explicitly that it was our greatest weapon. I think it is a tall order. Yesterday and again today the Treasurer has been flagging attempts to cut import expenditure, an increase in interest rates and an increase in indirect taxes because of the current account blow-out. Privatisation will be well and truly back on the agenda for the Labor Party. This is the response to the consequences of globalisation and free trade. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), another right winger, would say to people who talk another way about controlling imports, such as through tariffs, that they are putting in indirect taxes and that they are punishing working people. Then he says, 'But mobile phone charges are down; they are a lot cheaper.' That is Labor Party talk today. The right wing Labor Party members talk about mobile phones as if they serve the interests of working people, but they scream about tariffs and claim that that is an indirect tax on working people. Yet the Treasurer will have to institute indirect taxes, unfair taxes on working people. Let us see what the right wingers in the Labor Party say about those regressive policies when they are put on the table by the Treasurer. Although origin labelling legislation is GA TT friendly at present, there is no guarantee that it will be in the future. There are some who argue that origin labelling, like labelling designed to outlaw goods produced with child labour, is a form of protection. We hear this talk. We would not be surprised to see such issues on the GATT agenda in the future. While the honourable member for Gilmore expressed his support for Australian industry and Australian goods, he chose not to address the real issues raised by those wanting to see the legislation tightened and improved. The crucial question of whether goods which acquire their essential character or qualities Australia deserve to be classified as 'Made in Australia', was not really addressed. All the anecdotal evidence and all the empirical research suggest that people generally believe that the term 'Made in Australia' is more akin to 'Product of Australia' as defmed by the legislation. That must surely be a matter of concern to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh). I appreciate. and understand the problems that the minister faces in producing a comprehensive origin labelling bill. It is generally understood that any classification of g()ods according to origin can produce anomalies and sometimes appear to disadvantage particular goods. Nevertheless, it seems that the community favours a labelling regime which provides an unequivocal explanation as to the origin of those goods. Instituting an education program to transform people's perceptions of what 'Made in Australia' means, I find hard to fathom. It is certainly a laborious way of solving .the problem. The fact that labelling creates some anomalies is something that I think we have to live with. We need to be concerned about it, but there is a line that has to be drawn. To allow the term 'Made in Australia' to include goods which are not truly made in Australia is an anomaly in itself and a complete misnomer. The ACTU and the Food Policy Alliance are right to argue that 'Made in Australia' should be replaced with 'Manufactured in Australia', a classification which would include the origin of the imported ingredient. The minister argues that replacing the 'Made in Australia' classification with something like 'Manufactured in Australia' would be very costly and would result in the export of jobs. I find it hard to see why a simple change of label of this kind would result in jobs being exported. No-one else in the House ever worries about jobs being exported, but I think it is good that we are talking about it for once. The minister may have details as to why jobs would be lost; however, I have not heard them. Other government members who have argued this line have also not provided any kind of detail as to why this would be the case. The quality of the government speakers in on this issue, I think, with all respect, was pretty ordinary. Some of them did not even talk about the issues. I do not think they had read anything about it or even knew what the issues were in this particular legislation. If the classification 'Made in Australia' is so important and has a significant status in the community, it is highly likely that most companies will make the effort to source locally in an attempt to qualify for the 'Made in Australia' category and win the confidence of the community: It is worth noting that many local organisations are now establishing precise import component databanks, including comparative pricing, in an attempt to help companies source locally. I know that on the 'Made in Australia' versus the 'Manufactured in Australia' question the minister would respond by saying, for example, that, as we do not produce cocoa, Australian made-or should I say Australian manufactured-chocolatecould never qualify for the premier category. Personally, I do not have a problem with that. If we are going to have an education program, it could include information to explain these particular kinds of anomalies. ALP members who have spoken on this bill have declared their support for accurate labelling laws in Australian industry, yet have generally refused to address the proposed amendments - amendments supported by the ACTU. The member for Lilley (Mr Swan) yesterday cited Voxon phones-phones which are assembled in Australia from, I am told, essentially imported materials-as an example of a product which would be discriminated against under the ACTU supported amendments. Why should phones which are not essentially Australian made qualify as Australthe Ian made? Let us get Australian made phones-fair dinkum ones. What we should be doing is developing an industry policy which facilitates the production of high quality items such as mobile phones. This would be preferable to deceitful legislation which enables imported goods to hide behind the Australian made symbol. As Peter Roberts argued in the Australian Financial Review on 22 November 1994, it is interventionist industry policy which has enabled our competitors to develop high-tech industry. Roberts is right. We do need to identify and nurture specific new industries. This, not the member for Lilley's version of virtual reality, provides the means by which we will be truly able to label high-tech goods as 'Made in Australia'. It is ridiculous for members of the government to claim that there is no validity in the proposed amendments. With all respect to the minister, who quite clearly understands the intricacies and implications of the legislation, most government speakers have barely touched on the amendments. Most members of this House have no qualms about putting the blowtorch to the underbelly of the manufacturing sector when multinationals demand access to Australian markets, yet when it comes to adopting strict and accurate guidelines as to the origin of goods some members immediately jump to the defence of importers. If, as many members seem to be suggesting, origin labelling is the last bastion of economic nationalism, then we should produce labels which tell the truth, enable people to purchase in a way which supports local industry and encourages manufacturers to source locally. The amendments proposed by the ACTU, the Food Policy Alliance and the coalition are a step in the right direction. To classify something as 'Made in Australia' when the intricate technology or the components themselves are a product of another market is the antithesis of an industry policy or a commitment to Australian industry. In the last two days of discussion, origin labelling has emerged as the panacea for our import and industry problems. That is what most people are talking about. That has been kind of talk from all over this House. People have been saying that this is a way of actually getting Australian goods into houses. Minister, that is what they have been sayingunless I have not heard them correctly. I will have to go back through the speeches to see whether I misheard them. I think origin labelling is important. It is a bit sad if that is the only way we can develop a serious industry policy. But if we are to have origin labelling-and serious origin labelling-then I think the amendments as suggested by the coalition and supported by the ACTU and the Food Policy Alliance are exactly right. Make them tight and encourage Australian industry and manufacturers to source locally and to win the support of the Australian community.",22
14,Mr NEVILLE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The debate over the new scheme to govern labelling of domestic goods claiming an Australian content, as contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bi111994, has been a long time coming. Since the bill was first introduced into the chamber on 23 March 1994, it has been subject to two government working parties plus House of Representatives and Senate inquiries. In that time, a whole range of groups, including farmers, food processors, unions-and, importantly, consumers, the intended target of the legislation-have condemned the government's approach to the country of origin labelling. The member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), as shadow minister for consumer affairs, gave a long list of organisations at the beginning this debate yesterday. While the government and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) should be applauded for seeking to tackle the very lax labelling laws we have in Australia, unfortunately they have forgotten or deliberately overlooked what this legislation should really be about-that is, truthful, honest and unambiguous labelling. We have had highlighted during this debate plenty of examples of how the current country of origin labelling laws, or the lack of them, have caused great confusion and uncertainty for consumers and have had serious consequences for local industries and firms seeking to compete with the tide of imported goods, especially in the food sector. Concerns have been raised in regard to imported Canadian pork being processed into ham and bacon in Australia and sold as 'Made in Australia'. A lot of pork producers in Monto in my electorate have suffered because of this. Imported orange juice concentrate is being blended in Australia in various proportions and sold as 'Made in Australia'. I point out that there citrus producers in my electorate as well. Imported peanuts become 'Made in Australia' peanut paste: In the adjoining electorate of Wide Bay there is the greatest peanut growing area in Australia. Some peanuts are grown in my electorate for that production. Another example I refer to is that of imported snow peas. Snow peas are also grown in my electorate; the producers are screaming out for vengeance. We had hoped that the government's proposed new labelling laws would restore the faith and confidence of both Australian producers and consumers. Instead, if introduced, they will create even more confusion and uncertainty, to the detriment of the economy and many small businesses around the country. The coalition's amendments are all about restoring some certainty and clarity to the country of origin labelling. Under the government's bill, the 'Made in Australia' terminology was created and actively promoted by this government, with over $15 million of taxpayers' money being spent to date. We are now going to spend three-quarters of a million dollars over two years, less the of amount required for the bureaucracy, to convince the public that it means something else. It has been pointed out overwhelmingly in this debate that 'Made in Australia' is perceived by most Australian consumers to relate to products, especially food products, that are grown and processed in Australia. I say to the minister that the whole thing is about perception. In one part of her legislation she tells us about kangaroos, koalas and Australian flags creating a certain perception and that they must not be used falsely on labelling. But 'Made in Australia' is overwhelmingly considered by Australians to have a perception level that is quite different from what she is trying to achieve in' this bill. The CSIRO national nutrition survey that has been quoted already found that 98 per cent of people agreed that food should not be labelled 'Australian Made' unless it was grown and processed in Australia. A national Coles supermarket survey, also quoted, found are an overwhelming preference for Australian made over imported products amongst Australian shoppers. The survey found that 94 per cent of grocery shoppers preferred to buy locally made goods; a further 67 per cent of shoppers nationally believed that Australian food products offered better quality.' than imports; and 71 per cent of the respondents said that they would buy Australian even if the imported product was slightly better in quality. As well, 57 per cent would buy local product, even if the imported product was 10 per cent less expensive. I quote the General Manager, Marketing, for Coles Supermarkets: Shoppers like to buy Australian as they are aware of the economic effects on job creation and the development of our manufacturing and rural sectors. If anything, then, this whole debate has highlighted the success of at least one government program-the 'Australian Made' campaign, which has been running for eight or nine years, and which has obviously rammed home to consumers the meaning of 'Made in Australia' and the benefits of buying locally. Yet the minister wants to destroy all that good work. Under the government's legislation that is. before us today, 'Made in Australia' could include products of largely imported origin, totally distorting consumers' perception of the term. 'Made in Australia' is relegated to the back seat when it comes to these new labelling laws. The coalition amendments, however, will seek to change all that and restore some truthfulness to the meaning of 'Made in Australia'. The coalition amendments seek to put 'Made in Australia' back on a pedestal. 'Made in Australia' and 'ProductlProduce of Australia' would be synonymous. These terms would refer to products for which Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and all the operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. We would create a second category known as 'Manufactured in Australia' which would include all goods which acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. This group could include products with a larger proportion of non-Australian ingredients or components than the first category. I ask the minister: why will he not spend his three-quarters of a million dollars trying to get that message over rather than confusing in the public mind something which has already happened? To those on the government benches who might say, 'What is in a word?', we in the coalition who have been listening to farmers, food processors and consumers say that there is plenty at stake in this word, or in this group of words, and in this debate about terminology and the use of labelling laws. Let me give a few examples where these factors apply in practice. The first involves a story of regional development, a success story about a value adding initiative in the small crop sector in the Bundaberg-Childers district of my electorate of Hinkler. It has been undermined by the ambiguous country of origin labelling laws as .proposed by the government. A consortium known as the Childers Processing Group is moving into the final stages of test marketing a range of value added products based on locally grown tomatoes, avocados and mangoes. This group has set out to produce a range of products including tomato pasta sauces, pizza bases and tomato juice, avocado paste, guacamole mixes, mango slices and chutneys. Within two years the group will produce over 3,000 tonnes of value added product, and these will be worth somewhere in the vicinity of $5 million to $12 million, creating employment for some 60 people in the area. Initially it is intended to focus largely on the domestic market, but already the group is looking for exciting export opportunities in South-East Asia, to which, I mjght add, it already exports fresh tomatoes from the same farms. However, under the current lax labelling laws the group must compete against imported tomato concentrate from countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Italy and now China which is looming as a major producer of the future. Under the government's proposed new labelling laws which we are debating here today these tomato paste products based on imported concentrate could continue to be labelled 'Made in Australia'. The minister cannot say, 'That will not happen because we will have qualifications on it,' because I am saying to the minister that some of these pastes may be turned from a paste, say, into a pizza mix-in other words, they will attain their essential characteristics in Australia and therefore will not be subject to any qualifying notation. However, under the coalition amendments we would not allow such misleading labelling as we believe, like the overwhelming majority of consumers, that 'Made in Australia' should mean exactly what it says. Consumers want to know that they are buying a truly Australian grown and processed product like those produced by this small crop producing plant in Childers, and that in doing so they are helping to produce a regional economy, an emerging Australian business and creating local jobs. As one of the entrepreneurs behind the Childers Processing Group, Ron Simpson, told me, members of the group, like many small businesses around Australia, have invested a lot of their own money and energy because they have confidence in their product and their industry. So too have governments, both Commonwealth and state, invested money and resources in helping to foster and develop these companies through various business assistance programs. Having done all this, if the government then fails to get its labelling laws right, if it fails to get truth in labelling so that the .local product can get a fair go and be easily identified on the domestic market with a clear comparison between it and the cheap imported products, then, to quote Ron Simpson, we have all missed the plot. In a way,. the government's thrust runs contrary to the spirit of the vast array of government departments and agencies promoting value adding and ultimately export. Many countries will stop at nothing through subtle and not so subtle methods-all be they nontariff methods-to stop our products from entering their markets. . Yet the government baulks at the simplest measures to enshrine the terminology 'Made in Australia' so that it clearly reflects the public perception that goods so labelled are Australian grown and produced. Processors like Ron Simpson, about whom I have been talking, do not want protection; they do not want tariffs of artificial trade barriers; they realise the realities of this post-GATT era. What they do want is a level playing field, which can be achieved through fair, honest and effective country of origin labelling. A matter which speakers in this debate yesterday did not refer to, but which I would like to touch on today, relates to snow peas. Snow peas are an Australian product which suffers from the vagaries of perception and marketing. I recognise that this is not solely a labelling problem. There are three dimensions to it. The first is anti-dumping, the second is quality, and the third is perception and, indirectly through that, labelling. Australian grown snow peas, as anyone who has eaten them will attest, are of the highest quality. They are grown efficiently with strict chemical control, in many cases under integrated pest management regimes, and are conveyed to the market promptly by high speed, specially refrigerated transport. To produce the Australian product costs around $5.50 a kilogram. Yet an inferior Zimbabwean product can be retailed-not wholesaled-at $4 less than the Australian product. The economic rationalists might say, 'That is stiff; they will just have to put up with it.' But I say to the minister and to the parliament that there is a twist to this. The first dimension to the problem is anti-dumping. It is difficult to accurately determine the actual cost of production in a developing country and, for that reason, actions to introduce anti-dumping legislation on snow peas have largely been unsuccessful. All actions thus far have failed. The second matter is that of quality control. There is anecdotal evidence of concern about chemical residues in the imported product. Again, I will not dwell on that point. The third matter is that of marketing and perception. Zimbabwean snow peas are landed in 2Y2-kilogram cartons marked 'Product of Zimbabwe'. I have no hang-ups with that. But the public does not buy snow peas in 2Y2kilogram cartons. The trouble occurs when people see them in loose trays in the supermarket, where they put them in the bag themselves. How is the snow pea purchaser to know that this is not an Australian product? However, if the public is well informed with truthful labelling, over time the quality comparison will become obvious and the Australian product will be bought. As of February 1992, the National Food Authority's Food Standards Code required that, with the exception of New Zealand produce, all bulk displays of unpackaged lines of fruits, nuts, fish and vegetables carry the country of origin delineation. Yet when I go into a supermarket and see attractive displays of bulk unpackaged lines, I would not know whether the dried apricots came from the Riverina or from Turkey, whether the dates came from the Middle East or somewhere in Australia, or where the snow peas came from. The Food Standards Code has been adopted under state and territory food laws and the states and territories are responsible for its implementation. But in many instances it is not being implemented. Whether the bill in its final form is the government's model or the coalitionlDemocrat amended model, it is essential that it is policed and policed properly, both at the trade practices level-what we are talking about today-and at the implementation level, when it gets down to the states. It is one thing to have a marvellous bill, rich with definitions, but if it does not translate to the end product at its point of retail sale then the exercise is fruitless and a grower like John Woodall, a snow pea grower near Bundaberg, suffers and possibly goes out of business, taking a quality Australian product with him. So the country of origin labelling legislation before us today has at stake not only the future of snow pea growers or the Childers processing group and its 60 future employees but also the viability of hundreds of other similar small businesses around Australia. Launching the 'Australian Made' month last October, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, noted the benefits of the 'Australian Made' campaign. Quoting research from Queensland University's Department of Economics, Senator Schacht said: For every one million dollars expended in Australian industry, 30 jobs are created or retained $280,000 is generated in taxes and charges: $231,000 in welfare payments is saved and $255,000 in purchasing power becomes available. He went on to say: For its part the Government has recognised the benefits that buying Australian has had for industry. Why then is the government looking to fail industry by pushing ahead with confusing and ineffective labelling laws that have been rejected by nearly all sectors of the economy? It is not only the people I have quoted from Childers and around Australia, the other groups referred to by the shadow minister and member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) yesterday, those in the unions, business and manufacturing who are demanding better labelling laws; it is also Australian consumers. The facts speak for themselves, as the latest research update from the 'Australian Made' campaign notes: consumer research indicates that three in five consumers consciously seek Australian brands over imports, representing a steady increase from just 41 per cent in 1988; comparing buying behaviour from state to state, Queenslanders prove to be the most effective supporters of local products, with almost 90 per cent opting for Australian made products over imports; and, when it comes to shopping habits, almost two-thirds look for the 'Australian Made' symbol of the gold kangaroo on the green triangle and make a similar check for the words 'Made in Australia'. This whole debate simply boils down to truth and honesty in labelling and marrying 'Made in Australia' to the overwhelming perception in the Australian marketplace. The government has had its chance to get this legislation right, but in its typically arrogant approach to policy development it has rejected the pleas of many groups, including its own trade unions and more particularly consumers, and conceivably has put nine years of promotion and the work of two inquiries at risk for the sake of what might turn out in the final analysis to be just a grubby excuse for a double dissolution. We in the coalition will not water down the 'Made in Australia' label, and I hope the coalition's proposed amendments will be supported when this bill goes to the Senate.",25
15,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"in replyAfter nearly two years of public debate, two inquiries by parliamentary committees, and I have lost count of how many opposition spokespersons on this issue, the opposition has shown in this debate that it still does not understand what origin labelling is all about and what consumers have asked for. Consumers want an end to confusion: a simple understandable method of identifying Australian goods. This requires definition in legislation. The opposition has been misled by a campaign designed to confuse by arguing over which words to use. Further confusion has been brought into the issue because this bill is not about the whole export-import debate; it is certainly not about any problems with AQIS as mentioned in the shadow minister's press release; and it is certainly not about those problems that can only be dealt with by the National Food Authority. The opposition claims industry support, as well as that of consumer groups and unions. I will deal with all of that. Unlike the opposition's proposal, the bill mlmmlses confusion to consumers and disruption and cost to industry by keeping the existing law on the meaning of 'Made in Australia'. Where Australian workers have been employed to transform components which come from Australia and overseas into new goods, these goods can continue, as now, to legitimately claim to have been made in Australia. The bill gives a number of other benefits to consumers and ensures that where goods are labelled 'Packed in Australia' or 'Assembled in Australia' the source of components has to be identified. Where goods say that they are 'Designed in Australia' they also have to carry information about where they are made. Where flags or maps or words implying Australian origin are used, there must be information about the true origin of the goods. It is interesting that members of tion have had very little to say about any of these elements of the bill. Those opposite have spoken about only one aspect of the bill. They want 'Made in Australia' to mean all Australian; to be a category A term along with 'Product of Australia' and 'Produce of Australia', and they therefore risk losing the good elements of the bill. Those opposite propose to move amendments to achieve this end and to introduce the term 'Manufactured in Australia' for goods which, in the language of the bill, acquire their essential character qualities in Australia. I am, of course, very pleased that the opposition has at last accepted the essential character test as being the only legitimate mechanism for determining Australianness. The argument has moved beyond proposals about percentages of ingredients and similar dead-end mechanisms to now being a debate about what to call a good that has obtained its essential character in Australia. It is quite clear from everything that those opposite have said that the opposition has been captured by one element of the food lobby. They only ever talk about food. However, the views they are putting forward do not even represent the views of the food industry as a whole, let alone of the rest of Australian industry. Take, for instance, theÂ· following comments in the November newsletter of the Grocery Manufacturers Association: The Federal Coalition's stance on origin labelling in which it seeks to differentiate between the tenns 'Made in' and 'Manufactured in', has been widely criticised not only within the processed food industry but also by broad industry groups which can appreciate the massive relabelling costs involved. Concerned at the implications of such a 'senseless' position-as one Liberal Shadow Minister described it in the Senate Committee report-the GMA, the Food Industry Council of Australia, the Confectionery Manufacturers of Australasia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are among industry groups which have called on the Opposition to review its position. The Grocery Manufacturers Association is the same group that opposition speakers have been claiming as being among their strongest supporters. Let met also quote from material used by the Confectionery Manufacturers the opposi- Association on 3 November: . . . the CMA supports the Government's proposal, it being a sensible proposal when compared to the more restrictive options being floated. The CMA goes on to talk about the opposition's proposal by saying: The logic of adopting non-dictionary definitions to separate the meaning of 'Made' from 'Manufactured' is mind numbing. The CMA intends to continue its campaign to pressure the coalition to support the government's bill as it stands. or In a letter to the then Leader of the Opposition dated 17 November the Council of Australian Food Technology Associations states: ... the Government's Bill will, with suitable publicity, allow consumers to distinguish in a very simple manner, between products that are wholly Australian and those that are made using some, or all, imported ingredients ... The Coalition's amendments, on the other hand, will make the issue more complex by introducing a third expression in a manner that is confusing and contrary to dictionary definitions and customary use of those expressions. Also in a letter to Mr Downer, when he was Leader of the Opposition, dated 4 November the Food Industry Council of Australia urged the opposition to think again about its amendments, describing them as 'both impractical and illogical'. The letter went on: The Coalition's proposal ... makes little sense and will we believe lead to greater confusion for Australian consumers as well as leading to costly labelling changes for Australian manufacturers. Adding to this confusion, some Australian manufacturers may not be permitted to use the term ""Made in Australia"" but at the same time, may be able to display the ""Australia Made"" green and gold kangaroo symbol ... The modifications suggested by the Coalition send the wrong message to Australian manufacturers. The Opposition should be encouraging manufacturers to value-add in Australia, not giving them reasons to move offshore. This letter was signed by the Food Industry Council of Australia, the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia, the Confectionery Manufacturers of Australia, the Australian Soft Drink Association, the Ice Cream Association of Australia, the Council of Australian Food Technology Associations, and the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia-so much for industry support for the opposition! These and many others who are outraged by the opposition's amendments are in good company in thinking these proposed amendments irrational. The shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, is of like mind. I quote from her comments in the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs: It just seems senseless to accept the Food Alliances' claim that the public see ""Produced and ""Made in"" as synonymous and, therefore, change ""Made in"" to ""Manufactured in"" to try emphasise the difference between Category Category B; to then turn around and introduce another ambiguity by allowing ""Made in"" to describe Category A and ""Manufactured in"" describe Category B. Additionally, the use of two descriptors (""Made in"" and ""Product of') for Category A adds an unnecessary complication which reduces the key elements of simplicity and thereby undermines the effectiveone ness of any labelling system. So says Amanda Vanstone. Similarly, can imagine the confusion when there are goods labelled both 'Manufactured in Australia' 'Australian Made'? I really hope opposition members are listening to this bit because many have talked about the 'Australian Made' campaign, which this legislation is designed to support and which their amendments will undermine. Obviously, many of the goods licensed to carry the Advance AustraliaMr Truss interjecting",29
16,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Listen to this. For once, listen to the words. Obviously, many of the goods licensed to carry the Advance Australia Foundation's green and gold logo, which says 'Australian Made', would not qualify to be able to say 'Made in Australia' under your amendments. They will be labelled both 'Australian Made' and 'Manufactured in Australia' but it will be illegal for them to be labelled 'Made in Australia'. Not surprisingly, Mr Norm Spencer, who until recently was the executive director of the 'Australian Made' campaign, has written to me, saying: I write to express my continuing concern over the Democrat's and the Coalition's proposed amendments to the country of origin labelling Bill. I am alanned by the fact that their recommendations for change run totally against the Government's commitment to the Australian Made Campaignand the commitment expressed by many members oppositeby threatening to change the meaning of the Australian Made symbol, thereby undennining the credibility of the campaign. The fact is that the proposal you are putting Policy up would undermine the 'Australian Made' in"" campaign in this way. Many thousands of the to 68,000 goods now licensed to carry the green and triangle and the gold kangaroo would have to A and be delicensed because they would not meet the newall-Australian test. The 900 to 1,000 to jobs created annually by this scheme would be jeopardised. That is the answer to the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) onjob exports. I am amazed that the opposition seems to have taken the view that Australia has only industry-the food industry. It only ever talks about food. The member for Indi (Mr you Lieberman) seems to have recognised the problem that the opposition amendments and would cause. He understands perfectly the problem of chocolate. He says that, while so chocolate actually needs cocoa to be made here, it should be able to be labelled 'Made in Australia'. So he suggests there be an exemption for chocolate. But what about an exemption for tyres, where you import a slab of rubber and Australian workers turn it into something new? What about an exemption for shirts, suits and all the other clothing for which fabric has to be imported? When will you stop exempting to support Australian consumers and industry? The opposition just does not have a clue. The member for Indi also mentioned misleading labels on vacuum cleaners that are only assembled here but have labels claiming they are made here. Many examples were given by members of the opposition. This is already illegal and the Trade Practices Commission should be notified in all such cases. Our legislation will make such illegal practices even harder to sustain. I now address the concept that the public consumer groups and unions all oppose this legislation. Every meeting I have had with consumers or with unions has been extremely satisfactory and none of this opposition has been expressed to me after those meetings. I made it quite clear many times, and the opposition has acknowledged this, that I would sit down and talk with anyone who has a problem with this legislation. I have done that many times and that offer still stands. I am very happy to sit down and talk with people, especially if they have been misled by the misleading statements that have been peddled and are still being peddled about this legislation. It is not in the ambit of this bill fix those problems relating to food and the problems referred to by the shadow minister for AQIS. Let us go to the research that is constantly being cited by the opposition as showing that the whole of Australia thillks that I am wrong. There has not been one piece of research produced yet to show that the Australian public thinks that 'Made in Australia' means what the opposition says it may mean. The only research Quadrant has done has been on food. There is also the sort of research that was done in programs such as the ABC's Investigators or Australia all over. After listening to Mr John Corboy on the radio the farmers were misled. In all those cases people were told that orangejuice made with imported concentrate would be called 'Made in Australia', which this bill specifically prevents and which is currently illegal. People were told on the Investigators that somehow I would allow tainted tuna to be called 'Made in Australia'. That was allowed to go on the television and was even used in evidence by the Food Policy Alliance, I think, at a Senate committee hearing. After that sort of information is given to the public, people are asked to ring in and say what they think about it. The Quadrant research, which is so often quoted, was totally on food; there were no questions on shirts, suits, tyres, hardware or any of the manufacturing industries in Australia. Mr Truss-What's wrong with food?",31
17,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"There is nothing wrong with food. The first and second questions included the words 'when purchasing food products'. The third question asked, 'Do you believe it is acceptable to allow food products ... ' The fourth question asked, 'Do you purchase food products . . . ' Question five asked, 'Why do you purchase ""Made in Australia"" food products?' Every question was in relation to food. Even so, what was the result of the Quadrant research which you have kept asserting proves one thing? A substantial proportion of people-47 per cent, nearly half-are under the misapprehension that 'Made in Austra,lia' means 100 per cent Australian ingredients. to Most of Australia, in other words, even on food does not think that 'Made in Australia' means 100 per cent Australian ingredients. That is the research you quoted. The CSIRO survey too referred only to food. Interestingly, despite loaded questions and the fact that the Quadrant research was commissioned by SPC, less than half of the respondents, as I have just said, agreed that 'Made in Australia' meant 100 per cent Australian ingredients. Of course the government is also concerned about the labelling of food. We are well aware that consumers are most concerned about this issue. This bill is setting the baseline for labelling for all Australian products. The Trade Practices Act is an act of general application and the government has no intention of introducing a scheme that will satisfy the particular demands of one industry, which can be met by the National Food Authority; by disadvantaging all others, especially when there is already a sophisticated cooperative scheme in place that makes decisions about the labelling of food. There is no reason why the argument cannot be put to the National Food Standards Council that peanut butter made from imported peanuts must be labelled 'Made in Australia from imported peanuts' . We certainly agree with that. Thus the concerns of the peanut butter eaters of this nation will be satisfied without costing the plastics, the chemicals, the clothing and all the other manufacturing industries of this country millions of dollars in needless relabelling costs. Consumers can always buy peanut butter labelled 'Product of Australia' if they want to be absolutely certain that the peanuts were produced here. Governments have to consider the interests of all parties: consumers and the Australian industry as a whole. We have talked to the food industry. We have also talked to the plastics industry, the chemicals industry, the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the pharmaceutical industry. Do not keep saying things which are simply the opposite of the truth. The Executive Director of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Council of Australia wrote to the Australian Financial Review earlier this year: Australia's fashion textile, clothing and footwear industries have no choice but to import components because a large range of crucial imports are not produced locally-for example, Australian fashion garments made from imported silk. Many TCF companies are developing and successfullymarketing a unique Australian image for their product. This has generated the second fastest export growth performance in Australian manufacturing industry. Part of the success is due to the ability to 'Made in Australia' label. These efforts would not be assisted by the application of an unnecessarily restrictive definition of 'Made in Australia'. Such a definition was suggested by Mr Corboy, the great hero of the opposition. Let me sum up the opposition's proposed amendment to the meaning of 'Made in Australia'. Secondary industries are against you. Significant sectors of the food industry are against you. Your own legal spokesperson is against you. Even Mr Corboy's Quadrant Research is against you. Any informed consumer who has not been misled by lies that have been peddled is against you. Consumers will not benefit if industry is so disadvantaged that it stops labelling altogether. The opposition's proposal is likely to result in less information for consumers rather than more. I have a couple of other minor matters. There seems to be confusion about whether there was a proposed amendment about regional identification. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) said that there would not be one. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) said that there would be one to introduce 'Produce of Tasmania'. No such amendment has been tabled by the opposition, for very good reason of course. I hope honourable members opposite are aware that, if this term is introduced, it will mean that goods labelled 'Produce of Tasmania' will have to be all Tasmanian. The Tasmanian government's submission to the House of Representatives committee which inquired into this bill said that very few products would qualify for even the 'Product of Australia' label. Do not forget that food products will benefit from that label. The food industries and primary industries-the farmers-benefit most from that label. If that is the case for Tasmania, I am not sure why the opposition would be keen to make this special and obviously much more restrictive provision. In any case, the government's proposed amendments meet the concerns that have been raised in this area without the chaos that the opposition's amendments would bring to those wishing to emphasise their state or regional origins. All Tasmanian products proud to be use the Tasmanian can declare that all over their product, as long as they also state that it was made in Australia or that it is a product of Australia. That applies to every region in Australia. I have heard nothing from opposition members in this debate which has convinced me that the bill should be amended in the ways that they suggest. I say categorically to the Australian public: it is only those who have sat down and tried to make a labelling system work that understand this is the only labelling system that will in fact work. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.",32
18,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I move: (1) Clause 2, page 1, line 7, omit ""thirteenth"", substitute ""nineteenth"". I mentioned in my second reading speech that I would move this amendment. It extends the phase-in period for the legislation from 12 months to 18 months from the date of royal assent. This was a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology.",34
19,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The coalition will not be opposing this change. is an acknowledgment by the government that its proposals will create considerable upheaval in manufacturing, and in fact every industry in Australia and will require significant labelling changes in a whole range of induslegislation. tries. In her rebuttal, the Minister for Consumer Affairs seemed to imply that only the that coalition's proposals would result in labels having to be changed across the country. That is simply false. This legislation thousands of labels around the country to be changed. Almost every regional label will have to be changed. The use of regionalisarelation tion will be permitted as a result of a future amendment the government will be putting before the House, but it will still require changes in wording in almost every instance. Many products which currently have imported ingredients in them will have to have a change of label. Other significant changes also be required. There is some cost associated with label changing, and everyone acknowledges that. legislation There is some inconvenience. There is also need for industries involved to have some time at their disposal to phase in the appropriment. ate changes. It is therefore quite reasonable that the time available be extended by this six-month period. I understand from the explanatory memorandum provided that there is also provision for a further 12-month extension if difficulties arise in particular industries. Perhaps the minister might confirm that that position is still in place. The minister has made a number of references-both in her rebuttal and earlier-to the National Food Authority's role in making regulations about the labelling of food. It is really an unacceptable passing of responsibility to another authority for the minister to make that kind of rebuttal, particularly since she knows that the National Food Authority cannot make rulings and cannot issue guidelines which are contrary to this legislation. So this legislation is fundamental in determining what labels will be placed on food products. The minister tried in her rebuttal to discount the importance of labelling food and said that, somehow or other, labelling food did not It matter as much as labelling suits, plastic products and the like. But it does matter to a very significant and growing Australian industry. What labels can go on food products is entirely dependent upon what is in this The minister should not blame the National Food Authority or try to lull the food industry into some false sense of security it can sort it all out later. It cannot sort it all out later. This legislation is prescriptive about what labels can apply to all products, will require including food. It is true that the National Food Authority has some capacity to provide guidelines into some matters, but it cannot change what is in this bill. As a result of that, those issues cannot be put in the never-never and deferred to another day; they need to be dealt with in this legislation. Those products, too, will need the benefit of this additional time so that changes can be made as required. I think will that this amendment put forward by the government is a constructive one. It is some acknowledgment of the implications that this will have on industry. Industry will a need this extra time and, as a result of that, the coalition will not be opposing the amendAmendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 3.",34
20,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I move: (1) Clause 3, page 2, at the end of proposed section 65VB, add the following subsections: ""(2) Without affecting the operation of tion (1), Australia is to be taken to place of origin of marine produce if produce is landed by an Australian vessel authorised to do so under the Fisheries 1952 or the Fisheries ManagementAct 1991. ""(3) In this section 'Australian vessel' same meaning as in the FisheriesManagement Act 1991."". This amendment deals with the origin marine produce. It seeks to clarify the current situation and to ensure that only Australian marine products can carry the label 'Produce of Australia'. The fishing industry is a very significant sector of both the Australian economy and the Australian food chain. The gross value of production of fishery products in 1992-93 exceeded $1.3 billion. There been a growth of something like 66 per cent over the past five years. Exports have reached $1.1 billion, making the fishing industry the fourth largest primary exporter. Australia, through stringent attention to matters such as hygiene standards and legislation. product handling techniques, has developed a strong reputation within the international community for producing premium quality seafood. This reputation is also reflected in the domestic market where a growing community awareness of health and nutrition issues, as well as factors affecting the general economy, has encouraged consumers to seek further information on the products they purchase. Consumers are demanding more appropriate labelling on products. Should the bill succeed as it stands at the present time, the fishing industry believes that its reputation will be placed in jeopardy. The intent of this amendment is to provide for clear and proper labelling of products. The minister has indicated her support for that concept so I encourage her to also support this amendment. The significant flaw in the clause at the present time is that fish or marine product caught outside Australian waters, including product caught in the waters of other countries by their own vessels or others, could be labelled as Australian product if it first landed in Australia. To take an extreme example of this, if an Indonesian fishing junk fished its way from Indonesia towards Australia, strayed subsecinto Australian waters, was apprehended by be the the Australian Customs Service and seized that and destroyed, with the fishermen perhaps imprisoned for illegally fishing in Australian Act waters, the catch could be labelled 'Product of Australia'. The fish were caught by Indohas the nesian fishermen on an Indonesian vessel, they were apprehended for illegal fishing but, technically, the catch could be sold under this of legislation as 'Product of Australia'. I understand that the government says that its current policy is that Australian vessels should use Australian waters. That is appropriate but there are some exceptions and there are circumstances which could result in fish landed in Australia but not caught in Australhas Ian waters or by Australian vessels being labelled 'Product of Australia'. That is clearly misleading. If the government is seriously intent on delivering to Australians truth in labelling, it will no doubt accept this amendment as a worthwhile improvement to this",35
21,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The government rejects this amendment. The amendment will provide no benefits to the Australian fishing industry. The only likely effect would be to harm the present arrangements supporting the fishing industries of Port Lincoln and Eden. The government's proposed clause was developed in consultation with the Fisheries Management Authority and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the bodies responsible for the acts referred to in the opposition amendment. Their advice was that the clause as it stands protects the Australian fishing industry because only Australian boats are allowed to land in Australian ports. There are a couple of exemptions for foreign boats so that canneries in Eden and Port Lincoln can continue to function. The opposition's proposed amendment appears to put the future of these canneries at risk. The Fisheries Management Act has no definition of' Australian vessel', bringing into question the opposition's drafting of its amendmentbut members of the opposition have difficulty understanding most things they read.",35
22,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The facts are that this proposal is strongly supported by the National Fishing Industry Council. It does not preclude the vessels referred to by the Minister for Consumer Affairs. The minister is asking us and the fishing industry to have confidence that the government will not change its current policies and, therefore, there will be nothing to worry about. Any industry that trusts this government not to change its mind is on very perilous ground. It is always changing its mind on policy issues. Some voters might remember that we went to the last election being promised tax cuts; now we are being told we are going to have tax increases. The civil aviation industry is not likely to want to trust the government on its policies because the open skies policy has turned into a ban on Air New Zealand. The woodchipping industry representativesoutside do not want to trust the government on its policies because it keeps changing its mind. The fishing industry is also concerned that the government's policies on these matters may well change in the future. Frankly, when the government says 'Trust us,' industries do not believe them. They want the protection that can be provided through this legislation to guarantee that fish caught by Australian vessels, landed on Australian shores by Australian seamen has the exclusive use of the title 'Product of Australia'. There is provision in the draft amendment to allow the circumstances referred to by the minister. This amendment will clarify and improve the situation, and frankly it ought to be supported. Amendment negatived.",36
23,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I move: (2) Clause 3, page 3, line 18, proposed subsection 65VE(2), after ""set out in the Table."", insert ""A representation in the Table may be followed by words that identify a particular place in Australia or a particular part of Australia."". This amendment makes it clear that, when a supplier wants to identify a particular place as part of an expressed and unambiguous claim that the goods originated in Australia, this may be done by adding the name of the place after the authorised term. This permits the use of such labels as 'Produce of Australia from Queensland', or 'Made in Australia at the Highlands Pottery, Tasmania'. This amendment applies only to the positioning of place names when they are used as part of an expressed and unambiguous Australian origin representation. It does not apply to such representations as 'Proudly Tasmanian' or 'Queensland Mangoes'. The bill has no provision restricting the placement, number or size of these representations provided the goods really are Australian. The government is very happy to amend the bill in this way. The bill, in its original form, already allowed all this to happen. We have moved this amendment in order to clarify totally the situation.",36
24,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"This amendment certainly is needed to remove any doubt that regional labelling is still permitted. Whilst the minister always claimed that the original legislation allowed that, many disagreed. Many legal opinions and organisations around the countryside expressed the view that their use of regional labelling was precluded. Amongst those organisations is the 'Buy Tasmanian' group. The Tasmanian government has also expressed reservations in this particular area. It is important that these changes be made. There was genuine doubt that regional labels may have been outlawed and that terms such as 'Made in Tasmania', 'Product of Sunraysia', 'Assembled in Wangaratta' and the like could no longer apply. This amendment does not completely satisfy many who are supportive of regional labelling. Some people would prefer to have terms like 'Product of Tasmania' or 'Made in Tasmania' as an option. Their argument is based on the fact that this is country of origin labelling for domestic use, it is not internationallegislation, and that therefore people in other states know where Tasmania is. They see that as being a sales advantage and would like the privilege of being able to use that label. On the other hand, I accept the fact that if you allow 'Product of Tasmania' you must also allow product labels for every other state and town in the country. There may be a growing confusion of labels which is not necessarily helpful in endeavouring to simplify and assist consumers in identifying what is genuinely Australian. The amendments will require additional words to be used in most instances. You will not be able to say 'Product of Tasmania', but must say 'Product of Australia'; in fact, you will have to say something like 'Product of Australia-Tasmania' or 'Proudly Tasmanian but Product of Australia'. All those sorts of labels will have to be used. It was interesting to note that the minister, in her pre-empting of the debate on the next amendment, indicated that there could be some confusion about 'Made in Australia' and 'Australia made'. That will occur under these circumstances too, because there will be some products that now have 'Tasmania made' on them that will not be able to have 'Made in Tasmania' or 'Product of Tasmania'. Those sorts of confusions are inevitably going to occur in these regional labelling situations, because there are some products that do not necessarily come from the district which traditionally carried the labelling. Whilst the solution provided by the amendment will not completely satisfy the critics, is an improvement, it does respect the right of communities to continue to proudly promote themselves through their product and to also identify particular communities with quality produce. Names like King Island, for instance, have come to be associated with quality beef and quality dairy products and the like; names like Kingaroy have been associated with quality peanutsMs MCHugh-It still is.",36
25,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"And still is; Sunraysia for quality dried fruits, and many others as well. I cannot think of anything in particular that comes from the electorate of the member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), but no doubt he will think of something of quality that comes from his areaMr Sciacca-Strawberries.",37
26,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"That is right. Those titles will still be able to be used, but to be modified. I think that is going to cause some distress, but it would have been an appalling situation if the legislation had stamped out and made unlawful those sorts of titles. The opposition will not oppose this amendment. It is a significant improvement, although we recognise that there will still be some users of regional labels who will be unhappy with these new arrangements.",37
27,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am concerned that the minister made some comments earlier on that there might have been some differences between the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and me. I am not too sure where she got that from. If she reads my speech she will see that I have already canvassed the matters about the regionalisation. Perhaps she could either apologise to me or clarify her comments. In any event, we are talking about the question of labelling. My understanding is that areas such as Ballarat, Bendigo, Kingaroy or wherever it might be would be free to make other comments in various parts on any of their products if they so wanted, espousing the virtues of their own product. I believe that this is an appropriate way to get around the regionalisation question, and I think in due course it will be to the satisfaction of those it producers throughout the country. Amendment agreed to.",37
28,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move: (2) Clause 3, page 3, proposed subsection 65VE(2), the Table, Category A, Representations, after"" 'Product of Australia' "", add ""or 'Made in Australia' "". (3) Clause 3, page 3, proposed subsection 65VE(2), the Table, Category B, Representations, omit"" 'Made in Australia' "", substitute "" 'Manufactured in Australia' "". Amendments 2 and 3 are the critical amendments which come to the crux of the coalition's determination to protect the integrity of the 'Made in Australia' label. These amendments will elevate to the same category as 'Produce of Australia' and 'Product of Australia' the term 'Made in Australia,' and it establishes a more accurately descriptive title 'Manufactured in Australia' for category they will all have B products. This legislation downgrades, grants a lesser status, to the term 'Made in Australia'. Goods which acquire their essential character or qualities in Australia but include imported ingredients will be able to be labelled 'Made in Australia' under the proposals put forward by the government. In so doing, they are fundamentally assaulting the public's understanding of labelling in Australia at the present time. The minister was very keen to discount the surveys that were referred to earlier as though food was unimportant. But they are in fact overwhelming in their results. It was shown in the CSIRO national nutritional survey of January 1994 that 98 per cent of Australians agreed that food should not be labelled 'Australian' unless it is both grown and processed entirely within Australia. We are not talking about the past because that is what we are surely trying to correct for the future. This is an opportunity for a new beginning. The government seems to be determined to put in place a system which is clearly defective. It is a system which is not supported by the vast majority of Australians. The minister worked very hard to find a couple of organisations that supported the government's position on this matter. In my sp-ech in the second reading debate yesterday, I hsted a score of organisations-and I have pages of them here-that are all critical of what the government is proposing to do. The opposition amendments have the overwhelming support of the consumer organisations, farm organisations, many industry groups and, most notably, the ACTU. Here I have a classic letter from Martin Ferguson. Is he amongst the ill-informed people? I put on the record the fact that the minister is nodding her head. The minister thinks the ACTU president is ill-informed. He made it quite clear in a letter sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which was made pUblic-not a secret document-that: The ACTU Executive has unanimously endorsed this submission to change two sections of the Bill in order to address our concern. The Bill's focus on representations about Australian origin carried on consumer goods supplied in Austral!a fails to recognise the widely-held public perceptIOn that goods marked 'Made in Australia' denotes that Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the product on offer. It is not just 98 per cent of the people of Australia who think this; it is also the ACTU and the consumer organisations, with which the minister claims to have a close relationship. A host of other organisations have written similarly, and if time permits I will quote from some of them. The government has spent $15 million over nearly a decade promoting the 'Buy Australian' campaign. It has contributed to reinforcing the view of the majority of Australians-that goods labelled 'Made in Australia' have Australian components. That campaign has been very successful and it is very commendable. The government now seeks to undermine that by tearing away at the basic fabric, the intent, of the entire campaign. The government will destroy all of that with a new campaign, but this one is going to cost only $787,000 over two years. Not even all of that will be spent on actually persuading the pUblic. According to evidence given at a Senate estimates committee on 23 June some of it will be used to develop guidelines 'and to do research. With a couple of hundred thousand over a few years, the government expects to be able to undo what it has spent $15 million helping to build up. The clear facts are that the vast majority of Australians want 'Made in Australia' to mean genuinely Australian. These amendments must be supported. (Time expired)",37
29,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 has been pulled more times than a rotten tooth. We can look back over the legislation's history. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) probably will not tell us exactly how many times it was listed for debate after it finally got a start on 19 October, but my recollection is that it was in and out at least three times after that. Indeed, it was listed for debate in the last week of last year's sittings. Mr Truss-They squibbed on it.",38
30,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Yes, it squibbed on it that time and it squibbed on it before. The reason the government has squibbed on it is that it knows it is bad legislation. The government has been told that it is bad legislation by none other than Martin Ferguson. This minister in particular and all the other government ministers instruct members to come into the House and the first person they quote when they are being supported by him is the president of the ACTU.",39
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT, they Order! The honourable member for Ballarat has made some admissible introductory facturers remarks but I would ask him to get to the amendments.,39
32,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am, Mr Deputy ing Speaker, by referring to the ACTU's views this legislation. They say it is rotten legislawill tion. They say it is anti-worker, and they are quite right. The minister said in her remarks that she has met with wide groups of people. I know for a fact that she has met with Martin Ferguson. Why will she not tell the House exactly what Mr Ferguson said to her? Mr Ferguson. Ferguson said to her, 'Pull this legislation out.'",39
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member must now get to the amendments.,39
34,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Indeed, Mr Deputy process, Speaker. I will read the ACTU's comments relation to these amendments. Mr Ferguson Australian said in this letter which the minister has and my colleague the member for Wide (Mr Truss) referred to it: We believe it is essential for the bill to clarify precisely what people, Australian consumers, expect of the term 'Made in Australia'. It has been difficult enough task to promote the benefits to economy of purchasing Australian made products without now introducing new terms tions which will only confuse consumers and allow manipulation of the system by overseas producers and importers. What the ACTU was talking about, what the perceptions. coalition is talking about, what the Australian community is talking about and what the main interest groups are talking about is the integriflag ty of the 'Made in Australia' theme. That what this legislation is not achieving and is what the coalition's amendments are trying to achieve. To come into this House and say that the coalition is only talking about the food industry is grossly untrue. The minister knows it is grossly untrue because she has read my speech of 19 October. She read the comments by the Managing Director of the Rocklea Spinning Mills. He said quite specifically that it is not confined to the food industry. His comments are not about the food industry; are about the manufacturing industry and the integrity and ability of Australian manuto compete with imported products. If we are really serious about protecting this country, if we are really serious about protectAustralian producers and consumers and on protecting Australian jobs, these amendments be accepted. Quite frankly, my view is that this legislation is un-Australian because it fails to recognise the prime perception of people that 'Made in Australia' means made in Australia. The ACTU is acutely aware of that, and I support the comments made by Mr These amendments are being opposed. This legislation has been introduced again for the most deeply cynical reasons. They will not be lost on the Australian people. This legislation is about giving this fraudulent government a double dissolution trigger. It has, in the thrown away Australian workers' in rights, Australian consumers' rights and manufacturers' rights. It is a deeply gotcynical exercise and it will be judged in the Bay harshest terms. (Time expired)",39
35,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,I have only to say that these amendments are rejected by a the government for one simple reason: the the legislation as we have proposed it is the only and descriplegislation that will work.,39
36,Mr NEVILLE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In talking about these amendments, I would like to revisit something I said earlier about In the legislation, the Minister for Consumer Affairs and the government admit, when they talk about kangaroos, koalas, the and so on, that perceptions are all importis ant in this matter. When, as the honourable that member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) said, 98 per c-nt.of the Australian public perceive 'Made in Australia' in a certain way, why in the name of heaven would the government go in the opposite direction, against the overwhelming advice of the unions, business groups, farming organisations and almost every group of any significance? As a previous speaker said, not only food manufacturers but producers of other products support our point of view. The minister said that we are basing the whole of the debate on food. FoodÂ· is a very important matter in Australia. Australia has a reputation for producing prime foodstuffs and, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, we have great chemical controls, integrated pest management controls, very high standards and a number of government programs for quality assurance and quality control. All these things are going into Australian products only to be undermined by this stupidity. As the honourable member for Wide Bay said in commenting on an earlier amendment, if it was a simple matter and if the minister's definition of 'perception' was correct, why allow 18 months for its implementation instead of 12? Further, if the matter is as in the Australian mind as the minister is saying, why spend $787,000 tryIng to change people's perceptions? In the few minutes left to me I would like to refer again to the group at Childers ,Which is now value adding, the very important matter we have been talking about. Minister after minister talks about small business being the great saviour of Australia, the place where jobs can be created. To the group at Childers these definitions will be all important. The group is going into a new area in the processing of tomatoes to make tomato pastes, purees, pizza mixes and so on, and also avocado paste, guacamole, mango slices and chutneys. This is quite a new area for Australian manufacturers. Sure, these things are produced on a small scale in cottage industries around Australia, but we are now talking about subtropical products with a great potential for Australia. As I said, the export earning potential is between $5 million and $12 million. Ron Simpson and his partners at Childers quite rightly want this matter defined because, if a cheap imported paste comes from Italy, Thailand or Brazil and that paste is then mixed with some Australian products to give it the essential character, say, of a pizza base, then by the minister's definition it will be made in Australia. Ms MCHugh-Rubbish!",39
37,Mr NEVILLE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is not rubbish. It is just taking a very basic powder or concentrate and adding herbs or various other things to it and the essential character of it will be, as it will be described on the bottle, 'Pizza base'. By the minister's own definition that product will be entitled to carry the definition 'Made in Australia'. To industries in places like Childers that will be devastating, and it will mean the end of a very important small business with a potential to employ 60 people. When we multiply that across other provincial cities of Australia we can get an idea of how the government's pig-headedness on this issue could damage small business and employment prospects.",40
38,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for clear ConsumerAffairs) (11.59 a.m.}-I hesitate to go over and over the arguments when people opposite not only refuse to listen but continue to say the opposite of the truth. In relation to pastes, including peanut butter, tomato paste and othersMr Truss-Pizza base might be different.",40
39,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In relation to pastes and pizza base and a variation on that, the undeniable fact is that the National Food Authority has the relevant role and responsibility. It is completely within its power to insist on the adding of words in relation to those pastes. It is completely consistent with this bill, which provides a baseline for all Australian goods. I have said that every argument of the opposition against the legislation has concerned food. It is totally unnecessary to destroy excellent legislation which supports Australian industry, which goes so far to meet the demands of Australian consumers, because of these pastes. The concerns for those particular pastes can be met by the National Food Authority. Those opposite should not destroy legislation which will do so much good. The fact that those opposite will not listen and will keep repeating the opposite of the truth is something that I cannot do anything about. No survey has been done of the Australian public or any section of the Australian public which shows that the Australian public thinks that' Australian made' or 'Made in Australia' means all Australian. I have seen two surveys-the CSIRO survey and the Quadrant survey-which ask questions only about food. Even the Quadrant survey done for John Corboy of SPC showed that most Australians do not think, even in relation to food, that 'Made in Australia' means 100 per cent Australian. I do not know how often I have to say that. That is the result of the survey done for John Corboy. I do not know of any surveys that have been done in relation to shirts or hardware or furniture or many of the 68,000 goods that are listed by the Australian made campaign, which we all support. Very few goods can be labelled 'Product of Australia' and probably fewer than half of those products that carry the green and gold kangaroo logo would be able to be labelled 'Product of Australia' or the opposition's definition of 'Made in Australia' . Food products are the great beneficiary of this legislation, because they have the great characteristic of being all Australian and having no added ingredients. That is very unlikely in the case of most other products which are made in Australia. Look around this room or any room you are in. From what you wear to everything you use, it is very difficult for products to be 100 per cent Australian. Food and primary industry will be the great beneficiary of the new label 'Product of Australia', which will even identify the pastes-the peanut butter, the tomato paste and all the others-that are 100 per cent Australian. This legislation identifies those at last. Most of the products which can now proudly bear the logo that we all love, that we all recognise and support and that the government puts money into, because it does so much good, have to import ingredients. But we think they still should be able to be labelled 'Made in Australia' and bear that logo. I challenge those opposite to continue to attempt to destroy that campaign.",40
40,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The challenge by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) is indeed foolish and totally misrepresents the coalition's position. We want to protect the 'Made in Australia' campaign. It is the government that is undermining it. I thought the minister's initial response-'This is the only one that will work'-was lamentable. She was subsequently goaded into making some additional response but, sadly, that was also pitifully threadbare. If farmers and food producers are so advantaged by the government's proposal, why are they all against it? A press release headed 'Opposition right on country of origin labelling bill' states: NFF President, Mr Donald MCGauchie, said farmers had argued vigorously for the term ""Made in Australia"" to be used only to describe goods manufactured in Australia from Australian ingredients. Goods which contain imported ingredients should be more accurately described by the term 'Manufactured in Australia'. This is the only way to ensure that consumers have accurate, unambiguous information about the country of origin on all product labels. This, after all, was the intention of the legislation in the first place. So the spokesman for the farmers-the people who are supposed to be greatly benefited by the minister's legislation--disagreeswith her. They want the coalition's amendment. But it is not them alone. On 25 January, I received a letter from the Victorian Farmers Federation, which states: We believe it is important to have 'Made in Australia' mean precisely what consumers think it means and fully support your endeavours to have this reflected in the Bill. The Australian Cane Farmers Association states: This Bill is totally inadequate and an insult to all Australians who want to buy Australian products. This proposed legislation will continue to allow foreign produced food to masquerade as an Australian product. That is what the government's legislation is about. The farmers do not want the minister's legislation that she thinks is so wonderful. SPC supports the coalition and states: SPC criticised the Federal Government's proposals ""to legalisethe use of 'Made in Australia' for food products manufactured in Australia from imported ingredients"" . It ""created a sharp focus on the misguided approach being following by the Minister for Consumer Affairs to recognise the rights of Australian consumers"". So the farmers that you say are so wonderfully advantaged think that your legislation is wrong and support the coalition amendments. It is not just farmers. It is also many people in manufacturing. My colleague referred to the letter from the Rocklea Spinning Mills. They are not spinning food; they are making cloth. Many others in manufacturing industries are concerned that competitors' products can be passed off as 'Made in Australia' when they contain significant imported components-just the sort of thing that we believe should be prevented in this legislation. But it is not just those on the industry side who hold that belief. It is also the trade unions. We have quoted frequently from the letter from Martin Ferguson. But he is not alone. Many other trade unions support this view: the Australian Food, Metal and Engineering Union; the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union; the Public Sector Union; the National Union of Workers; the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia; the Victorian Trades Hall Council; the Goulburn Valley Trades and Labour Council; the Sunraysia Trades and Labour Council; and the Queensland Trades and Labour Council-some of whom I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) depends on for his endorsement. They are condemning the legislation and supporting the coalition on this very important issue. The minister again referred to the Quadrant survey, claiming that somehow or other it came up with different results. Seventy-four per cent of consumers stated that products labelled 'Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients. Clearly, it is their very firm view that products labelled 'Made in Australia' should not contain foreign ingredients. But this legislation legalises the use of foreign ingredients in products labelled 'Made in Australia'. That is why these amendments are so important and why they should be accepted by everyone. The minister said that there had not been a survey that asks the questions that she would like asked, as though all the other surveys were somehow or other doctored and she would like a special one that comes out with the answers that she wants to support her case. You can walk into any supermarket you like in the country and ask housewives and shoppers what they believe 'Made in Australia' means and you will be told that they want it to mean all Australian. (Time expired)",41
41,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I wonder whether the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) spoke to the National Fishing Industry Training Council in relation to the fishing industry question. I again challenge her to tell this House what Martin Ferguson said to her in relation to the coalition's amendments. She refuses to do so. The coalition, the members of this House and the Australian public are quite entitled to draw the conclusion that Martin Ferguson said, 'Pull it out. Don't go ahead with it' The minister has not told this House what the ACTU said to her despite her open door policy. Do not worry, Mr Deputy Speaker, the door was open; it was kicked down by the ACTU. The minister has not listened to the ACTU. I will again refer to the letter from the Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Limited because this goes to the heart of the debate: As you may be aware, Rocklea, the company which I represent, is a spinner of yarn from Australian produced cotton and wool. You might also be aware that in recent times we have come under severe pressure from subsidized imported cotton products against which are seeking countervailing action. We agree with the alliance in its claim that Australian shoppers prefer to buy goods which are made in Australia and it is the truth in this label which is a major aid in our effort to defend ourselves against subsidized imports. It is very important for the jobs of our employees and the continued expansion of our industry that Australian products can be clearly distinguished from the imported products made from cotton which is dumped on our shores. ' In considering this issue I would ask you to bear in mind that truth in labelling is important not just for the food and textile industries. The issue IS wider than that. It is important across the whole range of Australian industry. After all, the Australian shopper has a right to know that the product they are buying is true to its label. When I previously mentioned Martin Ferguson and his views on this matter, and the fact that he has not seen the minister, the minister said, 'I have not seen him.' I want her to repeat that when she stands up again because I believe that is not true.'1 believe that Martin Ferguson has fully briefed the minister and her senior staff about the views of the ACTU on this matter. If the minister has' not seen him she can come to the dispatch box and tell us so. I have no doubt that he has spoken to the minister and her senior advisers about this matter. It is simply not true to say that that has not been done. She knows that, we know that and the Australian people know that. The ACTU is concerned about the same matters as Rocklea Mills, and they include Australian jobs. It is inexcusable for the government, via the minister, to come in here and refuse point-blank to discuss the key issues in all this: the integrity of 'Made in Australia', the integrity of Australian jobs, and the integrity of Australian workers, farmers, farm employees, manufacturers and workers in the manufacturing industries. That is what these amendments are about. That is what the coalition is about. It is simply not good enough for the minister to stand up here during this debate and say, 'Oh well, the government is opposed to these amendments.' She carries an extraordinary onus on her shoulders to try to convince this House and the Australian people why every one of those people on the list read out by my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) is wrong and she is right about these amendments. There is no substance to the government's opposition to these amendments except, as I said before, as - ,cynical political exercise, positioning this government so that it can, if it so wishes, get a double dissolution and proceed to an election ..",42
42,Mr NEVILLE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I would like to make one further contribution in support of my colleagues on this side of the House, and it is this: what is the minister's objection to the word 'manufactured'? Does the word 'manufactured' not clearly describe the process? Would it not be very clear to all Australians that, if something was manufactured in Australia, it might well have obtained products from overseas? It is a very clear, simple, unambiguous title, whereas 'Made in Australia', after eight or nine years of promotion by the minister's department at a cost of $15 million, means something else. Why would we want to change people's perceptions, and what is so dirty about the word 'manufactured' for those firms that want to use imported components? It introduces a level of clarity and removes any ambiguity in the matter. I would be interested to hear the minister's comments on that because it seems to me that nowhere has she explained it in this whole debate.",43
43,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I hesitate to rise again and to have this matter keep going backwards and forwards. I am certainly not going to indulge in this constant refuting of the basis of the assertions of the opposition. Nevertheless, that was a very good question. The answer is: of course we looked at it. We looked at everything and tried everything and saw what would work and what would not. We certainly looked at the word 'manufactured'. We were attracted for a long time to the word 'manufactured'. By the way, the two working groups were working before the legislation was introduced, not after-they worked for 18 months to two years before that. The delays to the legislation have been because of requests to go to committees. As for the request to meet people, I have complied with every request to make it clearer. As to your question, the reason we chose 'made' rather than 'manufactured' is because it is simpler and better understood. It is better understood because it is the common meaning of the word 'made'. It is better understood because, where cases have already gone to the courts, the courts have defined what the Australian public understands by the word 'made', and in several cases that has already happened. But, funnily enough, the clincher was the Australian made campaign. The Australian made campaign, which we all support so much, uses that word to describe many thousands of products which do not have all their ingredients sourced in Australia-thousands of products that bear the 'Australian Made' logo. We decided that because of understanding-never proved otherwise-actual meaning, court decisions defining it as the Australian public understands it and, lastly and most importantly, because of the Australian made campaign, we chose the word 'made' rather than 'manufactured'. For every single instance that has been raised by the opposition as causing a problem of integrity-for everyone of those where you have seen a problem-remember that the top label will be 'Product of Australia'. If they are an all Australian product, they are 'Product of Australia'.",43
44,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Wide Bay) (12.18 p.m.}-Had I not seen with my own eyes that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) is on the opposite side of the table, I would have thought she had just made a very powerful argument for the opposition's amendments being accepted. She has just finished telling us that she chose the phrase 'Made in Australia' because it has a common understanding amongst the people. Indeed it does! As we have been quoting to you time and the again, 98 per cent of people believe it should imply Australian ingredientsexclusively Australian ingredients-and that is the very reason why 'Made in Australia' must be considered to be a category A definition. The second reason the minister gave was that there have been certain court interpretations. But the court interpretations are of previous laws. They are not about the new legislation.. We are here in this pa-liament making new laws for the future, setting new ground rules about the way it should be done in the future. So we should not rely on the definitions that the courts have provided on past bad laws. The minister acknowledged that the laws were bad, but she wants to devise the new legislation on .the basis of definitions that have been created arising out of those old laws. We should be using this opportunity to make a new start for Australian industry, a new start for labelling laws, so that the laws accurately reflect what the people think they ought to be. The laws should give us an opportunity to appropriately label Australian goods so that only genuinely Australian goods are labelled Australian. It is no good falling back on court judgments on past poor law as an excuse to create new bad law. In reality we should be taking. this opportunity to set in place a new regime for the future. You do not have to rely on me to tell you that the public believes that 'Made in Australia' should have Australian ingredients. I read a little further into the letter from the ACTU and I thought I might quote another paragraph to the minister's embarrassment. Mr Martin Ferguson said: We believe that it is essential for the Bill to clarify precisely what people, Australian consumers, expect of the term, 'Made in Australia.' It has been a difficult enough task to promote the benefits to the economy of purchasing 'Australian Made' products, without now introducing new terms and descriptions which will only confuse consumers and allow manipulation of the system by overseas producers and importers. He has again raised a very significant point. Allowing 'Made in Australia' to be a descriptor of goods containing imported ingredients will allow the system to be manipulated by unscrupulous operators. Of course the grocery manufacturers are unhappy with the use of the term 'Made in Australia' being restricted to entirely Australian goods, because they have been amongst the people who have been using the current system to give an impression of Australianism for goods that were not genuinely Australian. Of course the chocolate manufacturers would like to use the term 'Made in Australia' to describe their product even though some of the ingredients are not Australian. They will continue to be able to use the term 'Manufactured in Australia', and that will be an improvement and a marketing advantage for them over the manufacturers of imported chocolates, which will have .to carry an imported label. So the chocolate manufacturers' concerns about' the coalition amendments are not really valid. They will still have a marketing advantage they can pursue. The trade union movement is concerned that to allow this abuse of the term 'Made in Australia' will cost jobs. I heard the minister say that some 80 or 100 jobs somehow or other might be lost as a result of the effect on the 'Buy Australian' campaign. That is tiny. I do not accept that figure to start with. It clearly is a fantasy to try to protect the minister in this regard. But that is completely insignificant compared with the truck that people will be able to drive through this legislation to describe all sorts of products which have imported ingredients as being 'Made in Australia'.. The impact of this amendment on jobs will be very significant indeed. It is the coalition, the ACTU, the consumer groups and the farm organisations that are protecting jobs; it is government that is putting them at risk by enabling products with foreign ingredients to carry a 'Made in Australia' label.",44
45,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mitchell) (12.23 p.m.)Since I was elected to this parliament one of my deep concerns has been the labelling of Australian products. Within my electorate I have a large number of primary producers, citrus growers and vegetable growers and a large mushroom industry. I have endeavoured to establish a decent labelling system for Australia:. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) came to this parliament bleating on behalf of the Australian housewife and the Australian consumer and now she is the Minister for Consumer Affairs. One can go back over her speeches and read the hearts and flowers, the passion, that she had for the Australian housewife, the Australian woman and the Australian consumer. Speech after speech was used to advance those causes and her own career. . She failed the first test she had in taking real action on behalf of Australian consumers, Australian women and Australian housewives. I want her to come with me to a shopping centre and ask people, 'Does ""Australian Made"" mean made in Australia?' They will say, 'Yes, totally Australian.' The minister is absolutely wrong. They will disagree with her because she has not only opened the doors to imports but also made it impossible for people to distinguish between imports and Australian made products. People can no longer tell whether a product is grown, made and manufactured here totally or whether it is a foreign product. So the minister has hit them with a double whammy. The biggest complaint can be heard on the hustings. You should get out on the hustings and associate with real people-real shoppers and real housewives responsible for spending in a discerning manner the weekly budgeted dollar. You will find them asking, 'Where is this flood of imports coming from?' You have to read the labels of products with a microscope to get even a dete-tion that they may be imported. The minister is doing nothing to rectify that matter. In fact, she is the confusing the issue by saying that Australian made does not really mean Australian made, that it can comprise a whole bunch of other components and that, as long as it is stuck together somewhere in Australia, it is an Australian product. That will not wash. You have failed the people you claimed to represent when you arrived in this place. I would have thought you would have been passionate about this issue. Australians are passionate about their own products, their own families and employees in Australian industries. Come with me to Blacktown. You would not get to places like that. Neither does the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), incidentally. Come with me and ask the people of Blacktown whether they believe Australian made means totally Australian or not. You will get the answer there. The government is fooling itself if it thinks that this makeshift proposition that it is presenting in the parliament today will solve the problems or give us a better sense of direction as a nation. The coalition's amendments are the only ones that truly represent what should happen in Australia. It is not just the coalition that wants your legislation changed; all consumers, workers and producers of Australia want it changed. That group of people does not agree with you. You seem to be agreeing with the grocery alliance and a few manufacturers. Your party is very elitist. You think you stand for the workers and consumers of Australia, but the only people you are representing in this House today are those belonging to a very narrow and elite group. You think you can gain favour from them by introducing their legislation and not the people's legislation. Go to the people and introduce the people's legislation. That is what the Australian Labor Party is supposed to stand for. The great ideals that the minister came to this place with have just been thrown out door on this important legislation. It is patriotic piece of legislation-something which she ought to support. More than that, it gives consumers the ability to discern facts, and that is what they want to do. They want to turn over those labels and be sure when they shop that they are buying an Australian product. They are patriotic. I beg the minister to come with me to Blacktown and ask an average shopper on a Saturday morning outside any major store whether Australian made means Australian. They will think, misguidedly, that your legislation will give an exclusive title to Australian made manufactured products from Australian difficulty ingredients. You are wrong. You need change this legislation because it puts Australia down; it does not build Australia up. (Time expired)",45
46,Mr LIEBERMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT, on The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) is well known for her admiration the legal profession. I was fascinated to hear her strong endorsement of the decisions taken by the courts over the years on the meaning of 'Made in Australia'. I am the last person to want to give the minister a lesson on law because I am sure there are other people who could do it better than I.,46
47,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Close to her.,46
48,Mr LIEBERMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Close to her. However, the decisions of the courts have been based on the fact that so far the parliament of Australia has not attempted to define and to bring up to a contemporary level the definition of 'Made in Australia'. The courts have had to grapple with the statute law that the parliament has created over the years under the Trade Practices Act, using the common law in order to arrive at a meaning of 'Made in Australia'. I am sure that, if the judges of courts could be frank with us today, they would say that they would much prefer to accept a new start. This bill provides the opportunity of a new start if the coalition's amendments-which are supported by the ACTU, the farmers of Australia and many others-are supported. Let us just pause and reflect. The opposithe tion is saying that the phrase 'Made in a Australia' should be given the same denominator, capacity and recognition as 'Produce of Australia' or 'Product of Australia'. That is the using the minister's own words in the bill. We are saying that 'Made in Australia' should mean that Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods, and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. That is what the consumers would like the parliament to do. They want us to clarify the law and let the judges get on with interpreting the new law and made clear by this parliament. Many years of in interpreting the situation have led to to the need for us to legislate today. With great respect to the minister, no judge in Australia would want this parliament to think that decisions handed down by judges the meaning of labelling-as stated in the trade practices law-used up to now would of bind this parliament inflexibly never to improve the law, clarify the law, contemporise it and bring it up to date. The minister should take off her heavy robe of ministerial responsibility and go into the supermarkets. I know that the minister is trying to be loyal to her staff and I know that her staff have tried to drive this one and that she has been supportive of them, but she should forget their advice. Prior to the bill being drafted, the minister's own working parties said to her that they would prefer the labels to be 'Made in Australia', 'Product of Australia' and 'Produce of Australia'. They said that. They then tried to grapple with other things but at that time their own guidelines as to what the government actually wanted to do were not clear. I do not blame the government for that because the government was developing its policy after consultation. I think that what has gone wrong gets back to the association with the law. The minister should tell her department that a good government is not bound by decisions of the judges on legislation that needs review. The judges often sayinformally and otherwise-how frustrated they are that the parliament has failed to draft legislation to clarify the law. The judges then have to grapple with it. That is how the common law is made in many cases and how statute law is made, because amendments are brought in by parliaments learning from what the judges say the meaning is, what it might be or where it needs clarification. The minister should just reflect on this. What is wrong with the phrase 'Made in Australia' meaning that Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods, and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia? What is wrong with that? I cannot find any reason for it to be wrong, except that the minister has been told, 'Hang on, Minister, some of the judges have said that, under the trade practices law as it presently stands, it means that they acquired their essential characteristics.' The judges are saying that because, up to this time, the parliament has not clarified the definition. Now we are doing it. The amendment will clarify it for everyone. Then we can go away and buy as much as we can of 'Made in Australia', knowing what we want. (Time expired)",46
49,Mr CLEARY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I will continue from my earlier remarks. Over the last decade, two prime ministers and a series of ministers have talked about globalisation and the need for us to internationalise and be internationally competitive. We have heard that ad nauseam. Along the way, we have also been told that part of the equation is comparative advantage; that there are certain things we cannot do as well as other countries, and we should just accept that. We cannot produce T-shirts like the Chinese, so we should get out of that low skill industry and get into high quality industry and the like. There are also certain things that we do not produce. Therefore, if a manufacturer cannot source locally, so what? That is the lexicon of the times, the morality of the times, and the political and trade ethic of the times. You do not punish manufacturers for that; you just accept it, and you educate and explain to the public that not everything can be sourced locally. But, if things can be sourced locally, it is great for manufacturers to go out and source locally and have that nice big label 'Made in Australia', not this mickey mouse concept that we are fiddling around with today. The government cannot allow dishonest manufacturers to use the title 'Made in Australia' if they do not have a commitment to sourcing locally when they can. On the other hand, if they cannot source locally,the government should explain to the public through its education program that comparative advantage and the laws of nature mean that we do not have certain goods and therefore they are purchased elsewhere. That is quite simple for manufacturers and for the public. I do not understand why that should be a problem. The opposition is right: the public perception is that 'Made in Australia' means that. That is what people everywhere, anecdotally, are saying. I do not care too much for the research-it tells us enough. The punter in the street will say that 'Made in Australia' means just that. It does not mean 'From imported silk', but if it is made from imported silk that should be written on the garment. People can see that the suit is made from imported silk and has been manufactured in Australia. So what? I do not think that is a problem. I cannot understand who is behind the move not to put 'Made in Australia' in that other category. Is it the importers? The opposition always talks about the government being captive to the unions but it looks like the government is captive to the importers, because it is an importer's market-an importer's ethic. That is confounding. Let me say one thing about the opposition: it is all very well to see this as a very important plank in industry policy, but let us take it a step further. Let us have a debate in the parliament about industry policy. Let us have a debate on how we get policies to develop real industries in Australia. Do not give us that crap that industries will be developed by cutting wages",47
50,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,That's unparliamentary.,48
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Mr Newell)Order!,48
52,Mr CLEARY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Do not give us that rubbish or nonsense that it is the wages of Australian workers that are the problem and that we are not competitive enough. We know that is not true. Let us get into a bit of interventionist economicsMr Lieberman-It's the stupid tax system.,48
53,Mr CLEARY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"We could talk about payroll tax, I suppose. Do not also say it is about not taxing at the top end or cuts to government outlays either. That punishes ordinary people, too. If you are all interested in ordinary people, talk about just policies because out in the community people want to hear a bit of compassion. If the Liberal Party got rid of some of that right-wing baggage, then out in the community we might be able to enact some progressive policies. Just at the moment the government has put more rightwing policies on the agenda. 'Made in Australia' really should be what the label means. That would be a way of supporting Australian industry. I reckon the minister knows that that label should be up there at the top of the list.",48
54,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"-Politics is all about the resolution of conflict. I understand why the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) has chosen to have this piece of legislation the way it is-creating conflict-when all the major players agree with the position that has been adopted by the - coalition. Who would have thought that the executive of the ACTU would come out with the unanimous decision to support the position that is being held by the manufacturers, the NFF and the VFF? I cannot understand why the minister has not taken the opportunity to pick up the coalition's amendments when there is crosspartisanship arid support for what the coalition is putting forward, particularly from organisations which understand far more about manufacturing processes than she would understand about the manufacturing industry in Australia. I want to quote some comments made by representatives of the National Farmers Federation. They have commended the federal opposition for its 'moves to change the proposed lapelling laws to more accurately reflect the origin of the product, including its components and ingredients. The position taken by us is in line with the changes sought by the NFF. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Don MCGauchie, said: . . . farmers had argued vigorously for the term ""Made in Australia"", to be used only to describe goods manufactured in Australia from Australian ingredients. If you want to talk to people in the food industry, who better to talk to than someone who has revitalised an AiJstraliim company, pulled it up by its bootstraps; that is; the Chairman of SPC, Mr John Corboy. If ever there were an industry in Australia that was right on the ground, and knew what is required for labelling in Australian and overseas markets, it is John Corboy. He took this company, which was really' flat on its back, pulled the whole show into being and put it back onto a profitable basis. Mr Corboy in the SPC News of 19 October 1994 indicated: ' Moves by the Federal Coalition and the Democrats to amend the Federal Government's controversial MADE IN AUSTRALIA labelling legislation is a victory for common sense. . . ' ViCtory has not been achieved yet because the government is not exhibiting common sense. cannot We have 'the Minister for Consumer Affairs here who is reluctant to change. I do not know what is driving her but surely she can see the common sense that is being expounded by John Corboy, the Chairman of SPC and one of our major food producers in Australia. Mr Corboy said it is 'a positive initiative which would be welcomed by every Australian farmer, consumer and Australian food manufacturer' . I do not think you can get it much clearer than that. John Corboy has spelt out precisely why the minister should accept common sense, should move towards accepting the coalition's amendments in this regard and should in fact give certainty back to consumers and back industry so they understand exactly what they are doing. I recall that in the second reading debate this House my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) menof tioned the firm Rocklea, which is a manufacthe turing plant in my electorate. That firm is very supportive of what the coalition is trying to do. It is an organisation which spins cotton and wool products in Australia It supports the approach that has been taken by the coalition on this issue and has spelt out that this will lead to greater employment opportunities. It also made reference to cotton from overseas that was being dumped in Australia. You can get no better support than to talk to somebody who is right down there at the grassroots level of manufacturing and who understands the problems in the industries. Mr Rooaldsoo--'-Employing Australians.",48
55,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,It will mean employing Ausare tralians and manufacturing products for Australian and overseas markets. There are a number of other companies that have supported the stance we are taking. It is time that minister saw common sense and accepted the amendments that are being put forward so capably by my colleagues. (Time expired),49
56,Mr NEHL,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I had not initially intended to speak on this Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill but I am forced to do so. I must start off by perhaps taking an unusual line for a member of the opposition: I want to congratulate the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) on having this bill brought before the House. The resolution of the issues is vitally important, but she has just missed it by one small area. I genuinely do congratulate the minister but I do, in the most sincere way, implore her to rethink where she is going. We should take this whole question of 'Made in Australia' back to Australians. They are who we are concerned about; they are who we represent. I defy anybody to go into a supermarket in my electorate and ask any of my constituents what 'Made in Australia' means. Everybody knows that 'Made in Australia' means the product or the produce to of Australia. I cannot understand why the minister sits at the table and shakes her head and cannot see that. 'Produce of Australia', yes, we all know what that means. 'Product in of Australia', we know what that means. It is the pre-eminent understanding of the people Australia that 'Made in Australia' means product or the produce of Australia. I have no hesitation in suggesting that we could have 'Manufactured in Australia' from imported goods, imported components. What is the matter with that? If we are really concerned with the truth in labelling, if we are concerned about the consumers of Australia-and this is the minister's prime area of responsibility: she has to be concerned about consumers-she should accept the opposition's amendment. She has to exercise proper concern about consumers. How are car dealerships going to be classified? I suppose under the minister's definition they would be classified as 'Made in Australia', but really there a lot of imported goods in every motor the car that is produced in this country. I implore the minister to make a last minute Solomon type judgment and to accept the the opposition's amendment. The bill she has presented is good for Australia except for that one sticking point about 'Made in Australia' . As other speakers in the debate have said, the support that has come for keeping it includes not just the opposition or even the Independent member for Wills (Mr Cleary) but the ACTU and the NFF-a whole range of organisations. An enormous list of public organisations in this country are concerned about the future of the economy and about future production. The member for Wills asked a very valid question. It was not in these terms, but he asked who benefits. Why are we so hell-bent on having 'Made in Australia' applied to things which are partly imported? Somebody must benefit. The people of Australia do not benefit at all. Perhaps some areas might, areas which can produce things from imported goods and proudly place on them the label 'Made in Australia'. It is not on. I was looking at a briefcase in a shop called the Rivers Clothing Co., I believe, in the Civic centre of Canberra earlier this week. It was a very nice briefcase and it had 'Made in Australia' on the label-I am sure the label was made in Australia-but when I looked carefully inside I noticed a tiny piece of fabric, about as big as a fingernail, sewn inside which said 'Made in India'. Perhaps was polished in Australia, I do not know. is important that 'Made in Australia' means made in Australia, totally made in Australia by Australians for Australians. I ask the minister to please change her mind and accept what the opposition is saying. We are on right track.",49
57,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I do not want to sideline the debate by a discussion about the Rivers Clothing Co., but if indeed it is the Rivers Co. from my electorate then I will have a little chat to honourable member about the Australianness of my constituent company later on. Indeed, he could do no worse than buy a pair of Rivers shoes made in Australia, a company employing 120-odd people. I think it would be an extraordinary tragedy if at the end of this process we did not set concrete, by way of legislation, once and for all the Australian people's views of what 'Made in Australia' means. My great fear is that we are going to lose that opportunity. I think it is an utter disgrace that that is likely to occur. I held out an olive branch to the minister 19 October last year, of which she is well aware. If she is prepared to review this let common sense prevail, and to tell thoselegislation and we do not know who they are-that pushing her to pursue this disgraceful piece legislation that she is no longer prepared wear that, I will go out and publicly support her and praise her in the strongest terms. will do that if she is prepared to tell those are running this disgraceful no longer prepared to succumb to their pressure. I am sure I speak for the majority of the people in the coalition when I say that we publicly support and endorse common sense. We have not at any stage during this debate seen anything that resembles common sense. I do not know why the minister is not prepared to discuss the ACTU with me. She obviously has her reasons for that. Her failure to respond will be judged accordingly. Leaving all that aside, the olive branch is it there. I do not want to detract from what the It shadow minister, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), might feel about it, but from a personal point of view-I would be surprised if he disagreed with me-the olive branch is there. I urge the minister in the the strongest terms to please take it up.",50
58,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I thank my colleagues for their contributions in the consideration in detail stage on these very important amendments, which are obviously at the crux of the Trade Practices Amendment the (Origin Labelling) Bill. I am sorry if the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) has been somewhat embarrassed by the lack of support she has received from her absent colleagues. I am sorry, as the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) so ably pointed out in his speech, that there is no government enthusiasm for this legislation and that none of the in government speakers presented their views with any degree of conviction. I am sorry for the minister from that point of view, but the now solution is really in her own hands. The coalition has proposed these amendments because it is very enthusiastic about country of origin labelling. We believe it is on important. We want legislation in this particular area and we are prepared to support it. But and we are obviously not prepared to support that is defective. We have proposed are constructive amendments. We have put of forward amendments that we believe are to firmly supported by the community as a whole. We have listed many organisationsI and we could list many others-that have that publicly declared their support for the coaliagenda that she is tion proposals. That support is wide ranging. It does not come from a small sector. It may not come from the chocolate manufacturers and the grocery manufacturers. Support has come from a broad cross-section of the community. It certainly comes from food producers, but it also comes from manufacturers and others in industry. It comes from farm groups, consumer organisations, those who are most directly affected and who are intended to be the beneficiaries of this legislation and the union movement. They may all have different reasons for wanting to support the coalition proposal, but they have all come to the same conclusion, generally independently, that country of origin labelling legislation is important for Australia. To get it right, 'Made in Australia' is a term understood and widely used in the community by those who buy goods and those who supply goods to mean that the goods, including components, are produced in this country. The coalition is seeking to guarantee the integrity of that term through these amendments. I believe it will improve the legislation. It will give it credibility in the community. It will give the country, for the first time, effective country of origin labelling and it will give the public a labelling system they can understand and use to benefit themselves and Australian industry. These amendments are important to the coalition. I am pleased that so many coalition members have been prepared to contribute to the debate. We will be dividing on this issue because we think it is important. These amendments also, significantly, have the support of minority parties in the Senate. So we may well have to revisit this matter a little later on. I would have thought that with the overwhelming public views that have been expressed and the long list of organisations which have indicated that they think the coalition is right in this regard maybe, in these last dying minutes of the amendments' consideration the minister might realise, 'Yes, this is something we should look at again. Let us get it right. Let us have legislation that is genuinely and widely supported in the community.' If the government supports these amendments, we will give the legislation the passage the government wants, Australian consumers want, Australian industry wants and we want. We believe country of origin labelling is important for Australian industry.",50
59,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise to conclude this consideration in detail debate and to say that I understand exactly why so many members of the opposition have spoken. I have been through it now for years. You have only to mention labelling and everyone has a view. All of us have agreed that the Australian consumer wants the confusion to end. They want to understand. They do not want to find the little label at the back. This legislation, of course, prevents that. With regard to the bag that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) saw, if it was made in India, the little label at the back would not be permitted; the labelling would have to be as large and as prominent as any other claim. Therefore, with regard to the concern that there can no longer be a picture of the flag or the word' Australian' - this does that. Every time labelling is mentioned, everyone has got a view. The problem is there are so many ways of doing it that eventually someone had to make a decision. Someone had to choose some words and define them. I was asked the very good question: why did you choose 'made' rather than 'manufactured'? I explained that, when we looked at them all, we had to go for what would work. Originally, I had all sorts of ideas-that it would be 95 per cent content. But it will not work; you cannot do it. Eventually, everyone comes to that conclusion. The interesting thing is that if anyone actually sits down andÂ· does the work, you eventually come to the conclusion that I had to come to-that this is the only one that will work.",51
60,Unknown,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Opposition members interjecting,51
61,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my colleagues are not here because they cannot bear to hear the rubbish that has been spoken by those opposite. If I have two more minutes in which to speak, it might be nice if people did not shout absurdities while I state how we came to these conclusions and why we will stick to them. There is absolutely no reason for choosing one rather than another, justifying the one that will work. You can make assertions forever; it is so easy. Each person who enters the debate at a late stage suddenly realises it is an easy assertion to make-that everyone in Australia thinks 'Made in Australia' means fully Australian. They do not. There is absolutely no research to show that they do. The only research that has been done proves the opposite. With regard to the SPC research on food-the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) can shake his head but he should read the words-the figure was less than 50 per cent. Even when people were asked five questions on food only-and we all agree that food is very special-less than 50 per cent said that they thought 'Made in Australia' meant all Australian. Those opposite can shake their heads one after the other forever. The fact is that the only surveys that have beenÂ· done disprove their point, and they were done only on food. Mr Ronaldson-Absolute rubbish.",51
62,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Why should I have to stand here and hear it said that it is rubbish? The words are on the paper; 47 per cent is 47 per cent. Opposition members talk about going into the supermarket. Of course, I am the one who does go into the supermarket all the time. I challenge those opposite to take the suits off their backs, go into a dress shop or a hardware shop and go through this book of nearly 70,000 products which the Australian public, those opposite have all agreed, recognise as 'Made in Australia', with the 'Australian Made' logo. That is what the Australian public thinks it Cobb, M. R. means when they see the green and gold kangaroo. When they see it on a pair of stockings, they know that the fibre probably did not come from Australia. When they see it on tyres, because they have been manufactured here rather than offshore, they know that the rubber did not come from Australia. When they buy a chocolate that has been made here, they know that the cocoa came from somewhere else but that the milk and sugar and the work that went into making that chocolate were Australian. That is why they agree with and they are happy for that to be proudly named 'Made in Australia', as all those products are. Very few products in Australia now, apart from food, can be called 'Product of Australia' because very few can source all their ingredients in Australia. We have come up with the only legislation that will work.",52
63,Mr RONALDSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Ballarat) (1.00 p.m.)The leaves are falling off the olive branch. I can tell you now that the reason the people are not in here from your side is that a great majority of them totally disagree with the government's legislation and they have told me and my colleagues personally that they reckon it is absolute bunkum. To use your expression, they think this legislation is rubbish and they know very well that Australian people think that 'Made in Australia' should mean made in Australia.

64,Ms MCHUGH,AYES,"Grayndler-Minister for Consumer Affairs) (1.10 p.m.}-I move: (3) Clause 3, page 4, lines 8 and 9, proposed section 65VG, omit ""also carry a representation in words that identffies the place or places of origin of the components or ingredients of the goods"", substitute: ""also carry a representation in words that identi fies: AYES. (a) the place of origin of the goods; or (b) the place or places of origin of the components or ingredients of the goods"". I also take this opportunity to table a supplementary explanatory memorandum. This amendment is to section 65VG. That section currently requires that, where a repreNA sentation identifies a particular production step which has happened in Australia, then the place or places of origin of the components or ingredients of the product must also be identified. As I said in my second reading speech, this is to ensure that consumers are not given partial and potentially misleading information, like the bag of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). .This amendment to the section adds a further option. Suppliers can either identify the source of ingredients or components, or they can identify the place of origin of the goods. This amendment has two purposes. The first is to give suppliers and manufacturers another way of identifying particular places within Australia. Goods which qualify to be labelled with one of the authorised terms, these being terms that identify Australia as the place of origin, can also be labelled with a particular production step which happened in a particular place within Australia without having to identify the source of the ingredients or components. So labelsÂ· like 'Product of Australia. Brewed in Tasmania' or 'Made in Australia. Handcrafted at Berrirna, New South Wales' will be permitted. The second purpose is to make it clear that representations such as 'Product of India' or 'Made in England' will be accepted on goods that are labelled with an Australian production PAIRS step. The note to this section has as one of its examples 'Packed in Australia. Product of India'. There was some doubt that representations of this .typewould meet the requirements of the section. As such representations meet the intention of the section, this section is being amended to clarify that these representations will"" be permitted.",53
65,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"Wide Bay) (1.12 p.m.}-The coalition will not be opposing this particular . amendment because it does help in clarifying - this vexed question of regional labelling. As I said earlier, the solutions offered by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) are not completely acceptable to some of those who have been placing a great deal of promotional emphasis on their regional labels, but it does ensure that regional identification can at least continue. The minister did not specifically refer in her comments to the concern that has been expressed about the words 'followed by' after the 'Product of Australia' label but I understand that the intention is that that not be prescriptive and that it would in fact be possible to say, for instance, 'Processed in Wangaratta. Product of Australia'. It does not have to be the other way around. Either option is permissible. Ms MCHugh-Yes. But that's the other amendment.",53
66,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"-I appreciate that. It only arises really under the issue of regional labelling. This is a positive step and it does help to enable some of those communities that have rightly been promoting their own region through their products to continue to do so though, as I said earlier, most of them, probably all of them, will have to change the wording of their label to comply with these new requirements.",54
67,Mr NEVILLE,NOES,"I am not here to prolong this unnecessarily but I just see a bit of inconsistency creeping in here. I would be pleased to hear the comments of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) on it. We have just heard how regional type products could be identified. However, what happens if a regional product uses terminology which is in conflict with the spirit of the bill? Let me give as an example, in the event of the government's legislation being carried in its present form, a product labelled 'Made in Australia. Product ofWangaratta' or 'Product ofKingaroy' or 'Produce ofKingaroy' or-if the coalition's amendments were to be carried, and the lowest category were 'Manufactured in Australia'-'Manufactured in Australia. Product of the Darling Downs'? Can you see the point I am making? Where we have established a categorisation of' produce,' 'product,' 'made in' and, possibly, 'manufactured' - depending on what happens in the Senate-and we have these four categories, what happens if a regional title is in conflict? I would be interested to know whether you have provided for that in the legislation, because in a way that could undo the spirit of what we are doing. For example, if it was labelled 'Product of Tasmania' or 'Produce of the Darling Downs', would that not imply that the classification to that regional area would have to carry the same rigour as it does in the legislation itself? If as a subtitle it had 'Produce of Tasmania', would that product have to have been wholly sourced in Tasmania, or if it had 'Product of the Darling Downs', would it have to have been sourced wholly from the Darling Downs? In other words, does the spirit of the legislation have to apply through any subtitling?",54
68,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"As the amendment to section 65VE, which we have already agreed to, made clear, those specific terms that we have defined-'product of, 'produce of or 'made in'--can be used only with' Australia'. When we talk about regional identification, one can have, say 'Brewed in Tasmania' if one is talking about beer or something like that. The reason why we keep talking about Tasmania is that we have used so many examples of labels already to convince Tasmanians that they can identify their region, or in this case their state, all over it in many creative ways, but without using the words 'product of or 'made in'. The words 'product of and 'made in' or 'produce of are with Australia. They are the words that we have defined and, because we have defined them, it does give specific meaning to 'product of or 'produce of, and that is one of the reasons the Tasmanians were ill advised to want to be able to use 'Product of Tasmania', because even their own government said that it is very unlikely that every ingredient would be actually Tasmanian, even of some of the fine quality Tasmanian products of which they quite properly want to boast. Mr Truss-It is possible, is it not, for them to use 'Product of Australia Product of Tasmania'?",54
69,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"No, it is not, and I tried correct you across the table when you were saying that earlier. We do not see it as a and precisely. difficulty, but it is something that must be understood; that any product which people claim to be Australian now-do not forget that this is a voluntary thing-has to fit categories 'Produce of Australia' or 'Product of Australia' or 'Made in Australia', and people can add as many further descriptions as they like about the region. Alternatively, you do not fit our definition of 'Product Australia' or 'Made in Australia' then you have toÂ· describe a stage in the process with all the sourcing of overseas origin and Mr Truss-You cannot use 'product', 'produce' or 'made' with any other word than Australia? That is not a very good feature.",55
70,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"The whole point of this legislation, and I specifically heard one of the opposition speakers go to this point in talking about the regional identification, plicity. What consumers want more than anything is to get rid of the confusion. can say almost anything now, and that is what has made it so hard for the courts and it what has made it so easy for people to get away with deception. We have made it 'made', categoric and clear, but we have still allowed regional areas to boast their particular attribof utes. MrNEVILLE(Hinkler) (1.19 p.m.)-This has been a very enlightening little sideline to the debate, because I do not think that tion is abroad. I accept what the Minister Consumer Affairs said, that if you are going to have the essence of simplicity, you have got to stick to those three terminologies 'produce', 'product' and 'made in'. NevertheAustralian; less, I do not think the various explanations that have gone ahead of this legislation ensured that that is well understood and well accepted in the regions. Assuming coalition is not going to offer any more opposition to the bill, I would appeal to minister for there to be an educative process in this, because I think a lot of regions lot of states believe that they will be able use those three terminologies, and I think should correct that confusion very early in the piece. Otherwise, it is going to be a mishmash to of second-guessing the government. I think you ought to get that out on the table quickly",55
71,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"That process has certainly been gone through at great the length with the industries and producers in those states where there was a problemmainly Tasmania. There will be an educative program which will be very clear, because the if new wording is so simple. Australians-and of those producers who wish to claim that their goods are Australian-will have to learn that only something that is wholly Australian will so on. be marked 'product of or 'Produce of Australia', whilst 'Australian Made' means what it says. Everything after that, any claim to some partial Australianness, will have to describe the process and the real origin.",55
72,Mr TRUSS,NOES,This is something that I am somewhat disappointed is its simto learn about. Ms MCHugh-It is very simple. We have People already agreed to it.,55
73,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"This is one of the things that is will cause some additional concern. The bill is basically outlawing the use of words like 'product' or 'produce' on any regional labelling. That was not my understanding the way in which it was proposed and that is going to cause concern in states that were using those sorts of labels. My understanding was that it would be possible to use 'Product percepof Australia' or 'Product of Tasmania'. for However, if the word 'Product of Tasmania' were used, it would clearly have to be a product of Tasmania absolutely, in the same of way as a product of Australia is absolutely there could not be any ingredient from another state. But to outlaw those words have altogether would seem to be unnecessarily restrictive. That is something that we will that the need to look at further.",55
74,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"I will just say that it is very clearly in the bill. I have and a been so courteous throughout this debate, to despite the abuse that has been heaped on me you by members generally, and I will allow myself to say that, if this is evidence of the lack of understanding of the basics of this bill by another shadow minister-there have been so many who have had to learn it-then those opposite might begin to understand that there is a great deal about the bill that they have refused to understand.",55
75,Mr TRUSS,NOES,"I point out, in the same spirit of patience, that there were government amendments proposed to clarify the situation in relation to regionalisation, and that is where the confusion has occurred. The government changed the bill pretty significantly when it agreed to-in its terms clarify, but in other people's terms recognise-the right of regional labelling to continue. It is in that process where this misunderstanding has occurred. As I said, there will be plenty of opportunities for us to look at this again in the future, and we will be revisiting it.",56
76,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"Revisit it if you like, in your own mind, dear colleague! But it was ih the bill at section 65VE. It was clearly outlined in the explanatory memorandum. It was always possible in the bill for regions to identify themselves as they can now. It was only because there has been such doubt caused, such confusion aroused, by those with some sort of axe to grind about this legislation that we actually clarified it with that very complicated amendment. But it was certainly in the bill. In the explanatory memorandum, paragraph 15, it says quite specifically that the effect of this section is to prohibit the use of representations such as 'Manufactured in Australia' or 'Produced in Tasmania' or 'Made in Canberra', A label which now reads 'Made in Bendigo' will therefore have to be amended to read, for The example, 'Made in Australia at Bendigo'. I say to the opposition spokesperson 'on this matter: read it again, but do not revisit it, because we have already been through all. this. That is a core piece of the bill which the opposition has just opposed. If the opposition does not understand something as basic as that, which is spelt out so clearly-it says that a label cannot say 'Made in Bendigo'; it has to say 'Made in Australia at Bendigo'-it is no wonder the opposition has understood so little about the rest of it.",56
77,Mr NEVILLE,NOES,"Hinkler) (1.26 p.m.)There is a bit of confusion, even in the wording of the bill. I refer the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) to page 3 of the bill.",56
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Newell)We are debating government amendment No. 3. Your remarks have to be confined to that.,56
79,Mr NEVILLE,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am only introducing page 3 of the bill and identifying the section to show that there is an ambiguity between what the minister has just said as it applies to this amendment and what is in the bill. On page 3 of the bill, in the note to 65VE(1), it refers to terms such as 'produce of Queensland's Darling Downs', 'produced in Tasmania' and 'made in Australia'. Could the minister comment on that, Mr Deputy Speaker?",56
80,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"I also found that note a little confusing, but what it was doing was describing the terms that could be classified as unambiguous. We have said that from now on we are only allowing a couple of unambiguous terms to be used: 'Product of Australia', 'Produce of Australia' and 'Made in Australia'. They are now the only unambiguous terms allowed.",56
81,Mr NEVILLE,NOES,"It specifically says 'produce of Queensland's Darling Downs'. If 'produce', 'product' and 'made in' are no longer acceptable terms, what are they doing in that explanatory note?",56
82,Ms MCHUGH,NOES,"As I just said, 65VE(l) says: corporation must not supply goods that carry an express and unambiguous Australian. origin representation in words except as authorised by subsection (2). It gives examples of 'express and unambiguous Australian origin representations', and then says that from now on the only ones that can be used are those authorised in subsection (2). Those terms.are 'Produce of Australia', 'Product of Australia? orÂ· 'Made in Australia'. That is exactly what we have been debating all day. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Ms MCHugh)-by leave-read a third time. ANZAC DAY BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 8 December. Second Reading",56
83,Mr SCIACCA,NOES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In this special year of remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, it is my great honour to introduce into this parliament a bill providing for ANZAC Day to continue to be observed on 25 April each year and to declare ANZAC Day as the national day of commemoration. The object of the bill is to ensure that, for current and future generations of Australians, the contribution of all those who served Australia in time of war is commemorated and remembered, so that ANZAC Day will continue to hold an important and special place in the hearts and minds of all Australians. The significance of ANZAC Day in forging Australia's national identity in a very special way is known to us all. It is timely, however, to recall the legacy of ANZAC and what it symbolises. One newspaper editorial of the time described the meaning of the achievement of ANZAC in the following terms: Before the ANZACs astonished the watching nations, our national sentiment was of a flabby and sprawling character. We were Australians in name ... but we had been taught by our politicians not to trust ourselves-wewere constantly admonished by our daily journals to remember that we were nothing better than a joint in the tail of a great Empire. There were patriots who protested against [this] slavish and sycophantic doctrine. But, generally speaking, it was assumed that Australia only lived by the grace of England, and the Empire Day orators had a better hearing than the faithful who clung to Australia Day and gave special honour to their own starry banner. ANZAC day has changed all that . . . No matter how the war may .end-and it can only end in one way-we are at last a nation, with one heart, one soul, and one thrilling aspiration. There can be no doubt that the ANZAC achievement signalled the fulfilment of the promise of nationhood in the fledgling Australian federation. The deeds of Australian soldiers at ANZAC gave birth to a belief in the capacity of all Australians to attain for themselves a uniquely independent and proud national identity. The ANZAC tradition embodied a true sense of national character. For the first time, it set Australia and Australians apart by demonstrating their willingness and capacity to have Australia's voice heard in its own right in the community of nations of which it was a part. There is no question either that the ANZAC tradition is the unifying symbol of the sacrifice made by Australian service men and women. Nor is there any doubt about its subsequent influence on later generations of Australians who continue to uphold that tradition. The willingness to meet this sacrifice instilled in Australians a sense of pride in themselves and their achievements. This bill ensures that, as time slips by, the courage, fortitude and selfless sacrifice of the ANZACs and those who followed them will not be forgotten, but remembered in a special way. By declaring ANZAC Day as the national day of commemoration to be observed on 25 April each year, their deeds, and those of all Australian service men and women and others who have served the nation in time of war, will not only be remembered and commemorated, but serve as an ideal which will inspire and guide future generations of Australians. I am mindful also that, in focusing attention on the significance of commemoration and remembrance, the tragic aftermath of war should not be forgotten. In this sense, I believe that this bill symbolises the debt owed by the nation to those whose lives were affected by war. It is, therefore, a timely reminder of the continuing commitment of the Australian government to honour and serve souls veterans and their war widows through programs of care, compensation and commemoration. I commend the bill to the House.",57
84,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"I formally welcome the participation of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) in this debate and thank him for his attendance in the House. This issue of ANZAC Day epitomises the idea of bipartisanship amongst all sectors of this parliament. On behalf of the coalition, I take pleasure in leading the debate on this very important piece of legislation. The intention of the ANZAC Day Bill is to entrench 25 April, ANZAC Day, each yearand I have underlined the words 'each year' in my speech notes-as, in the words of the bill: the national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who served Australia (including those who died) in time of war and in war-like conflicts ... The people referred to in the bill are the people who risked all and/or lost all to defend our nation and our nation's values. It is significant that this legislation is being debated in the first week of the parliamentary sittings for 1995. As everyone would be aware, 1995 is the 50th anniversary year of the ending of the conflicts of the Second World War, with 8 May and 15 August being the most significant dates of celebration. I will return to that matter later. On 25 April 1915, Australian and New Zealand forces landed at Gallipoli and demonstrated to the world the courage, heroism, commitment, innovation and competence of Australian service personnel. That tradition has continued in subsequent conflicts. ANZAC Day is both the conventional and the appropriate date to commemorate the contribution of all Australians who have participated in the defence of Australia and of Australia's values. However, ANZAC Day represents neither the most significant nor the only participation by Australian troops which must be remembered. Australians first left our shores to participate in a conflict in 1860. Australia's first official involvement as a country in a conflict was in New Zealand in the second Anglo-Maori wars. One ship and some 2,500 soldiers from Australia participated in that conflict alongside New Zealand regiments. On 3 March 1885, a New South Wales contingent of 770 soldiers fought in the Sudan for approximately two months. Considering the means of travel in those days, those soldiers probably spent more time travelling to the Sudan than they spent in actual conflict. Between 11 October 1899 and 1 June 1902, approximately 16,500 Australians served in colonial and Commonwealth contingents in the Boer War in South Africa. Between 6 August 1900 and 25 April 1901,560 Australians from the New South Wales, South Australian and Victorian colonial navy contingents served in the Boxer Rebellion in China. We then come to some of the major conflicts, the first of which was known as the First World War. More than 10 per cent of the population of Australia volunteered to fight-over 400,000 people from a population of four million. Over 60,000 of those people died, and 150,000 were wounded. Hardly a family in Australia was unaffected. Some significant dates during that time were 4 August 1914, when Australia formally entered the European war; 25 April 1915, when troops landed at Gallipoli; and 23 July 1916 to 3 September 1916; the Battle of Pozieres. There were other engagements. I will not bore the House with all the dates, but these engagements include: the Battle of Passchendaele; the charge of the Light-Horse Brigade at Beersheba in the Middle East on 17 November 1917; and during 1918, on the western front, the battle of Villers-Bretonneux; and, of course, 'we eventually attended Armistice Day. In that regard it is notable that the innovation of our military commanders was highlighted during that period. In - n article in the Australian on 10 November 1993 there was an historical report of the success of an attack on a significant German outpost at Hamel on 4 July 1918. It contrasted markedly with the conventional military tactics of the day which resulted generally in very lengthy conflicts and massive casualties. They were wars of attrition with 500,000 deaths and, as the newspaper article points out, the commanders in those conflicts worked on the principle that he who had two or three men standing had won the conflict. That was an outrageous situation notwithstanding that it was the convention of the day. But on 4 July 1918 an Australian commander, Lieutenant General Sir John Monash, employed new and radical tactics to achieve his objective of occupying this heavily defended outpost at Hamel and he did so with brand new tactics. He combined the use of tanks and other weapons and achieved his objective from beginning to end in 93 minutes. He was disappointed with that because prior to that particular attack he had predicted he would occupy the enemy trenches in 90 minutes. He was only three minutes out. It is reported that subsequently his tactics almost ftnished that war. His tactics were used consistently through,out-and remember that this was on 4 July 1918. I have already reminded the House that it was only four months later that the war was over. Whilst we consider the wonderful deeds of valour of the privates and the corporals, it is worth considering what a brilliant job our commanders did back there in 1914-18. I think these are the things that will be remembered as we continue to recognise ANZAC Day as that day of commemoration for all these conflicts. It is worth recognising also Australia's involvement in the Second World War and the contribution that occurred there. We think of places such as Benghazi, EI Alamein, Kokoda, Tobruk and, of course, that magniftcent involvement of Australian troops defending our country throughout Papua New Guinea. I have mentioned the signiftcant dates and the ftrs- is 8 May 1945 when victory was achieved in Europe and the second is 15 August 1945 when the Paciftc conflict was ended with the surrender of the Japanese. We then look, to the involvement of Australians in Australian servicemen & servicewomen who NA New Zealand 1860-61 (Official (Anglo-Maori) Australian involve- Victoria 1860-61 ment) Sudan 3/3/1885-8/5/1885 the Korean War where about 17,000 Australians fought between 1950 and 1953. Another 7,000 were involved in the Malayan Emergency between 1950 and 1960. And there were another 3,500 Australians involved in the Indonesian confrontation between 1963 and 1966. Approximately 50,000 defence personnel were involved in the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1973 with 520 Australians killed and some 2,400 wounded. One of the more signiftcant battles occurred there on 18 August 1966, the Battle of Long Tan. Since then several peacekeeping engagements have been undertaken by Australian defence personnel in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Mozambique and the Middle East. Australia attends these peacekeeping efforts not only because of the expertise of its personnel but also because they are welcome around the world as genuine peacekeepers. Australia has never found itself as an aggressor. Australia has always had the recognition and respect of other people in the world if our troops are invited onto their soil, and I am very proud to think that is the case. In 1990 the Australian ships HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Darwin arrived in the Middle East as part of the United Nations force involved in the Gulf War against Iraq and our involvement there again was positive. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have asked the minister if we might have incorporated in Hansard the statistics of the casualties of all those confrontations that I have mentioned, and I seek leave at this time to have those included in Hansard. Leave granted. ..

85,Mr TUCKEY,CONFLICT DATES,"In summary, might I add that those statistics show us that 102,601 Australians have died in the conflicts listed, that 225,737 were wounded and that 34,730 became prisoners of war at some time. So there has been a substantial involvement of Australians, and that substantial involvement has frequently been in going to the aid of others, but in all cases protecting our values and the democracies of other nations. But, of course, in the Second World War that changed. That was the first and only war that was actually fought on and from Australian soil. Again, it is a very significant aspect of this parliament to create a day of commemoration to remind future generations that war got that close.

But I have a personal recollection of what war meant-not in the tragedies we still see in the daily press and on television of people's houses burst apart and the tragedies that go with war when it is right on your doorstep; as a resident of Perth as a lad, my recollections were severe enough. There were trenches in the schoolyard. I amaze people when I tell them of my other recollection, that we all went to school with a piece of string around our neck with a cork on it, because we were told that when the bombs went off-and we got past the point of doubting that that might happen-we would have to put the corks in our mouths to save our eardrums. I am not sure if that would have worked. Fortunately, we never put it to a practical test. But the children of Darwin did and the children of Broome did. We had wars on Australian soil, not necessarily hand-tohand fighting but probably the most dreadful part of war as we see it today, aerial attack. Australia can never again believe itself to be insulated from the threat of war, tragic as that statement might be. It is therefore very appropriate to recognise, as this legislation proposes, the contribution of Australian servicemen-all those hundreds of thousands-over the years, and it is appropriate that it be done in this way and appropriate that it be legislated by the federal parliament. I am delighted that in doing all of that we have concentrated the activities or the commemorations of that day as we have. It is simply a day to remember those people and their gift to Australia by going overseas to defend our understandings of democracy against totalitarianism and, of course, as time has gone by, to defend this country and its people and its values. It is an extremely important day. The other aspect of this year is that the government has chosen, again with total coalition support, to nominate this year as the year in which Australia remembers. I am delighted to be cooperating with the minister in the various functions that he proposes to recognise the significant dates throughout this year. It is important that we use this year, as I said, as much as we will continue to use ANZAC Day, as a time to remind people of what history has taught us in terms of defending the things we hold dear. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, are actively involved with your own electorate in organising electorate functions. The government has provided some funding, using the geographic boundaries of our electorates, which I think is appropriate, and I just take the opportunity to mention that the people of my electorate have risen to this challenge with enthusiasm. It is not as simple as some might experience because the electorate of O'Connor is about the same size as the state of Victoria. Could you, Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine conducting a committee meeting in Bendigo, with some of the participants 700 miles apart? With the aid of technology we have managed to overcome the problem of distance by teleconferencing meetings, which has worked quite well. In that context we chose to use the local government ward areas of the Country Shire Councils Association to give us some geographic designation, which gave us five districts plus the city of Geraldton, which is big enough in population terms to stand on its own. I record my thanks to Mrs Ainslie Evans who is from Katanning, or the great southern ward, and has accepted the chairmanship of our committee; and to Geoff Foster, Frank Ludovico, Paul Anderson, Ian Dew, and Ray Underwood, for their participation on the committee. We had to also ask ourselves what sort of activity was appropriate in an area of that size, and the committee opted for an essay competition, but an essay competition with a slight difference. We expect groups of young people--starting with years 6 and 7-to act as reporters, go into their own community and interview people who went to one of the wars or undertook the many duties in rural areas that kept the home fires burning, such as women who ran family farms, operated machinery, grew crops and joined the Women's Land Army. Many people still within the community had a close association with the war effort, so they will be interviewed and essays about their experiences will be written. We think that that project will encourage those children to learn more of what it was like in that period of time. Using the funds, I think we have 50 or 60 prizes. We have been able to make them fairly modest, but the No. 1 prize is an electronic diary, which will be for the very best effort. We are grateful to the teachers of all the schools within my electorate. In total, there are 147, but they will not all participate because they do not all necessarily go to those years. We are having three groups involved in this fundamental activity. I thank all of those people who have chosen to participate. I am sure other members will be anxious to use this debate to advise the House of the activities of their communities in this regard. It is interesting how much war activity occurred in the electorate of O'Connor. In the town of Nungarin, for example, there was a major facility, storing plant and equipment, of which one building remains. As its contribution to this year, the local community is turning that building, which for years has operated as the shire works depot, back into a war museum. I am told that the building was originally a facility that at one stage stored 10,000 motorbikes, amongst huge quantities of other equipment, in case someone attacked Australia. Scattered around what is now farmland are the remains of brick walls and so on, the value of which the community has begun to recognise. I recently visited the location with the State President of the RSL, Len Keynes, and the Governor of Western Australia, also a military man, Major General Jeffrey. The armed services also attended, and I would like to recognise their contribution in travelling the 150 to 180 miles into rural country to put on an excellent parade, which added so much to the activities of the day. I am also grateful to the defence forces for bringing quite a lot of equipment to the museum. The locals are still trying to gather up all the old wrecks and restore them, so our visitors filled the museum with more modern pieces. It is a great pity that it did not happen a bit sooner. When all this ordnance was disposed of from Mundaring, a lot of it-such as tanks and Bren gun carriers-went straight out into the rural areas as land clearing machinery. Some were even used as tractors. I am just old enough to remember when that was commonplace. There were articles in the newspapers about blokes running around in tanks, and knocking down trees on their farms. Such a lot of it has been allowed to rust away, but people are now scouring the countryside. Some of these items have been collected and it will be interesting to see how they are restored over time. Again, I welcome the government's initiative. I thank the private members, particularly the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), who initiated this proposal. They are to be congratulated. I thank the government for picking up their proposal and using it in the way that it has. This proposal has the total support of the opposition. We think it is right and proper and that Australia will benefit by having a formal reminder throughout its future history--each year, as the legislation says. We will see increasing interest from young people in this commemoration. I am reminded of the increasing number of young people who turn up at Gallipoli. Friends of mine who attended the ceremony last year estimated that there were more than 2,000 young people there. It is wonderful to think that young Australians are starting to remember that aspect of the past. I suppose that is the reason that they stay here in Australia as free people. That is what it is all about.",60
86,Mr HOLDING,RAAF,"There are good days and bad days for politics and for this parliament. For me-and, I am certain, for all honourable membersthis is a good day, because it shows the unanimous view of this House as to the importance of ANZAC Day and what it means to coming generations. The reality is that this concept of a national day of commemoration, which has been long sought by the ex-service community, is an idea whose time has well and truly come. I have spoken on two occasions about the importance of ANZAC Day. I do not propose to take up more time of the House on it, as I have been here long enough to know it is important to get this sort of legislation through quickly. But I do want to say several things. Firstly, I want to make the general point that in the broad community this parliament seems to get most attention when a decent sized political brawl takes place. This motion, which had its origins in a private member's motion, involved prior discussion at a cross-party level and I want to thank my colleague the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for his support and assistance. I want to thank all those members who participated in the debate on that motion, which indicated clearly to the government the level of support that this proposal had. I particularly want to thank the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who picked up this idea with much enthusiasm and, with characteristic energy, did all the work that was necessary to bring it through cabinet. Those of us who have been ministers know that this is not always an easy task. I also want to thank the National President of the RSL, Digger James, the Victorian President, Bruce Ruxton, and all those members of the national executive who gave this concept their total support and commitment. I also want to mention the thousands of members of the ex-service community who inundated this House with petitions in support of this concept. It shows what can be done when members of this House speak to each other across our political division for the purposes of producing a concept which is very important to future generations of Australians. It is noteworthy on this important occasion when the House is speaking with one voice that the press gallery is almost empty. Perhaps that says something about the nature of the relationship that exists. I commend all of my colleagues who brought about what I believe is a very important contribution to our society and to the way in which we view those who responded, often by making a tremendous sacrifice, to the needs of this nation. I commend the minister, the government and all those parliamentarians who brought this day about.",62
87,Mr LIEBERMAN,RAAF,"I, too, would like to offer my words of support for the ANZAC Day Bill 1994 which is designed to enshrine ANZAC Day at last in federal legislation as a law of the Commonwealth as it day to commemorate and to represent so many things not only for this generation of Australians but for future generations of Australians. In doing so, I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for his vigorous promotion of the legislation and for bringing it here today, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and, from my side of politics, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for having brought in private members' proposals on behalf of all the political colours of this parliament. Also, I would like to record my appreciation to the members of RSLs in both my electorate of Indi and in my former state electorate of Benambra. It was whilst I was the state member for Benambra that this proposal by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Cook was first publicly promoted. I thank, too, the many thousands of people who helped me with letters and signatures on petitions in north-east Victoria, all of which have helped to make Australians' voices heard in the parliament. I believe that this day of commemoration has more significance now and will grow in significance as the years go by. Our nation is very young. We are not the sort of people generally to go out and parade as do some other nations. We do not have the characteristics of extroverts; sometimes Australians are a bit reticent about things. But without a doubt there is one day in the year throughout the whole of Australia when we notice the intensity of feeling, community, fellowship, friendship and remembrance manifested by Australians individually, and that day of course is ANZAC Day. On ANZAC Day last year in Wodonga I was pleased to see an increased number of young people attending ANZAC Day celebrations. From talking with my colleagues, I understand that they too have been observing that ANZAC Day appears to be attracting more interest and more participation from young people in the community. That is exactly why this particular day deserves to be enshrined in legislation. The other point I will make, and I make it only as a passing reference because I do not think any state would seriously do anything to undermine ANZAC Day, is that it is true that under Australia's legal system ANZAC Day is celebrated as a public holiday in Australia because of the states having legislated for that purpose. Should one of the states lose its respect for ANZAC Day, then in theory the parliament of that state could cease to recognise ANZAC Day as a day of commemoration and as a day for a public holiday. By passing this legislation, the Commonwealth parliament will send out a signal to indicate that no unilateral action by a state could do that, although 1 emphasise that it would never be likely to contemplate that. 1 think that is a nice point to put on the record. ANZAC Day means so much to so many people. My late father served in the First World War and the Second World War. 1 remember taking him to ANZAC Day ceremonies in the last years of his life when was not well at all. When he could not march any longer, 1 still took him there and 1 saw the effect that that day had on him. It was quite a moving experience and one that 1 enjoyed sharing with him. Fortunately, 1 never had to serve overseas. I am a member of the lucky generation that did not have to do so, because of the sacrifice of so many Australian men and women who fought in wars to defend democracy in this country. 1 did take part in national service. When we were training at Puckapunyal in the armoured regiment and later on in the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles, which had a great historical significance with the Light Horse Brigade, the pride and history of ANZAC Day and what it meant to Australia's defence forces was all around us. You could not help but pick it up. Such is the case if you talk young, new recruits of any of the armed forces of Australia who are going through basic training and then into their postings. They will share with you their appreciation ANZAC Day. It is an ongoing torch that lights the way for people who still offer their to, and take up a career in, the defence forces. There are very large defence establishments in my electorate of Indi at Bonegilla-REME, ordnance, transport, TAFE training and survey and other associatsymbol ed attachments. A lot of the many thousands of people who came from war-torn Europe after the Second World War as immigrants made their first home in my area of north-east VictoriaAlbury-W odonga. They were first at the Bonegilla migrant centre, which is now pronounced 'Bonygilla' because the Europeans could not say 'BonegilIa'.1I have got to know quite a few of those people. A lot of them fought against tyranny and the Nazis in their home country; they were in concentration camps and went through terrible .ordeals. Many of those people, classified as 'new Australians' by most, go along to ANZAC Day as part of their remembrance and also as an indication of their feeling of involvement with Australia-the country that has given them freedom and safety. One of my good friends, Andrew he Rutkowski, was a Polish army officer. One day when he wore his medals from the Polish army, he told me about one of his experiences. He was a member of the Polish cavalry, which road its horses against the advancing German armoured tanks as they invaded Poland. Andrew was severely wounded and finished up in a concentration camp. He migrated to Australia and became very much involved in the community; he was in fact the town clerk of the rural city of W odonga. The member for Melbourne Ports probably met him. Andrew was a shining example of what his adopted country meant to him on ANZAC Day. We should remember that ANZAC Day has a wide significance for many people, not just for those who served in the wars for Australia. The Australia Remembers year of 1995 to could not be a better year for this legislation to come through the parliament. During Australia Remembers people will be participating in many functions and events throughof out Australia to honour and thank all the men and women who defended Australia in the lives Second World War, who stayed at home to make Australia safe, and who provided food and factory production and munitions to keep Bandiana and the community going. The Australia Remembers year is another of ANZAC Day by remembering those of this nation who were involved in the Second World War. It carries on the tradition set out by the armed forces at Gallipoli. 1 also have heard-although 1I have never had the pleasure of visiting Gallipoli-that on ANZAC Day it is absolutely incredible to observe the number of young Australian tourists who make it their business to be at Gallipoli to participate in the ceremonies. That is a significant example being set by our young Australians. That is why I am very confident that, when all of the people who served in 25 April means. these wars do pass on, as inevitably they will, future generations of Australians will ensure that ANZAC Day continues to be commemorated, which of course is the purpose of this legislation. The bottom line for doing that will be to remember the people that make a nation, the people before us who gave their lives and suffered so much to make sure this country was safe and could grow. Looking into the next century, which is 1990. only five years off, from my perspective it is not difficult to see Australians who have never fought in wars-and I hope that they will never have to fight in wars-actually continuing to remember the symbol of ANZAC Day and the incredible experiences of those young people, so many of whom were from Australia. Those young people were thrown into a foreign country, into a strange against a foe about whom they knew nothing. In fact, now many people from Turkey have a deep respect for Australia built on the tradition of what happened over there in those incredible days. I am sure that that tradition will go on partly because of this legislation being passed through the parliament to make old friend. sure that the day is a special day that is recognised in the statute law of Australia.",63
88,Mr LES SCOTT,RAAF,"I congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) on his role date in getting the ANZAC Day Bill before the parliament. This bill is just a single paper. Quite often many bills that come before this place are larger than this. However, I would suggest that the few words in this bill say a lot more than many of those big, heavy bills that come before us. The title of the bill says so much when it states: An Act to declare ANZAC Day, on 25 April, to the national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who have served Australia (including those in time of war and in war-like conflicts Although the bill consists of only one page, it says a lot about Australia's pride in its history and what ANZAC Day means to this country by declaring 25 April its national day of commemoration. It is important that we always take the opportunity to recognise what In April 1990 I visited Gallipoli on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the landing. I was honoured and privileged to be one of the representatives of this parliament to up visit Gallipoli on that memorable occasion. up When this bill was first presented to the House I reflected on that visit. The report of the visit by the parliamentary party to Gallipoli was handed down on 18 October ANZAC allows us to consider what it is to be Australian. It has meant a lot to many Australian families and to all of us who have made a contribution. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has acknowledged the contribution made by the RSL. On Monday I attended the funeral of a very old family war friend, Mr Henry Heney, at the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Mr Heney was a veteran of the Second World War. So many veterans of that war are now in their 70s and 80s and are passing on. At Mr Heney's funeral the RSL, through the local branch president, paid tribute to all veterans and, in particular, to my This bill is important in that it allows us to commemorate a day like ANZAC Day. The day will never be forgotten. ANZAC Day helps us to remember. Australians are paying more to attention to ANZAC Day now than they did when I was growing up. That certainly applies piece of to the children in our schools. It is significant that this bill is before us when we are commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. long We remember those who served at Gallipoli and we remember those who served Australia in all theatres of war. Unfortunately, we have be had too many of those involvements, but they have all been in the cause of peace. It is who died) important for us to remember that. I am gratified to see the bipartisan support that the Australia Remembers program is receiving. I acknowledge the importance of what the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said in relation to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I acknowledge the presence of the people in the galleries. The press gallery is vacant, apart from the usual reporter from AAP who is often there. Parliament is not being broadcast at the moment. I think these proceedings should be broadcast on television because this is an important bill. When we remember the end of the Second World War we need to think about a lot of people. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon, London, in the United Kingdom. So many Australians took part in the Battle of Britain. I met Dr Michael A. Fopp, the director of the museum. I took some material to London and showed Dr Fopp what Australia was doing by way of commemoration this year. Dr Fopp was particularly impressed with Australia's contribution. Obviously, the UK and other countries will be involved in similar activities. I talk specifically about the air force because my own father served in the Royal Australian Air Force in Great Britain during the Second World War and was very closely associated with the Royal Air Force, as was Dr Fopp's father. In fact, he was one of those who went to Britain and decided to stay there after the war. Dr Fopp wrote to me in relation to the contribution that Australians made during the Second World War in Britain. Whilst he acknowledged that it was very hard to distinguish anyone group-he is right in saying that-priorities needed to be clear. He said: I feel a significant commemoration of the part played by Australiansin Bomber Command should be made. There was hardly an RAF Squadron without its sprinkling of Australians (and other Commonwealth countries) and they had a significant impact on the effectiveness of the RAF. Indeed, as I mentioned to you, my own father was one of the Australian Battle of Britain pilots. Dr Fopp has visited Australia on many occasions and maintains a very close interest. He acknowledges very much the contribution that Australians made in the Second World War. During this particular year we need to focus on the contributions that many of our people made in Europe as well as in the Pacific because they are two significant events-the 8 May victory in Europe and the 15 August victory in the Pacific-and we should give them equal importance. It is a time for us to remember and to reflect on both those occasions. Actually, one of the things in the museum is a short film about the film The Dambusters, a film I am sure we have all seen. There is also an honour roll on which many Australians are acknowledged. When we see a film like that we remember the time so well, and it is important to do that. One of Dr Fopp's assistants, John Freeborn, also assisted on this day and showed me around all these various things. He showed me that film and asked if I had ever seen the film The Dambusters. I said, 'Of course I have. Who hasn't?' That was my reaction and it is significant, considering how many Australians served our country overseas. I think it is an important time for us this year to be focusing on our national pride and national significance. I do not want to take all the time allocated to me today because I know there are others who wish to speak. It is important that we all have this opportunity. Getting back to Gallipoli and the significance of that visit for me, I note that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs indicated that he will be visiting there this year for the 80th anniversary. I think that is important and I acknowledge what he is doing in inviting young Australians whose relatives were at GaIIipoli to visit there as well. Being someone who had the opportunity to visit there, it is easy to become more closely involved with it. Like many other Australians, I have relatives who were there. My great uncle, whose namesake I am-another Les Scott-was at Gallipoli as an ambulance bearer. Some of those people lived to a ripe old age, as did my Uncle Les. So when you get back there and see the terrible conditions that people had to endure it really is a sad thing. The memories people have of it will always be with them, particularly memories of Lone Pine. I commend the Australian government for doing what it did at the 75th anniversary. It took a lot of those old veterans back to Lone Pine. Many of them have, sadly, passed on since. I am not sure how many of them are still with us, but it was certainly a great time for them. It was a beautiful sunny day at Lone Pine on ANZAC Day in 1990. All these old gentlemen were there. It was a moving time for us all. I know my colleagues in this place who were there with me will remember with great pride the opportunity that they were given to share the experience with those great Australians. It is extremely important to have 25 April as our national day of commemoration and to remember everything that has gone on since. We conclude our report with the words of Charles Bean from his 1948 book entitled Gal/ipoli Mission. He expressed his sentiment by quoting a statement which reads: They gave their shining youth, and raised thereby valour's own monument which shall not die. The passage of this bill will ensure that that sentiment does not die. The bill will be there after we move on. An act of parliament, which will be there forever, will ensure that all those who have fought for this nation and who did not return or who returned and have since suffered bad health, and who often have terrible memories, will always be remembered. We will ensure that the memory shall not die if we have acts like this place. I again commend everyone who has in any way supported this idea since the member for Melbourne Ports pursued this in a private member's capacity. I also commend the support given by the minister and by all my colleagues in this place. It is worthwhile for us all to support this bill so we can set in place forever this important day for Australia, our national day of commemoration, to reflect and show our great thanks and appreciation for all those who have fought, died and worked so hard for this nation. It is a matter of national pride. We can really be proud of a bill-as small as this one is; it is just a leaf bill-that is so powerful and so important to us as a nation. It is certainly my pleasure to have the opportunity to rise in this place and support it.",65
89,Mr MCGAURAN,RAAF,"Like all other members, I wish to support the ANZAC Day Bill 1994, which will instigate a national day of commemoration on 25 April of every year. One of the great privileges of being a member of parliament is being able to participate in ANZAC Day celebrations. It is always an inspiration to meet people who have served in one way or another in one, two or more of the conflicts in which young men and women have fought and served or to meet their families, who usually have bittersweet memories of the sacrifices made by relatives, often parents. I have been listening to this debate in my room and here in the chamber and I am impressed, like anybody would be, with some of the rhetoric surrounding this bill. As I represent a rural constituency, I cannot help thinking that much of the language used by speakers in this debate, and by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) when introducing this bill, has a hollow ring. I do not think we should gild the lily. There are major issues facing this country, and it seems to me that the ANZAC tradition has been turned on its head. The minister said in his second reading speech: The deeds of Australian soldiers at ANZAC gave birth to a beliefin the capacity of all Australiansto attain for themselves a uniquely independent and proud national identity. The ANZAC tradition embodied a true sense of national character. In so far as returned service men and women and their families are concerned, that is true. But, otherwise, what is our national character? When through pure, political opportunism industries such as the timber industry are being brought to their knees, what respect do we have for independence, an ability to work and earn an honest day's wage? The parliament is surrounded by men, women and their families who want to earn a decent wage under an agreed set of rules and conditions but are being denied their very livelihood. I think it is hypocritical for one member after another to stand up and talk about this onegreat Australian identity and how this parliament is paying homage to the traditions of those who have made sacrifices for the nation. A lot of people are making sacrifices today, and they are being denied any sort of recognition. You cannot represent an area like Gippsland---east Gippsland being one of the great battle lands in this war between conservationists and the timber industry-without knowing the hardship that is being suffered by so many people. The minister continued in his second reading speech: There is no question either that the ANZAC tradition is the unifying symbol of the sacrifice made by Australian service men and women. In regard to armed conflict, that is so. But in regard to everyday life in Australia today, where is the unity? We are unnecessarily pitting Australian against Australian because the legislature is becoming hostage to and is at the beck and call of a strident, extremist, unsatisfiable conservation movement. If honourable members want to stand up and glorify themselves in the deeds of others at the time of war, so be it. However, they should understand that there are immediate, pressing issues that need resolution this very day. The timber workers, associated forest product workers and their families have been here for several days and will continue to stay. In my constituency of Gippsland, Orbost-a large town of more than 4,000 people-will be closed over the next couple of days as its residents come to Canberra to impress upon the government, and the opposition when need be, the importance of their industry. All they want is the government and the green movement to honour the agreement reached in 1992; namely, the national forest policy statement. It is as simple as that. There will be more rhetoric to follow in this debate. What is happening in regard to this issue of sawlogging and woodchipping flies in the face of the legacy handed to us by the ANZACs. Politicians are brilliant at seizing on past deeds to, in a very shallow way, pretend that there is a national character, a national unity. At the moment, that is not the case because the government has reneged on an agreement signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself, all state premiers except for the Tasmanian Premier, the timber industry and the mainstream conservation movement. It saddens me that all those values and the tradition of independence, self-reliance and self-help are being destroyed in country areas because of the pressure being brought to bear on the government by extremists. I, like my opposition colleagues, wholeheartedly endorse the bill before the House. It is excellent in so far as it goes, but let us not kid ourselves. The installation of a national day of commemoration does not solve our problems overnight. We need the same thing that guided the ANZACs-plain common sense. They were uncomplicated people who simply wanted to be treated fairly by governments. At the moment, the same kinds of people who live in the same types of areas-namely, east Gippsland-are being denied that. ANZAC Day will be a national day of commemoration celebrated by all Australians. But there are 364 other days in the year and we want our governments to be guided by the same values that one day-25 April--embodies in all Australians.",67
90,Mrs CROSIO,RAAF,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.36 p.m.)-I rise to support the ANZAC Day Bill 1994, which is currently before the House. I am very pleased that, when the bill was first introduced, it was a private member's bill and received joint cooperation from both sides of the House. With all due respect to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), I must admit that when I first came into the chamber I went and got the bill because I thought I had come in at the wrong time and that we were talking about another bill. But, obviously, the honourable member is facing an audience up in the gallery. I apologise to those in the gallery Jor having my back to them. Mr MCGauran-We are talking about values.",68
91,Mrs CROSIO,RAAF,"If we are talking about values, I think we should introduce them at a time and place in which the honourable member knows full well we can have a debate, not during a debate on this very important piece of legislation before the House today. I believe that ANZAC Day is already perhaps the most important day in our national calendar. This bill will rightly enshrine 25 April as the national day of commemoration. . I would like to describe what ANZAC Day means to me. It is a uniquely Australian day. Most countries throughout the world have national days for remembering the horror of war. Remembrance Day is celebrated throughout the Commonwealth of Nations and in other places. In the United States, for example, it is observed as Veterans' Day. But I have never seen a day unite the nationindeed, unite two nations-as much as ANZAC Day. It may sound trite in this House, but it is true to say that on ANZAC Day we see a unique spirit. VV ehave in this country a day when people in their thousands-not just veterans-rise at 4 a.m. and arrive before dawn at their local memorial. VV e have in this country a day when young children line the streets in their capital cities, towns or small country villages, waving flags and cheering men who are often 20 times their age. VV e have a day in this country-25 April-when old comrades unite, often for the only time in 12 months. They remember the close friends who did not return to Australia with them. It is a day when, 80 years later, some French villages still come to a standstill and remember those young men who came from a country that most Frenchmen had never even heard of to successfully defend them in that time of need. I have often seen visitors from overseas become moved by the solemnity and unity of spirit which is exhibited in our country on our ANZAC Day. It seems that, in recent times, we have seen an upsurge in interest in the commemoration of those who have fallen in war, and so it should be. But I personally believe that this is due partly to the series of anniverworth saries of major events in VVorld VVar II. Last year we saw the very important anniversary of D-day, the turning point of the Second VVorld VVar. This year we commemorate the 50thÂ·anniversary of th- end of VVorld VV ar II. I cannot let this .opportunity pass without putting on the public record my appreciation of and congratulations to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and all those involved in the Australia Remembers project. The 50th anniversary of the end of VVorld VVar II is for me, and I think for many citizens of this country, a time for reflection. It is the anniversary of the end of a war which best epitomises the fight between good and evil, a war in which every citizen of Australia--every citizen of the free world-combined in a tireless effort for six long years to put down the most vile regime the world has ever seen. It was a war ofimspeakable tragedy and human loss. In my electorate of Prospect, we are commemorating this anniversary with the construction of two eternal flames. One is at the Leo MCCarthy Memorial Park in Smithfield and the other at the Fairfield RSL. It is the first time in our city that flames will be constructed as a permanent reminder of and permanent memorial to those who have served from our area in the war. This would not have come about if we had not brought these clubs together in an Australia Remembers committee. I am pleased to say that our city, in particular my electorate, is going to have a permanent memorial to those people. I believe the construction of the flames is of great relevance to the bill in the House today. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) put his case very admirably when he first introduced into this House the private member's bill and said that it was important that surviving veterans know that, for as long as this nation endures, Australia will continue to honour ANZAC Day. On a similar note, the eternal flames which I have referred to symbolise the eternal gratefulness of Australians to those who died for our freedom. I would like to quote the way it is stated at the Australian VVar Memorial; it is having recorded in Hansard the way it is put: By burning in perpetuity, the flame parallels a nation's never ending gratitude to, and remembrance of, its war dead, and the never ending value it places on its freedom. The symbolism of the flame is also captured in the lines of MCRae's poem In Flanders Fields, which reads: To you, from faIling hands we throw The Torch; be yours to hold it high. Those words epitomise what people want in our city. The flames will be dedicated within my electorate on or near victory day in the Pacific, 15 August. The Prospect electorate Australia Remembers committee is very determined to make sure the ceremonies for the dedication of these flames become major public events in our area. We envisage that this project will do much to heighten public awareness of the significance of VP day and the anniversary of the war's end. I would particularly like to place on during this opportunity to speak on this my appreciation of the representatives of the Fairfield and Smithfield RSL clubs branches who serve on the Prospect electorate Australia Remembers committee. I would particularly like to thank Bruce Short, the President of the Fairfield RSL and the branch; Jack MCCosker; Ken Thomson; John Burgess and Terry Buck. They cover the Smithfield sub-branches well. Their involveimportant ment in this project is another contribution in their already significant involvement in community at large. The people of Fairfield and Smithfield in my electorate certainly benefit from the community spirit and the involvement of their local clubs. It Returned Services League of Australia which originally called for ANZAC Day to become the national day of commemoration. I congratuI late the RSL movement for putting this item on the national agenda. As I have said, in this last year we have seen several other initiatives of renewed recognition and commemoration of those have made sacrifices to defend our country. The moving entombment of the Unknown suffered Soldier was an event of extreme national significance which paid tribute to all of those who did not come home. The introduction the Civilian Service Medal and the Philippines Liberation Medal and the treatment of war time merchant seamen as servicemen are long overdue moves which recognise that it was the total war effort which won the war. Now we have the ANZAC Day Bill, which we are debating here in the House. It is measure of how ingrained in Australian society the concept of ANZAC Day has become that we often hear of the ANZAC 'legend' the 'spirit of ANZAC'. That one word has come to represent the attributes of bravery, tenacity and irreverence which have characterised Australian military forces and, we like to think, the Australian people generally. Images of Simpson and his donkey and the Australian forces carrying on at Gallipoli when it was obvious that the fight was lost evoke the notion of courage, which epitomises the ANZAC spirit. This year we are seeing in record a very meaningful, symbolic gesture the bill passing of the ANZAC Day spirit to a new generation with the visit of nine descendants and subof the ANZACs to Gallipoli. We all remember the moving ceremonies involving our veterans on the 75th anniversary of the landing in 1990. This anniversary subwill see young people making that journey. So a new generation will be making a symbolic journey showing that ANZAC Day is as to today's generation as it has been to generations in the last 80 years. Just as this the bill before the House shows that ANZAC Day will live on, this journey made by these young people will show that ANZAC Day will continue to be honoured by present and future was the generations of young Australians. It has often been said that Australia is the only nation which celebrates a military defeat. believe that this is an essential point. There is no way that the observance of ANZAC Day can be seen as a glorification of war. By commemorating a crushing military defeat, we are certainly not claiming a superior fighting ability or any sort of international prewho eminence. By commemorating a defeat, we are signalling that all nationalities have in war and that it is a human tragedy that we should see avoided. It is the veterans of war, those who have suffered its tragedy of first hand, who know that best. I conclude my remarks on this bill today by congratulating those involved in the framing and passage of this bill. I would like to place on record, as previous speakers have done, my congratulations to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable a member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for originally bringing this matter to the attention of the House in June last year. I also commend the or Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his response. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the honourable member for Cook would realise, the many private members motions come before the House but we do not always have the tained opportunity of seeing those motions result, with the support of the opposition, in legislainterpreted tion. This bill will ensure that ANZAC will continue to be observed for as long as the Australian nation exists. As we pass this bill, and as we commemorate the 50th anniversary the end of World War II, it is appropriate renew our commitment to protecting the freedom and improving the nation which veterans fought so well to defend. The motto of Legacy, which has as its emblem the eternal flame, perhaps best summarises this thought: Fear not that you died for naught, The Flame you threw to us, we caught. I commend the bill to the House.",68
92,Mr DOBIE,RAAF,"Having been one of the co-sponsors that ANZAC Day should be declared as Australia's national day of commemoration, I have a particular perof sonal pleasure in rising to support the ANZAC celebrations. Day Bill enthusiastically today. I do not intend to repeat the speech I made in this House on 6 June 1994, but there are certain points that I wish to make again. First of all, I must say how pleased I am that the governcommemoration ment has acted with all haste to put through this bill, which has the total support of one in the House of Representatives. I just hope that it is a unanimous decision in Senate as well when this bill reaches there. The major reason why I am supporting this bill is that ANZAC Day is a day for every Australian to remember, for generations to come, those who left their Australian homes with a strong desire to return, but did not, well as all those who did return but carried with them for the remainder of their lives the ber. scars of their war time experiences. The government has acknowledged this by rushing this bill through the House. I am delighted say, as a member of the opposition, that there is an enthusiastic response from colleagues my own party, and that of the National Party, to give their enthusiastic support to this bill. The bill is straightforward. It does not impose any encumbrance whatsoever on January being correctly regarded and mainnumber as Australia's national day. It should be re-emphasised that, while certain people have the bill in many ways, ANZAC Day shall be the official day of commemoration, nothing more than that, but, most importantly, nothing less than that. On 6 June 1994, in seconding a motion of moved by my colleague the honourable to member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), I said that the bill will have the unanimous our support of the national executive of the Returned Services League. I should repeat to the House that the official announcement was made on 14 April 1994 in the company of the National President of the RSL, Major General 'Digger' James. My contact with the President of the New South Wales RSL indicated as 'having his 200 per cent support'. As I reminded people in the House, the original motion was put before the House on the 50th anniversary of the D-day celebrations in Europe. I am pleased to say a large number Australians visited Europe to join in the I am certain people will support this bill, which originated in the office of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He has put the case for ANZAC Day as the official day of not only most eloquently but obviously with great skill within his own everygovernment party, as he brought this about quickly and successfully. When I was youngthe er, and many people in this House were younger, Remembrance Day was always 11 November, which is of no consequence now. I believe one of the reasons is that it was never legislated for. I believe that everyone in this House would accept the fact now that 25 as April is surely the day of commemoration that Australia should have instead of 11 NovemI would like to repeat an interesting point I made on 6 June last, and that relates to the to composition of Australian forces which landed at Gallipoli on ANZAC Day 1915. Irrespective in of its ethnic composition, it should be borne in mind that one-third of those Australians who fought at Gallipoli were in fact migrants to our country. I mention this to make ANZAC 26 Day much more significant to the large of migrants we have in our community. As the House knows, I am such a migrant myself. , Like everyone in this House, I have attended ANZAC Day celebrations for many years. As we have all seen, there has been a growing increase in the young and very young attending ANZAC Day services, which are held in every suburb and village in the country. I could go on with anecdotes of where one has celebrated ANZAC Day as a day of commemoration in foreign places, but as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, there are 25 people listed to speak on this bill and so we have to be brief.' Last June I described how I had taken part in the celebration of ANZAC Day in Zimbabwe. I was one of three members who attended the Muzorewa election campaign in that country. A small service with MPs from both sides of this House was observed. To people of all political colours, Australia's ANZAC Day is regarded and celebrated as a commemoration for peace throughout the world. The final point I wish to make relates to fact that large numbers of RSL members are ageing and sadly dying. I am informed the average age of Second World War veterans is now the mid-70s. The younger members of the RSL who served in Vietnam, Korea, Cyprus, Somalia and Rwanda, who were as gallant as those older members, will not have the numbers to maintain ANZAC Day by themselves as time goes on to future generations. Being one of the older members of the House, it should be understood that I was too young to serve in the Second World War. It is with humble regard for all the sacrifices that have been made by generations of Australians from the Boer War on that we should pass this bill with a great enthusiastic response.",71
93,Mr GIBSON,RAAF,"With three minutes to go before question time, I will commence my comments on the ANZAC Day Bill 1994 with the intention of completing my comments after the debate on the matter of public importance. I am delighted to join with many parliamentary colleagues in supporting the bill. I congratulate the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) for his initiation of this legislation and for the very strong support he has received from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). It 'is very appropriate, as other speakers have said, that we are debating this bill at this time. This is the year in which wecommemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. I have spoken in the House previously about the excellent program Australia Remembers 1945-1995, which will be commemorated in every part of Australia this year. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his department deserve great commendation for this program. They have been working very hard in providing great support for every city, town and community throughout Australia to be involved in this very important remembrance throughout 1995. Apart from its important component of commemorating the end of World War II, the Australia Remembers activities have renewed discussion in Australia about the involvement of Australian forces in armed conflicts, the particularly in World War II but also in many other armed conflicts this century, and the consequences of those armed conflicts-good and bad, past, present and future. There has been a lot of debate in the leadup to the Australia Remembers campaign. During 1995 a lot of positive and negative messages will be gained from the Australia Remembers campaign. If there is one thing we are able to hold up, it will be the unanimous passage of this bill which will ensure that the importance of ANZAC Day is held in our national history forever and a day. I will continue my remarks about the importance of the bill when the debate is resumed. This is a very important bill.",72
94,Mr SPEAKER,RAAF,"It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member for Moreton will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Prime Minister",72
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Finance. I preface it by reminding the minister that today' s balance of payments figures, the worse on record, have brought Australia to what the Prime Minister himself once defined as banana republic status. 1 also remind the minister that there are threats of tax rises, new pressure on interest rates and the Australian dollar, and that parliament is currently surrounded by anti-Labor protesters, with thousands more to converge on Canberra tomorrow. 1 therefore ask the minister: why will Australia's part-time Prime Minister not stop hiding in his office and come in here now, provide answers for the mess he has created and end his contemptible arrogance towards the elected representatives of the Australian people? An incident having occurred in the gallery",72
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before 1 call the Minister for Finance, 1 say to people in the gallery that you are welcome here at any time. There are certain protocols to be followed. Mr MCGauran-This is a democracy, after all. Do you know the word?",73
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the member for Gippsland that 1I have been a little tolerant of his interjections.,73
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, because he has been in this place now for a very long time, that since these arrangements have been in place the Prime Minister will appear at question time tomorrow. He will be perfectly delighted to explain to you that the government is very pleased with a situation in which we have 5Y2 per cent growth rates and an increase in business investment. We anticipated in the budget that business investment would grow to the tune of 14 per cent; that figure is now 24 per cent. The employment targets that we anticipated would come in about a year and a half from now have come in already. We are going down to a much lower level of unemployment than was anticipated in the budget. He would also be happy to point out that, in confronting the current account deficit, as opposed to the situation where he confronted similar sized current account deficits when you were Treasurer, and when we confronted similar sized current account deficits during the 1980s, at least the current account deficit now reflects the fact that we happen to be in drought. That is not a situation that we can do anything about. More importantly, there is the fact that a very substantial proportion of it represents the decision by business to take the investment course which it has undertaken. A massive proportion of that current account deficit is investment in new productive equipment in this country, and that is what is creating jobs. But it does impose upon us a savings task-a savings task in which you are not participants. You call the Prime Minister into this place to answer your questions. Opposition members-Where is he?",73
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yet you have already announced that as far as fiscal policy is concerned, in so far as the government can address the savings issues related to the current account deficit, you will absolutely repudiate any opportunity, as far as the government is concerned, on the revenue side. The Leader of the Opposition knows very well that, when he was Treasurer of this nation and held his highest office to this point, there was never a budget in which he did not address both the revenue side and the outlays side of the budget, both in an upwards direction and in a downwards directionusually in a downwards direction before elections and then a total clawback immediately afterwards. You have no moral authority to lecture this government on taxation matters while you are led by the 'fistful of dollars' Treasurer. And you have no moral authority to govern this nation while you encourage a level of behaviour in the House that is not responsible for financial policy, that curtails the capacity of the government to put in place fiscal policy which will address interest rate requirements. You come down on interest rate requirements. Let me conclude with this, because you mentioned interest rates in your question. 1 make the point that not in the entirety of your last term as Treasurer of this country did interest rates in the housing area fall below levels where they are now. The second point is that we now find the 90-day bill rate at 8.3 per cent. When you were Treasurer, it rose to 22 per cent. So as far as we are concerned, we do not take lectures from you either. On the historical record, as far as the balance of payments is concei:ned don't want a history lesson.",73

101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact of the matter is that there is an excellent recovery under way in this country, as the massive number of people who have benefited from the new jobs that have been created over the last three years know. That recovery is a direct result of government policy. We are accountable in this place, and so are you. You are under an obligation-if you are not going'to let-because, my friend, you have numbers in the Senate. Opposition members inteljecting",74
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will wait just for a moment. Those on my left will cease interjecting. The minister has the call. He is responding to a question directed to him by the Leader of the Opposition. The provisions of standing order 55 will be observed.,74

105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor! I warn the member for O'Connor early on in the proceedings.,74
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You had the luxury when you were Treasurer of a tax take some $10 billion higher than the tax take of this government; you had the luxury of a Senate which passed your legislation and gave you total flexibility as far as the proper economic management of this country is concerned. You want to be Prime Minister, yet you imposed a tradition in the last term of parliament of completely irresponsible opposition behaviour when it comes to dealing with budgetary matters. Employment and Unemployment",74
107,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The minister would be aware of the revised forecasts for employment announced in the Treasurer's mid-year review. What does this mean for job seekers throughout Australia?",74
108,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, the midyear review of the budget confirms continuing good news for job seekers in this country. It is good news that is not acknowledged by those on the other side and good news that they said could not be achieved when we announced our targets. The fact of the matter is that the revised forecasts",74
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Sturt.,74
110,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The revised forecasts indicate that this year we will have stronger economic growth than forecast; even more importantly, we will get stronger growth again in jobs as a consequence of it. This year we will see a growth of3.75 per cent in employment in this economy; the budget forecasts said it would be only three per cent. Not only is it better than what we forecast, but there is no OECD country doing better than us. It is not just this year that this impressive record is being posted. Since this government was re-elected, we have created 477,000 jobs in the economy. Honourable members might recall that when we went to the election we said we would create 500,000 jobs, and that target was ridiculed. We are almost there and have not been in office for two years of the term. We also made a commitment to ensure that the long-term unemployed would not be left behind. The very pleasing news in the revised forecasts is not only that they have been picked up, but that their rate of unemployment has been falling faster than the overall fall in the unemployment numbers. So by any standards, this is a remarkable outcome. Most of all, by the standards that the opposition said could not be achieved, it is a truly significant outcome. I admit that there is still a long way to go. But I also say that these figures give confidence that we will get to the targets that we set ourselves when we announced Working Nation. The same, of course, cannot be said of the so-called rejuvenated opposition. What did we see in the five. years of office that the current Leader of the Opposition held the Treasury portfolio? He left this economy with 10 per cent unemployment and rising' and only 262,000 jobs created. We have exceeded that in one year. The reality is thanhe opposition has not got the commitment to-;",74

112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! The member for Gippsland 'does not need to move around to continue to interject.,75
113,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is that the opposition has not got the commitment that this government has to both job creation and to assisting the unemployed. We have, it will continue, and the figures yesterday confirm the real progress upon which we will build. Fiscal Policy",75
114,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for FinaI).ce. Almost every day last year the, Prime Minister and the Treasurer-neither of whom can be bothered to come into parliament today-rejected the calls of the coalition to reduce the budget deficit control the runaway current account deficit and rising interest rates. In the light Treasurer's confession this morning that deficit 'tightening fiscal policy helps to minimise further movement in monetary policy' and today's record $2,400 million current account deficit for December, is it not the case that had you listened and tightened fiscal policy last year when we called for a mini-budget, you would have taken pressure rates and the current account? Is it not also the case that tightening fiscal policy now rather than in four months time would take pressure off sooner rather than let these problems feed for another four months?",75
115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether ment figuresyou know anything about economics outside the debates you used to have in the Melbourne Union at the beginning of the 1980s. orderIf we had structured our budget around your predictionsMr Rocher- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",75
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume his seat! The member for Curtin on a point of order. Mr Rocher- Mr Speaker, it is improper for a minister to direct his remarks at an individual in this place. He is supposed to direct them through the chair and I would ask you to ask him to do so. It might give him a little bit of time to think up a credible answer.",75
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I am iri indebted to the Second Deputy Speaker for bringing that to my attention. I hope all people heard.,75
118,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we had operated on your prophesies for the last budget we would have had this: we said that business investment would be at about 14Y2 per cent during the course of the year. Your view was that it would be considerably less than that. We said that there would be employment growth that would Â·take unemployment to 9Y2. You said that that was a grossly exaggerated estimate of where we were going to be. We said that the growth rate should be 4Y2. You said that was a grossly exaggerated position. So, if we had been structuring a budget on to the propositions that you put forward at that time as to where the economy would be now, of the we would not have been talking about a of $11 billion if we were a responsible any government. We would have been talking about a deficit much higher than that! Of course we would have because you would have been in a situation where there was an absolute requirement for the public sector to take up the slack in the private sector until it off interest could be moved along. The problem with your position on economics is that it is completely incoherent. You have one set of criticisms of the government's figures as being overoptimistic and then you have a set of prescriptions on those governMr Rocher- Mr Speaker, on a point of",75

122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will remember it, budget though.",76
123,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition spokesyou men have a set of predictions as far as the budget is concerned that would type of budgetary outcome and a set of suggestions based on a totally different set, far more optimistic than not only he presented but that we presented as well. The simple fact of the matter is that you know nothing about these facts. The other fact of the matter is this: you also participants in the debate. In 1993 when we addressed the task of deficit reduction in the first budget, we made clear where intended to take things and we made some cuts and adjustments. You meddled with those cuts and adjustments. You opposed everyone of the cuts that we put in place. What Ralph-what the Treasurer has had to say since that time is that now, as we look-as we repeatedly do at this time of the year-at the figures coming through, there is a judgfederal ment by the government of a requirement for further fiscal tightening. As we approach over the next three months, we leave table all i-sues on the revenue side .and on the outlays Side.

Speaker, this point has twice been drawn your attention by my colleague, the honouralmost able member for Curtin.",76
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of state order. The minister corrected himself as he went.,76
125,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only thing that Marx got right is that history begins as tragedy and ends as farce. Mr Costello-Was that a joke? Mr BEAZLEy-It was an aside. If you succeed with this budget, as you did with that in 1993 by addingÂ· $600 million to whatever the size of the deficit was at that point in time-as you appear to be indicating want to do-and if there are consequences as a result of that in monetary policy, lead to one you will wear it. Enterprise Bargaining",76
126,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister inform the House about the progress of enterprise bargaining in the federal indusare trial relations system and how it compares with the performance of the state systems?,76
127,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable we member for Paterson very much for his question and for the opportunity it gives me to report to the House that, according to the , Department of Industrial Relations database, there is now a total of 3,180 formal agreements that have been registered under the federal system since October 1991. These agreements cover a total of 1.36 million award employees. Notably, since this government's re-election in 1993, the pace at that which agreements have been made has picked on the up-and picked up quite a bit. In the period since April 1993 the number of formal workplace agreements has increased Not by a massive 246 per cent, with the number t-e of employees in agreements having grown in m that same time frame by 81 per cent. The percentage of federal award workers covered to by agreements has been raised from around 35 per cent to better than 55 per cent. This increased coverage has occurred at a time when the federal award system has itself Mr grown by some 500,000 employees. It has to gone up from 1.98 million employees to 2.5 million employees. That increase has mainly been as a result of the exodus of workers caused by the policies of conservative governments. That is why the federal industrial relations system is so much larger today. Indeed, if it were not for that exodus the number of federal award employees who would be covered by agreements now would not be around 55 per cent; it would be better than 66 per cent. What is most encouraging about the year to January 1995 is that we have seen 1,340 formal agreements registered compared with 1,080 in the previous 12 months. We can see that the rate of agreement making is up quite a bit. I think all of this is clear and unambiguous evidence that the 1993 reform act is spreading the bargaining culture throughout the federal system. Unfortunately, of course, that Success has not been matched by the state systems. In New South Wales, where legislation has been in place since 1991, the percentage of state award employees covered by workplace agreements is today less than half of the rate of success in the federal system. In Western Australia it is a paltry eight per ceht---only eight per cent of employees are covered. In Tasmania it is a miserable three per cent. In Victoria the system has stalled on 311 formal agreements. Of course, the details of those agreements are a Victorian state secret-they have never been released. The comparison would look even worse for the conservative states if they had not precipitated such an exodus of workers to the federal system. One could only conclude that the greatest contribution of these conservative states-the greatest contribution they are making to enterprise bargaining-is to expand the federal system where we have seen bargaining actually proceed. Of course, that will not stop the opposition from arguing that there is a lot wrong with our system and that it ought to go back to Jobsback, that mirror image of the failed conservative systems. I noted yesterday that the new Leader of the Opposition announced that the member for Flinders will be the shadow minister for industrial relations. In his time in this parliament this is his 12th assignment as a shadow minister. He must be the most experienced shadow minister. Of course, his greatest ability inÂ· the past has been to convince the electorate to say n()o---to say no to constitutional change and to say no to the GST. They have been his great contributions in here. Let me say that he is tailor-made for this job because the electorate have already said no comprehensively to Jobsback-style IR. Indeed, they are saying it every day at the state level. Whether they are voting with their feet or voting at the ballot box, the answer will always be the same: only with the protection and the underpinning of an award safety net will you see people truly engage in enterprise bargaining. The numbers, the comparison of our system and the state Liberal conservative system bear that out. NA",76
128,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform .the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Norwegian Standing Committee on Local Government and Labour. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to the members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Interest Rates",77
129,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance, because neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer will front in the parliament today. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said",77
130,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,77
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right. The Deputy Leader has the call.,77
132,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is patently clear neither of them is here. Is that a problem? My question is: yesterday the Prime Minister said, 'I don't believe there is any cause for adjustment' on interest rates. This morning, the Treasurer said in relation to interest rates, 'I think it would be quite reckless to preclude any increase.' Is the Prime Minister reckless or is the Treasurer wrong?",77
133,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In so far as the activities of this government impact upon interest rates, they will be influenced by the capacity that we have to deliver an effective continuation of our deficit reduction program. So,in so far as we can do anything in this place on that, I have already explained to you the essential prerequisites of that and you are out of the game. You have declared yourselves nonparticipants as far as that is concerned. So you do not deserve any better consideration than that. Social Security: Compliance Policies",77
134,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"- Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House of the government's compliance strategy in his department? Is that strategy succeeding in ensuring that only people entitled to social security payments actually receive them? Does the government intend to implement any further measures in this area?",78
135,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. It is an issue which is of considerable public importance and it is also one where there is a great deal of public disinformation. The issue is one that has been subject to quite vigorous study by an international recognised expert, Professor Weatherley, who is an acknowledged expert on social security systems. He published a major report in 1993, titled Compliance Policies in Social Security. His conclusion was: The Department of Social Security has placed a major emphasis on compliance especially since 1986. This was both necessary and appropriate to correct the relative laxity of the past and to restore public confidence in the payments system. Who was responsible for the system when this relative laxity applied? They are over there. He goes on to say: The central conclusion of this study is that the compliance measures that were adopted have indeed succeeded. Attempts to further tighten compliance are unlikely to be cost effective and may undermine the quality of services and threaten civil liberties. He also made the point: There is no basis for the commonly held beliefthat fraud is rampant within the system. Compared to other domains, public and private, the incidence of social security fraud is modest. So that is the position. We have a system with outlays of around $34 billion a year, very substantial amounts of public money. I argue, and it has been confirmed by independent study, that we have very effective compliance measures and measures to counter fraud. We are starting to develop our expertise in that area into a small export industry. We are providing consulting services, for example, to the UK government. I would like to acquaint members of the House with some of the most recent statistics. In the six months to December, the department conducted 1.1 million entitlement reviews. These included data matching activities with other agencies, periodic reviews of certain entitlements, risk based reviews based on departmental assessment of possible overpayments and so forth. Professor Weatherley made the point that the techniques we have developed in this area are some of the most sophisticated and effective in the world. All told, these compliance measures in that sixmonth period saved us money at the rate of $19.3 million a fortnight, which annualised is $500 million a year. So this is a very effective approach. When some of these figures came out, the honourable member for Berowra started making comments about tips of icebergs and saying we did not have a coherent fraud management plan. I draw the honourable member for Berowra's attention to the latest edition of the Department of Social Security's fraud control plan, for 1994-95, which is one of a series of such plans issued on a financial year basis. To suggest that we have no coherent approach is absolutely absurd. Quite frankly, if the opposition were genuinely concerned about these matters and if it were genuinely concerned about the question of deficit reduction, it would stop impeding some of our most effective compliance measures. I instance the data matching program and the legislation needed to give effect to that. The opposition has continued to fiddle with it and has not allowed us to entrench it as a permanent feature. This program at its inception saved us, either directly or indirectly, something in the order of $150 to $200 million and is still saving us, directly or indirectly, well over $100 million a year. If the opposition is seriously concerned about these matters and if it is to be taken seriously on the broad issue of deficit reduction, let us have a bit of cooperation on that matter, as in a whole raft of other measures that the government may implement in the pursuit of its deficit reduction strategy. Carbon Tax",78
136,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Does the minister acknowledge that a carbon tax currently being worked on by the Treasurer and Prime Minister in their offices as they avoid parliament's scrutiny would raise the price of electricity for pensioners, the unemployed and others on low incomes, who will have no choice but to cut deeper into their household budgets? Does the ministerMrs Crosio--Oh, shame.",79
137,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You deny a carbon tax would have this effect on electricity?,79
138,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right! Dr Tbeopbanous-Why didn't you talk to Mr Kennett?,79
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Calwell!,79
140,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the minister further acknowledge that this new consumption tax-whatever you like to call it, it is a consumption tax-would increase the price of petrol, thereby hitting all motorists and putting up transport costs, especially in rural areas? In the government's desperate attempt to belatedly, and at long last, tackle fiscal policy, is this not just a regressive tax that will hit the poorest hardest?",79
141,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This comes from a party whose finance spokesman two weeks ago saidÂ· that he thought it was a very useful contribution and basically agreed with the suggestion that there ought to be a 0.5 per cent efficiency dividend imposed on pensions. That is basically what he came out with at that point of time. And you say you are here with the milk of human kindness as far as pensioners are concerned. Mr MCGauran-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is hard for the Minister for Finance to answer these questions in the absence of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. But he cannot so blatantly avoid giving an answer to a direct question. The question is about the carbon tax.",79
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,79
143,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question was about more than the carbon tax. It was a whole series of questions on equity and what will happen to pensioners in the light of any indirect tax increases. Mr Ruddock-And the people who would have to pay it.,79
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Berowra!,79
145,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me point out one or two things. to you about that. If you rely in this budget process purely and solely on questions of cutting outlays, you must inevitably have a massive impact on the poor and needy in this community because outlays, particularly in the social security areas, are directed at those who are most needy. So do not come here suggesting to us that you have a concern for that. A very good question was asked of your Treasury spokesman as part of a systematic effort by Laurie Oakes and one or two other members of the press gallery to get out a view from him, given his view that allegedly the rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer. He was asked, 'How would you go if the government were to introduce an income tax surcharge on upper income areas?' He said, 'We really wouldn't have to say anything about that. We really wouldn't want to go down that road.' When he was asked for a view on the inconsistency between those positions, he ducked the question very efficiently I thought at the time. Mr Costello-So you've got a surcharge in mind; is that it?",79
146,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as you are concerned, you will tolerate only an attack on the needs of the neediest people in this community. Coming from the way in which you phrased that question, that is not something that, given your position, we need concern ourselves about. VPDay",79
147,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--Can the Minister for Veterans' Affairs inform the House as to why the Australia Remembers program is utilising the term 'VP Day' to denote the end of W orId War II in the Pacific rather than the term 'VJ Day', particularly given that there has been adverse reaction to this move within some sections of the 'ex:""service community and the media?",79
148,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a little bit of adverse reaction. There was story in one of the national dailies, the Sydney Morning Herald, a couple of weeks ago entitled 'Now it's VP Day, no offence to Japan'. The Singapore Straits Times put an editorial which was quite critical Of called decision taken by the government calling IS August 1945 VP Day, not VJ Day. In addition to that, there have been a few other bits and pieces. I think the ABC mencall tioned the point yesterday that we had edly changed the name. I want to make it clear that it has, always been known as VP Day. It has been interchangeable on ,some occasions. I' notice that our comrades in Britain use VE Day for Victory in Europe the digger. Day but they use VJ Day for Victory in Japan Day, not VG Day for victory over Germany. In any event, I asked the Australian War Memorial for some information before we made the decision as to what term we would use. The War Memorial said to me that, in most articles at the time, the words 'VP Day' were used. I want to give just a few examples of some of the things that appeared in some articles at the time. The Guinea Gold, which was the official Australian Army newspaper at the time, had two editions on VP Day. The first one was headed 'First special VP minister edition'. Later that day a second edition, headed 'VP second edition', published an article entitled 'Wild rejoicing in every part of Allied world for VP1'. On 17 August Sydney Daily Telegraph published a column entitled 'VP Day highlights'. Even the Sydney Morning Herald on 16 August 1957 an article entitled 'VP Day remembered at service in Sydney'. When some of my friends and colleagues the ex-service community say, 'Look, should be VJ Day,' I refer them to a number of speeches held by the National Film and Sound Archive. There are two particular speeches which I have referred them to. One was given by King George VI when delivcouple ering a VP Day message to the Empire in 1945 and the other was by His Royal Highelement ness the Duke of Gloucester when he delivered the Governor General's VP Day speech in 1945. Finally, the Sun in Melbourne, which at the a time boasted a circulation of 334,614, published an article entitled ' Mr Chifley declares VP Day'. It cost tuppence for that paper at the time and a lot of people read it. I have a out photograph from the Australian War Memorithe soal showing three women enjoying the day. in Emblazoned across one woman's frontknitted, actually-are the words 'VP Day'. To be serious, it does not really matter what we it. At the end of the day, we just have to supposmake sure that we remember what those people did and what that day represented. So at the end of the day, it does not matter what it is called. We will be calling it VP Day. Mrs Bishop-It does matter. It matters to",80
149,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You should not worry about it, Bronwyn, because there are no problems. I think you will enjoy it as well. Privatisation  the Minister for Finance. I was going to ask the Prime Minister or the Treasurer this question but, as they are not here, I will ask the Minister for Finance. Now that the government has again managed to get our current account on to the banana republic road, the will be aware that the Prime Minister has reopened the privatisation option as one of only three solutions to get the government out of the mess. Is it a fact that Telecom and the the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank will be considered for sale, or are you going to rely solely on big tax rises and major cuts published to government spending?",80
150,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You clearly missed your line on that one, Geoff, but I am glad to see in that you are still there. There were nasty it really rumours over the weekend. ",80
151,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see you safe and secure in that position. I wish to say a of things about privatisation. In budgetary terms, it is useful to have a certain of privatisation around, but it is not wise to proceed down the course of privatisation purely because of budgetary matters. As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister pointed out in different statements and conversations yesterday, essentially, we need to reduce the deficit target to improve the position of private and public savings in this country. That is the primary interest we have in the change in the structure of the deficit we are looking at. Whatever particular value individual cases of privatisation have, they have scarcely any impact on that issue at all. Privatisation will be part of the budget for a substantial time but its impact in that area, as opposed to spending cuts and revenue changes, is minimal. We will view each privatisation on its merits in that light. We as a government have a considerable rate of success in relation to privatisation. We have the two airlinesMr Costell0-:-0h, tell us about Qantas. Mr BEAZLEy-it is going well, thank you very much. Mr Downer-And tell us about the airports.",80
152,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have two airlines undergoing privatisation. One is completed and the other is going through. We are getting the airports in place. We have privati sed nearly 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. We have privatised the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the bulk of defence . industries. When you were in office, there was one effort and that was with the Belconnen Mall. The total number of privatisation projects under the Fraser-Howard government amounted to the Belconnen Mall, and you did not succeed in delivery on that. You must forgive us-the failures in the Belconnen MaIl sale process are not the people who lecture us on the subject of privatisation. As far as Telecom is concerned, the Treasurer ruled that out from consideration in the statements he made yesterday. Basically, the reason is this: in telecommunications we have decided to go down the path of competition as opposed to being dominated in our concerns by privatisation. We did privatise one telecommunications asset, the Aussat satellite. It was privatised and subsequently became the basis of Telecom's competitive partner in what is now a time-limited duopoly. We will be going over to full competition in 1997. Regardless of whether or not you consider privatising Telecom is appropriate, the last thing you want to do is privatise an outfit with such an enormous position and market dominance when you are trying to establish a substantial competitive effort, encourage other people into the market and encourage the investment of private sector money in competition with Telecom. If you do not do that and if you do proceed down that road, you are very likely to get the sort of outcome that Britain got when it initiated the process of privatisation of British Telecom and managed to secure a position. That was its dominant concern. It had to write a prospectus that gave investors a decent opportunity. It did not say that there would be a series of curtailing practices imposed on British Telecom where, in the course of one year, the principal competitor of Telecom secured a higher level of market share than the British Telecom opponent managed in the first 10 years of competition. So we go down the road of privatisation not on the basis of some ideological fix on the subject but on the basis of whether or not-in the light of which particular government sector industry is participating-it is sensible to pursue privatisation at that point. We are further encouraged in that regard; while privatisations do have on an annual basis a good impact on the bottom line of the budget, which is important for psychological reasons and others, they are not big in consideration in the area of improving total domestic savings. We would continue t6 look at them in that light. In those circumstances, the Treasurer's answers to the questions to him yesterday were sensible. Work Related Fatalities",81
153,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister inform the House of the latest annual estimate available of the number of work related fatalities in Australia?,81
154,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Thank you for that question. A recent study has been undertaken by Worksafe Australia, the Commonwealth's occupational health and safety research arm. It indicates that 2,700 Australians die each year as a result of their work. The most interesting thirig about this sad statistic is that until recently the nearest estimate was that only 500 had died. The point to be made is that with the states and the Commonwealth working together and using the best sources of data, for the first time we now have a clear picture of the real depth of work related death and injury. The cost to the nation of these injuries and deaths is something like $10 billion a year. It is critical that the Commonwealth has the eyes and ears to research these problems. We funded Worksafe Australia for 10 years with that in mind. It is the opposition's view that Worksafe Australia should be abolished. So the new industrial relations spokesman has an opportunity now to tell the Australian people why he wants to abolish Worksafe Australia, which is the eyes and ears not only of the Commonwealth but also of the states with regard to getting a clear picture of the depth of the problem of occupational health and safety in this country. There are something like 160 separate pieces of legislation governing occupational health and safety in Australia; and the cost of administering that legislation is over $100 million. So the nation's businesses, not only the workers, would wish there to be a national cooperative effort to tackle OH&S issues. One of the key instruments we have in tackling occupational health and safety is W orksafe Australia. So it is incumbent on the opposition to say why it wants to get rid of one of the most powerful tools we have in combating OH&S disasters. National Media Liaison Service",81
155,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance, the member for Swan-the defector from Swan. The National Media Liaison Service costs Australian taxpayers $1.5 million a year. As the ordinary taxpayer is now facing tax increases, how can the minister justify the use of money belonging to hard-working Australian taxpayers for political propaganda purposes? What possible justification could there be for the government to protect aNiMaLS from the usual scrutiny associated with accountability for the expenditure of public moneys audit by the Auditor General?",82
156,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The organisation to which you referred, while it has had a title change, was not native to us. We arrived to find exactly the same sort of operationMr Downer-You promised to abolish it.",82
157,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that operated at the time you were in office. So we continued the grand Liberal tradition after we changed the title. I suppose that question could have been directed to the then Treasurer at any time he addressed any deficit that he had in mind in the budgets he brought down. The organisation is subject to financial audit, like all Commonwealth outlays. It is not subject to efficiency audit. In that, its position is similar to that shared by members of ministerial staffs, members of opposition staffs and members of parliamentary staffs. They are not currently subject to efficiency audit, although financial audit applies to all they do. If you want to think logically through that and decide whether it is useful to have the Auditor-General run an efficiency audit over the Leader of the Opposition's staff, or over your own staff, for example, perhaps you could write me a note and let me know. Education",82
158,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of criticisms of the government's performance in education levelled by the member for Ballarat? Can the minister inform the House whether these criticisms have a basis in fact?",82
159,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am familiar with the farrago of criticism from the member for Ballarat, obviously desperate to retain his position on the front bench. He issued a press release last week criticising three aspects of education policy, specifically literacy, curriculum development and retention rates. When I learnt last night that the recycled Leader of the Opposition had decided to leave the honourable member for Ballarat as his spokesman for schools, vocational education and training, I was reminded that back in May 1989 the member for Bennelong declined the position of opposition spokesman on education offered by the then leader of the Liberal Party. He announced in a press conference on 12 May that year that he would sit on the back bench rather than take such a junior position. Obviously he still holds the view that education is a matter beneath his attention or he would not have left in the position somebody who has proved beyond doubt that he does not understand the portfolio. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order in relation to relevance. The minister was asked a specific question about my criticisms of the government's performance in this area, including the fact that one in four Australian children have literacy problems. He might care to get back to that.",82
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister was asked a direct question. In respect of the honourable member, he might address that issue.",83
161,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Let me turn to the specifics of the honourable member for Ballarat's complaints. Let me take, for example, his literacy complaint. The honourable member for Ballarat might have been more convincing if he had not made 25 errors of punctuation and grammar in his press release. The honourable member criticised the government's 'newly announced' literacy survey. Newly discovered by the honourable member perhaps, but newly announced it certainly is not. It was announced in the budget last May. The honourable member fails to understand that this represents the first systematic attempt to identify problems of teaching literacy in schools. The states have never agreed previously to contribute their data to a national survey. The states have never agreed on a standard measure ofliteracy. If anything is to be done about alleged problems of literacy, the sources of the problems have to be identified. That is what the Commonwealth is attempting to do. The second area the honourable member criticised was that of curriculum development. He criticised the government for failing to deliver civics education in schools. Yet all will recall that when the Prime Minister first proposed such an element in school curricula members opposite howled in opposition. He went on to claim that my department had announced a program to teach children about the different work that men and women do within the family. He is wrong again. In the International Year of the Family, all state and territory ministers agreed to develop a course on family studies. If the member thinks the course is not important, he should explain his position to all the state Liberal ministers who actually wanted it. Finally, let me be charitable of the member's criticism on retention rates. The ABS confirmed yesterday that the figure it published last week was incorrect. Those diligent and numerate members who examined the initial figures could see clearly that the state and national figures were not consistent, but the member for Ballarat just accepted the headline figure in the media. He either failed to do the sums or got them wrong. Mr Ronaldson-You didn't pick it up; you didn't put a press release out on it.",83
162,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-The fact is that retention rates have certainly fallen, not by 312 percentage points but by two percentage points. There are three fundamental points which the honourable member for Ballarat fails to grasp about retention rates. The first is that, when this government came to office, around one Australian child in three finished year 12. It is now 74.6 per cent. The second is that shifts such as we are seeing are obviously influenced by state policies. If he had read all the figures published by the ABS last week, he would have seen that the number of schools in Victoria declined by 207 last year. He might have asked his Victorian Liberal colleague, the minister for schools in his home state, just how it is you go about keeping young people in education when at the same time you are closing down their schools. The third point is that we have seen over 450,000 new jobs created since the government was re-elected. Students are pursuing a range of vocational pathways, combining work and school or work and technical studies, and clearly that means that fewer will be staying on. It has been clear for months to the whole of Australia that the opposition has been behaving like a flock of headless fowls. The fact that the honourable member for Ballarat is still spokesman in this area proves that, while they might have found the old head, they are still the same old chooks. NA",83
163,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform honourable members that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Doug Young, the Canadian minister for transport, accompanied by the High Commissioner. On behalf of the House, 1 extend a warm welcome to the minister. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Logging and Woodchipping",84
164,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Due to the part-time prime ministerial roster. system, my question too is directed to the Minister for Finance. ask: is he aware that one of the largest oldest timber companies in Western Australia, Whittakers, has asked the WA Stock Exout change to suspend its shares because of the federal Labor government's decision to impose embargoes on timber harvesting in 63 coupes in Western Australian native forests? Has he assessed the likely further financial damage of the chaos his woodchip policy shambles is causing, if only because he about to seek to move to an electorate with timber component? Mr MCGauran-He didn't know that; he has not been there.",84
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party is being put off his question.,84
166,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As finance minister, has he had his department assess the potential for further damage to the Australian economy, including exports, arising out of the shambles in the timber industry? What steps is he taking to bring about an urgent resolution of his government's woodchip chaos? When will his government give the timber industry a fair go and some answers? An incident having occurred in the gallery",84
167,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the situation to which you allude and, yes, it does concern me.",84
168,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So does Barry Cunningham. Mr Downer-What are you doing about it?,84
169,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fact of the matter is that it is not necessary in this current environment-and 1 understand it for lobbying purposes and everything else-to get yourself into a situation where you exaggerate what may nevertheless be substantial problems.,84
170,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,84
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left.,84
172,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whatever lobbying goes on of government, and it is all fair and decent, and above board in democracy, you want to be very careful about exaggeration when other people are going to be making investment decisions or decisions about the value of shares at the same time, because you 1 will have an impact on them psychologically. and That is the first point 1 make on that. The second point 1 make on that is to point what the Prime Minister said in the press release that he made on those reservations of areas. He did not rule out logging in those areas. What he said was that those areas are being examined to see whether or not the values laid down in the forest policy to which all the state governments and the Commonis wealth government, bar Tasmania, signed up a to were in some way going to be offended. 1 would have thought that the most sensible thing for us to do would be to as rapidly as possible come to conclusiops with the state governments and the industry to assess whether or not that actually happens to be the case. That will give the people the sort of certainty they need in the climate that now exists. Whether or not we had gone down that process, the recent decisions by the Federal Court which are related to this, but unrelated to the decision making process, would virtually oblige some process like this anyway-that is, if you are going to have those levels of certainty. These problems will be worked out as time goes by. Opposition members-When? When?",84
173,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But I teJ1 you what will not be worked out. I understand the position of the people in the gaJ1ery and the people who have been lobbying me and others every day that we have walked into this parliament. I know that at the end of the day we will have a solution to this problem.,85
174,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister wiJ1 wait for a moment. I think a genuine question was asked by the Leader of the National Party. By the response from the gaJ1ery, a number of people are trying to listen to the minister's answer. At least give them some courtesy if you are not prepared to extend it to the minister.",85
176,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,VVhat they wiJ1Â· then confront when this is over is this position: you will go into the next campaign with a set of industrial relations policies which wiJ1 deprive them of the protection of their awards and deprive them of their right .to organise. Ethiopia,85
177,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs inform the House about the remarkable aid work performed in Ethiopia by Dr Catherine Hamlin, work for which she was awarded Australia's highest honour, Companion of the Order of Australia, in this year's Australia Day awards?",85
178,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. His interest in aid matters, particularly in Africa, is weJ1 known and I thank him for bringing this matter to attention. Dr Catherine Hamlin was the only woman awarded Australia's highest honour in the Australia Day awards and one of only three who got that honour. I had the very great privilege of meeting Hamlin last year. She is a truly remarkable woman and is doing truly remarkable work in Ethiopia. She has been there for 35 years. She is an Australianobstetrician. From memory, she is now 71 years old. She went to Ethiopia with her husband, Dr Reg Hamlin OBE, in 1959. They pioneered surgery on Ethiopian women suffering from vaginal fistula. In Africa, this condition usually causes in women who suffer obstructed labour through extended childbirth a fistula-without going into aJ1 the medical details-between the vagina and the bladder. That leaves women in constant pain, continuaJ1y incontinent, smeJ1y and unable to work, and they are usuaJ1y and quickly rejected by their husbands and the rest of society. As a consequence, they live lives of unremitting misery. The surgical technique which was devised by the Hamlins and used there has restored something like 15,000 Ethiopian women to health and has enabled them to lead a normal life. VVhen one sees the testimony of these women, I think you could say that the work they have done is truly miraculous. They began their work with a three-year contract at the Addis Ababa General HospitalÂ· in 1959 and have stayed on ever since. They found that women suffering from this complaint were not accepted by the general hospitals, so they had to set up their own. This they did with donations from the United States, England and Australia. Elevewthousand operations have been carried out in the hospital that they themselves set up. . Under the Australian aid program, I have been very pleased to be able to give $120,000 to the hospital to upgrade the facilities and set up a hostel for women who are waiting for surgery, laundry facilities and a residence for an additional doctor. In the next month, another $54,000 is to be used to provide a laboratory, a staffroom, canteen, library facilities, furnishings and equipment. These are funds that I give with the most extreme pleasure. .I take this opportunity to congratulate not just every recipient of honours and awards in Dr the Australia Day honours, but Dr Hamlin in particular-a most remarkable woman. and a whoJ1y deserved award. It is through such dedicated workers as Dr Hamlin that our aid has such a good reputation. They are the heart and soul of the volunteer movement. I thank the member for drawing attention to this matter.",85
179,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Reports: Government Responses",85
180,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule showing government responses to House of Representatives and joint committee reports for the period 13 May 1994 to 8 December 1994, and reports presented to which responses are outstanding. Copies of the schedule are being m-de available to honourable members and it will be incorporated in Hansard. The schedule read as followsReports presented to which responses are 8 December 1994 This document continues the practice of presenting to the House of Representatives at approximately six-monthly intervals a schedule listing Government responses to House and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding. The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 25 May 1978 Prime Minister Fraser informed the House that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government Description of Report Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (House, Standing) Justice under scrutiny: inquiry into the imple05-12-94 mentation by governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Review of Auditor-General's Audit Report No 36, 1992-93; No 1, 1993-94, Volume 3, Sections 1.13-1.39; and No 27, 1993-94, Sections 16.19-16.24 Review of the Auditor-General's Audit Report No 20, 1993-94, Northern Land Council Access and equity-rhetoric or reality? Inquiry into the implementation of the access and equity strategy Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Joint, Statutory) ASIO and security assessment: a review of security assessment procedures Banking, Finance and Public Administration (House, Standing) proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983, at which time the ministerial statement method of response was continued. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament has been taken as the .date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee. outstanding The schedule includes advisory reports on bills introduced in the House of Representatives. Other than the advisory report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the schedule does not include reports from this committee, reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Governmentresponsesto reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.

184,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader. of the Opposition (Mr Co-tello) proposing that a definite matter public importance be submitted to the for discussion, namely: The abject failure of the Government's economic strategy, which has led Australia to a runaway account deficit, rising interest rates and I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required by the standing orders having risen in their",91
185,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Today is a sad and sombre day for the Australian public and for the Australian economy. Today, Australia experienced its highest ever current account deficit for a month. In the month of December, in our trading position with the world, as a nation, we lost $2,400 million. People in the gallery who are concerned about forest matters might have been here to see the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) come into the parliament today and answer some questions. They might be wondering. why it is, at a time when we are running a deficit of $2,400 million for a month, that the government has got plans to close down exports in their industries. They are going to be wondering about that. They are going to be wondering why, on a day when Australia had its worse current account deficit ever, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot even walk into the parliament. They are going to wonder why the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is not here. The Treasurer is sitting in his office, having journalists in for cups of tea. He is watching this on television. But do not ask him to come here and answer to the people of Australia in question time. Oh, here he comes now! Let us give the Treasurer a welcome! It is very good of you to tum up, Treasurer. It is very good of you to come in after question time, after the opportunity to stand here and account for yourself. It is very good of you to tum up after watching it all on television. Do you like it better on television? Why can't you come into question time and explain yourself and tell the people of Australia why the deficit was $2,400 million for the month of December and why the current account deficit was $13 billion over six months? That is a 53 per cent increase in the deficit over the same period last year-from July to December. The merchandise trade deficit rose by 118 per cent in this month, with imports up six per cent and exports down five per cent. It would have been higher, had it not been for the net income going backwards. That will rise in due course as debt servicing rises in relation to world interest rates rising. We will have debt feeding on debt and the interest costs feeding on the interest costs. Mr Chynoweth interjecting",91
186,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The member should shut up. He is in the wrong parliament. He gets up here and talks about Jeff Kennett. He ought to know where he is. He has not made one contribution on Commonwealth policy. He has forgotten where he is. That deficit will be higher as world interest rates rise. We are going to hear tired old arguments coming out of this government about how bad things were in 1982, although we had an advance on yesterday. The Treasurer said that this has been a problem for 200 years. He actually thinks Captain Arthur Phillip set him up for this problem-or maybe it was Bennelong, who welcomed Arthur Phillip, that set up this problem. He was saying yesterday that this has been our problem for 200 years, that that is how long it has been around. When those opposite get slightly more serious, they talk about what was happening 12 years ago. We are going to hear that over and over again; if I had run out of arguments I would probably do the same. That is the reality of this discredited government. Let this fact be put on the record: 12 years ago when the Fraser government left office our net foreign liabilities were $23 billion; they are now $160 billion net. That is a sevenfold increase over the period of this government's stewardship. Can we call it 'stewardship'? We can call it gross negligence. Yesterday we had a bombshell. This Treasurer came in and said that his budget forecast had missed by $8,000 million. Mr Richard Evans-Whoops!",92
187,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It was going to blow out to 5.75 per cent of GOP. In 1986 when the current account deficit was getting to around the level of six per cent, the current Prime Minister went on the John Laws program and said: ... you can't fund $12 billion a year in perpetuity every year, and then the interest on the year before that, and the interest on the year before that. The only thing to do is to slow the growth down to a canter. Once you slow the growth under 3 per cent, unemployment starts to rise again. The interview continued: Laws: And then you have really induced a depression. Keating: Then you have gone. You are a banana repUblic. In 1986 the Prime Minister said ' ... you can't fund $12 billion a year'. VVhat is it now? It is $26 billion-back to 5.75 per cent of GDP, as I said yesterday. VVe are going right down the same track that the Prime Minister described in 1986 as leading to a banana republic. That is not our description, that is the Prime Minister's description. His excuse on that occasion was that we had a collapse in international commodity prices. Now they are high. The Reserve Bank says that, in US dollars, they have risen by 14 per cent. VVhat is the excuse this time? VVho is the government going to blame? There is only one culprit standing behind this, and it is the Prime Minister himself. As Glenda Korporaal said in today's Sydney Morning Herald, 'Australia's latest balance of payments crisis is driven by internal factors rather than external ones.' But that should worry the government even more. That is its responsibility. VVe saw it again when the government set us up for a current account crisis in 1989-90, when the current account got to 5.9 per cent of GDP. The government took interest rates to 17 per cent and business rates to 20 per cent. Then when it was all over, the Prime Minister said, 'This is the recession we had to have.' VVhy? VVe had to have a recession to deal with the current account problem. After coming. through that recession-the worse recession in 60 years-after putting one million people out of work, and after ensuring there was record small business bankruptcy, we are right back where we started. The Australian people will say to themselves: what was it all for? VVhy did we have to throw one million of o,ur fellow Australians out of work? VVhy did we have to bankrupt all those small businesses just to get right back to where we are now which is where we were before? It seems to the Australian people that, no sooner do they see a bit of light, no sooner is there a little ray of sunlight and they feel they are finally getting out of recession, then what does the government do? It starts jacking up their interest rates. It starts putting their mortgage repayments. It starts making it tougher for small business people. It starts setting them on exactly the same path again and worse because this time you are not only going to get the interest rate increases, you are going to be slugged with the tax increases as well. So this government has in mind for the people of Australia a high interest rate, high tax, low savings, high current account deficit, high budget deficit future. VVe have a Prime Minister who is monumentally out of touch. Do you know what he said yesterday? He said that this was the best year of economic news since 'thewar'. Let us put it in the terms of the Minister. for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca)-'the best year of economic news since VP Day'. That is what the minister will be telling us shortly. Of course, the Prime Minister was behaving a little erratically yesterday because he got on radio 2UE. I went on after him and because I went on after him, he rang in from his car phone and said to the interviewer: Any time any of us are invited, straight away there is a Liberal to reply. The interviewer was a bit shaken. He said: I think it's probably a factor of opposition ... The Sydney Morning Herald article is headlined, 'Keating hits the airwaves (temper, temper ... )'. .. VVe do not expect him to come into the parliament. But you can you imagine this emperor who does not deign to come into the parliament. He went on a radio program. How dare they insult him by letting anybody else on after him! VVhen you are a part-time Prime Minister and you do not have to come into the parliament and you deign to do a radio interview, how dare they have another view! How dare people talk about a current account deficit when it is the best year of economic news since 'the war'. You only have to read today's newspapers. Max VValsh states: For Australia to be moving into Mexican territory in terms of the current account defioit is a matter of considerable concern, ... This government has put us in the situation of that having the highest current account deficit in the OECD except for Mexico. Do you know what the Prime Minister said on radio 2UE? up He said, 'Look, putting up interest rates isa good thing. YOli see, you-re taking out premium insurance on your job because if I put up interest rates, you're going to keep your job. So it's just a little premium you pay on your home mortgage.' I will tell you what the premium is, and you know it. The premium of high interest rates in this country is a premium that has been put in place because of your current account deficits and your record run-up of massive foreign debt. That is the premium that Australians are paying. Australians are already paying the highest bank prime interest rates in the industrialised world, and you are going to drive them higher. Or are you? Last night, the Prime Minister said there was no cause for an adjustment and the Treasurer said he could not rule out a rise before the budget. Who is wrong? You or the Prime Minister? I have to say in your defence, Treasurer, I think you are right on this one. I think there will be interest rates the May budget, and you know it. But I will tell you what is absolutely fascinating about this: the Prime Minister going on television saying that there is no need for interest rates to go up. Do you know why it is fascinating? Because we have all been told the Reserve Bank sets interest rates in this country. Why is the Prime Minister out there on the television and the radio saying what is going to happen to them? How could it possibly be the case, with an independent Reserve Bank, that the Prime Minister can go out and tell us where interest rates are going to go? You can bet your bottom dollar that interest rates will go up. You have a secret tax agenda. You will not come clean on what that tax agenda is. You are talking about taking out your failures on the people of Australia in relation to interest rates and taxes. I will tell you what is even worse on this current account deficit: you have a deliberate policy to frustrate exports. You will not allow uranium mining. Exports are falling in this country. We have a current account deficit and you say that we cannot mine uranium except if it is in the Northern Territory where it is nice clean uranium. But if it crosses the state border into Western Australia it cannot be touched. What is the logic behind it? The logic behind it is, as you know, the union officials who control your national conference have said that CRA had to be punished, and because CRA had to be punished we cannot mine uranium. We have a current account deficit in relation to forest products; yet you are actively mucking up this industry. You have trucks parked all around this place. You have picket lines of workers consisting of the kind of people that the Labor Party used to represent but no longer does. You used to stand up and pretend that you had some moral authority to represent those people. You have walked away from them. You have betrayed them. You have left them in that situation. You are actively causing problems with exports. You think woodchips are a problem where you have five of your members about to resign. The Labor Party is bitterly divided. before Wait until the Treasurer and the Prime Minister tell you their real agenda on privatisation. The Prime Minister was on TV saying, 'There is another way we can do this; it is privatisation.' He is looking longingly and lingeringly at Telecom to try to solve his budget problems. Let us see if the Treasurer gets up here and rules out privatising the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank. We have made it entirely clear that we believe in privatisation-not to cover budget deficit shortfalls but to retire debt and to reduce expenses in the servicing of public debt interest. We have made it entirely clear that we will not hamstring Australian export industries like uranium mining. We have made it entirely clear that we are serious about doing something about the current account deficit. We have made it entirely clear that we are not going to let you break your electoral promises and engage in electoral fraud and take out your mistakes on the Australian people. We have made it entirely clear that the Australian people want someone to stand by them, stand up for them and look after their interests. They do not want to see this mishmash, this outfit of bitterly divided rabble, continue with its economic mistakes in the way that it has. This is a figure and this is an outcome for which this government must be condemned. (Time expired) MrWILLIS (Gellibrand-Treasurer) (4.18 p.m.)-It must be a long time since a government in this country has been condemned for producing the fastest rate of growth of any country in the Western world and producing an additional 300,000 jobs in one year. Is this abject failure of a government? The government has been doing this in association with an inflation rate of just over two per cent in the underlying rate and, for the full year, just over three per cent because of the increase in interest rates showing up in the CPI. This is a temporary factor. Is this some abject failure of government economic policy? What a complete and utter absurdity to accuse a government of abject failure when it is producing very high rates of economic growth, high rates of employment growth, a considerable improvement in productivity, a restructuring of the Australian economy which its predecessor government never had the guts to touch, and changing the whole structure of the Australian economy from one which was serving this country very badly to one which will serve it in great stead in the future. The government is doing all this despite the fact that it is facing some difficulper ties in what has happened to commodity prices and the drought, and is having some problems with its external accounts because of that. That is a transitory problem. The fundamentals are being addressed by this government and have never been as well addressed by any previous government. Anyone who is a clear observer would recognise that to be the fact. This government is producing outcomes which the previous Fraser government, of which the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, could never have dreamed of producing. When the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, what kind of growth did the government achieve in those days? It was a pathetic effort on every front. It was a pathetic effort on growth. In the period of the Howard treasurership there was growth of 2.1 per cent per annum on average, while under us it has been 3.3 per cent on average-a 50 per cent-plus improvement. As for the inflation rate, when the Leader of the Opposition left his job as Treasurer it was 11.4 per cent. Today it is just over 2.5 per cent, an incredibly lower rate. And that 11.4 per cent was in association with double digit unemployment of 10 per cent. So he had the duo-the high, double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment-an appalling record. He also had a great record on interest rates. The opposition is keen to take advantage of the fact that there have been some increases in interest rates but what did it do when it had hold of the economic levers? When the Leader of the Opposition left government as Treasurer he left behind a 90-day bank bill rate of 15.9 per cent. Today it is 8.4 per cent. He had a peak rate on the 90-day bank bill of 21.65 per cent. He left behind a home mortgage rate, a regulated rate-there was no deregulated system then and you had to beg your bank manager to get this rate--of 12.5 per cent. Today it is 10.5 per cent. It is not a regulated rate and it is obtainable in a quite easy way. The small business rates when he left were 13.5 to 14 per cent. Today they are 10.3 to 11 cent. Large business rates when he left were 15.5 to 16 per cent. Today they are 9.75 to 10.75 per cent. If you want to give us lectures about interest rates, go back to your own record and look at what you did when you were in office. When the Leader of the Opposition had hold of the interest rates lever or talked to the Reserve Bank about it, what did he achieve with interest rates? There were much higher rates of interest under the Howard government or the Howard treasurership than there have been under this government. We are achieving far better outcomes on interest rates than was the case when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. What kind of record did he have on employment? He achieved an average rate of growth of jobs of 52,000. What has been the rate of growth of employment under this government? It is 154,000, or more than 100,000 a year more jobs per annum under this government compared with the lousy outcomes under the present Leader of the Opposition as Treasurer. That is the kind of outcome we have achieved compared with what the opposition could achieve. The Leader of the Opposition has a record from when he was Treasurer, and you need to go back and look at his record when he stands in this place and tells the Australian people that he could do better. You look at his record and you will see what an abysmal record it is. We have heard a bit about inflation. As I said, the inflation rate is far higher under Howard government than it is under Labor at present. We have also heard about the current account. Several times in the past decade and a half the current account has been at levels similar to what it is now. The first of those times was when who was Treasurer? It was the now Leader of the Opposition. He was there when it was 5.5 per cent of GOP. So do not tell us that this is something unique to a Labor government, havfng a current account at 5.5 per cent or so. You achieved that in the year 1981-82. That was the current account outcome then. So do not give us high moral lectures about current account outcomes. That is what you achieved. We are told that we are a high taxing government but what kind of a tax record does the now Leader of the Opposition have? When he was in charge of the tax lever what did he produce? When the Leader of the Opposition left office as Treasurer, government revenue as a percentage of GDP was 26.1 per cent. Under Labor it is 24 per cent this year-I gave the revised figures yesterday-so we are taxing two per cent of GDP less than the Howard treasurership did in the early 1980s. Two per cent of GDP represents $10 billion of taxes that we would be coIlecting today if we were coIlecting at the same sort of tax level at which the Leader of the Opposition was coIlecting when he was Treasurer. The Leader of the Opposition wants to stand up in this place and go on radio and talk about the terrible thing this government is doing in terms of taxation. He hopes that the people will forget about his record. The fact is he has got a rotten record both as Leader of the Opposition and as Treasurer and we are going to make sure that everyone knows about it. There was a higher ratio of government outlays to GDP under the Howard government than there currently is under Labor. We get from the opposition lectures about reducing the size of the public sector, getting government expenditure under control and so on. The opposition was patently unable to achieve that back in the early 1980s. By the standards of the past this government has performed very weIl in comparison with the previous the government and other governments around the Western world. Virtually no other Western government is producing the combination of outcomes in growth, employment and low inflation that we are. That is a fact. Of course it is very rare to have a situation where everything is completely terrific. There is the downside at the moment that we have a current account which is too high and needs to be addressed, as I mentioned yesterday. One reason for that is that we have been, in a sense, too successful on business investment. Business investment is growing at a rate far beyond the expectations of the opposition, which said that there was no possibility that we could get these kinds of growth. What the shadow Treasurer said after the budget last year about business investment bears some repetition today. He said that business investment was dead in the water, that there had been simply no recovery in investment in Australia, that business investment was being hamstrung, and that business investment was still dragging the chain. What has been happening is that business investment has been growing at a rate of knots. Despite the fact that the opposition said it would never happen, we have seen business investment growing not at the 14Yz per cent forecast in the budget but at 24 per cent-an extraordinary take-off of growth in business investment, which is producing productive outcomes for the future because that business investment provides the basis upon which we can grow in the future and upon which we can have more jobs and produce more exports. A good example is today's balance of payments figures, which show for December a further increase in the current account deficit for that month. Virtually the whole reason for the increase was the liquid natural gas tanker import. That LNG tanker cost $360 million and is a very large capital import. At the moment it shows up as a negative in the current account. But what will be done with it? It will be used to export LNG at the rate of $140 million per year. It will add very considerably to our capacity to improve exports. It will cover its import cost in less than three years and will be a net contributor of substance to Australia's exports in the future. That is just one very clear example of the fact that an increase in business investment can be very productive indeed for the balance of payments even though there is that up-front import cost. Of course business investment as a whole is very import intensive. When you get strong growth in business investment, you must expect a surge in imports, particularly in capital imports, because business investment is import intensive. Since the budget, the forecast for the current account has grown from $18 billion to $26 billion. About half a billion dollars was in the original forecast and another $1 liz billion of that increase of $8 billion is accounted for by the intensification of drought, because we have not got commodities to export. It is not the government's fault; the commodities are not there, because there is a drought. As the drought breaks, and it seems as though it is well on the way to doing that--one certainly hopes that is the casethat will obviously rectify matters next year and in years to come. I have already spoken about business investment. In terms of the growth from $18 billion to $26 billion on the current account, some $2 billion can, be attributed to the extraordinary growth, that additional growth, in business investment. We have also had an increase in interest rates around the world which puts up our net interest payments overseas. That factor will add about $1 liz billion to our current account deficit. So those three factors account for well over half the $8 billion increase. It remains nevertheless the situation that government clearly needs to ensure that we further tighten policy and the circumstances of that current account deficit figure to ensure that we have a sustainable recovery. We announced yesterday that that is what we will do. We will do it in a way which is sensible and logical by going through the budget process to produce a tightening of fiscal policy and a better outcome on savings in this country. That is what is clearly needed in order to have a capacity for sustainable economic development. We are very well situated in many respects. We have undertaken tremendous structural change in this country. The opposition may try to laugh it off, but it is an enormously changed economy from what it was when the previous government was in office. It has had reductions in tariffs. It has had a widespread array of micro-economic reform in many industries, which has meant that they are now much more efficient. We have had a 30 per cent increase in our international competitiveness. We have productivity in the non-farm market sector of the economy growing at some four per cent per annum. That means that our capacity to be competitive is enormously increased. We have produced an economy which can show large increases in productivity. That helps us to keep inflation down, makes us more competitive and gives us the chance to further improve our balance of payments in the future by further diversifying our exports. We have seen tremendous growth in exports of manufactured goods growing at some 13 per cent per annum in real terms. We are seeing about a 10 per cent growth in services exports-industries which were largely incapable of exporting before this government came into office and are now very much up to it. Those are the sorts of changes that this country was crying out for. They are fundamentally important changes which we are determined to proceed with, despite the current account difficulties. We will proceed with the tariff cuts. Those structural changes will bear this country in great stead in the future and ensure that we are able to reach a the situation of strong sustainable growth with current account outcomes that do not lead to a cessation of growth, as they have done in the past. That will not occur this time because of the way in which policy is being pursued. (Time expired)",92
188,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Listening to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) speak alarms me because he seems to have a total misunderstanding of what is going on in this country today. He selects certain figures for short periods and compares his record with ours. I think the only fair comparison is that of the average figures when we were last in government compared with the average figures for the last 10 or 12 years that those opposite have been in government. I will take up the indicators that the Treasurer was discussing. Let us look at the current account deficit. The average current account deficit under the Fraser government was 3.4 per cent of GDP. The average current account deficit under the Hawke-Keating government was 4.4 per cent of GDP-substantialI:Y more. Let us look at unemployment, which the Treasurer spoke about. The average unemployment rate under the Fraser government was 6.42 per cent. The average unemployment rate under the HawkeKeating government was 8.64 per cent-33 per cent higher. The Treasurer spoke about private sector investment. Private gross fixed capital expenditure averaged 17.1 per cent of GDP under us; it averaged only 16.7 per cent under them. For the Treasurer to latch on to the business investment figures and fling them around during this time of bad news is desperation indeed. If you look back to March 1983 when those opposite came to power, you will see that the figures are notoriously volatile. some quarters they were positive 23 per cent, but in the next quarter they plunged to minus 13 per cent. There were 10 quarters where they dropped by 34 per cent. If the Treasurer is hanging his hat on that, I think he is on dangerous ground indeed. Another indicator that the Treasurer referred to was savings. An average level of savings under the Fraser government was 24 per cent; under the Hawke-Keating government it was 18.7 per cent and is falling. Foreign debt was also mentioned. When we handed over the reins to Labor in 1982-83, overseas debt was $23 billion or 13.6 per cent of GDP. Today, it is $160-odd billion, which is 38.2 per cent of GDP. Real wages is another matter the Treasurer mentioned. The average yearly real male wage growth under us was 1.3 per cent. Under Labor, the average growth is a negative figure-minus 0.01. We are ahead again there too. The workers are also better off under us. The Treasurer spoke about the taxation burden. Tax revenue averaged 22.9 per cent of GDP under us; under Labor, it averaged 24 per cent. We beat them hands down there as well. It is absolutely fraudulent for not only the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) but also the Treasurer to get up here, select figures over a narrow period of time and paint themselves in a better light. Mr Braithwaite-Clutch at any straw.",98
189,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Indeed. The parliament and the nation have received two bits of very bad economic news. The current account deficit projected for this financial year is $26 billion, an all-time record. For the month of December the figure was $2.386 billion; again, an all-time record. It has risen 53 per cent over the last six months. It is hitting home to Australiajust what this will mean I think for the first time. Yet we had the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in question time here today talking about the government's-I can hardly believe this-deficit reduction program. I remind the Minister for Finance that the deficit is blowing out like we have never seen it before, at record levels. We were totally and absolutely misled at In the last election by the Prime Minister. The classic broken promise that he made, amongst many, was the solemn promise to reduce taxes; the l-a-w promise, which turned out to be nothing more .than an l-i-e promise made by a person who can only be described as I-ow for making such a promise and then breaking it. It is extraordinary. Now it appears that we will have 100 days or 14 weeks of inaction while waiting for the 9 May budget, contemplating what sorts of tax increases and interest rate increases we will have to suffer in the meantime. Before the last election not only did the government promise tax reductions which it did not deliver; it also mentioned nothing about the tax increases that it brought in straight after it was elected. Who will forget, particularly those in country areas, the savage increases in fuel prices? The government tried to put 5c a litre on the price of unleaded petrol and lOc a litre on leaded petrol. It has now gone up to 5c and 7c respectively. The people located in marginal regional electorates will not forget that. If the government imposes another 10c a litre on those people-and this is now being discussed in the pressthere will be massacre in the bush. The government imposed sales tax increases. It is talking about carbon tax increases. Worst of all, the government will hit its own voting heartland when it imposes a three per cent wage tax increase which is called a workers superannuation contribution. That will allow the foot in the door for a charge of six per cent, then nine per cent and probably 15 per cent if Labor is re-elected. The government's inconsistency is also unbelievable. One minute it says that it cannot cut spending and that we are deficit daleks, the next minute it .talks about cutting government spending. Apparently, we are going to switch over from being deficit daleks to become deficit darlings but I will believe that when I see it because, quite frankly, I do not think that the Prime Minister has the stomach for it. In fact, the Prime Minister did not know what the situation was. It took the Treasurer to fly to Sydney last Friday to tell him. The Prime Minister has been so rattled by it, he has been running around making feral phone calls to radio stations ever since. As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), said, we have the largest current account deficit in the developed world. We have the largest current account deficit of all of the OECD countries except for Mexico. It will be $26 billion this financial year, which is 5.75 per centofGDP. Mr Anderson-Why does he hate our kids, because they've got to pay it back.",98
190,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes, and our grandchildren. What is Mexico's current account deficit? Ours is going to be 5.75 per cent of GDP and rising. Mexico's current account deficit today is 6.6 per cent, and we know what is happening to the peso there-it is plunging. As I mentioned earlier, our overseas debt is $160 billion. I wonder what Mexico's overseas debt is. Do honourable members know what Mexico's overseas debt is? Ours is $160 billion net. Mexico's net overseas debt is $74 billion net-about half of ours-which is 22 per cent of GDP. Do honourable members know what ours is? Our net overseas debt is 42 per cent of GDP-virtually double Mexico's. So the comparison with Mexico is apt indeed. We all remember that, when the Prime Minister was Treasurer, he got the medal for being the world's greatest Treasurer. We tend to forget that the person who got the medal for being the world'sÂ· greatest Treasurer the year before our now Prime Minister did was the Treasurer of Mexico. The government even puts out other mistruths. It claims that it has a revenue problem, but it is really a spending problem. In 1995-96, the government is going to spend $7 billion more than it projected it would spend in the One Nation statement. So let us not be misled that it is a revenue problem. It is totally and absolutely a spending problem. The Prime Minister is nothing more or less than economically illiterate. He has fudged the truth on tax cuts and tax increases-and there are more to come. The privatisation even program has become a farce. Last year alone, 530,000 people were hidden in the job market program. We have heard a lot in this parliament today about VP Day, which we are going to celebrate this year. We will be celebrating 50 years since the last war. We are going to be celebrating VK Day at the next election. (Time expired)",99
191,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"This matter of public importance provides an opportunity for both sides to put some credibility into the economic debate. That is what we would look for from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) rather than the juvenile sort of debating process we get both here and outside in the media. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition basically offers nothing as far as the opposition's view or approach to these issues is concerned. He refers to matters relating to the level of business investment. What he said at the of the budget shows his zero credibility in approach to these issues. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) does not try to rectify the mistakes the Deputy Leader of Opposition has made on the issue. I have heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on a few occasions now refer to the need for national savings to grow- He is right on that point. We need to do more to encourage national savings and to encourage private savings. But what is the opposition's policy in the area of private savings? One key area that is very strong as far as increasing national savings is concerned relates to our superannuation guarantee arrangement. What is the opposition's approach to encouraging that level of private savings? Its approach is to freeze the superannuation guarantee arrangement. Rather than encourage national savings, as Dr FitzGerald identified in his report to the government-and which should be supported by all sides in this parliamentthe opposition's approach is to say, 'We'll freeze that area of important national savings.' Superannuation assets today represent $186.7 billion to the national economy. They are very important assets that add greatly to the nationfar al savings effort of all Australians. The opposition takes the approach of obstructing progress in the areas of national savings, fiscal consolidation and the deficit, and, therefore, the idea of having a sustainable recovery with a comprehensive deficit reduction plan. You would think that for most of the measures it would not be too difficult for an opposition to say, 'Yes, it is important for us to operate in the national interest and to take steps to support national sustainable recovery.' That would be a constructive opposition's approach. But, rather than do that, for everyone of those measures the opposition has tried its best in the Senate to thwart the deficit reduction plan. In relation to this year's approach, by way of the response of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday, the government has outlined the very positive news-which the country should welcome-that there has been strong growth. There is no reason why that growth cannot continue in a sustainable way, but there needs time to be a recognition that, as we proceed his through the cycle of economic recovery, some of the government involvement in the stimulus of that economic recovery will need to be the wound back. That is a responsible course of action to take and any responsible opposition would say, 'Yes, we recognise the validity of that approach.' We have seen business investment grow rapidly. It has now reached 24 per cent. At the time of the budget, the shadow Treasurer said that those figures were fanciful. He said that they would not be achieved and that we were talking a lot of nonsense in terms of the projection about where business investment would go. Business investment has grown by 24 per cent. That is something that we should welcome because it is ensuring that capital goods are coming in and that we get a productive investment back into the economy. Even today's figures on the balance of payments highlight the fact that capital goods represent a substantial part of that growth in merchandise imports. That again is something that is going to be for the good of the economy in the longer term, but it does mean that we have to ensure that attempts we make as as the current account is concerned address the issues in that area. That is occurring. There is absolutely no reason for us to see' the figures released yesterday by the Treasurer as anything other than positive news for the people of Australia They mean that we are getting continuing strong job growth and very productive business investment, which will help encourage further job growth into the future. That has been achieved with low inflation being maintained. The trend line on inflation again highlights the fact that we are achieving growth in this recovery with low inflation. Notwithstanding the fact that the interest rate adjustments made to date will feed into inflation to a limited degree, the comparison with 1982-83-when the former Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was in the chair running these issues-is stark indeed. We had the trifecta under the former Treasurer. We had double-digit inflation, interest rates at high levels and high ), unemployment. As we moved through that phase under the former Treasurer, there was absolutely no prospect of inflation being reduced in the now opposition's process of trying to get us to extricate Australia out of the hole it was in at that time. There was no hope at all of that occurring; Of course, it is very different today. We actually have low inflation. Employment growth is coming through and the economy is running. There is every reason to believe that, with the right balance of policies in the future, we can achieve a sustainable level of quite high growth by Australian standards, but one that nevertheless can ensure, with a growing outward-looking economy, a manageable level of growth. That is the big difference between now and 1982-83. None of the things that were needed to really open up the economy and none of the areas that needed to be deregulated to provide that opportunity were able to be undertaken by the former Treasurer. This is because the National Party kept the brake on all those sorts of things that perhaps some in the Liberal Party thought were desirable but never had the temerity or the gumption to proceed with. Of course, today we have an economy that is subject to tests internationally. There are a few tests that you can make. The first is to compare our level of growth with that of other economies. If you were to do that, you would see that we are growing strongly. Economists from most countries would love to have the set of circumstances Australia has so they could drive their economies forward, and they can do that with low inflation. In Europe, people are desperately seeking this sort of good news to be able to move forward. We have every reason to believe that we can manage our processes quite effectively in that context. The comparison with Mexico is, of course, a nonsense. When we look at all the economic indicators we would be subjected to versus Mexico or other OECD countries we come out well on almost everyone of the lead tables that might be identified in that regard. The key point to make in this context is the government recognises that the area of the current account does have to be addressed. The Treasurer outlined yesterday the considered approach the government will take in the lead-up to this year's budget to ensure that we properly address this issue. That means constructively looking at both the outlays side and the revenue side as part of that process. Absolutely nothing should be taken from yesterday's announcements by the Treasurer and stl:ltements by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) other than that they are saying that the government will keep its eye firmly on the ball in the lead-up to the budget presentation on 9 May. One of the things that comes through from the figures that have been emerging in the last few weeks is that the economy has already started to respond to the action that has been taken on interest rates. The three official movements in interest rates have already seen changes occurring in terms of the level of economic activity. So what we need is not to have some crazy range of measures taken now, as the Leader of the Opposition wants, but a sober analysis in the lead-up to the budget of how the economy moves in the next couple of quarters; and then make appropriate adjustments in our budgetary position and look at the outlays and revenue measures at that stage. To do anything else based on, say, the building approval figures for today or the retail sales figures out today would reflect an unwillingness to respond to the core issues in terms of our economic activity and the core strengths of our economic performance-and to build upon them. We have been told over the last 12 months or so by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we were going to have double-digit inflation. We have been told there would be a run on the dollar. We have been told almost every other absurdity that could come along; the most recent being that we are going down the Mexico road. The fact is that we have kept inflation at low levels and we have an economy that is growing and will continue to grow. We have unemployment coming down by a far greater magnitude than anyone expected 12 months or so ago; all because the that government has taken the right mix of policies at the right tiIpe and has recognised the need to keep the economy growing and pick up that rate of recovery. Now, with the economy moving well, the government can move out of that process to allow the private sector investment to occur. Private investment will be able to take up that slack in a major way because it is making the sorts of productive investments that will enable our outward economy to prosper in the next 12 months or so. The mature economic writers are saying we have the right balance; and I think this MPI highlights that point. (Time expired)",99

193,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of facilities for Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School, Townsville. The Department of Defence wishes to relocate 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School from Sydney to Townsville to meet operational and training requirements. 10 Terminal Regiment provides Army's terminal capability and most of its water transport capability. The Army Maritime School trains 10 Terminal Regiment's personnel. This proposal will place the regiment close to its primary user which is located in Townsville and will also allow for the vacation of current locations on Sydney Harbour. The development proposal will provide office accommodation, instructional facilities, marine facilities, repair facilities and storage facilities. The estimated out-turn cost is $25.5 million and it is anticipated that construction will start in September 1995 and be completed by December 1997. I commend this motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",102
194,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment works for CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Gungahlin, Australian Capital Territory. The redevelopment at Gungahlin will be designed to accommodate 90 staff and a number of visitors and students. The staff will include 60 research personnel and 30 in management, administration and research support. The proposed works will replace existing temporary and substandard accommodation and provide additional facilities to meet expanded functions on the site. Existing unsatisfactory facilities will be demolished and the new facilities built within the existing campus in accordance with the site master plan. The CSIRO site is an 88-hectare parcel of 10 land located in southern Gungahlin, Australian Capital Territory and is bounded by the Barton Highway to the west and Bellenden Road to the north. CSIRO tenure is a 99-year Commonwealth lease. The project with a budget of $7 million has been approved by the CSIRO board and will be funded from within the CSIRO 1994-2000 capital investment plan. Completion of the project is expected by late 1997. I table the drawings and commend this motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",102
195,Mr LIND SAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology)-by leave-I thank the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) for his indulgence and the House for allowing me leave to make some observaimpact tions on notice No.3. This is an important referral to the Public Works Committee that the location of 10 Terminal Regiment Townsville will add a significant the operation deployment force. There is a degree of urgency associated with the move. Due to the restructuring of 10 Terminal Regiment, it can no longer operate over its sites at Middle Head, Georges Heights and Woolwich, and the Chowder Bay location of the maritime school. The relocation to Townsville, which I hope will be completed by the end of 1997, will enable the Department of Defence to underopportunities take a rationalisation of its Sydney Harbour properties. A number of potential sites waterfrontage in Townsville and, may I say, Brisbane have been investigated but the Department of Defence considers the Townsing ville site the most viable, especially as Terminal Regiment's single customer happens location. to be the 3rd Brigade which is responsible for maintaining the amphibious capability of the Australian Army within the army itself. There is no doubt that the operational and training effectiveness of the 3rd Brigade will be enhanced by the move of 10 Terminal Regiment to Townsville through reduced Public travelling time and a one-stop embarkation point. In addition, the regiment plays an important role for the Australian Army. provides amphibious beach teams survey and prepare beaches for amphibious tactical lodgments and control the beachhead during operations. It also provides a terminal troop at 28 days notice to move into support the 3rd Brigade and maintains close links with navy and civilian shipping operations. Importantly, so far as North Queensland is concerned, it conducts a number of Defence Force aid to the civil community tasks where a demonstrated training benefit can be established. Such support in the past has included emergency assistance in times of natural disaster and also help with other community activities. The 10 Terminal Regiment has a strength of 321 all ranks-that is, 150 Australian Regular Army personnel and 171 general reserve personnel. So it will have a significant also on the activities of the Defence Housing Authority in Townsville which will in provide accommodation for married personto nel, some 60 of whom will be accommodated capability to at Lavarack Barracks. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) are to be congratulated on this important initiative. It will not only improve the capability and operational and training effectiveness of the Australian Army and the 3rd Brigade in particular but also, very importantly, the project, which will cost an estimated $26.8 million, will give job to the people of Townsville and Thuringowa and provide opportunities for with businesses to supply various goods and services associated with the project. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity of speakto this motion and to express my appreci10 ation to the government for this proposed Public Works Committee Reference",103
196,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Works Committee Act 1969, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and It report: Housing development at Golf Course which Estates, Palmerston, N.T. The continuing increase of service personnel and their families associated with the Army presence in the north (APIN) requires provision of some 810 additional housing units between 1995 and 2000 in the Darwin area to accommodate defence personnel and their families. The Defence Housing Authority is responsible for the provision of housing for service families in the Darwin area. The demand for good quality family housing for the projected increase in army personnel over the next few years cannot be satisfied by the local market. In order to eliminate the significant housing shortfall, the authority is proposing to develop two sites, Palmerston Golf Course Estates and a neighbouring site known as the Gunn land, and construct 740 dwellings for defence personnel and their families. The dwelling mix will be 20 per cent units, 20 per cent courtyard homes and the remaining 60 per cent traditional homes. The proposed development will be undertaken as a joint venture. The estimated total cost is $159 million. I commend this motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA",103
197,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEE,Watson) (5.06 p.m.)I move: That the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 be referred to the Main Committee. Members should be aware that this week the Main Committee will sit only on Thursday. At the beginning of the sittings there is not a great deal of legislation. Both the Chief Opposition Whip and I have talked to the various parliamentary committees to see whether they had any reports they wished to debate. That offer from the government is still open and we are looking at a number of 'take notes' that the opposition might want to have dealt with up there in the next two weeks. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. ANZAC DAY BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.,104
198,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEE,"I spoke only briefly on the ANZAC Day Bill before I was interrupted by question time. This bill is designed to set permanently 25 April as Australia's national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those, including those who died, who served Australia in times of war and in warlike conflicts. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that for all time 25 April is recognised throughout Australia as the national day of commemoration. It is very appropriate that this House is debating and considering this bill at this time as we commence the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. Throughout Australia, there will be many events to commemorate that important anniversary. They are being coordinated under the umbrella of the program called Australia Remembers 1945-1995, which is an initiative of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for which he is congratulated and very strongly supported by all members of this House. In question time today, the minister discussed a minor controversy that had emerged earlier this year over one element of the Australia Remembers program. In fact, I was about to comment on that matter before I was interrupted by question time. The minor controversy was over whether the name given to 15 August 1945 should be VJ Day, Victory over Japan Day, or VP Day-as we are now calling it-Victory in the Pacific Day. It is a minor issue but it was raised by some members of the RSL. This matter created quite a deal of controversy in Brisbane. For hours and hours on Brisbane talkback radio we heard debates and recollections from older residents about whether or not it was called VJ Day or VP Day. In question time the minister very comprehensively demonstrated that both names were in common use in 1945, that both names have validity and that there were no surreptitious or suspicious motivations by the government in selecting the term' VP Day' to describe 15 August. It was amazing to note the fervour by which that debate on this question occurred on radio talkback. So many people were absolutely convinced of either one cause or the other. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has taken a very conciliatory attitude and has not attempted in any way to be dogmatic, but to prove the point that both terms are equally valid. What this talkback episode demonstrated and what this debate demonstrated was that there is a great thirst for knowledge within the Australian community in relation to Australia's contribution to the wars around the world and to international efforts to seek peace; that Australia has had a major role throughout this century in every major conflict, whether it be a full scale war, a warlike conflict or a peacekeeping operation; and that Australians can hold their heads high with pride about the contribution that hundreds and thousands of Australians have made throughout the century in those incidents or wars. In the same way, this ANZAC Day Bill serves to set in concrete our nation's commitment to those contributions. I think it is absolutely appropriate that 25 April be established permanently, nationally, to be celebrated or commemorated as our national day of commemoration for that sacrifice and for those contributions, because it has become a problem in some states. Although we recognise 25 April as the day and the ANZACs and the members of the RSL engage in marches, et cetera, on that day, some states do not necessarily declare 25 April as the public holiday. They attach it to the weekend or have it as another day. The concern has been raised legitimately that as the generations pass on and as the large number of people who were veterans of the Second World War pass on, there will be a lessening of the commitment to ANZAC Day. The very purpose of this bill is to ensure that we enshrine 25 April permanently as that day of commemoration, because it is such an important day in our nation's history. There has been some criticism of ANZAC Day, and people in the community who misunderstand what ANZAC Day is about often criticise us for having a public holiday or having marches, in some way accusing it of being a glorification of war or being some sort of excuse for a few people to get together and have a few drinks and a bit of a gamble in the club. I believe that ANZAC Day represents something much more important than that. That is why this bill is getting such strong support from both sides of the House. Although it is a minor bill in the scheme of things, it is an important symbolic gesture. I would like to answer some of the criticism that has been raised about ANZAC Day. It is true that many young people do not understand what actually occurred in the Second World War, in the Korean War, and there are many who do not understand the contributions that occurred in the Vietnam War. They have allowed the politics of certain issues to cloud the actual contribution and sacrifice that occurred in each of those conflicts. I believe that the establishment and continuation of ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration enables us to ensure that the reason those men and women contributed that effort in those war years is remembered, not what the actual politics were of the conflicts but why those individual Australian citizens were prepared to contribute and risk their lives-and in many cases sacrifice their lives-for a particular principle. It is the principle that they were fighting for, what Australia stood for as a free society, a democratic society, a society where all individuals were able to live in peace and harmony. That was what those Australians who entered those wars and warlike conflicts were fighting for, and it is that that we have to keep emphasising in our commemoration each year of 25 April. That is the principle that all ofthose people fought for. They did not fight for symbols; they fought for principles. They fought for the very essence of what our Australian society is and what it meant to them. That was a free democratic society where all individuals could rise to their own ability, could contribute greatly to our society and live in a free, open society. That is why it is important that we do take the opportunity each year with ANZAC Day to ensure that we teach all our generations of Australians what that sacrifice meant. This year will give us a particular opportunity to emphasise those key points, being the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. ,I am delighted to have the opportunity as the federal member in my area to chair the local committee of the Australia Remembers commemoration and to organise a number of activities in our schools, in our local communities, in the parks through picnics, through concerts and also through memorial ceremonies and to help contribute to the broadening of the education and understanding of all our generations in Australia about those principles that those Australians fought for. ANZAC Day provides us with a clear, concise opportunity in the Australian calendar to pay homage to our ANZACs of all gener-tions and to use their faith, their fire and their commitment to inspire fellow Australians to national greatness. It is our responsibility as the country's law makers to ensure that the significance of ANZAC Day does not become eroded over the generations, and that the commitment and the sacrifice' that those Australians made is continued. I am delighted to support this bill, to congratulate the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) for his original initiative in moving his motion. I also congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in taking forward the spirit of that motion and bringing this bill forward. I commend the bill to the House.",104
199,Mrs BISHOP,COMMITTEE,"I rise to support this bill, to support the concept that ANZAC Day, 25 April, be permanently made, in the words of the introduction to the bill, a national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who have served Australia, including those who died in time of war and in warlike conflicts. I rise to speak because I think it is very important that when we put on the record the fact that we wish to honour those who have served, we do it in a way that is honest and straightforward and is in no way tinged with political correctness or any effort to rewrite history. I was interested, for instance, to hear in the parliament today when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) rose to debate-because he introduced it at question time-the question of whether or not the end and the defeat of Japan in August 1945 should be called Victory over Japan, VJ Day, or Victory in the Pacific, VP Day. He said that it did not matter what it was called: he Kad chosen VP Day. He held up about 10 examples over the course of some 50 years which purported to uphold his contention. I interjected and said, 'It does matter.' He said to me, 'Bronwyn, don't worry; you'll enjoy the year anyway.' I will and he will, because both of us want to honour those people who served. But it does matter because it matters to the p'eople who served. It mattered to those who fought. It matters to those who suffered in POW camps, who toiled on the Burma Railway, and came back to tell the tale. I spent time with such people only recently. If we are to properly recognise and pay credit to the sacrifice that was given, then the first thing we can do is listen to the people who gave the service. I and the good minister are both beneficiaries, together with millions of others, of the sacrifice they made. If they want to call it VJ Day then VJ Day it should be. But I go back to the words of the bill. It states that ANZAC Day is: ... to be the national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who have served Australia. I have gone back and thought of the people who fought in World War I. I have gone back to a speech I made in the Senate on 5 March 1992. That was the time when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was trying to rewrite history and was denigrating the British. I said: Paul Keating's rabid attack on Britain is one against an old ally with whom we fought proudly in Flanders and Ypres in World War I, commemorated by the red poppy which we wear each year to remember; in the Middle East, in Greece and in Crete in World War II-and, yes, World War II saw us suffer in the POW camps of Malaya and Singapore and on the Burma railway. Part of our tradition is the selfless sacrifice given by so many Australians in so many theatres of war to give us today the freedom we enjoy. My father fought for me and my land in places such as Balikpapan and Borneo. He joined up, together with thousands of other Australians, after war was declared because Germany invaded Poland. Perhaps he remembered that General Monash was of part Polish Jewish heritage. I do not know. But I do know that he believed that the general was a great Australian. I know he believed himself that he was fighting against evil-the evil of Nazi Germany, of Hitler, of Mussolini. He knew all of that before Japan entered the war. He joined before he knew that his theatre of war was to be his own backyard. He and thousands like him believed in the dignity of the freedom of man and that it was worth fighting for in any part of the world. Then I did some research into our history. I went back to the records of the parliament of 27 September 1938-three days before Chamberlain signed the notorious Munich pact. Mr Curtin said: Our view, based upon an acute realization of all that has happened to Australia in the last 25 years, is that the wise policy for this dominion is that it should not be embroiled in the disputes of Europe. I have said before, and I say now, that we have not the power to solve or to appease them; and we should not risk the lives of our own people in an endeavour to achieve what appears to be doubtfully possible. He further said: I remind Australia that we have already experienced a colossal waste of the flower of our manhood. By this legislation we honour those people who sacrificed, and those people who gave, those who saw that evil had to be fought, by making 25 April a permanent day of commemoration. Mr Curtin said on 28 September 1938, two days before Mr Chamberlain signed the Munich pact: But I submit that the claims for extra territory which appear to be implicit in Herr Hitler's proposals, as against the original proposals, do not resort to force in Europe; nor do they warrant war in Europe. I take the responsibility of going so far as to say that should war in Europe result over this matter it will be a war that Australia would regret. But Australia, while regretting it, should not be involved in it. He further said: I make that statement quite frankly. I merely add that it is the hope and, I believe, the prayer of every Australian, that war will be averted. I add that it is my own prayer that if war cannot be averted in soine parts of the world at least the people of Australia will be spared it. Of course, other Australians did not see it that way. They saw it as part of their duty and they did serve. We have remembered in recent days the horror of Auschwitz and read the recollections of individuals who mattered. Every individual in this world matters, has an intrinsic worth, yet because the people of Auschwitz were singled out the horror of that place and what was done to the Jewish people remain a blight and something which we also must remember. As we remember ANZAC Day and honour our Australians who chose to give of themselves to help others as well as our own land, I can only say that I rise to speak in this debate because I feel a sense of pride in a nation that can produce such people-people who are above their own idea of serving only themselves, who have made the Australian people feel part of a proud nation able to hold our heads high. As we honour all who have served in whatever theatre of war or war-like situation-in the words of the bill-I simply want to say thank you.",106
200,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"I rise to support the ANZAC Day Bill 1994. It is a bill which is for: An Act to declare ANZAC Day, on 25 April, to be the national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who served Australia(including those who died) in time of war and war-like conflicts. The key clause of the bill is clause 3, 'Observance of ANZAC Day as the national day of commemoration'. It says: The national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who have served Australia (including those who died) in time of war and war-like conflicts is to be justify known as ANZAC Day and observed on 25 April each year. This is a bill which has, I suspect, support from all members of this House. I do not need to do any more than refer to the explanatory memorandum and a couple of com:ments from the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to outline the significance of this bill, the historic importance of ANZAC Day and the great contribution that day makes to our national spirit and development of a national identity. The explanatory memorandum says: The decision to introduce this bill flows from concerns within the community about the future recognition and observance of ANZAC Day. It goes on to say: The bill will set aside 25 April each year as a special day for Australians to contemplate and salute the spirit of ANZAC and dedicate themselves to the same ideals of service, courage, commitment, endurance and niateship which sustained the ANZACs and all those who served after them. This bill ensures that while 25 April will be the day of commemoration specifically to commemorate those who have served in war and war-like conflicts, the bill will in no way detract from or affect the celebration of Australia Day or other important events in the country's history. I am sure most members would be aware that ANZAC Day originally commemorated the landing of Australian and New Zealand forces at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 during World War I. After World War II, ANZAC Day became a day of remembrance for all the dead of those two wars and has now become a day to commemorate the service of all those involved in the first two world wars and, subsequently, Korea and Vietnam. ANZAC Day was first observed in 1916, and 25 April has been a public holiday in all states since about 1920. This bill will enshrine ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration. The minister, in his second reading speech, made the following points, which I wholeheartedly endorse: The object of the bill is to ensure that, for current and future generations of Australians, the contribution of all those who served Australia in time of war is commemorated and remembered, so that ANZAC Day will continue to hold an important and special place in the hearts and minds of all Australians. He went on to say: The deeds of Australian soldiers at ANZAC gave birth to a belief in the capacity of all Australians attain for themselves a uniquely independent and proud national identity. The ANZAC tradition embodied a true sense of national character. For the first time, it set Australia and Australians apart by demonstrating their willingness and capacity to have Australia's voice heard in its own right in the community of nations of which it was a part. He went on to describe the ANZAC tradition as the unifying symbol of the nature and character of the sacrifice made by Australian service men and women. He said: Nor is there any doubt about its subsequent influence on later generations of Australians who continue to uphold that tradition. I also adopt what he said towards the end of his speech: I am mindful also that, in focusing attention on the significance of commemoration and remembrance, the tragic aftermath of war should not be forgotten. In this sense, I believe that this bill symbolises the debt owed by the nation to those whose lives were affected by war. It is, therefore, a timely reminder of the continuing commitment of the Australian Government to honour and serve veterans and their war widows through programs of care, compensation and commemoration. I have been very fortunate, since becoming the member for Perth, to work closely with a number of local RSL sub-branches in my electorate. The minister referred in his speech to the continuing commitment of the Australian government to honour and serve war widows through programs of care, compensation and commemoration. These local RSL sub-branches work assiduously to ensure that that objective is met. Since becoming the member for Perth I have been involved on a number of occasions in ANZAC Day commemorations with local RSL sub-branches at commemoration sites within my electorate. I am pleased that those local RSL sub-branches are involved, through the local Perth Australia Remembers committee, with the Australia Remembers celebrations. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those RSL sub-branches throughout my electorate and the contribution they playas important parts of the Australian community and my local community. I have been pleased to to be involved in the Mount Lawley-Inglewood RSL sub-branch ANZAC Day commemorations, which traditionally take place at Clifton Crescent in Mount Lawley. It is a suburb near where I grew up. I am pleased that on ANZAC Day my father has attended those commemorations with me. The Mount Lawley-Inglewood sub-branch has as its president Mr John Quinn and as its secretary Mr Derek Arkeveld, both of whom I know and both of whom make a substantial local contribution to the aspirations and objectives of the RSL and the aspirations and objectives to which we all adhere through the commemoration of ANZAC Day. Another local RSL sub-branch with which I work closely in my electorate is the Bedford Morley sub-branch, which commemorates ANZAC Day at the Salisbury Street commemoration site in Inglewood. Inglewood is the suburb in which I grew up. Many of the Bedford Morley sub-branch members are card carrying members and players of the Bedford Bowling Club, of which my father has been a playing member since 1967. I am also pleased that on ANZAC Day my father is able to attend the Bedford Morleycommemoration at the Salisbury Street site. Like Mr Quinn and Mr Arkeveld, the Bedford Morley subbranch secretary and president, Mr Ted Pennington and Mr Chris Pitsikas, make substantial local contributions. I am also pleased to work with the Maylands RSL sub-branch. Mr Ron Larkin is its president and VVendy Jupp is its secretary. The ANZAC Day commemoration takes place at Eighth Avenue and Guildford Road, at the commemoration site in Maylands. I have also had the great pleasure of being able to work closely with what is now called the Eastern Region sub-branch of the RSL, which is a recent amalgamation of the Bassendean Guildford RSL sub-branch and the Bayswater Meltham RSL sub-branch. The current office bearers of the Eastern Region sub-branch are  Jack VVagland, who is its secretary, both of whom have been involved in the Australia Remembers commemoration at the local level. I have been pleased to attend the ANZAC Day commemorations at Halliday Park in Bayswater, ,and the commemorations in Bassendean at the Old Perth Road commemoration site, which is directly opposite my electorate office. I am also pleased to be to work closely with the Bellevue sub-branch, which is situated at the Bellevue RSL Servicemen's Club in Purton Place, Bellevue. On ANZAC Day, a commemoration service is conducted there. It is one which is supported very strongly by local residents and by the Shire of Swan, the relevant local authority. Arthur Elder and Jock Manderson perform their president and secretary roles with distinction. I am pleased to have also a couple of Polish ex-service associations in my electorate-the Polish Ex-Servicemen'sAssociation, which is based in Maylands, and the Bellevue Polish Ex-Servicemen's Association, based in Bellevue. I share a local RSL sub-branch, the Nollamara North Perth RSL sub-branch, with my colleague from VVestern Australia the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron). I am pleased that members of that sub-branch, together with the ones I have referred to above, and the two Polish associations were able last year to meet with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in my electorate office and to raise with the minister some of their concerns about veterans' matters. One of the programs I am pleased to see the minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), commission during 1995 is Operation Restoration. VVhile this is a program which is separate from Australia Remembers, it is consistent with the ideals of the Australia Remembers program. Operation Restoration is a program which will have the effect of ensuring that throughout Australia many local war memorial or commemoration sites will be restored. The effect of that program will also be to provide new work opportunities for long-term unemployed people. I have made the point that there are a number of commemoration sites in my electorate. These are, in the main, traditionally maintained and kept in good order by the relevant local authorities, but from time to time more general repair or maintenance work is required. This is precisely the objective of the Operation Restoration program. I am hopeful that in 1995, through Operation Restoration, the relevant local authorities will able make application to ensure that the local memorial sites to which I have referred are restored to their original condition. I refer specifically to the City of Stirling, which has responsibility for the Mount Lawley commemoration site in Clifton Crescent, the Inglewood commemoration site in Salisbury Street and the Maylands commemoration site in Eighth Avenue, Maylands. I am very pleased that the Mayor of the City of Stirling, Councillor Adam Spagnolo, has indicated his council's wholehearted support both for the Australia Remembers program and for Operation Restoration. The same is true of the town of Bassendean, which has responsibility for the commemoration site in the Old Perth Road in Bassendean. The Mayor of Bassendean, Councillor John Cox, is a very strong supporter of ANZAC Day and the aspirations that that day entails for all Australians. The Mayor of Bassendean is a great supporter of that commemoration site. The same is true of the City of Bayswater, which has responsibility for the commemoration site in Halliday Park in Bayswater. Its mayor, Councillor John D'Orazio, has made clear to the Australia Remembers local Perth committee that his local authority, the City of Bayswater, strongly supports the Australia Remembers program and also the Operation Restoration program. That is also true of the Shire of Swan which, as I have previously indicated, has responsibility, in part, for the Bellevue RSL commemoration site. The President of the Shire of Swan, Councillor Charlie Gregorini, has played an active role in the Australia Remembers local committee and is keen to ensure that the Bellevue RSL site is restored as part of the Operation Restoration program. I also have in my electorate the RSL Mount Lawley War Homes, situated, as its name describes, in Mount Lawley. I am very pleased to be able to work closely with the chairman of the Mount Lawley RSL homes, Mr Ken Baker. As a result of a visit to the Mount Lawley RSL homes by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, with me and my state parliamentary colleague the member for Perth, Diana Warnock, the minister initiated a task force to investigate specialist veterans care services in conjunction with the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawthe rence). I will read into the record the terms reference of that task force and make some points regarding the importance of that incould quiry to the Mount Lawley RSL homes. The preamble and terms of reference are as fol lows: The Government has a special commitment to provide recognition by the nation of the contribu"" tion of veterans and war widows. This includes ensuring access to the most appropriate highÂ· standard aged care services to maximise quality of life. This recognises that, for many veterans, their illnesses and disabilities have been caused,or exacerbated, by their war service. The Government's aged care reform strategy has sought to establish and refine a full range of services covering the continuum of care required by older people. The objective is to provide high quality care, within targeted planning models, which take account of individual needs and preferences in care type and which has shifted the balance of care towards expanded support through community services. The specific terms of reference state that: ... the role of the Taskforce will be to: l.(a) Analyse the existing range of aged care services for veterans and war widows and investigate the extentto which veterans, war widows and their carers have been able to take advantage of the gains provided to the general community over the last ten years. l.(b) Identify strategies to improve access to the full range of aged care services by veterans and war widows. 2.(a) Examineways in which the aged care needs and preferences of veterans, war widows and their carers, both as they presently exist and as they are likely to change in the future, can be identified, recognised and addressed in the context of overall Government directions in residential and community care. / 2.(b) Within this context, identify ways in which the Government can assist ex-service organisations to provide an appropriate wider range of services and investigate how these services could best be delivered. 2.(c) Delineatethe respective roles of Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Human Services and Health in the provision of aged care services for veterans. The key term of reference which is of relaged evance to the Mount Lawley RSL homes is that which reads 'to identify ways in which government can assist ex-service organisaof tions to provide an appropriate wider range of services and investigate how these services best be delivered' . It is the aspiration of the Mount Lawley RSL homes to provide a - wider range of residential care to war veter as. As part of the task force inquiry, earlier this month members of the task force visited the RSL war veterans homes in Mount Lawley. Following that visit, the minister wrote to me to indicate the progress of the task force inquiry and its direct relevance to Mount Lawley. I draw the attention of the House to some of the key points that the minister made in his letter to me: ... I understand the discussions at Mt Lawley were extremely fruitful and that a number of opportunities have been identified in relation to the War Veterans Home facility and in the wider precinct around that facility. I know you will be keen to playa part in ensuring that full advantage is taken of these opportunities. He went on to state: It would appear to me that there is a significant opportunity open to us here to facilitate a cooperative approach to the provision of aged care services in your electorate. The Taskforce has identified several areas where a co-operative approach could mutually benefit both the proprietors of these facilities and the clients who make use of the facilities and the services provided. He further stated: I understand that the management of the War Veterans Homes were somewhat attracted to the idea of providing care based on the needs of their residents rather than providing facilities which must be filled with veterans with certain types of care needs. This would change the emphasis to focus on demand, (i.e. the veteran's needs) rather than supply, (the availability of a particular type of There are also a number of other opportunities in areas such as catering, medical support, insurance etc that could be explored. I know from my discussions with Mr Ken Baker, the Chairman of the Mount Lawley RSL homes, that this will be a welcome first step in relation to that task force's inquiry. While talking of matters relevant to veterwill as affairs in my electorate and in Western Australia, I note that many of my local RSL sub-branch members would be aware that the Deputy Commissioner for Western Australia, Mr David Watson, has recently retired from that position to be transferred to Canberra way of promotion. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Watson for the valued service that he provided in his role as Deputy Commissioner. He has the respect of the veterans community in Western Australia and he certainly has the respect of those members of the veterans community within my electorate. Mr Watson also has the respect of my father, whom I have referred to earlier, as a result of his and his officers' assiduous attention to detail. After many years of waiting and having been the beneficiary of change to legislation, late last year my father became a fully-fledged veteran, entitled to that status under the act. As a result of the assiduousness of Mr Watson and his officers, my father was finally able to prove his maritime war service and be provided with his veteran's status under the legislation. Mr Watson has my gratitude for that and my father's respect and regard. I wholeheartedly support the bill before the House.",107
201,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"It is a pleasure to participate in a debate in this House that truly has bipartisan support. What the ANZAC Day Bill sets out to achieve certainly has that. The move to have ANZAC Day recognised as Australia's national day of commemoration began early in 1994 when a private member's motion was moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and seconded by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), with the full support of the Returned Services League of Australia, as well as hundreds of thousands of bed). signatures on petitions to achieve this goal. This bill, which has finally come before the parliament today for debate, has true bipartisan support. This bill declares that ANZAC Day be celebrated nationally on 25 April every year, regardless of whether that date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday or a weekday. The bill ensure that 25 April remain a national day of commemoration to recognise those who fought for our country then and in all conflicts in which Australians have fought ever since. There has been a growing anxiety within the ex-service community that ANZAC by Day may not be observed in years to come, and this move will certainly allay those fears. ANZAC Day is a celebration of mateship, of self-sacrifice. For many Australians it marks the birth of an independent, free Australia. The ANZAC legend has many ingredients and offers themes that continue to be of relevance today. As World War I diggers pass on, the ranks of World War II thin and the veterans. pf Vietnam age, it is important that ANZAC Day remain a meaningful day of remein brance and thanksgiving. This is particularly important given the compulsion of some to reappraise important Australian symbols. It is also important that a day such as ANZAC Day remain free froin the debates about participation in foreign wars. ANZAC Day must not be seen purely in modern day terms. To understand the meaning of ANZAC Day, we need to enter the very different mental and physical world Australians lived in during periods of war. Australia did not enter the war with closed eyes. The community feeling of the time emphasised a love of the old country and an infinite desire to protect it. ANZAC Day as our national commemoration day may eventually become more important than Australia Day. There are several reasons for this possibility. ANZAC Day is very inclusive in terms of race. Men and women of Anglo-Celtic background fought alongside Aborigines, those of European backgrounds, et. cetera. Australia Day celebrates the beginning of European history in AuÂ·stralia, whereas ANZAC Day celebrates the coming of Australia and all Australians to a maturity. On that point, an interesting article appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald at around the time that ANZAC Day fell last year which bears that in mind: ANZAC Day is a much more inclusive and forward-looking occasion these days. That is not to say that the traditional values are no longerhonoured or the traditional themes no longer apparent. Quite the contrary. ANZAC Day would not be ANZAC Day without the celebration of ""mateship"" and of the virtues of self-sacrifice, courage in the face appalling odds, and the determination to stick things out until the end. And the day still marks in most people's minds the baptism if not exactly the birth of a nation of independent, free, and freespirited Australians. But ANZAC Day is no longer locked in the pastor trapped in an image of old men speaking a dead language. ANZAC Day has embraced the wider and more contemporary changes in Australian society. The pride and self-confidence it manifests directs our attention to the future as much as it does to the beaches of Gallipoli in 1915. The ANZACs demonstrated that Australians are the measure orany other people anywhere in the world and that is a lesson as pertinent in these days of rapidly changing commercial opportunities and rapidly shrinking cultural autonomy as it was to the fledglingAustralian nation of 80 years ago. It is terribly important that we recognise that. That is part of the ethos behind the support that has been rimstered for making ANZAC Day our national day of commemoration. I was drawn to the main onition that was .made by Peg Webster at the ANZAC Day ceremony that was held in Port Macquarie last year. I will read that speech into the Hansard record as it is a very interesting speech put together by an Australian citizen. The speech reads: My name is Peg Webster and I was an army nursing sister during the Korean War, and it is a privilege to speak on this day. Nothing I say can do justice to the heroism of the Australasian soldiers at ANZAC, it would not be possible to overpraise them, they made our country's name known throughout the world, and I feel it an honour to pay tribute to their gallantry. This same gallantry has manifested itself in the men and women who have served our country since then. It is part of the Australian way, and it is a way that we must all strive to maintain. It does seem at times, in our multiculturaI society that our hold on honesty and decency, on fair play, truth and duty, is slipping, and it is the responsibility of every one of us to be watchful, and not lightly sever ties, that have helped to form the basis of the Australian way-just because of a whim or fancyor a political gambit, or political ambition, and not to accept change for 'change sake',-and the burden must increasingly be shared with the young-as they grow. We would like to think that thes y young people here today, will never be called upon to take up arms in war, but we would like to think that they will be ready to defend the freedoms-theprideand the ideals of the Australian way, which is of surely what those men of ANZAC believed. Each of the 200 Australian flags, donated by the Sub Branch and handed out by ex-service women to children this morning, is symbolic of these things. The entombment of the Unknown Warrior in the Hall of Memory at the National War Memorial in Canberra-on Armistice Day last year-saw a upsurge of pride and an awareness of sacrifice throughout our country, Nothing can alter our history; it is fact, it has happened-and no amount of rhetoric, or sweet i, talk, .or manipulation, can change the things that are passed. We hear of the facts of history being purposely misrepresented in some countries, and we must all be vigilant and aware and ensure that we continue to honour those men of ANZAC-and all the m:en and womeh since-and keep Australia a place that is worthy of their sacrifice. ANZAC Day does not commemorate material values; the costs of war can never be counted. It doesn't praise victories nor boast of conquests. It shines a light on the human spirit and its ability to conquer fear and hardship in the struggle to reach the highest ideals. Every ANZAC Day, when the Last Post soundsAustraliahs honour those who served, and every ANZAC Day, when Reveille sounds-it is a call of awakening and rededication, to remind us of the standards for which we must all strive when called upon to do our duty. And that is why-once a year-on this solemn day-the bugles sound all over Australia ...... . LEST WE FORGET. I thought that was a very good oration on ANZAC Day last year by an average Australian. I would imagine that Peg VVebster represents many hundreds of thousands of people in her beliefs, ideals and understandings of what ANZAC Day is all about. It is not just about the past; it is about the future and what Australians are about. It is very important that this bill before the house today receive this bipartisan support. It is very important that we do not allow politicians either today or in the future to meddle with that history by rewriting it. ANZAC Day is locked in there and it will always be part of the ethos of this country and all its citizens. It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), talk about a lot of the veterans in his electorate. Of course, I represent the electorate of Lyne on the mid-north coast of New South VV ales. A high percentage of the population there are retirees, a high percentage of which in turn are veterans. My electorate has a very broad cross-section of veterans not just from the Second World War or the Korean War but also from the Vietnam War. I have a very active group of Vietnam veterans throughout the electorate of Lyne. Just recently, I had the opportunity to meet with a group of veterans in Wauchope who have established an office where they are going to run a counselling service for Vietnam veterans in the area-a self-help service of veterans helping veterans. On that occasion, they asked me whether I would make representations to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for some small amount of financial assistance to help run that office. I know that the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs is certainly very mindful of the plight and circumstances in which a lot of the Vietnam veterans are living today. He has certainly made some moves towards alleviating those problems and I commend him for that. We still have a fair way to go as far as that particular section of our veterans' community is concerned. A lot of work remains to be done in assisting a lot of the Vietnam veterans and their families as they struggle with that part of their life that is causing them concern today. As this nation continues down the road on which we are stepping today with the ultimate passing of this piece of legislation, it is building these people up. They no longer feel demeaned. They feel as though this nation is finally recognising a lotÂ· of the sacrifices they and some of their comrades have made and which they and their families are making today. So we need to continue along that line in supporting this bill and recognising the broader definition and understanding throughout this nation of what ANZAC Day is all about. The bipartisan support of this bill through the national parliament is important in ensuring that ANZAC Day is recognised as Australia's national day of commemoration, and I add my support here this afternoon.",111
202,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,COMMITTEE,"-I agree with the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) that it is a pleasant duty to speak to this bill and know that it has bipartisan support. The ANZAC Day Bill of 1994 is very important. This bill will cement ANZAC Day as one of the two days of national significance on the Australian calendar. ANZAC Day and Australia Day should receive equal attention and equal prominence as Australian national holidays. The very first ANZAC Day was the day that Australia genuinely became a nation. It was the true birth of the Australian national image and identity. The heroic deeds of the ANZACs at Gallipoli were the true beginning of the very fabric of the Australian nation. What we are today, what we believe in, and how we see ourselves all began on the very first ANZAC Day. The mix of qualities which make people genuinely Australian had its roots here. Australian mateship, tenacity, humour and fairness can all be linked back to the GaUipoli campaign. The ANZAC tradition and ANZAC Day really do represent what Australia is all about. As a consequence of this it is totally appropriate that the day of commemoration known as ANZAC Day be set in legislative concrete. This bill will ensure that ANZAC Day will observed Australia-wide on 25 April each year because first and foremost ANZAC Day is a day of commemoration and not just an excuse for a holiday or long weekend. As I have already said, ANZAC Day is central to the Australian tradition and that tradition should be observed into the future by commemoration on the right date. We should be much more concerned with paying our respects to those that have fought and died in Australian conflicts than with simply having a day off or a long weekend. Australia's national day of commemoration, 25 April, sees commemoration not only of the efforts of those who fought in the frontline battle but the efforts of all those who served in uniform. It is also a day of commemoration for those who stayed behind and who made immense sacrifice to keep this country running. It is important that the role of these people, many of them women, be remembered. We hear about the bravery shown by our soldiers in the frontline who are rightly remembered for the honourable service they gave to this country. However, I would also like to highlight the role of those women who served in uniform and at home. These women should be given greater recognition than has sometimes been the case in the past. During World War II, for example, some 70,000 women served in uniform in organisations such as the Women's Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, the Australian Army Nursing Service, and the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force. The outstanding Australia Remembers calendar which I and I suspect most others received today pays tribute to these women. I quote from one of the pages: Thousands of them endured hardship, many were imprisoned, some died in the line of duty but their spirit never wavered, and their outstanding example, is still remembered. The role of women is often overlooked in the total picture of Australian conflicts. I would like to specifically highlight the role of women in World War II as this is particularly pertinent in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the be end of World War II, and because I, too, am a woman representing women in Australia. It is a little known fact that most women's services saw active service in theatres of war during World War II. These included Darwin, New Guinea, Malaya, Ceylon, Greece, Eritrea, Syria, Egypt, Libya and Palestine. Members of the women's services served in every battle area in which the Australian Army was involved during the entirety of World War II. Many of the women were involved with medical units which obviously had to be situated close to the front line. Not only did these women experience action; they experienced action in some of the most dangerous of hot spots of the war. Many of the hospitals in which they served were directly bombed and they came under direct fire in a number of theatres, including Greece, at Crete, and Tobruk. In the fall of Singapore, 65 servicewomen were killed or captured by the Japanese and only two dozen of these survived prisoner of war camps until the end of the war. At home in Australia another organisation that played a crucial role during World War II was the Women's Land Army. The Women's Land Army consisted of women aged between 18 and 50. Many of these women were from the large Australian cities. They left their suburban life to supplement the supply of rural labour engaged in food production, which was severely depleted as many workers volunteered for military service. Even in my electorate I have had a lot of women from the Women's Land Army come forward and tell me the story of their participation in the war. It was a very little known story for someone like myself who was actually born at the beginning of the war. It is a story that has been long unsung and it is time that we heard it. The Women's Land Army is but one example of the effort made by those women who remained behind while their fathers, husbands and brothers were away at war. ANZAC Day is for them, too. Every Australian owes a debt to all the men and women who have made sacrifice in one way or another in time of war for the benefit of current and future generations. ANZAC Day is a special day for every Australian community. It is a day of remembrance and a day, may I say, of renewal. Each year a new generatlOn of Australians watches, listens and learns on ANZAC Day about their history and their tradition. There is another role that ANZAC Day plays and that is an educative role. It is very, very important. It is important that ANZAC Day be conducted therefore, on 25 April each year and on no' other day. The date 25 April has been significant, is significant and will, af-er this legislation is passed, always be of special and specific significance. It is significant because it is truly an anniversary of the Australian nation coming of age. Each year it fulfils a role for us all. It fulfils the role of education for the young-those who have not been exposed to war. It fulfils the role of remembrance for those that Australian conflicts directly affect: remembrance of fallen comrades, remembrance of lost friends, remembrance of sons and daughters, fathers and mothers who did not come home. ANZAC Day brings out in all of us feelings of true respect: respect for those who gave up so much, some paying. the ultimate sacrifice, for the future of our natlOn, Australia. It also gives us a real sense of true national pride. We all know that Austr-lian soldiers have distinguished themselves m every conflict in which they have been involved since the first ANZACs. Every Australian should take great pride in the achievements of all these people. ANZAC Day gives us all the opportunity to show that pride. On many ANZAC Days I have stood proudly beside those ANZACs. As the honourable member for Lyne has said, the numbers of the original ANZACs are dwindling and the numbers of the World War II veterans are dwindling. But we have other veterans and we must ensure that they also are proud to stand: our Vietnam veterans, our Korean veterans and veterans from other areas of conflict. As members of parliament we are all participating this year in the Aust-a!is - eÂ­ members program. We are partlclpatmg because we are proud of what it means. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his department are to be commended for what they are doing for the veterans from all spheres of war. Each member of this Hou-e is to be commended for what he or she IS doing along similar lines to myself. We need to pay tribute, as others have said, to all RSL organisations, including the subbranches that work so tirelessly for the veterans and the women of the auxiliaries of those sub-branches who work behind the scenes. We must never forget the other groups too numerous to name. A couple of small examples I have come across are groups like the 3gers, the POWs, the Women's Land Army, and the returned men and women of our nation. We must all stand tall and pay tribute to them. It is a remarkable sensation to be speaking on a bill that has bipartisan support and to know that we all pay that tribute. I commend this bill to the House.",113
203,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,I see that the honourable member. for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) has her own little war going on outside Parliament House at the moment. I hope she is fighting for the jobs of the loggers from her electorate. Mr Knott-You look as though you've been in a war.,115
204,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Yes, I feel as if I have come out of a war. Mr Deputy Speaker, I should apologise to the House for not wear-g a tie. I must say that I am one person who IS a stickler for convention in this place, but since I have broken my arm I have found that about the only thing I cannot do is tie a tie knot and I have not really wanted to ask anyone else to do it for me. I apologise to you, Sir, and to the House.",115
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Mr Andrew)I am sure that the House wishes the honourable member for MCPherson a speedy recovery.,116
206,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"The ANZAC Day Bill 1994 follows on from a private member's bill which was debated in this House on 6 June last year. I took part in that debate. The motion moved at that time by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) reflected the wording of a petition which had been taken up by RSL clubs around Australia. That petition was, in part, a response to a concern that ANZAC Day may not always be the unique national day of commemoration that it should be. At the time there were suggestions floating around that it might become the focus of a wider commemoration, or that it may perhaps incorporate Australia Day, or some other variation on that theme. During the debate I expressed some reservations about the intentions of the member who moved the motion. Now we have before us a piece of government legislation which is quite innocuous. I accept that it is widely supported both in the parliament and by the Australian community. I do not want to spoil entirely the spirit bipartisanship which has existed in this debate, but I want to state again in the context of the debate my abiding distrust of this government, and particularly of the bona fides in veterans' affairs of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). ANZAC Day is everything that has been said about it today. It is a unique day and it has evolved because returned servicemen and women and their organisations have been so diligent in ensuring that it is not forgotten. Up until now, ANZAC Day really owes very little to governments but much to the RSL and the other returned services organisations which safeguard and have safeguarded the interests of veterans and their families so well for so many years. I, like all members here, have spoken in the past with great conviction about ANZAC Day. Many of us take an active role each year in the ANZAC commemorations. I recently started wearing, with great pride, my father's medals on ANZAC Day. I hope one day my son will do so too. I often tell my son, Timothy, about his Pop's war service. He hardly remembers Pop, who finally died of a war caused disease, leaving my Mum a war widow. I also tell young Tim about Vietnam. I want him to understand why the government of the day sent his Dad there. Frankly, I do not trust this government with any of this country's precious traditions. In my view, standing here in this parliament today, this government has done enormous damage to the fabric of our society over the last 10 years. Like me, many of the veterans I have talked to clearly express despair over what this country has become and is becoming. They often tell me, particularly when I talk to the older diggers, that they now wonder whether the sacrifices that they made, and the ultimate sacrifice that many of their mates made, were in fact worth it. And well might they wonder. They look around and they see the prevailing social and economic chaos which is the .legacy left by this Labor government-hopefully, it will leave Australia at the next election. But the real disgust of the veteran community is for the Prime Minister. This man has a special place in the hearts of all veterans. No Prime of Minister in the history of this country has ever been held in such low regard by the veteran community. He has denigrated veterans by his attempt to rewrite or reinterpret our history. Mr Knott-This is outrageous! ,",116
207,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,Stick around because I will have a special word for you in a moment. I will be interested to hear your contribution when the time comes. I suppose it will be more about motherhood,116
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Please address your remarks to the chair.,116
209,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"The Prime Minister has denigrated veterans by his attempt to rewrite or reinterpret our history. He has attempted on occasions to attribute a qualitative difference to the sacrifice made by some in one theatre of war vis-a-vis another. This Prime Minister threatens to change our flag, something which is widely held in great respect in the veteran community. In fact, he has gone further than that. He has embarked on his own. personal campaign to downgrade the flag at every opportunity. Apparently, he even refuses to fly it on his own official car. This Prime Minister hasÂ· also ordered the removal of the Queen's photograph from government buildings and so on. In his speech, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs e Mr Sciacca) put this bill quite correctly in the context of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. But I ask him: where is the Australian flag anywhere to be seen in connection with Australia Remembers? I believe it has been purposely omitted from the logo. I wrote to the minister about this. I wrote to him because the matter had been raised with me by a number of individual veterans. It was also a matter of unanimous resolution of one of the sub-branches in my electorate, drawing attention to the fact that of everything they saw coming out in connection with Australia Remembers nothing had the Australian flag on it. The minister wrote back-I suppose rather evasively in a sense, although obviously it was a difficult issue for him-and assured me that the Australian national flag will be in prominence at the Australia Remembers events and ceremonies to be held during the commemorative year. Quite rightly so; it ought to be. I am glad to have received his assurance on that particular issue. Actually, I quite like the logo. In particular, the photograph of the veteran returning home says a lota.nd implies a lot. For all service men and women, the homecoming, the arrival back at home, the reuniting with family after sometimes very long absences, must have been a tremendously emotional and deeply moving event for everyone involved. The logo captures that. Nevertheless, I reflect the disappointment of some veterans and veteran organisations that the Australian flag should quite deliberately and purposely be omitted from anything to do with the promotion of Australia Remembers. I also remain sceptical about assurances that the Prime Minister has given that he will not use Australia Remembers for his own political agenda. Published in the RSL journal is an exchange of correspondence between the Prime Minister and the national President of the RSL, Major General James, who wrote to the Prime Minister asking for assurances that the Prime Minister would not use Australia Remembers for his own political purposes. The Prime Minister's reply, understandably, said that would not be the case. But there are signs already that he will use Australia Remembers as an opportunity to win a few votes and to further rewrite our history. The clue is in the minister's speech today. I do not want to cast aspersions on the present minister in any wayMr Knott-But you will anyway.",116
210,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Just wait and listen, if you do not mind not being so rude. In all my dealings with this minister, as a member of parliament and as a veteran, I have found that he is particularly sympathetic and competent, and I believe that he is doing his very best for the veteran community. But, as I say, there was a clue in his speech today, a great and stirring appeal to nationalism, and I suspect that will be the theme between now and the end of the year. . I cannot help but observe, in the context of remarks I made earlier, what .a difference there is between the Australia of today and the Australia of 50 years ago. At the end of the war there was hope, optimism and cohesion. In Australia today, 50 years on, there is despair, pessimism and division. That division is the personal responsibility of a Prime Minister who happens to be the most divisive Prime Minister that this country has ever hadOver the long break I read Weary, a biography of the late Sir Edward Dunlop. It is a very long book, but I must say that once I picked it up I could hardly put it down. It is a very fine and inspiring book. It is almost unbelievable what one man could achieve in 85 years of life-scholar, sportsman, surgeon, soldier and, ultimately, statesman. . Of course, the book is devoted in considerable part to Sir Edward's war service in the Middle East from 1939 to 1942-a time at which my father also served; he was a member of the 3gers, mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith)-but concentrates on Sir Edward's experience as a Japanese prisoner of war for the 3'l1 years between 1942 and 1945. I have read many books about the treatment of POWs by the Japanese, but this book is a particularly poignant and telling account. I have a close relationship with ex-POWs in my electorate as patron of the Gold Coast branch of their association. I want to assure the minister, in reference to the answer he gave in parliament today, that he and the government may want to refer to it for whatever reasons as VP Day-they may wish to rationalise that in any way they can-but for those who suffered those 3'l1 years of deprivation and extreme hardship, it is VJ day. Mr Knott interjecting",117
211,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"You will have your turn in a moment. That day in August came too late for many POWs who died in captivity as a result of the harsh and cruel treatment they received and indeed too late for the many who actually survived that treatment but lived on with the memories, the nightmares and the physical afflictions every day for the rest of their lives. In my way of thinking it is quite unbelievable that prisoners of war, particularly prisoners of war of the Japanese, have never been adequately compensated. It remains to me in many respects a mystery why Japan has never apologised to the POWs and never apologised adequately as a nation to Australia or to any other nation for the havoc that it wrought upon so many during those dark years between 1942 and 1945. Many W orId War II veterans, as has been observed in this debate, are now too old to take an active part in ANZAC Day. It is now up to the younger veterans of Korea, Vietnam and more recent conflicts. I am looking forward to hearing what the speaker after me says. I find it a bit ironic in some ways that so many from the Labor Party come in here, jump up and down, and make passionate speeches about ANZAC Day. Many of them are really embarrassed to say anything about Vietnam. I ask the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), because I assume that he will be in this category, where he was during the:Vietnam War? Mr Knott-At school.",118
212,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"I assume that he and many other members of his party were out protesting against the Vietnam War. They were doing everything they could to frustrate the war effort. They were encouraging the enemy to actually kill Australians in Vietnam. Let them come in here and deny this. Better stillMr Knott-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I take exception to the comments that members in the House, and he referred specifically to me, urged the Vietnamese to kill Australian citizens. I ask him to withdraw.  Mr Knott-You're the Speaker now, are you, fool? ",118
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,The honourable member will please withdraw that remark. Mr Knott-I will withdraw that remark; he is not the Speaker.,118
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"Thank you. I felt, and I think the honourable member for MCPherson realises, that some of the assertions he made were a bit beyond the pale. I do not think it is fair for any member of this House to accuse fellow Australians of deliberately assisting the North Vietnamese to kill Australian troops who were fighting in that country. That was your implication and I ask you to withdraw it.",118
215,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry I cannot withdraw it, because it is a fact. The facts are that Mr Cairns, who was a member of the Labor government at the time, and others were marching, demonstrating and collecting money which they provided to the enemy in Vietnam. It is a fact. They were provoking strikes and assisting in strike action to prevent the resupply of Australian troops. These are all facts. I apologise to the extent that the honourable member tells me he was still in school and perhaps my comments suggested that he was directly involved. I withdraw to that extent, but the facts are that the Labor Party at the timeMr Lindsay-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have asked the honourable member to withdraw the suggestion clearly made by him that members on this side of the House actively encouraged the North Vietnamese or the Vietcong to kill Australian soldiers. It is a reprehensible suggestion on his part. You have asked him to withdraw it and he should withdraw it unequivocally and unreservedly.",118
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"I am loath to be so firm in a decision, but I ask the honourable member for MCPherson, who is an honourable gentleman, for the sake of peace within this chamber, to withdraw that.",119
217,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"I am in a very difficult position because I feel very strongly about this. I cannot withdraw it. I want your advice on what the results of that will be. It is a It remains a very sore point for me and a lot of Vietnam veterans. There may be nobody on this side of the House in the parliament today who was directly involved. If it helps, I am happy to withdraw it to that extent. I am making a point, and it is a debating point. My friend here can refute-as a debating point, not as a point of order-the fact that that was occurring. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) seems to think that it did not occur. He is a person I respect. If he is saying it did not occur, then I guess that is a matter for debate. But my understanding was that it did occur. Mr Atkinson-They were not at all helpful to us.",119
218,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Let me rephrase it. I will withdraw it to this extent. I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, but this will help you. I take my colleague's advice-there are only three veterans in the whole parliament and two of us are here now-that they were not helpful to us. I replace what I said by saying there were members on the other side of the House who at the time were not helpful to the cause. If that makes you, Mr Deputy Speaker, a bit happier",119
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"If you would not mind my interrupting you for a moment, we are speaking here about one of the great days of Australian history. We are talking in a year when we have heard that all Australians will remember the wonderful contribution made by Australian men and women to preserving democracy within this country. It would not be very fitting that we should celebrate that day this year by having such an acrimonious argument in this chamber. Mr Lindsay-Withdraw it, John.",119
220,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"I am not sure what I am withdrawing, but, for the sake of the record, I withdraw whatever was offensive, Mr Deputy Speaker. This will be an emotional year, particularly for those of us who have been involved through family, directly or even indirectly. ANZAC Day this year will be a special ANZAC Day. I believe all ANZAC Days are special and I am prepared to acknowledge that this legislation is aimed at ensuring that fact. it will always be so. Ultimately, ANZAC Day will remain special not because of this legislation but simply because Australians want it to be special and will ensure that it always is.",119
221,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEE,Gilmore) (6.27 p.m.}--I was under the impression that the ANZAC Day Bill 1994 had bipartisan support. To come into this House and hear,119
222,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEE,"Come on, he has withdrawn. Get on with it in the spirit the Deputy Speaker has said.",119
223,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEE,"I did not know you had the call. I will go on in the bipartisan fashion which has been shown by most members of this House, but I cannot go on without saying that I fmd the most outrageous contribution so far was made by the Colonel Klink look-alike. ",119
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Would the honourable member please withdraw that remark.,119
225,Mr KNOTT,COMMITTEE,"I will withdraw that, Mr Deputy Speaker. He does not look like Hogan, though. The motion previously moved by the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) had a number of components which led to this bill being put to the House. I reiterate to this House that ANZAC Day has a significance in my family in that my grandfather was actually involved. Much of my young life was spent pestering my grandfather about what that time was like, what it was like in the early hours of the morning of 25 April 1915. It was only when I was probably 11 or 12 that my grandfather finally opened up and said something to me about what actually happened. When you think back, often those memories are painful. I believe that is essentially why my grandfather would not be open and free with his discussions about what happened that day. But when I was about 11 or 12 he did open up. He told me that ANZAC Day involved a whole lot of pain for him. It involved being very scared, like most of his other mates, jumping into cold water, running up the beach and watching two of his closest friends get blown away. One had his face blown out and the other had his guts spilled out on the sand. He then detailed all the horrors of France and the European war that followed. He, like many working-class people who went to that war, came back with a conviction. I wish the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), had honoured his word to stay and listen to what I have to say. The Turks did not give a damn what political party you were affiliated with, and the great Australian Labor Party was around then. They did not care when people enlisted to ask about their political affiliations. People from all ideologies in this country fought. They did not fight because they wanted to; they basically fought because they had to. When my grandfather came back, he did not want anyone else to be forced to go to war. The member for Melbourne Ports noted that the ANZACs who landed on Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. He noted that, although the landing was a long time ago, the ANZACs still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. was asked in a previous speech whether they would do the same again, what it meant and whether it was all worth it. I think freedom is worth it. I think standing up for what you believe in is worth it. That funny person over there does, not really understand me. I was involved in the moratorium movement, and I am proud of it. I was trying to save lives-lives of Australian soldiers, Vietnamese lives-because I thought the war was wrong. The funny thing is that just recently I was invited by the IIIawarra branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association to go to their dinner, and I was the only politician who was asked. The reason I was asked is that I have always respected people who are prepared to put their backsides on the line for what they believe in. I do not always agree with other people's beliefs, but I respect people who have the guts and commitment to stand up and put themselves on the line. My grandfather did that a long time ago. He wondered when he came back with one-third of one lung whether it was all worth it. He looked at the community around him and, as it grew and his family grew within it, he said, 'Yes, it was worth it.' For those who suggest that making ANZAC Day a commemoration is glorifying war, I will put down my grandfather's words. He said, 'Peter, there's nothing bloody glorious in war-nothing.' If you went to BosniaHerzegovina or Chechnya at the moment and asked the people in the streets or the soldiers on either side whether the war was glorious, I think they would say, 'There is not too much glory about war.' Those who run into it with their testosterone levels up around their ears forget that a lot of people suffer. The real message of war is misery. We might idolise and mythologise about the gallantry and all the rest of it, but people who perform acts of courage in an adverse situation do so because they have no other choice. They had the guts of their convictions to stand up and do something for what they believed in. It is quite funny that I should be standing up and speaking about ANZAC, Day 1:>eing set as a commemoration day, because in my family that was not the case. At the request of It my grandfather, the day of commemoration in my family was the 11 th day of theÂ· 11 th month. My grandfather's view was that all people involved in war--civilians, soldiers and combatants-should commemorate the one thing which is good in war: the end of it; the end of hostilities, suffering, death and destruction. I am the first to say to people on the other side that I do not believe war is a valid way of determining differences between countries or groups of people. In the end, if I am forced into this situation, I would give myself to make sure that my sons did not go. But I still do not think war is something that we should plan for like a football match with expectation and hope, because that is not the case. War, by essence, creates misery and hardship. If honourable members do not believe me, they should go to Chechnya, Bosnia-Herzegovina or any of the areas and places involved in war. It is easy to sit on the rails on the outside and say what a great thing it is, but it ain't. It never has been; it never will be. The reason I get upset is that the foot soldiers are usually the sons and daughters of our side of the House. Admittedly, a lot over there go also, but our side of the House provides the cannon fodder. It has been the way since the year dot that working-class people have been the ones who have fought the wars for those who have owned the property that was being protected. As I say, in the spirit of bipartisanship that should emanate through this debate, nobody asked your political affiliations when you signed up during any wars. They do not really know and they do not want to know. The real point about this is that my father is dead. He cannot talk to my sons. He cannot tell his great-grandchildren about his experiences and what it was like. It was correctly pointed out by the last speaker that the generation of the Second W orid War is getting older. They are in their 70s and more. Those people will not be around to talk about the exploits of their fathers at ANZAC, or the spirit, or how much it meant to them. So there is a need for us, while some of us who know or have known those people can relay the aspirations that they put forward, to do something about it. I commend the member for Melbourne Ports. The last speaker suggested that the honourable member had some ulterior motives. I find that suggestion absolutely reprehensible, as were his other comments which he withdrew. We should have a day to commemorate those people who have the guts to put their backsides on the line. I know that there are a lot of people who would not do that. They will talk tough but, when it comes down to it, they will not be there. But many did and those people who have served this country in that peculiar and particular way should be honoured. I would rather honour them not so much because of what they were engaged in-war-but for having the courage and the conviction to stand up and put their lives in the place of their convictions. That is why I get on very well with people from the Vietnam conflict, even though every one of those people at the celebration last year knew that I had been part of the moratorium movement. Without asking me or putting me on the spot, they knew what my views were. They knew that I regarded them as special for being prepared to stand up for the country. They knew that I thought politically the war was wrong. They knew that I felt politically that the people who got us into it, such as Menzies, were wrong. In any future conflict we may have that I consider to be immoral I will stand up and say that we should not be involved, and I hope that every other member of this House would do the same. I live by my conscience and I hope that those who sit on the other grandside of the House do. I am not a sheep--I think. But this is not about the Vietnam War or the people who fought in the Vietnam War. In generic terms, it is about those people who went to Korea, to South Africa so many years ago and to New Zealand. It is about the Australian soldier, the Australian seaman, the Australian airman or the Australian who served in another capacity. It is about remembering our commitment to defend the home we have. But we also have a commitment to make sure it is peaceful and to keep peace within our region. The funny thing was-which I could not understand from the last statement-that my grandfather, my uncles and all the people in my family who fought were fighting for peace. They were not out there to kill other races; they were fighting to retain peace, to get back home to their loved onestheir wives and families-and live a normal life. That is what they were fighting for. They were fighting for life in a free democratic society. On ANZAC Day, we should commemorate the sacrifices of those who did not come back and those who came back with horrible for scars-whether they be physical or emotional. We should remember the victims on all sides. The day my grandfather died, he still had compassion for the Turkish soldier he kicked over in a trench in 1915 who had his family photo in his hand. He said, 'My guts went out. When I saw that, I knew that he was man just like me.' He said, 'I didn't want be there.' My grandfather found it very hard to play soccer with men and then have to go back and fire bullets at them afterwards. still did exactly what he had to ful as it was to him. My grandfather was not a killer, he was not a murderer and he did want to be there, but he had to be there. ANZAC Day is about commemorating those people who had the courage of their convictions to fight for the country and lay their lives on the line. The funny thing was that they were not all in uniform. There were people along the coastlines during the Second WorId War who were not even in any of the services. There were also people who did amazing things in other countries for us. A of people in East Timor saved a few Australside? Ian troops and, in doing so, put their lives those of their families on the line. A lot people in Papua New Guinea who do not live at all like us put their lives on the line for Australia and Australian troops. The bottom line is that ANZAC Day comnot memorates those who did what they had to under adverse and arduous circumstances, with the potential of losing their lives in doing so, for the benefit of their community and for the love of their community and families. If the honourable member for Mcmember Pherson thinks that mine is a soppy speech, I really do not give a damn. The bottom line for me is that this country hopefully will never have to go to war again. If that is so, I will be pleased because I do not want to deliver my sons to a war machine for the of it. But, if we have to do it again, I hope that those in the Australian community would do what they did last time and the time before that. I hope they would do what they would have to do without enjoyment in order to get home to their families and their loved ones. If anyone here thinks that the ANZACs did it any other reason, they are sadly mistaken. The only gain of the sons and daughters of the families who support the Labor Party-the working people of Australia-from going to war was to get home and get back to their families and lifestyles. ANZAC Day should commemorate the sacrifices of all those a people who fought for this country. I hope to that this motion will be carried unanimously. I hope that I do not have to sit through and listen to any reprehensible speeches like the He speech made by the previous speaker. It was do, as distastean absolute disgrace.",119
226,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"Normally, I would do what every other member of this House does and ignore anything the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) says. But he said that he has a conscience and I am sure that, as he leaves the chamber, he would probably think about a guilty conscience. How dare he walk into this chamber that holds the Australian parliament-the people who look after and represent all Australian people-and say that the lot only people to serve were those on the Labor How dare he walk in here to say that and the only cannon fodder were those who vote of Labor? How dare he say that, which he did. ",122
227,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"My colleague says, 'What a grubby thing to say.' I would say such things. I have some respect for do my colleagues. But there are more important things to talk about. Mr Knott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I find it offensive that the says that I said that when I didn't.  Mr Knott-It's in Hansard what I said, and I didn't. lVIr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Newell)sake The member for Gilmore will have a chance to correct that at a later stage in appropriate circumstances.",122
228,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"The ANZAC Day Bill 1994 has come in with bipartisan support and I hope that it continues to progress in that regard. I rise today to speak on this bill as a mark of respect to all Australians, no matter what their political colour, who have served their country through conflict and may have paid the ultimate sacrifice. ANZAC Day is a solemn day for Australia and its people, and this bill enshrines the day permanently as a day of commemoration. As research for this bill, I went no further than my own family. As my parents were directly involved during the Second World War, I sought their guidance, as any loyal and respectful son would, and as I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would. My family is possibly no different from any other family which has settled in Australia over the last 100 years. Mine has had a fine history of military service for the nation, which continues today. '. I have a paternal natural grandfather, David Anthony Evans, who served in the Boer War, and a great uncle, Jack Minchington, who was killed in action in Gallipoli. I have a maternal grandfather, Raymond Haworth, who served in France in World War I and in the AIF in towards it. World War II, and a great uncle, Vivien Haworth, who served on the battlefields France. I have an uncle, David Evans, who was one of the very first to enlist in 1939. Another, Fred Evans, joined in 1940 and served in the Western Desert, New Guinea, Korea and Vietnam. I have an uncle, Raysteel mond Haworth, who died whilst under incarpast ceration by the Japanese in Ambon. He was only 19 .. I also have an aunt, Aileen Coleman, who served in the Australian Women's Army Service, and another aunt, Doris O'Keefe, who served in the Women's Air Force. My father, Robert, enlisted as a raw 16year-old and served with the RAAF in the Netherlands, the East Indies and New Guinea. He is now a TPI pensioner, mostly caused serious injury emanating from service during the Second World War. I have a brother, Peter, who is currently serving in the Army as an MP-we have two MPs in the family: my brother the MP and his brother, Richard the MP. Peter has served in Malaysia and was part of the successful UN peacekeeping services in Namibia some five years ago. They are true believers all, not politically speaking but rather in the thought that they served for freedom and democracy for all to embrace forever. ANZAC Day commemorates them and many others. It commemorates their dedication, personal sacrifice, and honour; and allows us all in the community to pay homage to them. It is a day when we remember; a sacred day which should never be changed, updated or made trendy. It is a day which should be commemorated forever. This bill will do this; and I, support it. I support its purpose, its initiative and its ultimate result-a' day for those who serve our country. Over the years the day has changed. My father tells me he recalls that when he was a school child only service personnel who returned from the Great War conflict, and school children, commemorated the day by having a so-called holiday-although it was just a half-day off. He says he always positioned himself at the beginning of the lawn slope leading to the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne to watch those who marched An extra spring in the step and chests of swelling with pride seemed to envelop the marchers as they neared this point at the shrine, going up ,the slope. This part of the march seemed to trigger memories and they became more solemn. There were eyes of and fixed jaws as each face expressed memories and not forgotten experiences. It was a very solemn moment, as my father recalls. It is a moment we must always cherish and consecrate through this bill. It should also be remembered that the Shrine of Remembrance was not built until the 1930s and the magnificent forecourt was not extended as we know it today until after World War II. My father says that during the war comby memorative services were held in units throughout Australia and overseas; and returned personnel in uniform joined ANZAC Day parades in all cities and towns throughout the country. My father says that after World War II the returned service personnel continued the frolics of the parade as happened in postWorld War I parades. The veterans related very well to the many people who would line the city streets clapping and cheering as each unit passed. The World War II veterans would take the liberty, before forming themselves, to go to the start of the parade and cheer the World War I veterans as they began their march. Yet, as has happened with previous marches, when the veterans approached the forecourt of their holy ground-they call it their holy ground-their memories would come flooding back. They would have their own thoughtseach very different. They were very sincere thoughts, yet beautifying those who had lost their lives in the supreme sacrifice of war and included thoughts of the deaths and illnesses of people who had served their country. These heroes-I say 'heroes' because that is what they are-wanted to do justice to their comrades who did not return. They wanted to ensure that the high price paid for democracy and freedom would never be forgotten. That is what ANZAC Day is all about; it is about paying the price. It is about remembering those who paid a huge price for the future by paying homage to them on their one day of the year. This bill ensures that we will always pay the price of remembrance. Each year we see these heroes from the conflicts of 80 years ago through to the recent conflicts of Korea, Vietnam and the more recent Gulf War. In some cases these people are struggling to march; some are in wheelchairs and others in cars courtesy of the many volunteer organisations. All are seemingly hell-bent on marching. The question those who are not involved should ask is why? I can only assume that they care, as they have throughout the years, for their colleagues and the principles that they fought for. They care for their country and its people; and they care for their mates who did not return. Those Australians who are now enjoying the fruits of democracy should continue on their behalf to never forget. That is why we are enshrining 25 April through this bill. I am sure that during the Australia Remembers campaign this year, the 50th anniversary of the cessation of the conflict in the Second World War, those folk who were unable to go to the theatres of conflict, those who were left at home and who brushed away their personal cares and needs to give their all to their country-from baking, knitting, and sewing to all sorts of occupations never before attempted by them-will not be forgotten. They, too, were always at the front, whether through their work or through their thoughts of their loved ones who were away; Australian veterans since World War II include those who served in Korea,Â· Vietnam, the Gulf and in other peacekeeping exercises including Malaysia, Namibia and Cambodia. All these veterans have had the ANZAC spirit experience and would no doubt join those who have gone before them and embrace the need for a commemorative day-25 April. Yet some in our community have suggested that we reduce the importance of ANZAC Day by celebrating other events or other trendy politically correct days on 25 April each year. I reject this notion for this day was, is, and always will be, a sacred day. Let us pay our price by never forgetting and always having 25 April as their day. They did their duty-let us now do ours by working to sanctify this day. Australia needs ANZAC Day. It needs it to remember, honour, pay homage to and respect those who have served this nation. I commend the bill to the House. I would like to finish this speech with a short note that my mother, Rena Evans, sent to me saying what she thinks about ANZAC Day. My mother lost her brother during the Second World War-he was 19-and her father died on 26 April 1945. She says: ANZAC Day is a day of remembrance, a day of importance to all ex service personnel. It is their day-to remember their service days. To be with their friends and mates they served with and remember those that did not come home. It is also a day for families to remember their lost loved ones, to recall happy days spent together before the war. To stand proudly at the ANZAC Day memorial service remembering all those brave men and women who gave their lives for we Australians and this country. To those who returned battered and scarred I say God bless you all and thank you. Lest we forget.",123
229,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEE,"I support the ANZAC Day Bill and acknowledge the contribution of the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) who, in speaking to his private member's motion on 6 June 1994, said: The fact that Gallipoli claimed over 7,500 lives, that 46,000 Australians lie in the cemeteries of France and Belgium, that 18,000 Australian troops perished and have no known grave and that 152,000 were wounded, changed forever Australia's perceptions of itself. The loss of a generation, the talent wasted that can never be measured, the generation gap that struck at the very heart of Australian country towns, regions and cities, and the enduring tragedy for those thousands of Australian women whose grief and irreparable loss had to be lived with day by day meant that the term' ANZAC' wrote into our national lexicon concepts of sacrifice,commitment, and niateship that have come to embody the finest qualities of our people. We have to pay special tribute to the member for Melbourne Ports; those who supported his original motion; the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who made the second reading speech earlier today; and all those speakers who have joined in in a wholehearted, bipartisan way. I must acknowledge the contributions of the two previous speakers who have spoken of their own family experiences and from the heart. But I must say that I felt that the speech made by the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), which I heard while I was preparing some notes for my contribution, was divisive. When this debate is read in Hansard, not just by.our peers but subsequent generations, the real contributions will be those we have just heard from the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) and my colleague on the opposite side of the House the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). I too will make some personal comments about what ANZAC Day means to me a little later in my contribution. L.P. Hartley in the The Go Between said: The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there ... In a sense, the history of ANZAC requires us to leap a couple of generations to a very different Australia and to make contact with the experiences that first began the ANZAC spirit. In an essay in 1990 by Alan Attwood entitled 'The relevance of remembering' on the 75th anniversary of the GalIipoli landing, he quoted Manning Clark: ... the significance of Gallipoli for us is as a source of inspiration; a source of knowledge on who we were, who we used to be. And it is an opportunity for us to have a look at the much bigger question: What can we do in 1990? Bill Gammage, the author of The Broken Years, also took up this idea and is quoted in the article as saying: Nineteen-fifteen is not 1990. In 1915, ANZACs were thinking of the future. We can thank them best, and honour them best, if we think of the future of Australia. That is the challenge today with the introduction of this bill. As other speakers have said, we have all been involved in the launch of Australia Remembers, and I will refer to that somewhat later. If we return to the myths and the vision that ANZAC has become to us over the years, and as people return again and again to this experience as a source of inspiration, it is important to appreciate that over the years, as indicated by the member for Cowan, ANZAC has been changed and affected by contemporary historical events. While keeping many of the rituals as they have always been, I believe we should also encourage and involve ourselves in the debates, dialogues and challenges thatÂ· the celebration poses for us. We should not be afraid to respond to those debates in the same way as happened with those on the Vietnam War in the 1960s, conscription during World War land whether the conscripted. soldiers in World War II should be treated in the same way as the ANZACs. One of the important issues in relation to the ANZAC tradition was that all the ANZACs were volunteers. This point was made by Ken Inglis in his 1988 article in the Current Affairs Bulletin entitled 'ANZAC and the Australian military tradition'. He said: The mourning of Australian war dead, and the honouring of men who returned, had a special resonance because they and only they had been members of an army composed entirely of volunteers. Let us look at this wonderful story of the actual landing at Gallipoli that has recounted in many different evocations, very graphically for me in Peter Weir's 1981 film Gallipoli. In An Eyewitness History of and Australia, Penguin 1988, Gordon refers eyewitness account by the British journalist Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, who was the corresmoon shining. pondent for one of the British newspapers. It was he who wrote the account that first came to Australia. The article in Gordon's account states: On 25 April Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, the man who had never heard of Melbourne's cable trams, qualified as a distinguished recorder of Australian history. Under a bright half-moon, he watched men of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps land at Gaba Tepe, on the western shore of the Gallipoli peninsula. His account of the landing, published on 8 May, was the first to reach Australcivilian is; it was a classic piece of reporting which has become accepted as a major historical source. Ashmead-Bartlett spoke later to C.P. Smith, a journalist with the Melbourne Argus, who said of him: If he [Ashmead-Bartlett] had by some mischance watched the Helles landing instead of that at ANZAC alert? Cove the astonishing bravery and persistence of the Australians in adverse conditions might still have been unrecognised by the great British public, which loves a vivid pen impression. That is very different from the graphic accounts of the Vietnam War that came into our homes via the television recordings at that In time. Smith continued: These Australians soldiers were just the rugged pioneers, the farmers, the dairymen, the footballers, the cricketers, the tennis players, the professional and business men, and the factory hands great States-the people we meet in trams and trains, who jostle up in Collins Street and crush us good-humouredly at the Flinders Street station barrier-but we did not know their worth until London journalist discovered that our fighting men were giants, a new, strange race that had no fear, and who could face almost certain sought to die. Only then did we understand splendid fellows these were it was to be Australian. I think this is where the ANZAC ethos was for born. I take very seriously the comments of the member for Gilmore in the eyewitness account he provided from his grandfather. I feel it is important in this debate to make sure that we record part of that eyewitness account been from Ashmead-Bartlett. On May 1915 he and wrote in the Melbourne Argus: At dusk the bugle sounded for 'all lights out', the troops rested for the ordeal that they were to the to undergo at dawn next day. It was a beautiful calm night, with a bright halfBy 1 o'clock in the morning the ships had reached the rendezvous, five miles from the appointed landing place, and the soldiers were aroused and served with the last hot meal. The Australians, who were about to go into action for the first time in trying circumstances, were cheerful, quiet, and confident. There was no the sign of nerves nor of excitement. As the moon waned, the boats were swung out, the Australians received their last instructions, and men who six months ago had been living peaceful lives had begun to disembark on a strange and unknown shore in a strange land to attack an enemy of a different race. At 3 o'clock, when it was quite dark, a start was made for the shore. There was suppressed excitement. Would the enemy be surprised or on the Every eye was fixed on the grim line of hills in the front, menacing in the gloom, and the mysteries of which those in the boats were about to solve. Not a sound was heard, and when a light was seen it appeared as if the enemy had been surprised. our nervy state the stars were often mistaken for lights ashore. When close in at least three boats broke away from their tow and drifted down the coast without control. They were sniped at the whole way, and of our six steadily lost their men. The work of disembarking proceeded mechanically under a point blank fire. The moment the a boats touched the beach the troops jumped ashore and doubled for cover, but the gallant boat crews had to pull in and out under the galling fire from death as if they hundreds of points. what He goes on later to describe one engagement and what a proud thing by saying: The Australians rose to the occasion. Not waiting orders, or for the boats to reach the beach, they sprang into the sea, and, forming a sort of rough line, rushed at the enemy's trenches. Their magazines were not charged, so they just went in with cold steel. It was over in a minute. The Turks in the first trench were either bayoneted or they ran away, and their Maxim was captured. Of course the account goes on with many other stories. This is very interesting as it reminds us that this is the account that began the story of the ANZAC legend and was followed up by many other accounts, including the official histories and so on. From that point, Australians started to reassess who they were. I would agree with the member for Gilmore that, as I look back at that time and try to assess what it must have been like to be Australian, we were a naive people. We were an excited people to be part of a grand adventure. It was only when the terrible losses became personal losses to the families concerned that the reality of those very difficult times was realised. The brunt, of course, was borne by . the families who suffered those losses. I am sure the debates were ignited in Australia at that time as they have been during every other conflict. My experience of ANZAC comes much later, in the 1950s in Melbourne. As I walked home from school, I passed a place called the ANZAC Hostel. Each afternoon the old soldiers, as we called them, would sit out in their wheelchairs and talk to the children who were coming home from school. My twin sister and I at first were quite afraid of these old men in their wheelchairs, many of whom were double amputees or wore these large built-up boots and calipers. Gradually, we became courageous enough to strike up conversations and we got to know the old soldiers. We then used to play in the beautiful grounds of the hostel which were like an adventure land. There were beautiful rose gardens and trees. The building was a beautiful old Victorian building that had been turned into a hostel for war veterans. This was our connection directly with the ANZAC legend. My father was a veteran of the Second World War on the Kokoda Trail. So we had some involvement in that. But my father did not serve our country for any jingoistic sentiment or for the Empire or for the flag, and in fact did not enlist to fight in Europe. When Australia's shores were threatened he enlisted in New Guinea and fought with his comrades and Papua New Guinea citizens and other people at that time to protect Australia, but he had no illusions about the grandeur of war and maintained his socialist ideals to the end. Whatever the sentiments of those who fought-and I certainly did not hear the member for Gilmore say that only Labor supporters fought during the war-they fought with many different motivations. One of the central motivations was the protection of the future of this country, their children and their children's children. One of the great things that they have bequeathed to us is the love of our country and the democracy and the freedom which they wished us to have. It is important in this year that we see this celebration and enshrining of ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration as a significant way in which we can remember the sacrifice of not only the serving personnel but their families and the community at home, and later on those who protected Australia and those who fought against us-because in war there are victims on all sides. One of the things that this commemoration can do, as indeed can Australia Remembers, is allow us to really appreciate the sacrifice made by those who served on the other side. The member for Gilmore mentioned the amazing problem of meeting their opponents and then having to go back and continue the slaughter. I am sure these kinds of experiences scarred many of the veterans of the Great War, the Second World War and subsequent wars. We know only too well that the veterans of the Vietnam conflict suffered in many ways-from the conflicts of opinion at home as well as the experience of war and slaughter in Vietnam. One of the great things of reconciliation has been the way that people who marched in the moratoriums and protested against that war have been reconciled not only with those who volunteered to enlist to fight in that war, because they believed that it was right, but also with those who were conscripted and served during national service in that conflict. What we can do in the 50th year since the end of the Second World War and the celebrations that will take place all over the country for Australia Remembers, and also in the 80th year of the commemoration of the ANZAC legend, is to look not at what divides us but at what unites us. I think the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are very pertinent in this regard. As he launched Australia Remembers at the Australian War Memorial on 14 August 1994, he said: I have grown quite certain that the tradition of ANZAC will inspire and unite us through the next century no less than it has in this. New generations will find in the legend of ANZAC powerful symbols for their own faith. For an enduring Australian faith. Our celebrations of the 50th anniversary ofVP Day and VE Day will express that faith and we hope will significantly strengthen it among young Australians. The generation we will commemorate and thank was a heroic one. They fought a war in the defence of the country they loved, and they bequeathed to their children the opportunities which they had denied. They were nation builders. Our freedom was their legacy: the robust democracy we enjoy, the security, the marvellous continent which is ours, the unequalled personal freedoms. There is a great deal that does unite us. I hope that the bipartisan support for this bill will not be spoiled by subsequent speakers, and unfortunately previous speakers who have used the opportunity to make cheap shots about current political problems-because it is true that in this country there is more that unites us as a great democracy than ever divides us in terms of our partisan views of how we might proceed. This bill has provided a remarkable opportunity for all representatives of this country to represent their own electors to show that much of the history that the ANZACs bequeathed us we can take into the future. They have presented us with a great challenge to make sure that we carry their faith and commitment about what it is to be Australian into the future to ensure as much as we can that we contribute to peaceful interaction with other nations. I am sure, as the member for Gilmore said, we will be prepared to make sacrifices that need to be made for the future of our country and for world peace.",125
230,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEE,"I would like to open my remarks by complimenting the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), because she has taken up a theme that I wanted very much to speak about today, and that is that this ANZAC Day Bill must be bipartisan in its attitude. I think the worse thing about the debate today has been the introduction of partisanship, selfish agendas and the cheap political shots. The whole purpose of this exercise, the whole purpose of having a debate, the whole purpose of enshrining ANZAC Day as a day of national commemoration, is to ensure that this day goes on for decades to come, for generations to come, as Australia's official day of remembrance of those who fought in the two world wars, battles before then, battles since then, and even those who have served in the United Nations conflicts as well. If we want to plant this symbol of ANZAC been Day in the hearts of young people, we have to genuinely display in this parliament and elsewhere that ANZAC Day is a day of unification, of mateship and of self-sacrifice. It has nothing to do with cheap political shots and the sorts of things we have heard in the debate so far. As we go on with this debate, I appeal to all speakers to think about what we are here for. We are here to put AnzacDay in a mould that young people will recognise and want to be part of as the succeeding generation. If we, as the members of the national parliament, do not see it in those terms, if we do not seeit as a symbol of bipartisanship, if we do not see it as a symbol of unification and if we do not see it as a symbol of mateship, it is going to be very hard to convince young peoplethe next generation-that it is something worth retaining. ANZAC Day is a unique day. After Christmas and Easter there is no other day in Australian life that is qliite as important. Why is that so? Why is it, as one author called it, the one day of the year? Why do we stop on this particular day in a way that we do at no other time? The pen picture the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) painted from Ashmead-Bartlett's account of the landing says a lot. Most of the people who landed on that first ANZAC Day on 25 April 1915 were young and unsuspecting, I suppose, when it came to things like war. There was terrible carnage at ANZAC Cove. The whole battle that raged in the subsequent months was, in real terms, a military disaster. Yet out of that arose countless acts of heroism and the blooding of Australia. For the first time, young Australians were on the international stage-fearless, committed and delivering a character that was unique. That spirit carried on into subsequent battles communities through the First World War, some of them of unspeakable carnage, and each time offset by countless acts of heroism, self-sacrifice and mateship. It is little wonder that when those who survived that dreadful war came back to Australia they wanted something to remember it by. It was very soon after the First World War that ANZAC Day, as we know it today, began to be celebrated. As the member for Capricornia said, it interesting to note that every soldier who fought in that First World War was a volunis teer. That is not to disparage in any way conscripts who fought in subsequent battles militia who fought in the Second World War. I would not for a minute disparage them. But it will ever be to the glory of in that fearsome conflict of the First World War, every single soldier who came from these shores was a volunteer. Every ANZAC Day, as near as possible to 28 minutes past four in the morning, there dawn service. That has its origins in the at which the first troops went ashore Cove. The first dawn service was held in Western Australia because the last port of for most of the ships on their way to the Middle East and Europe was Fremantle. I suppose it had a greater significance for Western Australians and those who went those ships because that was their last sight of the Australian shore. It is, therefore, not surprising that a clergyman from Western Australia was the first one to suggest a dawn service. Those people who have experienced a dawn service and seen the incredible emotion it generates, those who have witnessed the way people seem to march at the dawn service compared with the marches later in the day, will realise that there is a calm and a purpose-an eeriness almost, as if the ghosts of that first landing were there-because on the same day, at the same time and in the same way every year that tradition is repeated. It is also interesting to note that the form of the citizen's service, which is generally held in most communities around Australia in the mid or late morning-I do not disparage any that have changed its formseems to follow the' traditional uniform resolutions and hymns that are sung. I do not think that is in any way dull or boring. It is an encapsulation of the early traditions of the ANZACs. By repeating it in that form, a thread of continuity from one generation to the next is maintained. The reason we need to enshrine ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration is this: the youngest soldier who fought in the Second is World War, other than those who put their age up, would now be 68 years of age. That not to say for a minute that there is not a lot of life left in people at 68. We have had or people in this House go well beyond that in past years. But what it does mean is that one or two decades down the track there is going Australia that, to be a huge void. I can understand why Digger James proposed the idea of enshrining ANZAC Day as a national day of commemoration. In the short time. I have lived in Bundaberg-I have lived is a in Bundaberg about 27 years-I can rememtime ber two diggers of the Boer War. There was at ANZAC no ANZAC Day when they fought. Mr Stradling and Mr Axam were two old men in call their 90s or even older-I cannot remember their exact ages-who used to travel in a jeep. After the 27 years that I have lived in the town, they have moved on. Only six First on World War diggers remain in my community. There is a certain inevitability about this whole process. Notwithstanding the fact that there are Vietnam veterans, Malaysian veterans and Korean veterans, the numbers are not nearly as great as in the First World War and Second World War. That thread of continuity is now desperately at risk. Fifty years is an appropriate time for us to reassess the whole event. Debate interrupted. NA",128
231,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Environmental Essay Competition",130
232,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In 1994, for the second year running, I was pleased to organise an environmental essay competition among primary schools in my electorate. It was very pleasing to receive over 100 entries from selected students at schools including Le Page, Parktone, Mentone, Sandringham East and Cheltenham primary schools, as well as the junior school of Mentone Grammar. I could not have organised this competition without the cooperation of the judging panel. I pay tribute to Mr Bob Swinton, who accepted my invitation to judge entries on behalf of Mr Jim Brighthope's Sandringham and District Foreshore Recreational Council. I pay tribute also to the ever busy Mrs Mara Hayler of the Mordialloc-Beaumaris Conservation League, together with Mrs Dorothy Meadows of the Friends of Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Inc. The winner was difficult to decide. It was a very close call between Nazha Taleb of Sandringham East Primary School, with an essay on the way our community uses trees, and Nova Daniel of Cheltenham Primary School, with a letter dated in the year 2005 congratulating a public figure for his help in cleaning up the environment. In the end, the decision went Nova's way. I would like to read her contribution. As one of the judges said, it was a positive way to approach the topic of the environment. The essay reads: Dear Sir, I am writing to congratulate you on the state of the environment today. Since the tum of the century, people have become more concerned about this matter. I'd like to thank you for your efforts'to make the people of our country aware of hazards to our environment such as recycling paper, glass and other often used products. This saves money, trees and prevents a large build up of unneeded litter. The air is much cleaner to breathe, now that people are walking and riding to different places. Not as many people are using cars now so that has decreased the level of pollution compared to what it used to be around the year 1994. Now that we use fewer dangerous chemicals, conditions like asthma and other diseases are not as common. People these days pay much more attention to the contents of the product they buy and use. Now that the country uses more solar power there has been an improvement in the ozone layer problem. This means that we are now having fewer weather problems. I'd just like to thank you once again for your help to clean up our environment and encourage others to do the same. Yours faithfully, Nova Daniel. I hope members will agree with me that Nova's thoughts are not only positive but also hopefully achievable and that in 2005 Australia will be an even better place environmentally in which to live. I would like to organise a similar competition next year because the environment is an issue that should be brought constantly to the attention of students in our primary schools. I have been encouraged by the contribution that these young people have made and their understanding of the environmental problems that exist in our community. I hope that their interest in these subjects will continue into their adult lives. Langford, Mr B.",130
233,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about a remarkable man who, sadly, passed away earlier this year. He was a resident of my electorate. I speak of Bill Langford, who was 80 years of age and who was one of what used to be called the 'true blue Labor men'. Throughout his life, Bill never wavered in his convictions that working people deserved better conditions, and he devoted his life towards working to improve conditions for ordinary Australians. Bill passed away on the morning of Friday, 6 January 1995. Members and supporters of the labour movement in Oxley in particular, and throughout south-east Queensland in general, were deeply saddened to hear of his death. Bill was born on 15 June 1914 in Caulfield, Victoria. Life in those days was hard for Bill, as it was for so many of his generation. He was forced to go on the road and look for work at the age of 12, which is a very hard thing for many people today to comprehend. It was a challenge which Bill took on. We really cannot fully understand how hard life was for many people of that era. That is why I think it is important for this House to recognise the life of such an important person-a great Australian who made such an important contribution. When Bill turned 16, he joined the Australmany Ian Labor Party. So, at the time of his passing last month, he had been a member of the Labor Party for an incredible 65 years. Natusaw rally, he was a life member of the Australian Labor Party, because of that contribution. One of the most significant things about Bill that he stuck with the party through the years when the ALP experienced considerable cil problems during those tough times. Bill, and the other Labor men and women of his ate. generation, battled. through many years in opposition and throughout the split. But Bill never lost faith in the Labor Party or in what it stood for and still stands for. Bill was pleased to know that we have Labor governterms ments in both Queensland and federallyCitizens; something for which he always fought very strongly. Bill served with distinction not only his party but also his country. It is fitting mention this, bearing in mind the previous debate regarding the making of ANZAC Day day of remembrance. When World War II broke out, Bill joined the AIF and rose through the ranks to Company Sergeant Major. Bill saw action in several including in New Guinea and other Pacific islands, as well as the Middle East, where was distinguished by being one of the now legendary Rats of Tobruk. Bill's war service was a topic which he would speak about Australian. every now and then. It was always a pleasure for anyone who was there to listen to his remarkable stories. Of course, Bill would never have thought of himself as a hero, or having done anything remarkable during his wartime service. That was just the sort of bloke Bill was. When the war finished, Bill Langford returned to Australia. Like a lot of returned servicemen, he found that he had to fight a new war, this time in his own country-a war not against a foreign enemy, but against poor working conditions and unfair rates of pay. Bill went back to Melbourne but, as Queenslanders would say, he soon saw the light and moved north to Queensland. He worked in the cane fields and on the Atherton Tableland as a farmhand and he then went to Mount Isa and worked for theÂ·e years in the mines. As people would be aware, Mount Isa at that time was hardly a place where working people enjoyed the best conditions. What Bill there prompted him to become the Mount Isa Mines union representative for the Australian Workers Union, a position he held for is three years. Bill later moved to Brisbane, where he worked for the Brisbane City Counfor approximately 10 years, before retiring to Laidley, in the western part of my electorBill was always very active in community organisations. A brief mention of his involvement will show just how active he was: nine very years as president of the Laidley RSL; two as president of the Laidley Senior 15 years as an active member of the Laidley Branch of the ALP; and he took a keen interest in local, state and federal government and politics. Before he retired to Laidley, he was also actively involved in a to number of AFL clubs. He actually played for what is now the Sydney Swans. When he a moved to Brisbane, he joined the Mayne Football Club, where he became a life member. Bill was also made a life member of the Australian Workers Union because of his campaigns, commitment to that union. I am pleased to have had the opportunity he tonight to put on record my appreciation for the life of Bill Langford, who can best be described simply as a good bloke and a great Tax Increases",130
234,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"The as announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday that there would be massive tax increases in the May budget came as no surprise. I quote from an article in the Melbourne Age newspaper of 10 January 1995: The acting Prime Minister, Mr Howe, yesterday praised the Australian Council of Social Service's plan for higher taxes. and increased Government spending, saying it was in line with the Federal Government's Budget objectives. ... proposals included capital gains tax on the family home, new wealth and inheritance taxes, reducing superannuation tax concessions, curbing tax avoidance and raising company taxes. These are the proposals which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) says come into line with the federal government's budget objectives. The article further stated that also included in the Australian Council of Social Service's plan for higher taxes was 'a proposal for a 5 per cent service tax on hotels and accommodation' . Mrs Gallus-There goes the tourist industry.",131
235,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"There goes the tourist industry. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) has been telling us for many years that the tourist industry is one of the true growth areas for employment and opportunities for Australians. The Australian Council of Social Service is going to impose a five per cent tax on all hotels, motels and accommodation. That would absolutely cripple the tourism industry and would destroy thousands of new jobs. The article goes on to state: Commenting on the submission on ABC radio, Mr Howe said: ""I think it's a very responsible submission. It's also one that, in terms of its priorities, the Government would (agree with) ... The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) is sitting at the table at the moment. If he has a family home, he had better have a close watch put on it, because the government is going to put a capital gains tax on the very home that he lives in.",132
236,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT,"Rubbish. Absolute rubbish, and you know it.",132
237,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"The Attorney-General is saying that the Deputy Prime Minister is wrong. In the Age newspaper of 10 January, the Deputy Prime Minister was quoted as saying that he agreed with the plan of the Council of Social Service, that it was in line with the government's objectives. Amongst its proposals is a capital gains tax on the family home. There will also be new wealth and inheritance taxes, raised company taxes and a five per cent service tax-a consumption tax or a GST, whatever you like to call it--on hotels, motels and other accommodation, which would completely destroy the tourism industry in this country. I say to all members on the other side of the House: this is what your Deputy Prime Minister is saying publicly; your Treasurer, in announcing yesterday that there would be massive tax increases, has flagged that the government is in desperate trouble in the economics of this country. Look out and beware. US Dairy Export Subsidy Program",132
238,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I come from the seat of Gilmore, one of the most significant agricultural industries of which is the dairy industry, which has its historical foothold in the Jamberoo Valley. The Jamberoo Valley has been described by many as being probably the best dairy land this country provides. It is with a great deal of regret that I stand up here to talk about the US dairy export subsidy program. I was under the misapprehension that the Americans were our friends. I was under the misapprehension that, over many years of negotiation about trade, these defenders of democracy were out there trying to make sure we had free trade: 'We don't want those nasty Europeans subsidising-and that is the only reason that we subsidise.' As stated by the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan): This decision runs the very real risk of undermining the positive price developments in dairy export markets. There has, for example, recently been a reduction in European dairy export subsidies in Asian markets. So these so-called friends of ours are determined to use anti-free trade, anti-friendly activities in our region, to the detriment of our Australian farmers. The agrarian socialists, otherwise known as the National Party, have not said much on this matter. I know the families that have been farming in my area for 100 years plus. I know the blood, sweat and tears that they have put into their properties. I know that this government has tried to address their concerns and give them some security. That has partly been done by seeking export markets on a free and fair basis. The GATT is all about that. Our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sought assurances from Mr Clinton. The Minister for Trade stated in a media release: The US. Administration has given a number assurances to the Australian Government that would avoid action through its. export subsidy programs which would harm Australia's commerand cial interests. In particular, such an assurance given by President Clinton to Prime Minister Keating in 1993. What the hell is happening? The message I economy. put out is that the Australian farmers and the dairy farmers in my area are angry. They are upset. They have done everything they can to efficiently produce the best dairy product in the world at the lowest cost available. To now have those markets ripped from underneath them by American subsidies is an absolutely outrageous thing for the Americans to do. harks back to the American wheat subsidies in Indonesia. Maybe we have to start looking at the Americans in a new light. The Jamberoo Valley will suffer from this, as will all dairy farmers in Australia. The to say: dairy industry's estimate of the suffering is $20 million. I know that my colleague the the answerhonourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who lives in the Jamberoo Valley, and I will fight and make sure that we do everything can to protect Australian business. those on the other side of the chamber to find their voices and to protest at what this outraian geous action by the US administration will to Australian farmers. If there is going to competition in the world, let it be; but we not need the Americans to go in thereÂ· and she wrote: take these outrageous actions in terms of massive subsidies. Let them take those subsiThe dies off and look after their own deficit. By doing that, they would do the world Keating Government",132
239,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"1t is very interesting to observe a government unravelling. That is what we have been seeing in the last few weeks. I commend the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) for the very interesting contribution she made in the adjournment debate last night. She had the courage to take up the cause of one of her constituents, knowing full well that by doing so she was endorsing outright open criticism of her own Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This shows that, at long last, some of the backbenchers are no longer prepared to put up of with the nonsense that the Prime Minister has it been carrying on with, with the fact that he is no longer in touch with the Australian people no longer recognises his responsibilities was to the Australian people, and with the fact that not only has he lost Â·the plot but also that his government has lost control of the whole It is worth repeating some of the things that the member for Bass said in this chamber last night. She read a letter from the wife of a logging contractor who lives in her electorate. By reading that letter into the Hansard, she showed that she was prepared to be highly It critical of the Prime Minister, because she believes that he is no longer responding. I will take some of the points out of the letter from Mrs Jan Bishop, the wife of the logging contractor. She said that 1994 was the International Year of the Family and then went on To the families in Australia's timber communities she refers to what it has meant to some of we Australia's politicians in office todayI urge is a resounding NOTHING. She went on in the letter to show that Australtimber industry people had tried to bring do the Prime Minister's attention to what was be happening. In reference to his decision to do reassess the decision his minister had taken, Prime Minister's decision yesterday showed no vision. a favour. The letter goes on to say: It became clear once more that employment is not a concern in Canberra. We should send a clear message today that the Year of the Family was a farce. They are very strong words. She said: It meant nothing to the Federal Government ... they gave nothing to provide assistance or hope. These are the words that the member for Bass was prepared to read into the Hansard last night. By reading them, she clearly endorsed them. The letter goes on to say: We have worked hard for a proper balance between conservation and a productive industry. When the Prime Minister talks about balance his words are hollow. Those are very strong words. It goes on to talk about the Prime Minister and states: He hasn't even paid our community the simple respect of looking at what we have done before condemning us to a future of despair. Those words show very clearly that the member for Bass is fed up with having to support a Prime Minister in whom she no longer believes, in whose decisions she no longer believes and for whom she obviously no longer has any respect. In this context it was very interesting look at an article that appeared on page 1 today's Canberra Times headed 'Five Labor MPs in quit threat over woodchips'. It states: Five Labor backbenchers have told colleagues they will threaten the Government with their resignations from the party over woodchipping. Colleagues are attempting to talk the five resigning,I like that phrase 'attempting to talk the five out of resigning'. We know how the Labor Party works when it 'attempts' to talk people. It is a nice little euphemism, is it not? Many over that side would know exactly what I am referring to. But the article goes tell us a little more: Some long-serving MPs with regional electorates described thisthat is the feeling about the Prime Minister's operations. It goes on: One said there was a very strong feeling that process had lost integrity and the Prime Minister's Department and office was making deals without consultation. These are very strong words. Of course, it shows now that we really do have some very serious problems in this government-it is unravelling. The article continues: Another backbencher, who is not planning to resign, said there was no leadership whatsoever on the issue, and all pretence of following the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement had been abandoned. ""This has the real potential to destroy this Government,"" he said. It is about time a few more had the guts to stand up, like the member for Bass, and put their names to what they really think about the Prime Minister's lack of leadership over this whole issue. It shows that the government really is unravelling and is very clearly about to lose office because that is about all it deserves. Auschwitz: Commemoration",133
240,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"The 28th day of January 1995 marked the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, where millions of innocent human beings-Jews, gipsies, to Poles, political dissenters-but overwhelmingof ly Jews, were systematically put to death. Many members would have heard or seen aspects of those ceremonies where survivors gathered from around the world to mourn, to pray, and to remind us all of the evils of racism and anti-Semitism and the destruction that claimed over six million innocent lives, out of and which forever marked the lives of those who survived. In my electorate, there are many of my fellow citizens who carry their tattooed to numbers on their arms. They have rebuilt their lives while living with the agony of their own experiences and with the agony of the on to loss of family, friends and relatives. One would have hoped that this dehumanising and shameful episode in world history would have been enough to remind us all of the evil of anti-Semitism and racism in all its forms. The gates of Auschwitz were built on the the foundations of racial and religious prejudice. While it is accurate to say that Australia is more free of these attitudes than other societies, unfortunately there are still lunatic and fringe groups who neither recanted nor learnt anything from the horrors of Auschwitz. The League of Rights continues to be the best financed and overtly anti-Semitic organisation in Australia. It is of course true that overt anti-Semitism in Australia in 1995 is not as fashionable as it used to be. The polite form of 'antiSemitism' in contemporary society is 'holocaust revisionism'. That means that despite the overwhelming evidence-the documentation, the film footage, the evidence of survivors and the findings of war crime tribunalswe are told that we must be prepared to have political charlatans like David Irving mount platforms in Australia in an attempt to spuriously rewrite history so that we can pretend we are pursuing the truth of these matters. How is it that in Australia the verbal accounts and documentation of the survivors of the Sandekan death march, the findings of our war crime tribunals, the cruelty and privations suffered by our servicemen in Changi are accepted and properly accepted and writ large into our history of sacrifice? One could imagine the sense of outrage and animosity that would run through Australian society if it were suggested that in the interests of truth these events should be revisited with a view to questioning their accuracy. The double standard is self-evident, the implication being that Jewish victims and survivors cannot be believed. It is not an accident that the notoriously anti-Semitic League of Rights sought to sponsor David Irving to Australia. The then minister was correct and the government was right in refusing David Irving a visa. Holocaust revisionism is the fashionable anti-Semitism of the 1990s. Its base, its attitudes and its hatreds make it no different from the anti-Semitism that lead to Auschwitz. Auschwitz and all it stands for the agony, the suffering, the slaughter of the innocents-provides us all with the opportunity to recommit ourselves to the view that antiSemitism and all forms of racial hatred have no place in Australian society. Fisher Electorate: Essay Competition",134
241,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night I mentioned that in 1994 I organised the Fisher electorate essay competition again and I read into the Hansard the winning essay by Christopher Bingham from Caboolture State High School on the very important topic of the family. He was the senior section winner and we also have a junior section winner: Samantha Woledge of the Nanango State School. Last year she was in year 7. The topic she chose was that of racism. I will read her essay into the Hansard. It reads: Racism, as we know it today, has moved completely from the definition that once existed. Racism was thought of as 'the belief that human races have distinctive characteristics which determine their respective cultures.' Today, racism has become a major global problem, that is caused by the unrelenting attitudes of people and the ignorance which exists so readily, in our communities. As a race of people, we tend to have a strong beliefthat our own race is superior to others that exist beside us. There are many reasons why this type of negative attitude can flourish. It can stem from something as simple as personal experiences to something as complex as our upbringing. Parental influences, jealousy, conflicts which exist in sport and the feeling of life styles and livelihoods being threatened, all formulate a basis which can probably, unreasonably influence peoples attitudes towards another race. Racism is a problem for the whole of society to try to combat and it can cause anything from minor disagreements between neighbours to major disputes between countries that often lead to wars which involve millions of people and usually in tum, lead to more racial attitudes. Governments put in place, laws, to try to tackle racism but although this means that perhaps the racist tries to either hide his or her attitude or risk being charged and tried in a court of law, it does nothing to change the attitude, which is after all, the problem. The only way that the world's racism is going to stop, is if people are educated in the lifestyles, religions and beliefs of other races and then to be more tolerant, considerate and understanding of others. We need to realise that it is not feasible to group people together under one heading and assume that they are all alike. We must realise that all humans are created equally and in all groups there will be those that conform and those that don't. Every person in the world is an individual and should be treated as such, regardless of their race. The world has a long way to go, to reach anything remotely close to racial harmony but the abolition of Apartaid in South Africa is a major step forward in the right direction. As a child:I have only a child's view of things, but even to Â·me it seems that the more Governments try to Â·correct past mistakes and make up for longgone injustices, the worse the situation becomes. Samantha and Chris were in the parliament last year and they met very many members of this place. I would like to wish them both every success with their future studies. I know that Samantha indeed enjoyed her visit to the parliament and I hope that she does very well at Nanango High School this year. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8.00 p.m. The following notice was given: Mr Beazley to move That this House: (1) acknowledges the Beatification by His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, of Mother Mary MACKillop, founder of Australia's first gious order, the Congregation of the Sisters St Joseph; and (2) recognises the contribution to the people and society of Australia by Blessed Mary MACKillop and the beneficent and enduring work of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph.

Perth Theatre Company (Question No. 1741)",140
246,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 November 1994: (1) What sum did his Department, or its predecessors responsible for arts funding, provide to the Perth Theatre Company or its predecessors in (a) 1988, (b) 1989, (c) 1990, (d) 1991, (e) 1992, (f) 1993 and (g) 1994. (2) What funding will his Department provide to the Perth Theatre Company in 1995. (3) Who is responsible for determining the funding under which the Perth Theatre Company was funded and how was the distribution of funds determined. (4) Has funding of the Perth Theatre Company been reduced; if so, why. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Pilots (1) Perth Theatre Company, until recently known as SWY Theatre Incorporated, received funds from the Australia Council in the years nominated, as follows: (a)-(g) 1988-$2,875 1989-$1,875 1990-$7,475 1991-Nil 1992-$53,530 1993-$60,000 1994-$35,570 (2) At present no funds have been granted by the Australia Council for payment to Perth Theatre Company in 1995. The Company will have further has 40 opportunities to lodge applications which, .if approved, would result in payments being made by the Australia Council during 1995. (3) Perth Theatre Company has received funds from the Australia Council's Literature Board and Performing Arts Board (Drama Committee). The Boards of the Australia Council are delegatedwith the power to make funding decisions. In some cases, the Boards delegate this power to specialised committees. The members of the Council, Boards and Committees are all peers of artists and represent a wide variety of geographical, artistic and community interests. The members are usually appointed for one to three years .and the make-up of the committees changes continually. Boards and Committees of the Australia Council receive applications under a number of advertised programs of assistance; they consider their merits against published criteria, and approve grants to applicants from a budget determined by Council itself. (4) The aggregate of amounts received by Perth Theatre Company in 1994 from the Australia Council was lower than that received in 1993; this reflects the relative success of the various projects proposed by Perth Theatre Company against strong national competition. It is not yet possible to say whether the total funds Perth Theatre Company will receive from the Australia Council in 1995 will be less than the level it received in 1994. Department of Social Security: DSS (Question No. 1751)",140
247,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 November 1994: Has his Department paid a conditional management and booking fee in relation to DSS International; if so, (a) what is DSS International, (b) why was the fee paid and (c) what is his Department's role and itemised budget in relation to DSS Intemational. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (b) and (c) The Department of Social Security has no knowledge of a 'conditional management and booking fee' in relation to international project activity and there is no area of the Department called 'DSS International'. Nigeria: Fraudulent Business (Question No. 1759) Mr Bradford asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 November 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to concerns expressed about business and financial opportunities being offered through the mail in Australia by persons purporting to be prominent citizens of Nigeria. (2) Is it a fact that the ventures referred to (1) have proved to be fraudulent and have cost Australians $10-15 000000. (3) Will he order an urgent investigation by the Australian Federal Police into the matter. (4) Has the Nigerian Government been approached to assist in stopping the activity: if so, (a) through what steps and (b) has that government cooperated fully.",141
248,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has advised me that since 1991 over 1,400 such letters have been handed to it by the business community and citizens throughout Australia. The AFP is correlating information to facilitate overseas enquiries. (2) It is impossible to estimate the actual amount of money lost by the Australian business community and citizens or the number of victims. As the ""scam"" involves apparent fraudulent activity against another government, many victims are probably too embarrassed to report their loss to police. (3) No. As the offences are committed overseas, the matter is outside Australian law enforcement International juri,sdiction. However, the AFP has provided assistance and information to the UK police, through the Overseas Liaison Network and Interpol, to aid investigations and prosecutions of offenders based in England. Twenty alleged offenders are being prosecuted at this time. The AFP is currently conducting an intelligence probe to identify offenders to provide appropriate assistance to overseas law enforcement agencies. The AFP has in the past issued several media releases in an effort to warn the Australian citizens and business community not to become involved in this ""scam"", and to forward any such letters to AFP Headquarters in Canberra. (4) (a) Through the Nigerian High Commission in Canberra, the AFP has provided the High Commissioner with all available information to assist the appropriate authorities in Nigeria to investigate and prosecute offenders based in that country. In addition, I am informed that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has called in the High Commissioner of Nigeria to impress on him Opportunities the concern of the Australian Government. (b) The High Commission, however, has so far not indicat"" ed that the information has been able to assist the Nigerian Government in any investigation carried out in that country. . Department of Social Security: Information Technology (Question No. 1793)  in part Security, upon notice, on 17 November 1994: (1) Will the Minister provide details of the sums the Minister's Department and each agency, statutory. authority or government business enterprise for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spent on information technology in (a) 199192, (b) 1992-93 and (c) 1993-94. (2) Is the Minister able to itemise the expenditures referred to in each case in part (1). (3) Will further sums be spent on information technology in 1994-95. Hardware Software IT Consumables Services & Consultancies Voice Communication Maintenance Training Total * Note: These figures relate to specific information Security. (* Difference due to rounding). (2) Yes. Records are maintained in accordance with the Audit Act and Finance Directions. A request for fully itemised expenditure would involve an unreasonable diversion of the Department's resources. (3) Yes. The estimated expenditure on information technology in 1994-95 is $153.5m. (This reflects the impact of the main stage of the Department's Network Replacement Project). Department of Social Security: Program (Question No. 1804)  Security, upon notice, on 17 November 1994: (1) What is the method of evaluation for each program implemented within his portfolio under the Working Nation statement. (2) What will each program referred to in part (1) cost in (a) 1994-95 and (b) 1995-96. (3) What targets will be used to assess the performance of each program in (a) 1994-95 and (b) 1995-96. (4) When will the first evaluation occur. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The income support measures under Working Nation will have been subject to a Post Implementation Review (PIR) 12-18 months after the package is fully implemented. For most elements this will mean that a PIR will be conducted in 1995 - imd 1996. In addition, there will be PIRs of the Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Expenditure for information technology in the Social Security portfolio was: (a) 1991-92 (b) 1992-93 (c) 1993-94 $m $m $m 28.0 26.9 26.9 2.3 1.5 2.7 0.6 0.7 0.5 13.8 8.5 11.6 24.0 26.0 38.8 38.1 16.5 19.5 0.0 0.1 0.9 106.8 80.1 100.9 technology purchases of the Department of Social implementation of the Working Nation measures before the PIR of the outcomes of the measures takes place. An effectiveness evaluation will be undertaken after the new arrangements have been in place for 2-3 years. This evaluation will be carried out over 1996 and 1997 and is due for reporting in the 199899 Budget. Data sources will include DSS administrative data (and some data from the Department of Evaluations Employment, Education and Training (DEET)) and specially commissioned client surveys to measure longer term employment-related behavioural and attitudinal changes. These would include a tracking exercise involving an initial survey of a sample of clients prior to the reforms with a follow-up two years later to gauge the level of understanding of the new income support arrangements, changes in workforce participation, and earnings patterns. The method of evaluation for the Parenting Allowance component of the Working Nation Statement has not yet been determined. However, as Parenting Allowance will be introduced to improve full-time work incentives for single earner couples with children and to provide low income partnered women with a choice about workforce participation and caring for children, it is likely that it will involve a survey of clients before and after the introduction of Parenting Allowance. The evaluation will also irivolve an assessment of the effectiveness of its implementation. More detail about how the major elements of the package will be evaluated is provided below. Income Test Changes The impact of the new income test arrangements as an incentive to workforce participation will be monitored using administrative data from the DSS Newstart system. Aspects which will be monitored include the take-up of the entitlements by clients eligible for part-rates of payment, overall movement of clients from income support to the workforce and changes to the average earnings patterns of clients. Detailed baseline data on current client earnings patterns is planned prior to the introduction of the new arrangements to enable a before and after comparison. Feedback on client's understanding of the allowance income test would be sought through surveys, and longitudinal tracking of clients will be undertaken to examine movement from unemployment payments to part-time, casual and full-time work. The surveys will also obtain clients' perceptions on how the changed arrangements influenced their choices in moving into part-time, casual or full-time work. The reforms also target younger women without children and women with recent labour force experience who are married to social security recipients to increase their labour market participation. The resultant participation of married women in the labour market will be assessed through administrative data and qualitative research. For example, the perceptions of married female clients about their labour market status could form part of a client survey. Changes in the level of participation of married female clients in paid work and in labour market programs would also be examined using DSS and DEET data. More Flexible Income Support Arrangements This element comprises two aspects: extension of allowable activities and provision of future income support payments. PIRs will be conducted on implementation and outcomes of these two measures in 1995. The PIRs will include a survey of selected Area and Regional Offices in two or three States. Program Element Income Test Changes and Partner Allowance More flexible income support arrangements - extension of allowable activities - advances of future income support payments Phase-out of Wife's Pension Extension of Education Entry Payment Parenting Allowance Phasing Out of Wife's Pension The phase out of Wife's Pension will be evaluated as part of the wider review of the changes to income support for unemployed people. This will include analysis of DSS administrative data and specially commissioned client surveys. Extension of Education Entry Payment (EdEP) Data on the take up of EdEP by wife pensioners, and Partner Allowance and Parenting Allowance recipients will be collected as part of the wider review of changes to income support for unemployed people. Parenting Allowance Parenting Allowance will be introduced to improve full-time incentives for single income earner couples with children. The allowance will also provide low income partnered women with a choice about workforce participation and caring for children. The evaluation strategy for Parenting Allowance will assess its impact on clients and the efficiency of its implementation and ongoing administration. The evaluation will take place over two years and will seek to measure the extent to which the new arrangements may have influenced the choice to move into full-time, part-time and casual work. Research will also be undertaken on the impact of the new arrangements for married couples and, in particular, on the participation of married women in the labour market. It is proposed that data will be obtained from a survey of clients, incorporating longitudinal tracking, to assess behavioural changes in response to the Working Nation initiatives. This survey data will be supplemented with other research material, such as an analysis of data collected through the payment system. (2)(a) and (b) Costs and (savings) are provided below: Costs/(Savings) 1994-95 1995-96 $m $m o (96.0) 1.3 (5.3) 8.4 16.0 o (3.2) o 0.3 27.6 366.6 (3) Targets for performance are not set. Performance indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of programs. The impact of the changes on incentives to workforce participation will be monitored using administrative data from the DSS Newstart computer system, including changes to the average earning patterns of clients. Detailed baseline data on current client earning patterns will be collected prior to the introduction of the new arrangements to enable a before and after comparison. Client feedback on the allowance income test will be sought through surveys, and longitudinal tracking of clients will be undertaken to examine movement from unemployment payments to part-time, casual and full-time work. Effectiveness of the extension of allowable activities will be measured through performance information on the employment outcomes for clients as well as a result of their participation in broader activities. Effectiveness of the measurewill also be assessed by the extent (and nature) of client take-up of the broader range of approved activities. Effectiveness of the advance of future income support payments will be measured through performance information on the employment outcomes for clients as a result of their take-up of advances. Effectiveness of the measure will also be assessed by the extent (and nature) of client take-up of the advances. (4) The first evaluation, Post Implementation Review, will concern the improvements in flexibility of income support arrangements and will occur mid-1995. A detailed post-implementation review is proposed for 12 to 18 months after the implementation of Parenting Allowance. The details of the evaluation strategy will be developed during 1995 and Parenting Allowance will be included in the Portfolio Evaluation Plan for 1996. Affirmative Action (Question No. 1807)",141
249,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 5 December 1994: (1) Did he recently announce the names of businesses which his Department alleged had failed to comply with federal affirmative action laws. (2) Are the businesses referred to in part (1) prohibited from applying for. Government tenders. (3) Did the businesses referred to in part (I) include Snowdeli Pty Ltd; if so, (a) is it a fact 95 per cent of Snowdeli's workforce are women and that women hold all managerial positions in the business, (b) why was the business named as not complying with affirmative action laws and (c) will the business be removed from the list and be allowed to compete forÂ· Government tenders; if not, why not.",144
250,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsÂ·: (I) Yes. I tabled the Annual Report of the Affirmative Action Agency on 20 October 1994.in the House of Representatives. This report contained the names of businesses which failed to comply with the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. (2) Yes. A contract compliance policy was introduced on 1 January 1993. Businesses named in Parliament are ineligible for government contracts for goods and services and specified forms of industry assistance. (3) Yes. (a) As Snowdeli Pty Ltd have not submitted a report for 1993 it is not known whether 95 per cent of their current workforce are women, or whether women hold all managerial positions, according to Snowdeli' s 1992 report 84 per cent of employees were women and 80 per cent of managers were women. (b) Section 13(2) of the Act states that ""A relevant employer shall lodge a public report with the Agency within 3 months after the end of the period to which the report relates"". Section 19(1 )of the Act states that the Agency may name relevant employers which fail to provide a report about the progress of their affirmative . action program. Snowdeli has not submitted a report to the Affirmative Action Agency, so they have not complied with the requirements of the Act. The standard letter which provided an additional 28 days for submitting a report was not responded to. (c) No. The business cannot be removed from the list until it submits a report which complies with the requirements of the Act. Music Industry (Question No. 1836) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 5 December 1994: (1) What action is the Government taking to apply competition policies to the music industry. (2) What benefits would. flow to consumers from that allowing independent suppliers to impon CDs. (3) Following the Prices Surveillance Authority's recommendations to lift restrictions on parallel imports of recorded music, what consideration has been given to transparent policies for industry specifically through direct (a) bounties for Australian products or (b) income support for Australian artists. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The music industry is subject to the broad range of trade practices and consumer protection legislation as are other industries. The Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) has recommended that the Government amend the Copyright Act 1968 to allow parallel importation of sound recordings. The PSA considers this will enhance competition in the sound recording mark-. The Government is considering this recommendation. (2) There is substantial debate over the costs and benefits of allowing parallel importation sound recordings. The possible costs include increased piracy and an increase in the costs of policing it as well as reduced investment in Australian artists, resulting in reduced availability of Australian recorded music for consumers and lower economic returns for local artists, recording companies and related industries. The possible benefits include some reduction in the price of CDs and cassettes (particularly for top selling albums). (3) The Government is considering the Prices Surveillance Authority'S recommendations on the prices of sound recordings and r am not in a position to comment on whether consideration will be given to industry subsidies as part of our response.

If not, how does he defend the of applying a sales tax to pure fruit juice which is as identifiable a food as sales-tax-fi'ee whole milk? Has the Minister ignored the advice of Senator Sherry and resisted this move to conspicuous tax equity simply on the grounds of lost revenue, with little regard for the viability of efficient Australian horticultural industries? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the wholesale sales tax legislation food for human consumption (whether or not requiring processing or treatment), and ingredients and goods to be mixed with or added to food for human consumption are exempt from sales tax. A popular misconception is that the exemption for milk is based on the legal interpretation of milk qualifying as food in the sales tax legislation: in fact, beverages are specifically excluded from .the exemption for food for human consumption. The sales tax law separately exempts plain milk (containing at least 95 per cent of milk products) from sales tax, ie, it is separately listed as an exempt item in the sales tax law. Plain milk and orange juice are often not regarded as substitutes. On this point, I have received representations from soft drink manufacturers in which they claim that soft drink and orange juice are substitutes. Since most manufactured beverages (including most alcoholic beverages) are subject to sales tax at the rate of 21 per cent, it can be argued that orange juice and other juices (containing at least25 per cent juice) currently receive favourable sales tax treatment as they are taxed at the concessional rate of 11 per cent. On the matter of tax equity, the Industry Commission (lC) in its recent Report on Horticulture recommended that all juice be taxable at the general rate of 21 per cent, the rate at which most other manufactured beverages are taxed. The Government referred the IC's Report to the Horticultural Task Force for advice and subsequently rejected the IC's recommendation in favour of all fruit and vegetable juices containing at least 25 per cent juice being taxed at the concessional sales tax rate of 11 per cent. The Government also rejected calls from certain industry groups for an exemption for fresh juice. A specific sales tax exemption for fresh juice could be inconsistent with the GATT. Any sales tax measure that, in practice, discriminated against imports could invoke the National Treatment Provisions in the GATT which are designed to ensure that imported goods receive the same taxation treatment as domestic goods. The Government also announced on 29 November 1994 a multi-million dollar program to revitalise the citrus industry. Included in the package is a market diversification program, to be funded at a cost of $9 million over 5 years, to assist industry efforts to reduce its reliance on the juice concentrate sector and to increase sales of fresh fruit and fresh juice with a focus on exports.",144
