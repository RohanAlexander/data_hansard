7,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who?,11
8,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he is quoting, as I assume, the Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council, he misquotes him, because what the Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council was addressing himself to was, quite specifically, a matter relating the treatment of long service leave. In relation to that particular quote, he was referring to long service leave. The Leader of the Opposition might recall an incident back in 1978. I am sure the absent honourable member for Bennelong would certainly remember a similar instance when he proposed a similar measure at that time. Of course, the government of the day subsequently changed part of what it was proposing to do in that area. But if the Leader of the Opposition is trying to make a point about some of our critics, he might at least get their quotes right. Budget 1993-94  aware of some criticism of the budget on the grounds that it does not provide enough for employment growth through infrastructure expenditure and for the unemployed through various outlays? What is the government's budget strategy regarding infrastructure and other spending as it relates to employment and the unemployed?",11
9,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen various comments from commentators and from more direct participants in the political process about the fact that this budget contains nothing for the unemployed. That is a complete misstatement of what is in this budget. This budget has a very direct focus on the unemployed, both in terms of getting back to employment growth and providing assistance to people who remain unemployed. The whole shape of the budget was to provide a stimulus to demand through about one-half per cent of GDPsomething which the opposition says that it totally opposes but then ironically proposes policies which would accentuate that position. The shape of the budget is to give a stimulus to demand so that we can get the economy going at a faster rate and get to the point where the rate of growth of employment will make inroads into unemployment. The very shape of the budget is directed towards increasing employment and, therefore, towards looking after people who are unemployed. This budget contains a boost to Commonwealth investment expenditure. There have to been some quite wrong reports that this budget cuts back on infrastructure expenditure. That is untrue. This budget has a considerable increase in Commonwealth investment expenditure because the One Nation expenditures are running at full bore, because there are other infrastructure expenditures, because some of the public trading enterprises are increasing their investment. Commonwealth investment will increase by about seven per cent in real terms in this budget. That is a major factor in public final demand increasing by some 21/2 per cent in real terms against 11/2 per cent last year. That 21f'). per cent increase in public final demand puts about one-half per cent directly into GOP growth this year. So let us have none of this nonsense about this being a budget which does not have infrastructure expenditure to create employment. Of course, there is support for business investment. There are measures to cut company tax and to provide for the investment allowance on top of the One Nation proposals for the depreciation allowance extension and the development allowance. We are seeing major encouragement to business investment with the result that business investment this year is expected to increase through the year by some 103/4 per cent. Employment is expected to increase this year by 11/4 per cent. That represents about 100,000 jobs. We want to create a lot more jobs, but it is a turnaround from the situation of the last couple of years where employment has been going backwards. We are now back on an employment growth path of 100,000 jobs this year,with the forecast of 21/2 per cent growth for the following year and 23/4 per cent growth the year after that. We are directlyon track to meet the accord obligation of 500,000 jobs over three years. Comments from some quarters that the budget does not deliver on that accord obligation are dead wrong. To try to assist that process, there is more action in relation to labour market programs. This year 66,000 more people are assisted under labour market programs than was the case last year-66,OOO more. Is that doing nothing for the unemployed? We also look to take action to assist those who remain unemployed. There is a $6 a fortnight increase in the newstart allowance for the long term unemployed. Furthermore, we have relaxed the income test for unemployed people so that they can earn more whilst they are on benefits and without having their benefits impaired. There are a couple of measures along those lines. We also eased the waiting period for people who are employed for only a short time and who then become unemployed. again. These are all substantial steps in assisting people who are unemployed. Another step is the mature age allowance, which provides pension-type benefits for unemployed people who are aged 60 years and over. That is a considerable benefit for those elderly unemployed persons. Finally, all of the unemployed people benefit directly from the Commonwealth dental scheme, which provides both free emergency and basic dental care to all pensioners, beneficiaries, and low income families. The opposition tries to totally ignore that in looking at this budget. That is a considerable benefit to all lower income people, including the unemployed. Various people who should know better, including various people in the gallery and various people in marginal parties in another place, are dead wrong when they say that the budget does nothing about the unemployed. This budget is very concerned both to create jobs and to ease the position of those who remain unemployed. Budget 1993-94",11
10,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer him to his statement last week: ... the Budget (is) not a negotiating instrument and the Senate is going to have to confront it on that basis. ... it's a package, you can't just lop bits off. Does his statement still stand?",12
11,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Prime Minister indicated on Friday, and as I indicated on Wednesday, we have listened to what the Leader of the Australian Democrats has had to say to us and we will speak with her again. The governinent has considered its position in that context. It was always the case that the budget measures had to be such as to be approved by the Senate. The point that I was making last week was that this was a budget for four years; it was a budget which involved a deficit reduction strategy. I am not quite sure why the opposition would be asking a question like this. The opposition has rendered itself totally irrelevant to this discussion or any discussion about the budget, its objective, or even the course of fiscal policy for this nation over the next few years. If we look at what members of the opposition have to say on the budget and on the deficit reduction strategy, we see that they will make the deficit $3 billion higher than the government proposes by 1996-97. That is the only conclusion that we can draw from what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in his reply and from what his shadow Treasurer had to say in his remarks to the National Press Club last week. On this topic, let me just correct a very seriousMrTim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 146. Clearly, the Treasurer is now moving to a separate item. There is facility under the standing orders for him to provide the correction that he seeks to provide after question time. I ask you to direct him to do so.",12
12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Treasurer has yet to start to talk about an issue which you are suggesting he is. My understanding would be that it would be relevant to the question.,13
13,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Mayo has asked me about the government's deficit reduction strategy. He has asked me whether that strategy remainsMr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Treasurer has obviously forgotten the question I asked him; indeed, he has forgotten what he said last week. He said: ... it's a package, you can't just lop bits off. Does that statement still stand? He is now going into a general discussion about what this person and that person may say. It has absolutely nothing to do with the question. He was questioned about what he said. Was he kidding when he said it?",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honou-able member for Mayo will resume his seat. The Treasurer is in order.,13
15,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will say this slowly for the honourable member for Mayo. The reason I made those remarks was that the Senate had to realise something which the opposition has failed to realise: what the government is concerned about here is getting a credible fiscal strategy for the next four years. What has happened is that the approach of members of the opposition to fiscal policy has become so flaccid that they think nothing of adding an extra $3 billion to the deficit in 1996-97. But it is worse than that because the honourable member for Mayo has said that they were not proposing to decimate the budget, they were proposing to change 11/2 per cent of total revenues. He said, 'This is the same as what the Senate did in 1981'. First ·of all, 11/2 per cent of revenues is about $1 1/2 billion. The opposition is proposing $3 billion worth of changes which he says is the same. The honourable member wants to go for this current year. What happened in 1981,if he wants a little lesson in history, was that three proposals were raised by the then Treasurer. One was to increase all WST rates by 21/2 per cent, to correct some anomalies and inconsistencies and to broaden the WST tax base for goods which previously had been exempt. The combination of all the measures constituted 1.4 per cent of revenue at that time. The first and second of those measures were passed by the Senate. It was the third which did not pass. That was a measure to raise $132 million in 1981-82; that is, 0.3 per cent of revenues. So, as far as the honourable member for Mayo is concerned, there is no difference between 0.3 per cent of .revenues and 11/2 per cent of revenues. It is no wonder the opposition is in such disarray on fiscal policy, if its primary spokesman on the topic does not understand the difference between these matters. Essentially what the honourable member for Mayo has said is that he wants to see the deficit lower but he wants to knock off the measures which are going to achieve that objective. As well, when pressed on the point of how he would do it otherwise, all he could talk about was tax reductions. He wanted to reduce taxes. When he was asked what he would do about deficit reductions he had nothing to say-because the opposition has no policy in relation to fiscal policy. Indeed, it has no policy about anything whatsoever. Education: Universities",13
16,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-y question is addressed to the - inister for Employment, Education and Training. Has the minister seen allegations that it is a lot harder today for Australian young people to get into university than it was in the 1960s and that they have a more limited range of educational opportunities? Is there any foundation for those allegations?",14
17,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have, indeed. Among others, the Leader of the Opposition a week or so ago said: Think about your own kids and the difficulties that they have had getting an education ... compared to how easy it was for most of us. It is a lot harder for them ... to get an tion with 60,000 kids that cannot get into universithe ty. I will deal briefly with the time that the Leader of the Opposition and a few others of us in this House were lads. At that time only two students in 10 'who started secondary school completed year 12. Now, eight in 10 complete secondary school. Two in 10, when the Leader of the Opposition was a kid and eight in 10 young people today. Then there were 91,000 people attending university; in 1993 there are 575,000 in higher education. The comparison with the 1960s is so absurd that it does not bear continuing to talk about it in this House except that the Leader of the Opposition feels obliged from time to time, as he repeats each year the speech which he gave the previous year on the budget, to reiterate the line that is tapped into his computer. As he goes through that computer and spits out the last year's budget response, he is obliged to give it a run again. Let us take a more modern comparison than the 1960s; the circumstances we found when we came into office and the circumstances which now exist. In 1982, out of every 100 kids who started secondary school, 16 made it through to university. In 1993, 28 out of 100 make it through to university. In other words, the chance of any young person completing school and going on to university has increased by 75 per cent since the Australian Labor Party came to office. Only two out of 10 children completed secondary school in the 1960s. In 1982repeated Liberal governments later-the figure was only three out of 10. The figure today, as I mentioned earlier, is eight in 10. These improvements in opportunity are now reflected in the skills of our labour force. In February 1981, 7.7 per cent of the total labour force had degrees. In February 1993, 12.3 per cent of the total labour force had degrees. In 1981, less than 31 per cent had some other form of post-school qualification. In 1993, over 38 per cent did. We will be providing, via this budget, an extra 31,000 higher education places between 1993 and 1995. We have provided an addieducational $720 million over three years to expand vocational education and training system. We have provided an in-principle commitment to a further $70 million in growth in vocational education in 1996, subject to the states meeting their obligations under the ANTA agreement. . What does the Liberal Party offer as an alternative to fulfil the words that the computer of the Leader of the Opposition keeps spitting out at each budget time? What is the opposition's position? The opposition spokesman said: The Federal Opposition would retain its existing policy on education until a wide-ranging review could take place. He said that he intended to spend the next 12 months seeking the broadest possible opinion before formulating a new education policy outline to put before coalition members. He said: 'I'm fairly keen not to pre-empt anything although at this stage I think it's fair to say that we're in a situation where much of the current policy would be open to review'. Indeed it should be. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and accuses a government with a massively successful record in the area of education of being in some way dilatory. Despite the fact that he has been Leader of the Opposition for two or three years now and is supposed to have a policy in this area, he has none at all. Budget 1993-94",14
18,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-y question is again directed to the Treasurer. Does the government remain absolutely committed to a deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, achieved with no new expenditure cuts and no tax rises? I would like a simple answer-yes or no.",15
19,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition is simply not entitled to ask questions of us when it has no policy of its own. The government has set out its deficit reduction strategy, a deficit reduction strategy which it will hold to. But this is not a debt reduction strategy which the opposition agrees with. Its approach is to say that it wants lower deficits but then to oppose all the measures which might go in the direction of achieving it. The opposition dealt itself out of the play on this issue, and the government will deal with this matter in its own time.· Mabo Issue",15
20,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-y question is directed to the Prime - inister. Has the Prime - inister seen reports proposing that a referendum be held on the - abo issue? Does the Prime - inister see any merit in such a proposal? Would it contribute to a greater sense of national identity and purpose among Aborigines and non-Aboriginal Australians?,15
21,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's position in respect of the High Court's historic decision is that it will do what is necessary to award and protect native title in this country. We are in the process now, and have been for some months, of bringing together a piece of generic legislation which will introduce a system of national principles whereby native title can be ascertained, protected and awarded.",15
22,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You've shown no leadership whatsoever.,15
23,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In contrast, yesterday this person over here laid doggo at the Liberal Party conference while he accepted a resolutionfrom the far right of the Liberal Party to say that it will have a referendum on native title-in other words, a Richard Court proposition, a Western Australian proposition, which says, 'Yes, we stand for the rule of law in the Liberal Party except until it suits us, and when the High Court makes a key and seminal decision we will blackguard them; we will not accept the rule of law; we will not accept the legitimacy of the High Court; and we will seek to introduce a referendum to overturn it'. Just a couple of weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said a referendum would be divisive on native title. Yesterday he refused to argue against the putting of a referendum on native title and lay there gutless while the Liberal Party right wing rolled over the top of him. Even Jeff Kennett had to show him up when he said: ... in one sense walking away from government responsibility itself. That is, seeking to circumvent Mabo by trying to introduce a referendum to abolish it across the country by these means. The Leader of the Opposition sits there, protected by his apparatchik mates at the conference, doggo, cowardly. He is now prepared to contemplate the thing that was going to be divisive a few weeks ago. Listen to the proposition that was put: The Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party should consider all optiops which are consistent with the maintenance of the responsibilities of the States for control of land usenot justice to Aboriginals- including a referendum which reaffinns that responsibility . Guess who laid doggo in the middle of it all? The Leader of the Opposition. On the republic issue-another question of national identity which the questioner raises--':'he said he voted to reject the call for a conscience vote on the republic. In other words, all the younger and more national spirited minded people in the Liberal Party who believe in a singular identity for this country are voted down. What does he do? He rejects a call for a conscience vote on the republic. Then he said: The option is on the Government to say, 'The onus is on us to say why the Constitution should be changed'. That is, the onus is on us to say why we should not have an English .Queen as our head of state in perpetuity. You have got to be joking. He went to his conference and Malcolm Fraser looked after him. Malcolm Fraser said: A small group pushed our policies further to the right. He said: We've become a right wing conservative party. Five election losses on the trot, and yesterday they sit there saying, 'We don't have a problem'. Because they think the Government has a problem with the 1993-94 budget, they let the opportunity go by to consider that five election losses on the trot should be not considered, everything is okay, it is business as usual. If the budget debate is met and we have kept the Opposition leader longer than his natural political life, then it has served well because the Leader of the Opposition will never win a national election in this country. He is a low impact player, and his credibility is shot to ribbons the more he is out there calling me and the government liars and all the rest of it. What was the core of his policy? The GST has gone; it has been put asunder by him. So here we are at a national council of the Liberal Party-five election losses in a row; no consideration about its long-term potential to change; Malcolm Fraser writing it off as a right wing group; and its leader sitting doggo while a motion is passed, about states rights to overturn the High Court. If that is what is called leadership, God help Australia under a coalition government. By contrast, here is the government doing what has to be done on fiscal policy, doing what has to be done on native title, doing what has to be done on our national identity-leading, leading, leading and hot following, following, following like this basically craven coward opposite. Fuel Prices",15
24,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now that that diatribe is finished, my question is directed to the Treasurer. Can he confirm that even if he withdraws 3c of the increase in excise on leaded fuel, he will still be increasing excise on leaded fuel under this budget by a whopping 7c a litre?",16
25,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The increase for unleaded fuel as proposed by the budget was 5c. I am not sure if the honourable member for Mayo would get this right, but I think if we add the differential of 2c to 5c we get 7c. Regional Development",16
26,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Can the minister outline to the House the initiatives that the government has taken to enhance the economic and social development of regional areas of Australia?",16
27,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. Incidentally, the honourable member deserves some congratulation for having organised, in cooperation with the Latrobe Regional Comus mission, an exhibition of considerable importance in this parliament last week. The honourable member also makes a great contribution in chairing the regional development work of the caucus. The government has elevated regional development to a first order priority, and that, I think most' honourable members in the chamber would accept, has not been a position that has obtained since probably the Whitlam period. The first of the raft of government initiatives is the establishment of a task force on regional development, chaired by Mr Bill Kelty. It is now working very actively around Australia.",16
28,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,16
29,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite come in like fish. There is a whole range of people on that task force. I have reams of correspondence congratulating the government on the formation of the task force. Very few people in Australia can objectively claim to have the experience of working in regional Australia, particularly in so far as job creation is concerned. Numerous articles in newspapers and elsewhere have commented on-indeed I might say applauded-the role of people like Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox in going into communities, particularly in Victoria, and ensuring that those communities have an opportunity of putting a view",16
30,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Jeff Kennett is creating jobs in Victoria.,16
31,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The interjections of the honourable member for O'Connor are always asinine, and in terms of regional development he is about as useful as a steer in a paddock of heifers. The government has a range of further initiatives. Honourable members will be aware that the Industry Commission is currently inquiring into impediments to economic development in the regions, and the government looks forward with some interest to receiving that report. Taken together, the task force report and the Industry Commission report will provide a reasonable basis for government to give consideration to the whole range of issues that are of importance in regional Australia. The philosophy underlying our activity in this area is that national development also ought to be considered in a regional context; that is, regional economic development is important to national economic development. The second underlying philosophy is that governments do have a role here: they have a role working with and, importantly, listening to regional communities. They have a role . in working with not only the broad communities but also trade unions and industry, premAustralia. ised on the proposition-which is a sensible one, I think-that in large measure the impact on regional Australia of the internationalisation of the Australian economy has, of course, left many areas where government should be further engaged, There are some other points that I should quickly make.. One is that in the budget people may have observed, as I hope the honourable member for Maranoa did, that the government allocated- . An Opposition member-Boring!",16
32,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the madness we have to put up with in this House.,17
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refrain from responding to interjections.,17
34,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the opposition seriously considers the issue of regional ment to be boring, I think that says more about it than it does about us. In conclusion, $1.25 million",17
35,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are a monumental hypocrite.,17
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw that remark.,17
37,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Which is the remark?,17
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You will withdraw the remark you directed at the minister.,17
39,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw the remark. But the point stands: you are putting leaded petrol up by lOc a litre.,17
40,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is the fellow who thought that people at the last election 'voted for their fears and aspirations, not for what they wanted to happen'. You are a loop; you are a loop.",17
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,17
42,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I withdraw. Let me conclude by making the request of members of the opposition that, in so far as they represent their constituencies, they cooperate with the task force and cooperate with the Industry Commission inquiry. I believe that the government will be in a position, about midway through next year, to respond to the many submissions we have had from regional Fuel Prices MrTIM FISCHER-I direct my question to the Treasurer. I ask whether on 19 August he said to the House that the decision regarding fuel excise on leaded fuel was made '-entially for health reasons' because he was 'concerned about the deleterious effects on the intellectual capacity of young children'. If it really was a health issue, what has happened in the last 12 days with the proposal still to increase fuel taxes but more than have the differential?",17
43,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point I was making at the time was that it was essentially not a revenue issue; it was a matter,17

47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. Honourable members on my left will come to order. The Treasurer has been asked a question; honourable members will at least listen to the answer of the Treasurer.,17
48,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My smile had nothing to do with what those opposite thought it had to do with. It is to do with what they might find out later about the decision that we have taken. It was essentially a matter about how we can discourage the use of leaded fuel; in other words, how to encourage a conversion from leaded to unleaded. If we change the differential, different behaviour will no doubt occur. That is something which will have to be addressed by policy. Judiciary: Gender Imbalance",18
49,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Justice. In - ight of recent comments from the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Elizabeth Evatt, about the gender imbalance in the composition of Australia's courts and tribunals, is the government doing to redress this problem?",18
50,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At a conference on public interest law held in Sydney on the weekend, the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Justice Deirdre O'Connor, said that one of the problems for the Australian judicial system is that there are not enough women in positions of authority in our courts and tribunals. Justice O'Connor said that any visit to our courts and tribunals would reveal that women simply do not have many speaking parts in the court and tribunal processes despite the high number of women in law school. Elizabeth Evatt, in her capacity as the Australian law reform commissioner, is currently conducting consultations about gender issues and the law. A Senate committee is also investigating similar issues. I remind the House that the Governor General, in his speech opening this parliament, announced the government's intention to ensure a more appropriate representation in the judiciary of both women and people of nonEnglish speaking background. The position of women in Australian society is extremely important. Each ministry has a responsibility to ensure that women receive equal treatment, and that they are encouraged to reach for their aspirations. I have the responsibility for the appointment of nonjudicial members to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In this area, I am pleased to announce, there has been a change in the way appointments are made. The aim is to make the Administrative Appeals Tribunal membership more reflective of Australia's social diversity. In particular, we hope to see more women and people of non-English speaking background appointed to the tribunal. The new policy will ensure that all nonjudicial appointments and reappointments to the tribunal are people most suited to provide efficient, independent and responsible reviews of administrative decisions. These appointees will be required to have a clear understanding of the spirit of the Administrative Appeals Act. We will change the current appointment system by advertising in the national press what every 12 months a request for expressions of interest from persons seeking positions as non-judicial full-time or part-time membersMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Clearly, the minister is now making a comprehensive ministerial statement. You should direct him to do that after question time.",18
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is answering the question.,18
52,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The advertisements will not necessarily relate to any specific appointments to the AAT. There are so many appointments that advertising for each one would be expensive, and prohibitively so. Instead, we will generate a rolling list of potential appointees",18
53,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not like to disrupt the minister, but there is a standing order which says that you cannot announce policy during question time. I submit that, while it is very interesting to hear the Minister for Justice, it is not appropriate that he announce policy. The standing orders preclude it. I suggest that he ask for leave to make a statement after question time.",18
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is absolutely correct; I am sure the minister is aware of that. The minister will respond to the question.,18
55,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, in responding to the concerns raised by Justice Deirdre O'Connor, the appointment process will ensure that we follow an appropriate method, identifying a wider range of potential appointees. The advertisements will be part of a public proof order. cess. If it appears that the list is not adequate, we will go to the public further. Reappointments will be considered on merit and performances",18

Richardson that there was a clear need to 'rationalise' the wine industry and that 'some of the smaller wineries will not sustain the tax increase'.

80,Mr LINDSAY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the - inister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (3.01 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 (1993) and Excise Tariff Proposal No.3 (1993). The customs and excise tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. The alterations contained in these proposals operate on and from 1 September 1993. They give effect to the government's decision to increase the excise rate of duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.264c per litre, as announced in the federal budget on 17 August. These changes will enable the Civil Aviation Authority to recover part of the cost of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 (1993) also contains an alteration to include Eritrea in schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. This follows Australia's fonnal recognition of Eritrea as an independent country on 4 - ay 1993. Prior to this date, Eritrea was part of Ethiopia. The inclusion of Eritrea in schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act accords that country the full benefits of the Australian system of tariff preferences. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 In Committee Consideration resumed from 18 August.",22
81,Ms MOYLAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We have a government that is generous when it comes to guilt-speak, in damning the alleged misdeeds of our forefathers, and one that can describe a mean and deceitful budget as doing the decent thing. But it is strikingly lacking in compassion and in basic understanding when it comes to the 100,000 retired Australians who have invested in shares. The facts are breathtakingly simple. From next month pensions stand to be reduced, not because the recipients have received additional income but because the paper value of their shareholdings has increased since September 1992. It matters nothing to this government that the shares may have been purchased at a higher price and that they have been registering a nominal capital loss since the date of purchase. The government has no understanding of the motivations of small investors. It proceeds on the ignorant collectivist assumption that the stock market is a giant lottery where the punters scan the newspapers for the right moment to seize a windfall capital gain. It does not wish to understand that so many Australian shareholders have no interest in speculative gains but hold shares in blue-chip industrial companies that provide them with a fairly steady and modest dividend income. Such investors are often likely to sell their shares only in the event of a takeover, and to them the whole question of nominal gains and losses is an irrelevance. . This government is striking a blow against a prudent fonn of self-provision. If nest eggs are not invested in shares, the alternative of putting money out at interest exposes retirees to massive fluctuations caused by government manipulation of interest rates. There is clearly something wrong in combining a steady income with the protection, rather than the windfall enhancement, of the original capital. This government apparently does not want retirees to retain capital. Shares in reputable companies are one of the safest fonns of saving, but one that apparently is to be denied to elderly Australians who may require additional income support from social security. There is a massive inconsistency in a government that proclaims the virtue of superannuation as a fonn of retirement income and then introduces policies that penalise effective and responsible saving. Yet with the habitual changing of superannuation rules, the increasing propensity of this Labor government to tax fund income and· the removal of incentives for private superannuation, we can ask why Australians should not be lowed alternative means of self-provision. Savings in a blue-chip company may well be more secure than in a superannuation fund whose trustees are subject to less rigorous obligations than company directors, and where underperformance and insolvency can be real possibilities. The standard, slipshod defence of this mean ment. attack on retirees' savings is that those with substantial resources should not receive public assistance. Why is it then that, of the 100,000 pensioners affected by this move, only 1,500 have shareholdings valued in excess of $100,000 and their removal from the pension system will save only $5 million? It is hallmark of a government that knows it made a bad decision, but lacks the courage admit its mistake and return a measure of social justice to the pension income test, that it should reduce the rate of pension withdrawp.m.)-I al by SOC rather than by each dollar of unrealSocial ised gain. Jt is a supposed compromise that admits error but does not alter the basic problem. simply illustrates that the government the courage of its own convictions. How ironic also that this very budget, which will fund recurrent spending by selling $1.5 billion of Commonwealth Bank of Australia shares, in effect is saying that elderly Australians, who may possibly require some kind of Social pension assistance, need not apply. Indeed, this Labor government wants to confine share ownership to the rich and to the corporate sector. We may ask just how successful privatisation share floats will prove the savings of older Australians are excluded. Retired people need and deserve a degree of certainty in the management of income. many people in the Pearce electorate who are affected by the legislation on unrealised gains understandably seek to remove the problem by selling all their shares. They cannot afford the risk that they will at some stage face serious pension reduction caused by a sharper than expected revaluation of their shares. The action of the government is, in short, guaranteed to encourage all affected retirees to abandon the stock market altogether. The consequence will be that the realised capital alwill produce only meagre interest income when invested, and stands to be rapidly eroded by the new round of inflation that the government has now unleashed. A further consequence will be a sharp reduction in the total of 15.5 per cent of Australian adults who own shares. Perhaps this will satisfy some atavistic bigotry in the ranks of the governThe retired people that I represent and those from right across Australia have made it clear by their unprecedented interest in the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs that they do not see why, as prudent savers, they should be punished by an a ignorant and uncaring government. This has government for once should listen to the to people and the more enlightened members of its own backbench and repeal this injustice.",22
82,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"MCPherson) (3.11 will enter into this debate on the Security Legislation Amendment Bill for, I assume, the last time. I do so because I am still hopeful that the government may, It even at this late stage, change its mind about lacks this iniquitous legislation. Mr Andrew-You're an optimist.",23
83,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, I would have to be something of an optimist, having confronted the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Security (Mr Sciacca) in this chamber so many times over the last few months. Mr Ruddock-They are. changing their minds on a few things now.",23
84,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the shadow minister if says, government members are changing their minds about many things. I am hopeful that perhaps the deal that they have done with the So Australian Democrats in the Senate with respect to the budget may include a change to this particular legislation. I am wondering whether we are wasting our time here and the parliamentary secretary is in fact going to get a up and announce a government backdown on this particular measure. He is not giving any indication of that. The points that were made by my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan) are absolutely correct. In recent days I have spoken to many pensioners in my electorate who have small share holdings and my advice to them, both as a member of parliament and as an accountant, is that they really have no option but to sell their shares. That was the advice,the parliamentary secretary gave when he interjected on me in a previous debate. My advice, without exception, to those to whom I have spoken who are looking at their financial circumstances is that they ought to sell those shares. They clearly cannot afford to take the risk of hanging onto shares, not knowing which way .they are going to move. I have demonstrated the inequity of it to parliamentary secretary time after time in my contributions to this debate. I have pointed out to him that,. with almost all of the bluechip shares prior to the operative date that government is going to base the unrealised capital gain calculation on, which is 23 September 1992;Mr Sciacca-Some of their shares.",23
85,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary says they should sell 'some of their shares'. I am saying that because most of them have only small portfolios they will have to sellall of their shares. The parliamentary secretary has not yet given me a satisfactory explanation to another matter. I pointed out that many of the people who bought shares in Westpac or any of the major banks or the blue-chip industries did so in 1989-90 when they were at very low values and many have lost money on their shares. The mechanism that the government put in place to take account of this unrealised capital gain effectively shows in some way that they have made a gain, but they have not. I have never had a satisfactory explanation of that. The crunch will come for the governmentI wonder whether. the parliamentary secretary has done this calculationwhen the savings that the government says it will make from this iniquitous and obnoxious legislation do not eventuate. Has the parliamentary secretary been advised lately of what will happen? Let me tell him what will happen: when pensioners sell their shares the projected savings will not eventuate. Many of the pensioners that have spoken to me and that have these small portfolios will sell their shares and use the money in some way by taking a vacation, buying a new car or whatever. And they will simply fall bacmore heavily into the government's social security system. Is that concept too difficult for the parliamentary secretary to wrap his mind around? On my calculations, if most of the pensioners sell their shares, as they must, then the savings over which the government has gone to all of - his trouble and caused all of this anxiety amongst pensioners with share portfolios will not eventuate . So, in the end, what the was the point of the whole exercise? I have never confronted in this place such a ridiculous and absurd provision. We have been over it almost ad nauseam and we do not seem to the have got the message throQgh, that this is something that is just wrong-it is completely wrong. The government is not justifying why pensioners should now be·singled out as a group of people in Australia that cannot hold shares. Why would a pensioner who does not hold shares now go out into the stock market and buy shares? When the shares in Qantas, for example, are floated, why would a pensioner risk buying them? Pensioners are now the only people in Australia who will not be able to own shares in public companies. As I pointed out, they will be able to own shares in private companies but not in public companies. What is the answer to that? We have never had a satisfactory answer to that. How far does one extend this obnoxious principle of taking into account unrealised gains on anything as income? This was never an argument about the assets test. I accept that if a pensioner or anyone else has shares as an - set and those shares go up in value then that should form part of the assets test. We have never had any argument about that. But time and time again I have asked the government how it can regard unrealised capital gains as income for the purposes of the income test.",24
86,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It is absolutely immoral.,24
87,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is immoral. For the umpteenth time, let me pose the question: if a pensioner has this unrealised-underlined, emphasised, in italics-gain and loses part of the pension, how does he or she pay the bills? The answer that the parliamentary secretary gave me last time is that the pensioner sells some of his or her shares. That, of course, just points out how obnoxious this particular legislation is. Even at this last minute, I that the government may yet change its mind. The argument that this will have a dreadful effect on the stock market does not hold water. Obviously not enough shares are involved to have any effect. But I want to make it perfectly clear on record here, as we now apparently get to the end of this debate, that all the pensioners I have spoken to-and there have been many of them-and who have outlined their circumstances to me, will sell their shares before 23 September 1993, within the next few weeks.· That will not create a huge flurry of activity but that is what will happen. I want the government to stand condemned. This may have been a complex issue for many people in Australia but this issue is one on which the government ought to stand condemned. It has picked on pensioners. It has said that pensioners should not hold shares. I pose the final question, the one I have asked time and time again: where will the government stop as far as pensioners are concerned in respect of unrealised capital gains? If the government wants to take into account increases in a pensioner's share portfolio, will it stop at the pensioner's home? Mr Ruddock-Antique clocks.",24
88,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the shadow minister says, antique clocks. Where will the government stop? Cars? The principle here is so obnoxious that it potentially extends into other areas of pensioners' assets. The government has argued against that, saying that there is no market for homes or antique clocks. But there is a market for everything. Will the government force pensioners to go out and have their homes revalued each year? Is the government against the pensioners that live in my electorate who have nice homes? Does the government object to their owning those homes? Does the government want those pensioners to sell those homes and go and live off the proceeds in a caravan park? Ultimately, the whole thing is fundamentally flawed. The government is encouraging people to save, but this is a totally anti-saving piece of legislation. I have a lot of self-funded retirees in my electorate. People who have hope been prudent during their working lives and managed to gain some assets are being forced by government policy into using those assets in their retirement. The government does not want people who have worked hard to be able to hand on something to their children. At this last minute I implore the government to reconsider this most obnoxious piece of legislation.",25
89,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (3.20 p.m.)-After I have given those opposite every opportunity to make .the same speeches that they have made over and over again, I will cover the nest egg argument when I close the debate. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) has said the same thing, day in and day out, every time he has taken part in this debate. That is fine. The government has never had the intention of including the family home within the assets test-that is pure scaremongering on the part of the opposition. With the greatest respect to the honourable member for MCPherson, he should know better than to make people concerned about something that does not apply. I have had the guts to admit that I am not a financial planner. The honourable member for MCPherson is not a financial planner and, if he is an accountant, he does not know much about financial planning. So many financial p-anners in the community are publicly saying to pensioners who have got shares, 'Don't necessarily go out and sell all your shares. Have a look at it'. Conveniently, the honourable member for MCPherson does not say that a pensioner couple can earn $76 per week-something like $3,500 per year, which is a fair bit of income when we are talking about small shareholders-before they lose any entitlement to the pension. But the honourable member for MCPherson is making it sound as if everybody should run out and sell their shares. That is not only bad advice, but it is wrong advice, and he should not be saying that. If he is really concerned about those people in his electorate-indeed in the Australian community-he should at least tell the truth.",25
90,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I come into this debate very late, but I have made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary to the - inister for Social Security. The question I ask is: who got this so badly wrong? I have asked government members about their attitudes and their representations on this matter, and I have not yet found one who agrees with the proposition. While I admire the parliamentary secretary's very spirited defence of the impossible situation that has now arisen, I ask that question. I think I know the answer. The government today comprises too many bureaucrats who have not got enough to do, and they are thinking up new ways of getting into the public purse. Apparently, this is a novel idea. In view of compliance and implementation costs it is going to be a detrimental or negative factor. The parliamentary secretary has just mentioned those to whom this applies. Fair enough. I would suggest that most people who presently have shares are already earning $76 and are picking up a part pension. Any change or addition to that income by a notional income which is going to spring from this valuation of shares is going to reduce their income by $1 for every $2 of that notional income. That is significant. Let me give an idea of how notional that income is .. I have a small parcel of shares which,. at the beginning of this year, were worth half what they are listed at now. By this time next year they are likely to be back to where they started-that is the nature of the value of the shares. The wretched part is that there is no retrospectivity. In this year, we have a notional income because of an increase in the value of those shares, we will be denied the income we would nonnally have got for this year. In the next year, if the shares shrink back to their previous level, we will get no increase in the pension over and above the pension which we had before. This smacks of other inequitable taxes which are quite unfair .and which do not continue the system of taxation we have had in this country for so long. But one can expect it from a government that introduced the fringe benefits tax. I really mean that. In this country there has been no more iniquitous tax than the fringe benefits tax, which has affected the employment of many people. As I have said, this new tax is a penalty on employment. This manner of assessment will also have an adverse impact on savings. Within the currency of this bill a report has been presented in this parliament from Vince FitzGerald suggesting to us that Australians are poor savers and that we are going backwards at a fast rate of knots; yet we are now to implement this tax. A previous speaker had the courtesy of saying that it probably will not impact very much on savings, but when one has a very small savings base such as we have in Australia any impact is a bad impact. The parliamentary secretary said something about accountants in connection with financial planning, and I come to their defence. People have asked me, as an accountant and as a parliamentarian, what they should do. I have been giving them the hope that, come the budget, the government would see the error of its way and reverse the situation. But that has not happened. The only advice I can give these people is that they should sell those shares before they come up for valuation. That appears to me to be the only safe thing to do. The government is asking them to bail out of what is a very essential part of Australia's savings strategy. The government is asking them to bail out of an income capacity, where imputation is within the dividend structure, into an investment structure of an interest rate on which tax will be payable. There again is another anomaly: people not on the pension if are taxed at a much higher rate than those who are on the pension in connection with the same type of income. This is an iniquitous piece of legislation. I cannot believe that even the Australian Labor Party would have picked this tax up, from its own knowledge and out of its own think-tank, to penalise a section of Australians which is already being penalised. I have mentioned that young people are being denied employment because of the fringe benefits tax. I suggest that older people, who are the most sensitive and who require a lot of assistance, are being penalised at the other end of the scale. I have been a member of this House for a very long time, and we have often talked in here about social justice. Social justice, particularly the type of social justice the Labor Party espouses, is not the province solely of the Labor Party. In this budget the government is requiring people in need-a very susceptible part of our citizenry-to pay their optical expenses. We are denying that as a basic right of - edicare. That is as offensive as the fringe benefits tax and this tax we are debating here. We must also consider the unintended consequences-or should I say the intended consequences-of this legislation. An already very small area of savings, which is very important to Australia, will diminish. People will be forced to plan their affairs so that they will arrive at a pensionable age-not selfsufficient as we have been trying to get them to be-dependent on the pension. It is a catch-22 situation where there will be no assistance whatsoever. These people are vulnerable. I have heard here some very good speeches. The honourable member for Wide Bay (- Truss) has been ever alert to the problems involved with this legislation. I am pretty sure that he has written to the parliamentary secretary. Mr Sciacca-He hasn't heard what you said.",26
91,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"He heard what I said, and I think the parliamentary secretary also heard what he said in this debate. I do the parliamentary secretary the courtesy of saying that he is trying to support an insupportable proposition because he is a member of the Labor Party and of this government. Nevertheless, this measure will go downas slight as its effect might be on a lot of vulnerable people-as a miserable and vicious piece of legislation that attacks the very people who cannot afford to be attacked and who need our support more than anyone else. There are a lot of problems in this area, as has been demonstrated in the Senate by the minority and opposition parties. If ever there was a need for people to listen, it is on an occasion like this.",27
92,Mr TRUSS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I support the amendments put forward by the coalition to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. In doing so, I confront the parliamentary secretary with a very obvious message: these proposals are not loved by the Australian pensioner community; they are not supported by financial advisers; they are not supported by virtually any editorial writer in the country; they are not supported by any of the pensioners organisations; they are even not supported by his own colleagues. The government benches are even emptier this evening than they were on the night of the opposition's response to the budget. The parliamentary secretary cannot find anybody willing to back him. I note the presence of the honourable member for Herbert (-r Lindsay) who, as a man interested in the welfare of veterans, will also be concerned about the contents of this particular proposal because these measures affect veterans as well as social security pensioners. Anyone with any concern for the people who have served their country would also be concerned about the proposal that the government is putting forward to include the unrealised capital gain on shares in the income test. If tht} parliamentary secretary needs to be convinced that there is a great deal of opposition to what he is proposing, I refer him to events in the House last Thursday morning when a large number of petitions were presented to this parliament, all of which opposed the measures that his government is planning to introduce. I presented one of the petitions-I think there were eight others which all clearly - emonstrated the depth of public feeling on this matter. The petitioners submitted that the government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act should be abandoned. The petitioners noted that the majority of Australians regard the proposed method of calculating unrealised capital gains and losses as unfair and inequitable. It is clearly beyond dispute that the method of calculating unrealised capital gain is unjust. As previous speakers have pointed out, in many instances shares will be assessed as having earned a capital gain even when, in reality, they are worth less than the purchase price. Even though pensioners have lost money on their investment, their pension will be stopped on the basis of an unrealised capital gain. Any system with that kind of result must be regarded as unfair-but it is worse than that. The government devised a very complicated formula which accentuates the impact of any capital gain. It is not even a fair game. It has devised a scheme that multiplies the disadvantage. The unrealised capital gain is assessed as part of the income test-but so are the real earnings on the shares. It is perfectly fair for the real gain-the actual earnings-to be included in the income test, just as it is perfectly fair to include the capital gain in assets test. What is unfair and unconscionable about this whole exercise is that the unrealised capital gain is counted twice. The government is double counting so that it can limit people's pension entitlements. The second point that the petitioners raised was that the implementation of this measure would have a deleterious effect on national savings and investments of pensioners and veterans. Again, surely that point is beyond dispute. As the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) pointed out, building up a national savings strategy is essential to the future economic well-being of this nation. Our country is ageing. I was interested in some statistics I saw the other day which pointed out that the number of people in Australia over the age of 80 has increased by 114 per cent in the last two decades. An increasing number of Australians will become social security beneficiaries and be dependent on the age pension. That number will increase as the years go by. The commitment and the obligation of the government to meet those social security payments will grow year in year out. There is universal agreement across the nation that we need to be undertaking measures which will encourage personal savings and which will encourage people to put aside for their own retirement so that they do not have to depend upon government and taxpayers to meet their retirement incomes. That principle is well established and well agreed. This measure does precisely the opposite. It penalises those who have taken care of their own retirement and those who have tried to get the maximum possible return from their investments so that they rely less on their fellow Australians in their retirement. This measure, therefore, is totally in conflict with, and totally contradictory to, the rhetoric of the government; totally contrary to the recommendations made by every economic adviser in the country; and totally in conflict with what is good sense for the financial management of our country in the future. The third point that the petitioners make is that they regard the government's estimates of the cost savings as spurious. Again, that is a statement which is completely beyond dispute. The government keeps changing the estimates. Clearly, it does not have a clue how much it is going to allegedly save by implementing this measure. Many people believe that in the long term, even in the medium term, the savings there might be in 1993-94 will be offset by losses in future years. Whenever the share values decline, the government's liability for pension payments will increase. Any gains that are made in a particular year will be lost, firstly, as a result of pensioners selling off their shares and becoming permanently dependent upon the social security system; and, secondly, further down the track, any pensioners who retain any shareholdings will, when the value of those shareholdings drops, develop an entitlement to a pension where none existed before. That will have an impact on future budgets. I would have thought that a government that is interested in risk management would want to reduce its liability for pensions at times when its own income is low. Of course, when shre values drop, the government's income \\ til drop as well. That will be just at a time when it ""ill have to pay more pensioners. The logic of whatever the government is attempting to achieve in this regard has escaped all of the petitioners who put their names to the many petitions presented to the parliament on the last sitting Thursday.. It certainly escaped the notice of the contributors to this debate, pensioner organisations, veterans organisations and all of those who are likely to be affected by this proposal. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) has taken over from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who has taken a little relief from battering he continues to get on this particular issue. I feel some degree of sorrow for him. I am told that Queensland has battled to get much of a say on the government benches. He was touted as one of those who may have some kind of ministerial ambitions, but the government has certainly sold him a rotten egg on this one. He is being asked to carry something that none of the government ministers are prepared to carry themselves. They are palming. it on to a poor, lonely Queenslander. His electorate is surrounded by many pensioners who will be affected by this measure. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, in his rebuttal the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), went to great lengths to point out that houses are not likely to be affected by this measure. That just accentuates one of the inequities of the proposal. It is true that houses, whether they are worth $100,000 or $5 million, are not taken into account in assessing pension eligibility. The· capital gain on a house could be hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year and that does not affect the pension. The capital gain on clocks or an art collection can be considerable and it will not affect the pension. But if a pensioner happens to have some shareholdings, then his pension will be affected. Of course, only shareholdings in listed companies are affected. If his shareholdings are in unlisted companies, it does not matter. This whole measure is grossly inconsistent. It targets one small group of pensioners and treats them unfairly. That is unfortunate for them, but the message that this particular proposal gives to the whole retired population is that this government does not want people to make their own arrangements for their retirement.

93,Mr CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security pointed out, a number of us have spoken on this particular issue on a number of occasions. This is the third occasion on which I .have had the opportunity to speak. It is a chance that I cannot let go by because the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill very badly affects senior the citizens in Australia; a section of our community who should be revered and respected rather than hounded from pillar to post, as is the case with this legislation. Without doubt, it is the most unfair, pernicious and mean spirited legislation to affect pensioners and many other social security recipients for a long time. This piece of legislation deals with the government's treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purposes of calculating one's pension or another social security payment. Only two weeks ago, I spoke on this issue, pleading with the government to reconsider its stance.. I know for a fact that the to honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) opposes the legislation. He said so in a letter to the .Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) .. The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) also spoke two weeks ago-I was in. this chamber whilst she spokesuggesting the legislation was unfair. In fact, she said: During the recent parliamentary recess I, like every member of this house, was visited by many pensioners who were very worried about the impact upon their pensions of recent changes to the assessment of shares and their value. I confess to some serious disquiet over this matter. Let me repeat one of the points made by the honourable member for Lowe: I confess to some serious disquiet over this matter.",29
94,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I'll bet she won't cross the floor. MrCAMERON-She did not. I suggest to most government members that if they had an ounce· of compassion in their blood they would also be suffering more than just 'serious disquiet' over the issue. This legislation, for a start, defies logic. It assumes pensioners who own shares which rise in price have earned more when in fact they have not earned, one extra cent. Under this legislation, it is assumed that pensioners have earned more and their pensions are subsequently cut. Another comment by the honourable member for Lowe, which I endorse, is her claim that the office of every member has been contacted by concerned pensioners who are, quite frankly, worried sick about this issue. I am sure that every member of this House has had elderly Australians in tears in their offices GAINS over this ridiculous legislation. One such gentleman to whom I spoke last week is a constituent of mine named Reg. He asked me how he would survive, considering that his next eight pension cheques would all have to go towards paying his electricity bill. His pension was cut to $30. He earns $30 per week, down from $156.05 per week. While this legislation may assume he earns more, his gain is only notional, as we all know. We have all argued this point over and over again. He does not have one extra cent in his pocket. Indeed, as I say, he is now considerably out of pocket because of this legislation. As I said when I spoke on this matter recently, pensioners are being penalised for notional gains, but notional gains do not buy groceries or petrol or pay for insurance. Notional gains are absolutely worthless. They are certainly not paying this man's electricity bills. It is only when pensioners sell their shares that they get money and that is the only time they should be assessed. The present situation is an absolute sham. I also mention another gentleman who has contacted my office. His name is Keith. He bought two packages of the same shares about six weeks ago. This shows how ridiculous and unthought-out this whole legislation is. He bought one lot of shares at 25c and the other at 24c. The shares are now valued at 23c. Over the last six weeks, Keith has' actually made a loss on these shares. How does the Department of Social Security view this? It assumes he bought the shares 12 months ago-which is when it takes them into account for accounting purposes-for 5c because that is what the shares were worth at the time, and that he has made a profit of 18c and 19c per share, which he obviously has not. The fact is that he made a loss, his pension is now going to be cut, he will be out of pocket and he has no other form of income. This is totally ridiculous. I would like to quote directly from a letter written by a constituent to me, the Minister for Social Security, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins): Dear Sir, RE: PENSIONS AND UNREALISED CAPITAL It is with great anger and bitterness that I write to you with respect to the above. Because of the ""Catch 22"" situation you have created, I have been forced to sell my small share holdings, no doubt to overseas owners, and in so doing you have attacked my human right to improve my position in life by my own means, thereby not only undermining my earning capacity but also robbing me of hope for the future and destroying my self esteem. For a group of highly paid elitists to formulate a policy that seeks to pauperise what is already the poorest section of the community, reduces the nation to the likes of an oppressive dictatorship, not a modem caring democratic society. Your cavalier remark ""let them sell some shares if they need extra income"" shows how little any of you understand the nature of capital and investment. YoU(remarks smack of Marie Antoinette and her utterance ""let them eat cake"" and we all know what happened to her! You beseech people daily to save for the good of the nation, yet what earthly incentive would any one have to invest in Australia when your ultimate plan is to claw back the growth in the investment. The whole purpose of the exercise is to create a dividend stream, which I accept is reasonable to adjust for pension purposes, and capital growth in order to defend the value against inflation. I do not have superannuation and in any case it would be hard for anyone to plan around that concept as your government has, so far, over the last decade managed to alter those rules on an average once every eight weeks. Who could plan on that basis? Just for the record, having sold my shares, I have used the proceeds purchasing goods, mostly imported, that I was previously happy to do without as I purchased greater independence by investing in shares. Therefore in one move I have helped to swell the B.O.P. problem, destroyed what little capital I had, and will now be eligible for a full pension. In one fell swoop you have managed to .increase the welfare burden and chip away at the capital base of the nation. Well done! Unfortunately, I was one of those, who whim faced with a difficult choice at the polls, opted for your government because I believed you were a compassionate force in the land and compassion must be the basis for a civilised society. However, I see now I was mistaken and your vicious attack on a defenceless minority combined with your budget strategy forces me to the conclusion - hat I gO.t it wrong. One does not make the same mistake tWice. In conclusion, I implore our Democrat colleagues in the Senate, if they have an ounce of integrity about them, to look very closely at this matter. As they are in the business at the moment of doing' some deals with the government, let us see them do a deal that will help a small section of Australians who are being severely disadvantaged by this measure. I implore our Democrat colleagues in the Senate to keep the born-out-ofwedlocks honest.",29
95,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bow'man-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (3.48 p.m.)-I want to make a couple of quick comments. I have heard the. argument of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). It has been the same argument. I think they have got up at least twice in this debate alone, and that is fine. But the reason a lot of people are frightened is the very accusations and the misleading information that those opposite are putting out. The fact is that only five per 'cent of the total pensioner population is going to be in any way affected by these measures; 95 per cent of the total pensioner population will not be affected. Yet the hysteria that is being whipped up by some members of the opposition-' Mr Ruddock-Did you say 'yet'?",31
96,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Berowra knows exactly what I said. What I said was 'yet'; in other words, 'still'. The honourable member for Berowra knows full well what I meant by that. What I am saying is that, nevertheless, those opposite are still trying to scare pensioners as much as they possibly can by somehow implying. that just about everyone is going to be affected-or at least avast majority of pensioners are going to be affected. The reality is that out of some 2.1 million pensioners, and approximately 400,000 people in receipt of DVA entitlements, only 100,000 will be affected. That must be taken into consideration. What is the difference-I have made this point very clearly--,between having $150,000 in the bank earning the present deemed interest rate of four per cent, or whatever it is now, and having $90,000 in ,the bank and $110,000 worth of shares? One personbecause the money is in the fonn of shares and that person is able to disguise the earning capacity of those shares-can receive a full pension, whereas the person who has the lesser amount in the bank can receive only a part pension. Honourable members might nod as much as they like; they know full well that that is the truth. A lot of people out there are concerned. A lot of them have justified concerns because many believe what the opposition says to them.> It is not just 100,000 people who will be affected, some in a very small way; but it is also all the other people. It was the same old story when we brought in the assets test, the deeming. The opposition was out there saying all sorts of silly things. Once the assets test was bedded down, people realised that the vast majority of them were not affected. I wanted to make those points because, frankly, I can appreciate that the opposition is trying to make some political capital out of this. I can understand that, but it should at least be fair about that. It should at least tell the truth. It should at least not make political capital out of this by scaring that vast majority of the pensioner population when the opposition knows Jull well that that population will not be affected.",31
97,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I rise to make .a few comments .in relation to this debate .on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I congratulate the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on moving the amendments. lthink that in years to come the honourable member will be seen as a national hero on' the part of pensioners. Those members and senators who supported these changes will also be seen by many pensioners around the country as heroic in their actions. The position is quite clear, as the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) commented in his third address-and it is no accident that he was in here three times talking about this legislation. He properly represents the social security recipients, the pensioners, in his electorate by coming in here and making sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security hears the arguments enough times to try to persuade him to change his mind, to get the government to support those amendments, or to repeal the legislation. There are a couple of matters I wanted to raise. In the first instance, I mention the meeting that was held in Perth at the YWCA in Wellington Street on 30 July. It was a very big meeting and it was organised by me, the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans). I have already commented on the superb representation made by the honourable member for Stirling. I add also that those pensioners who reside in the electorate of·Stirling now get the sort of representation that they sadly missed for 10 years-or, in the case of the electorate of Cowan, since 1984 when the seat was created in the redistribution of Western Australian electorates. I think that there is a great deal of cause hope in those electorates now that the people are getting representation by their federal members who understand the feelings of the large numbers of pension recipients. Those people who are self-funded retirees, because of the decline in their incomes thanks to the drop in the interest rate, now face the prospect of applying for pensions. They may have share investments and may find themselves caught by the changes that were brought in as a result of the legislation introduced by the government last year. We see some instances where they are still suffering a net capital on the value of their shares since they purchased them. Notwithstanding that fact, because of the arrangements between September last year and September this year, any capital gain that may have accrued in the last 12 months will mean a commensurate decline in their pensions. I would like to let the parliament know the views of the people who attended the meeting at the YWCA on 30 July, who are affected by this legislation, and who met as a result of the initiative on my part and on the part of the honourable member for Cowan and the honourable member for Stirling. Because there was not to be a public hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in Perth, we decided that we would have our own hearing. At the conclusion of that meeting, certain motions were unanimously passed by those present. Mr Sciacca-Of course!",31
98,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security says, 'Of course'. He is trying to suggest that somehow we put together a clique of people at this meeting to come in and support the position that we had taken. We invited everybody who was interested in this particular issue to come along. It is no coincidence that the people who came along were obviously affected by this legislation. Something that interested and impressed me was the fact that the room was filled a quarter of an hour before the meeting started. There was standing room only; \ye had to get some more chairs because so many people were coming in. There was absolutely no question of how for they felt about the intent of the government. They did not see this as some means of reducing the burden on the taxpayer that pensions present. They saw it as another means of the government putting its fingers in the pockets of those people who have taken the trouble to save for their own retirement. Some pensioners now wonder why they bothered. Every time people seem to save a little money for their retirement, one can bet one's money that the government has its fingers in their pockets and takes it away from them. If it does not take the money loss away from them, it withdraws the other benefits to which they believed they were entitled as they were making those meagre savings during their years prior to retirement. I have no qualms about supporting the comments made by the honourable member for Stirling, who said that this was mean spirited, iniquitous legislation. I add. that it is in fact immoral. When the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) talked about assessing the unrealised capital gain of a person's residence and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security pooh-poohed the idea as being some sort of pie in the sky measure that would never happen, I bet that 10 years ago many people would never have believed in their wildest dreams that the federal government would assess the unrealised capital ga-ns on shares that they held. We know, as many pensioners told us, that in one 12-month period they may enjoy a gain on their shares, and they will then get the reduction in their pension income. But, in the next 12 months if they suffer a net loss on their shares, do they get a make up of the income they lost in the previous 12 months? Of course they do not. They lose both ways. Hence, it adds to the immorality of this dreadful legislation that affects so many decent and upstanding members of the pensioner community-people who believed all through their working lives that to save, to put away money for their retir-ment was something to be commended and admired. Now they find themselves at a loss as a result of taking the trouble to save for their own retirement. As the honourable member for Stirling and others have mentioned, why do people bother to save under these circumstances? Is it a surprise that this country has a savings crisis? Of course it is not. The very sections of the community one would expect to save for their retirement, in other words to contribute to national savings, are being hounded from pillar to post. The federal government has its fingers in their pockets at every stage. I point out that at the meeting in Perth the people resolved unanimously: That this meeting condemns legislation affecting pensions by the assessment of notional capital gains on shares and managed investments as income as both unfair and abhorrent, and urges that the legislation be repealed. That the principle of assessment of unrealised capital gains is immoral, and a disincentive to those who attempt to provide for their own future. That the criteria for costings for implementation of this legislation is wrong, and will become a net cost to taxpayers. That this legislation is a powerful disincentive to growth in the Australian share market, and will affect future recovery of the economy. I think that the sentiments of these people from Perth who were affected by the federal government's legislation is driven resoundingly home. Peter Thornhill of the Perpetual Trustees group commented that the proposed policy presented a basic misunderstanding of investment in the share market. In other words, the federal government does not even have its intent right. The intent does not match the nature or the trends in share market investment by pensioners. As Peter Thornhill mentioned in the article written by Barrie Dunstan-I commend Barrie Dunstan and the Australian Financial Review for his campaign against this iniquitous legislation-this is off the mark. It makes a misrepresentation of the share market as being a capital gains issue on the part of pensioners. It is not. It is an income issue. Pensioners should look to their investment portfolios and the potential effects of this legislation on those portfolios and seek expert advice. I make no bones about this-I am sure all honourable members on this side of the chamber would agree-it is important for any pensioner who has shares and is likely to be affected by this legislation to get expert financial assistance and financial advice to be able to make the correct decision at the end of the day. The parliamentary secretary lowers himself by criticising the opposition on the basis that somehow we are indulging in scaremongering. That is wrong. People are worried about the legislation and need to know exactly what it means to them. They need to get expert financial assistanc-. Because of the pledge, the parliamentary secretary must support this legislation. I was interested to hear the comments that related to the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) who has had disquiet . about this legislation. If she is disquieted by the legislation, then let her cross the floor and vote for the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), which is the decent thing to do. She should not stand on the other side of the chamber and express her disquiet about the legislation and then sit down and vote with the rest of the Labor Party. This will ensure that the iniquitous provisions of the legislation are rammed home to pensioners who have shares:",32
99,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sodal Security) (4.01 p.m.)-Firstly, we keep hearing about the effect this measure will have on national savings. We do not hear that the value of the total market capitalisation of pensioners with shares is of the order of 0.3 of one per cent or even less. That is the effect this measure will have on national savings. Secondly, I can certainly appreciate and understand the sincerity and the concern of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) and the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan), who have spoken previously. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) all voted for this measure last year. They piously stood in this chamber with all their emotiveness, but the fact is that each and every one of them, including the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), voted for this measure and supported it. I think the public should know that.",34
100,Mr VAILE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the. opportunity to speak again on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I was not in the parliament last year when this matter was voted on and I certainly would have had grave concerns about the legislation then, as I do now. In my electorate of Lyne in the mid-north coast of New South Wales about 40 per cent of the population has retired. A large percentage of those people will be affected by this legislation. I would like to bring to the attention of the few government members in the chamber some statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on social security. It is a much hackneyed phrase on social justice that we hiwe been hearing the government rabbit on about since the parliament resumed after the election. The Government said, 'We had the issues for social justice, you didn't. We are looking after these social justice issues'. The Prime Minster said: The final measure of how successful a nation we are will always be how well we care for each other. For us, economic policy will always be the servant of a greater goal-greater opportunity, greater care, greater social justice. Social justice remains at the centre of our approach to the business and task of governing. I ask: what social justice is there in this legislative measure that is being introduced? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security has admitted that it will affect a small number of people. It will also have a small effect on the investment market and on government revenue. But it is having a large effect through the sleepless nights that it is generating for a poor, defenceless section of the community-the pensioners who fall into this category. These people have worked hard and have saved a little money; they have earned a bit of respectability. They are coming into my office every day of the week. They are concerned because it is disturbing their lives. They have retired and have made plans for their future. They own a small holding which produces a little extra income, and which saves a little for the government. They are saving so that they can hand on to their children and grandchildren. And the government wants to attack that. When I last addressed the parliament a fortnight ago, I said that these people are not the high flyers. They do not have enormous share portfolios, such as the people whom the government may be trying to get at. They are just average people in the street who are trying to get on with the rest of their lives in peace and quiet. They are not allowed to do that as they are worried about what will happen to them. All they can do about it is to sell their complete shareholding and give the money away, spend it, go on a trip or buy a car, which is of no advantage to Australia. We have been told that the opposition has been stirring up the ire of this community group. Mr Sciacca-You have.",34
101,Mr VAILE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We have not. Mr Sciacca-Yes, you have.",34
102,Mr VAILE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We have not. A committee of inquiry has been set up to gauge the feeling of the community on this issue. I am spending an enormous amount of my time in my electorate helping people to understand what will happen on 23 September, how they will deal with it and how the Department of Social Security will deal with them. I have a document with me, which I refer to on a daily basis, and which helps me to explain these measures to the people that are concerned about this legislation, particularly the calculation itself. These people are average Australians. They are in the twilight of their lives and they have difficulty understanding anything put together by parliamentary draftsmen. I have a number of questions and answers available for people in my electorate. They come into my office, throw their hands in the air and ask, 'What are we going to do about this? What is the government trying to do to us? Why is the government making this a nightmare for us?'. To these people this is the only security they have. They are dependent on the taxpayer for their pension. They have a little extra security to help pay their electricity bill, phone bill, rates and to register their car. That is all they do with this money. They are not going on overseas trips with the extra income they get from their investments in share portfolios. They ask, 'How will the Department of Social Security calculate how much income is being earned by my shares?'. We have the calculation, which is as simple as we can make it, but it is still difficult for a lot of these to understand. Their concern is not so much what they are going to lose, but how to understand it. They just want to know what is going on. They also ask, 'If I make a loss on one parcel of shares, will I be able to offset this against gains on my other shares?'. The answer is, 'Yes. Social Security works out how much income all your shares and managed investments have returned. This amount can be positive or negative depending on how well each investment has done. Negative amounts-that is, losses-can be deducted from the total amount of income from your shares and managed investments. The following example explains how it works'. That is a complicated explanation of how that does work. I am not necessarily stirring up the argument in my electorate, I am trying to help my constituents understand what they will be faced with in September when they have to make a balanced d-ision on what they will do with their share portfolio. This is directly opposite to what we should believe and what we should be supporting in this country: getting people to invest rather than spend. For the last 10 to 15 years we have been on a spending binge and have not been saving. Year after year this government is providing the incentives to spend and not to save. This is just another of those incentives-to spend, to get rid of your assets and to bring people down to the lowest common denominator so that the government has control of their pocket, their thinking and, ultimately, the control of their vote. That is what it is all about. When the government talks about social justice issues it does not care that this is a nightmare for this section of the community. It is only a very small percentage of the community, but they are real people. Many people who voted for the government in March this year have told me that they are never going to vote for it again because of these issues and what it has done in the budget. They are real people whom the government said it cared for. We do not believe it cares people for them. I will never believe it when members of the government start rabbiting on with a lot of nonsense about 'We have the social justice agenda by the throat'. They havethey are choking it. They are boring it into the poor people in this community who need the support and understanding of the government in these hard economic times. They are trying to alleviate the burden on taxpayers. All the government wants to do is get them by the throat and squeeze the last little drop of blood out of them. We have to roll this over for the sake of that small percentage of the community that does not deserve to be treated this way.",35
103,Mr NEVILLE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Hinkler) (4.11 p.m.)""-I have only a short contribution to make to this debate. Most of the things that need to be said have been said. However, I must reiterate that to reduce pensions because of unrealised capital gain on shares is iniquitous. How the governrnent could have arrived at that decir sion I do not know. As other speakers have said, it is easy to understand that government members have become the playthings of their bureaucrats. It is interesting that such people as the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) expressed their disquiet. I wonder whether they will see this legislation as a rare act of bastardry as well. I would like to take the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security up on a few points. He said that of the 2.1 million Australians who receive pensions and the 400,000 who receive veterans pensions only 100,000 are affected. As if we can dismiss 100,000 Australians and it just does not matter! Some 100,000 Australians, who worked their little tails off to build up their share portfolios, who were selfsufficient, who wanted to provide for part of their retirement, who did the decent and honourable thing that most Australians have always wanted to do-to be self-sufficient in their retirement-will have their shares eroded as if by a cancer. Every time bills get beyond them because their pensions have been cut back-electricity bills; car registration and the things we have heard of this afternoonthey will sell off a few more shares. For people in their 60s, 70s and 80s to have to do that is very demoralising. What the parliamentary secretary is saying is, 'We can demoralise 100,000 Australians. We can afford to let them be the playthings of bureaucrats, let their lifestyle drop, use them as a tool to raise a bit of money for the government and erode their pensions and at the end of the day they will have to cop it or become ordinary pensioners'. As the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) said, those people will become totally dependent on the government and the plaything of its political agenda. If what the honourable member for Lyne said was not enough, there is ample eviqence of it in the budget. Members of the governrnent have expressed disquiet that retirees who have holiday pay and long service leave outstanding will be taxed at a higher rate. Taxing those people and putting them out to retirement on a lower income than they might otherwise have had will make them dependent on the governrnent. The other thing the parliamentary secretary said was that we are trying to help these people disguise their earning capacity. I do not think anyone is trying to do that. Shares are listed every day on the stock exchange and the listings are in the newspaper. The interesting thing is that, although one would think that the government, with its sense of fair play, would allow any loss in pension to be an adjusting factor, it has not. Whichever way we look at this, people lose. At the time deeming was introduced the governrnent said that this would materially improve the lot of pensioners. One of the excuses used to bring in deeming was that, by earning a little on savings, pensioners would be better off and less dependent on government. If that were the case, why does the government not apply the same principle to shares? There is a total inconsistency and I cannot believe that not only the honourable members for Lowe and Fraser, but any members of the governrnent-including the parliamentary secretary who comes from one of the all middle class suburbs of Brisbane where there are a lot of retired people-could believe in their wildest dreams that that was a sincere statement. Finally, the parliamentary secretary took up the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on the point that last year members of the opposition voted for this measure. But they did so because it was tied to another bill. The governrnent did not allow the opposition to separate this matter from increases to pensions. It knew full well that to delay this matter my colleagues at that time would have had to deny pensioners a just entitlement-an increase in their pensions. It was a very cynical move of the previous governrnenl' to tie those two measures together. This afternoon the parliamentary secretary is doing the Pontius Pilate act, trying to wipe his hands of it and put it back on to the honourable member for Moore. It was the government's initiative last year as it is its initiative this year. In my electorate of Hinkler the case is no different from that in Pearce, Stirling, Moore, Wide Bay and Riverina, where there have been meetings of unbelievable numbers of pensioners-2oo, 300 or 400 people at a time-all expressing their views. Also attending those meetings have been accountants and financial planners, and not one will agree with the government's measures. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has said on countless occasions that it is fair enough to use the unrealised capital gain in assessing eligibility for pensions but that to use it as a revenue measure is purely immoral, unjust and unconscionable.",36
104,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (4.18 p.m.)-I would like to make two small points. First, no matter how those opposite try to disguise it, the fact is that they did vote this measure. Mr Ruddock-We didn't.",37
105,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"They certainly did not oppose it. If the honourable member for Hinkler(Mr Neville) had been here at that time, he would have done exactly what his colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) did; he would have voted for the measure. When we are talking about fairness, it should be put on the record that, before a pensioner couple, for instance, lose entitlement to all pension and Commonwealth fringe benefits, they can be receiving an income of up to $31,293 per annum. On top of this, they can have assets, apart from their family home, of up to $292,OOO-which the government is extending to. $338,500 in September this year. A young married couple struggling with a mortgage, car payments, education expenses for children, et cetera, would find that. quite an attractive proposition. There is no doubt that this will cause some problems for pensioners with certain types of shares. But, if those opposite are going to point that out, they should also point out that we are not talking about taking every cent of pension from people. The honourable member said that I dismissed 100,000 people; I did not. I have as much concern for those 100,000 people as the honourable member does. Those 100,000 people represent about five per cent of 2.6 million. The way opposition members are carrying on in the community about this debate, they are making it sound as though many more people than those 100,000 will be affected. If it is a question of fairness, I simply say that the measure is nowhere near as unfair as the honourable member for Berowra, who is sitting there smiling at me, says it is.",37
106,Mr NEHL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the opportunity to participate, if only very briefly, in this committee debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, who is at the table, has been talking about fairness. I agree with him on one point: it is totally unfair that he was put in here to take all of this. Where is the' Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin)? for Why is he not here to face up to it? This is cowardice of the highest order. It is about time the minister came in and faced the music himself. Members of the Australian Labor Party have been going out and scaring old people in this country for 10 years. We have talked about the assets test campaign and what government members did in the 1984 election. There has been a succession of measures when they have upset the equanimity and the peace of the retired people of Australia. Whether they be pensioners or self-funded retirees, this is just another sorry chapter in that whole process of scaring the old people. It is about time it stopped. Old people in their declining years need to be able to live in some peace and harmony and, above all, not to be continually frightened about what will happen to them. This measure is totally unjust, unfair and inequitable. Government members talk about equity. It is just a loose and idle word as far as they are concerned. They do not know what it means. There can be no equity in saying to a pensioner, 'We are going to reduce your pension because the value of a few, shares you own has gone up'. Pensioners do not actually have the money in their pockets; they have to sell their shares to get it. Nonetheless, their pensions are put down because of it. The whole philosophy of this legislation is unjust and unfair. Finally, I say to the parliamentary secretary at the table that there are no marks in comparing poverty. He said that 100,000 people is only five per cent of 2.6 million people. Whether it is 100,000 people or five per cent of 2.6 million people, that is just playing figures. All it takes is one elderly Australian who is worried sick by this and who is actually going to be hurt, lose money and be placed further down the poverty ladder. Forget about the five per cent. One person is enough. The fact that it is 100,000 people makes it that much worse. I do not think that it is appropriate tO,talk about poverty and say that young families with mortgages would think that it was okay. I do not think that is the way to go. I implore the government to change its mind about this measure. It is unfair and unjust.",37
107,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I take the opportunity this afternoon to speak in support of the amendments that I have moved to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to recapitulate what they are. The amendments seek to repeal the relevant sections in the Social Security Act that are designed to treat shares owned by pensioners and any profit that it, is suggested might be taken by any increase in value in those shares, even though they are not sold, as income for the purposes of the income test for pension eligibility. The amendments relate to shares in which any dividend is already assessed as income for the purpose of the income test and any increase in the value of the shares is already treated as an increase in the value of assets held by the pensioner should that occur. Unlike most other assets owned by pensioners where any increase in value is treated as an increase in their asset value, if they are shares that increase in value they will be treated as income, even though a person may not have sold them. So people could end up with a very substantial reduction in their income for survival purposes and left with only one option, of having to dispose of the assets, if they are going to be able to eat. That is the bottom line. It is important not to forget that that is the issue which we have been debating. The government said today that this was a measure upon which we voted to support the government when it was introduced into law. At no time did the opposition support the government on this measure. The measure was introduced as one proposal with a large number of other proposals beneficial for with pensioners. The government said, 'You can have it only as a total package. If you want to amend it to reduce or eliminate that particular part of the package, then none of it will proceed, and we will blame you, the opposition, for that'. We pledged that when this matter came forward we would review it when in office, in the expectation that we were going to win the election and be able to repeal these provisions. We promised a review. That is what happened. For the government to suggest that we are in some way tainted because of that is totally misrepresenting our position in a way which I think does the minister no credit at all. There are only a few days left for the government to relent on this matter. I want to give the minister this assurance: I will not accuse the government of capitulation. I will not accuse the government of surrendering, of giving way, of giving ground or backing down. I will not try to make that point. I would be happy just to see the pensioner community relieved of the anxieties that they are genuinely suffering. At the moment, as the government is looking at backing down, capitulating, surrendering and giving way on the budget, it is getting a lot of flack. It could just add this matter in quietly. Right now, while the budget is under review, under retreat, there is a great challenge for the government to look at this matter again. This will be a real test for the Australian Democrats. I read that the Democrats are at the moment in negotiation with the government. They do not want to be seen as budget wreckers or as undermining the budget strategy. Let me assure the Democrats that if they believe, as we do, in all the arguments that we have put that there is no money involved in this, no substantial savings, they can join us in pressing the government at this time to make the change. This ought to be one of the major initiatives on which they press the government as part of their agreeing to a deal which they are talking about with the Prime - inister (-r Keating) at this time. It will be a genuine test for the Democrats. I know that last week Senator Lees was at a substantially attended meeting in Chatswood in Sydney. She was asked by some of the people there whether the Democrats on this matter would seek to change the government's mind. She was a little equivocal. - aybe the reason she was equivocal was that they have not done the deal yet. Senator Lees and all of her colleagues have gone around tut tutting and saying, 'We were purer than the opposition on this matter'. I want to assure the Democrats that this is the time of test. It has to be one of the matters about which they treat with the government. The Parliamentary Secretary to the - inister for Social Security has been saying that no new information has been put in relation to this matter today. He seems to be a bit disappointed. I will put some new information before him. I want to remind him of what the actuaries have had to say in their submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs about savings that can be made in relation to this legislation. The government has been putting it around that it can save something in the order of $60 million to $80 million through this legislation. I want to make it very clear that when the experts-the actuaries-got onto it, they were able to say that the government was making certain assumptions that were totally unrealistsaid, ic. In the view of the actuaries, if certain alternative assumptions were put-assuming a growth rate of 18 per cent-the savings could be $40 million. But if one made an assumption, which was also a proper assumption, of a growth rate of nine per cent, the savings would fall to $21 million. The gov:"" ernment ought to be taking that into account-the amounts that can be saved are getting smaller and smaller. At question time today I was interested that the Treasurer (-r Dawkins) had the audacity to say to us all that certain assumptions need to be made in looking at budget matters. He protested that people were not making assumptions. One of the failures on the government's part in relation to this matter, which it has put to us over and over again, is that no assumptions should be made about changed behaviour when estimating possible savings. The government has put this argument over and over again. I want to make it very clear that it is a flawed view to judge that there will be no alterations in behaviour. I will say something about that because it is important in the context of some of the minister's comments today on this question of whether or not people have been advised to sell their shares. One commentator, - r Dunstan, said in the Australian Financial Review that pensioners should not rush to sell. The minister is suggesting that this is an argument that people ought to be secure in holding onto their shares and that they may not be affected. Upon reading the article, it is very clear that - Dunstan is saying that, so far as the Senate inquiry is concerned, it might result in some favourable amendments and early selling may not therefore be necessary. That is what it was arguing: 'Wait until you see the whites of their eyes before you make the judgment'. This weekend a senior officer of a public company came to me to ask for some advice on whether I thought the government was going to change its mind. I had to say, 'I don't know whether the government is going to change its mind or not. I can't tell you that. Your guess is as good as mine'. But she 'People are ringing us. They're worried about this matter. We are getting hundreds and thousands of calls about this mattershould we sell or not?'. This is a very serious matter. It is not something that has been beaten up by the opposition. People know that it is necessary for them to consider their position because of the impact that these proposals will have. I also want to take Senator Faulkner to task. He has been writing to people saying that it is surely unfair if people have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested-and these are the people who will be mostly affected-to call on taxpayers to provide them with, a full pension. What audacity, suggesting that that is the case when, on the government's own submission to the Senate inquiry, those with shares valued at over $100,000 number only 1,497; and when, on the government's own estimates, only $5 million is affected. The government needs to look at this matter again. If the parliamentary secretary wants to see some new material he should look at the comments by the Auditor-General. (Time expired)",38
108,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (4.34 p.m.)-I have listened to this debate and I have listened to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) speak on the question of what the opposition did during the last parliamentary term when it did not support the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. He said the opposition just did not vote against it because of other reasons. I will him this: it is true that the opposition only promised to review the legislation when it was in government. At no time did the opposition promise, undertake or give any guarantees that it would change the legislation; the opposition said that it would review it. Given that the Fightback document, which would have been the opposition's manifesto if it had come to government, specifically stated that a Liberal government would cut the social security budget by some $1 billion, from where would it have got the money? I put that question to the honourable member for Berowra, but I can answer it for him. The opposition only promised to review the legislation and, at the end of the day, it would have left it. I can certainly understand that this measure-as indeed any measure which impinges upon the rights and entitlements of people generally, but particularly our senior citizens-would cause some concern. I regret that and I apologise on behalf of opposition members-because, like me, they ate members of this parliament-that there has been an unwarranted attack on pensioners in the form of scaremongering so that a lot of people who will not be affected by this measure may well think they will be. I apologise to those people for that. I have many retired people in my middle-class electorate, as does the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), and they know that this measure that I have been supporting on behalf of the government is one which, when looked at fairly on the basis of equity, is nowhere near as bad as the honourable member for Berowra and other opposition members have said. I want to take this opportunity to rectify a gross exaggeration of the truth that has been perpetrated by some sections of the media and the opposition which has caused unnecessary alarm within Australia's aged community. Many media outlets, for the sake of grabbing and manufacturing headlines, have assisted in scaring the public by saying that the government-in particular me-has said that every dollar of a senior citizen's nest egg must be consumed before that person is entitled to the pension. This is absolutely not the case at all give and I have never said that. During numerous media interviews, I have indicated that, outside the generous income and assets test limits currently offered by the government, senior citizens are expected to use savings beyond these thresholds to support themselves before they approach social security. Under the extremely generous pensioner income and assets tests allowed by this government, it is possible for a full pensioner couple to have almost $100,000 in the bank at the current deemed rate; $160,500 in assets outside the family home; plus the family home, which· could be worth anything from $100,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending upon where the pensioner couple live. In short, quite the contrary to not having any nest egg to pass on to children or grandchildren, it is possible for a pensioner couple to pass on a nest egg of just under half a million dollars or thereabouts while they have still been able to obtain the full combined pension. Looking at a single pensioner with his or her own home, the same thing applies only he or she cannot have as much. Part-pensioner couples are in an even better position and could accumulate nest eggs of well beyond half a million dollars to pass on to offspring before they lose full entitlement to the pension. I have already said that a pensioner couple can earn what amounts to average weekly earnings before they lose full entitlement to the pension and thus entitlement to fringe benefits. Those members of the media and the opposition who persist in selective quoting, knowing full well the truth of this matter, should apologise to the thousands of elderly Australians who have become unnecessarily worried sick in the false belief that they can no longer leave their children or grandchildren a nest egg. That right will always be there Chynoweth, R. L. under a Labor government. This issue has been canvassed enough. I do not intend to take up any more time of the committee. I simply say that the government does not accept the opposition's amendments. I commend the bill to the committee in its original form.

NA BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Lindsay: That the Bill be now read a second time.  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is a source of great concern to the coalition. Our concern stems from two key areas. The bill is yet another example of the very sloppy legislative and administrative practices which we have come to expect from this government. Time and again, this parliament is forced to consider amendments to pieces of legislation which have been poorly drafted, not sufficiently thought through, poorly administered or else rushed through the House without giving the parliament sufficient time for proper scrutiny and analysis. From my own experience, I know that many of the customs bills for which I have had responsibility over the last three years have to some extent been to correct drafting and administrative errors. The House may recall the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill 1990. This bill closed a loophole in the Customs Act which otherwise would. have forced the Australian Customs Service to return to their owners all the dangerous items which they had previously confiscated. If not corrected, this loophole would have seen thousands of guns, flick-knives, landmines, machine-guns and the like flood back into the community. I do not need to tell the House what the horrendous consequences of this would have been. I recall another customs bill which remedied an error which incorrectly allowed some spirits and spirit based soft drinks to be exempt from excise. The opposition consistently has drawn to the attention of the government the consequences of its poor legislative and administrative practices; yet there has been no change. We continue to be confronted with bills similar to the one currently before the House. I have to wonder whether the government will learn. I hope it will learn soon because we are fast running out of patience. It is interesting that the bill currently before the House arises out of an error in previous amendments which were overseen by the former Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, now the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall). There is no doubt that the minister made a right royal mess of implementing this policy, although perhaps we should count ourselves lucky: he has gone on to much bigger and better things, overseeing what is now commonly known as the pay TV debacle. In light of his mishandling of the pay TV issue, the botch-up he has made of this particular piece of legislation and the administration of the department, one should question his ability to hold the high office that he does. The second source of concern to the coalition arises from the retrospective nature of this bill. The coalition is always loath to support retrospective legislation, especially when it takes away a given benefit or imposes additional obligations on private persons. Indeed, we have consistently and firmly adopted the position that we will not support retrospective tax legislation because it can potentially impose extra costs on the community. It is the coalition's view that taxpayers must be confident of their obligations when they undertake their planning, budgetary, investment and other financial decisions. Likewise, they must be certain that the government cannot levy extra taxes and charges which are retrospective and hence face a backdated fiscal responsibility. The coalition does not, and will not, back away from this principle. In fact, I reiterate for the benefit of the government that we remain opposed to retrospective tax legislation. However, in some other cases-and I stress that these will be very few in numberthere may be compelling reasons for the coalition to consider its position on retrospective legislation. These circumstances must be of an extreme nature and such that they will have a significant and detrimental impact on the community. The example I mentioned earlier is a good case in point. The customs amendment seeking to close the loophole and hence prevent the return of dangerous goods to their owners was retrospective to 1956. The coalition supported the amendment because of the mitigating circumstances, including the potentially devastating impact on the community. In commenting on this particular piece of legislation, my colleague the ho.nourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said: It is importantto underline the point that in principle we are totally opposed to retrospective legislation and this is a very special case where the principle, if you like, is somewhat outweighed by the common sense principle of allowing all this dangerous equipment back into the community. In the same way, the coalition has to consider the retrospective element of the bill currently before the House in the context of a whole range of circumstances, including the potential impact on the industry and customers, the background to the original legislation, what it sought to achieve, the nature of the amendments and what they seek to do. In doing this, we have adopted a common sense approach. Accordingly, after considerable deliberation, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. However, I put the government on notice th-t our support on this occasion is strictly onceoff. In no way does it set a precedent for future support of retrospective legislation, especially tax legislation. Indeed, the coalition will consider any further retrospective legislation in the context of the circumstances which led to it being made necessary. Only in the most extreme and mitigating circumstances will we see our way clear to ever support such legislation. Let me say again to the government that, if it gets its legislative act together, it is highly unlikely that the coalition will again be placed in this position. For the benefit of the House, let me give a little background to the bill. The bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to put beyond doubt the intent of item 41A to apply to only the participants of the passenger motor vehicle plan. As most honourable members in the House will know, the government since 1985 has had in place a range of measures designed to encourage the rationalisation and international competitiveness of the Australian passenger motor vehicle and component industry. The passenger motor vehicle plan, as these measures are collectively known, was modified in 1988, with quotas and the local content rule being dropped and a new, more flexible export facilitation scheme introduced. The plan was then reviewed in 1990 by' the Industry Commission, and a new set of initiatives was announced in the March 1991 industry statement. The present passenger motor vehicle plan is intended by the government to take the industry through to the year 2000, and includes a reduction in tariffs applying to passenger motor vehicles of 21/2 per cent per year, phasing down to 15 per cent at the end of the decade; a reduction in tariffs on fourwheel drive and light commercial vehicles in line with general manufacturing tariffs; the continuation of the 15 per cent entitlement to duty free import of passenger motor· vehicle products; and the continuation of the export facilitation scheme, including its extension to component manufacturers. The export facilitation scheme is targeted at the four car plan producers as well as domestic component manufacturers. The House will recall that' there were originally five car plan producers but that this fell following the closure of the Nissan manufacturing plant. The scheme encourages the domestic production and export of motor vehicles and components by allowing producers to earn credits in respect of items exported. Credits are earned on the basis of a dollar for every dollar of Australian value added and are subsequently used to offset duty applied. to imported motor vehicles, components, replacement component parts, four-wheel drives and light commercial vehicles. Export credits can be sold or transferred amongst d<;>meStic car and component .manufacturers. In 1992, the export facilitation scheme generated exports to the value of $1.2 billion. The revisions to the export facilitation scheme were implemented in 1991 by way of amendment to item 41A of schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. It is currently administered by the same item and corresponding by-laws. Item 41A allows that certain goods prescribed in by-law can be imported free of duty. The amendment, and the customs by-law in respect of item 41A as written, does not make it clear that the duty-free entitlement is only for plan producers. Of course, item 41A has always been intended to apply only to the plan participants, by allowing them duty-free importation of certain passenger motor vehicles, as well as to component producers where they have earned the appropriate number of credits under the export facilitation scheme. It has recently been contended by two importers of passenger motor vehicles that item 41A and the accompanying customs administrative by-laws allow the duty-free importation of all passenger motor vehicles, including by those companies who are not participants in the car plan-that is, those who are not domestic manufacturers. These two companies have subsequently submitted claims to the Australian Customs Service for a refund of duty paid on all vehicles imported between 1 July 1992 and 1 March 1993. As I said, the bill before the House seeks to clarify this situation. As such, it corrects an administrative error in the drafting of the previous amendment and, in so doing, validates existing arrangements by ensuring that only domestic manufacturers gain the benefits of export facilitation. The coalition's support for this bill is purely in the interests of common sense. We recognise the far-reaching ramifications which our opposition could pose, not only for motor vehicle importers but also, more importantly, for our domestic manufacturers. Moreover, we recognise that our lack of support would seriously undermine industry confidence. In coming to a position on the bill, the coalition gave due weight to, firstly, the intent of the car plan and, secondly, the fact that the whole industry has long been operating according to the spirit and intent of the plan. The intent of' th- passenger motor vehicle plan and the legislation which implements the plan has been clear from the outset. It is designed to facilitate the rationalisation of the Australian industry and encourage it to become world competitive. The plan was never intended to support those importers who did not manufacture in Australia. This intent has long been recognised by the motor vehicle industry, iricluding both domestic producers and importers. The fact that industry has consistently complied with the intent of the plan is evidenced by its actions. Importers who are eligible for a refund of duty using export facilitation credits are entitled to obtain from the Australian Customs Service a determination which waives payment of duty. on vehicles and components when they land on the dock. This has obvious cashflow and administrative benefits because businesses do not have to pay the duty then claim a refund. Importers who do not have export facilitation credit simply pay the duty and obtain the cargo. If the companies in question genuinely believed that they were not required to pay duty on their imports, they simply would have obtained a determination from the Australian Customs Service. They would not have gone to the expense and trouble of paying duty then seeking a refund. The fact that they did not adopt this course of action indicates that the companies in' question were complying with the spirit of the car plan-until the loophole was pointed out to them and they saw an opportunity to capitalise on an administrative error. In developing a position on this bill, the co.alition also gave due consideration to the principles applying to the assessment of retrospective legislation. As a general rule, if legislation takes away a benefit that someone was receiving, or believed they were entitled to, then it is bad legislation and should not be supported. The bill before the House does not take away a benefit that was being received, nor was it a benefit to which vehicle importers, in good conscience, could believe they were entitled. The actions of the importers, and evidence that until early this year they supported the intent and spirit of the car plan, bear witness to this. The coalition thought long and hard about this piece of legislation. We arrived at a position which, I believe, is in the best interests of the industry. But let me sound a warning: the coalition will not be as receptive if it is put in this position again. One of the fundamental principles of good government is thorough, accurate and correct legislation. Indeed, it is second only to open and accountable administration. I would welcome the assurances, not only of the new ministers for customs and industry but also of all their colleagues, that they have made a commitment to these principles and that we will not be seeing a recurrence of this situation.",41
110,Mr OCONNOR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The purpose of the amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 is twofold. Firstly, the amendments will put beyond doubt the constmction of item 41A of schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and, in so doing, remove the possibility that a non-plan producer could import motor vehicles duty-free without export credits under the export facilitation scheme. Secondly, the amendments concern the government's policy intent under the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan: for an importer to benefit under paragraph 41A(a) of schedule 4 of the act, that importer must have a determination under the export facilitation scheme. The intents and purposes of this piece of legislation have been articulated before. We must understand that there are some fairly serious implications in not proceeding with the retrospective legislation in this area. I take on board the position that has been put by the  who spoke before me in this debate. I was pleased to hear that the coalition will be supporting the retrospective legislation. According to the honourable member, the coalition has taken that position because the effect would be to impose additional costs on the community. Let me say that, unless the government proceeds with these amendments, it would be faced with a potential liability in excess of $400 million, being the combination of duty paid on passenger motor vehicles for the period 1 January 1991 to 28 February 1993 and duty forgone on plan imports for the same period. A further implication of not proceeding with this retrospective legislation is that any successful circumvention of the government's policy intent by an importer could seriously undermine the benefits that have accrued to industry under the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan. Honourable members will be aware of the enormous benefits that the industry has generated under this plan. An additional point to consider is that the industry in total has every right to expect that the plan will be maintained as previously announced by the government. These amendments, therefore, preserve the integrity of the government's automotive industry policy. I was very interested in the comments that the honourable member made about this particular bill. He said that companies have attempted to capitalise on an administrative weakness in the legislation. I would have thought that they had more integrity than that; that they would have realised the advantages to the total industry of this particular plan and complied with the spirit and intent of the government's legislation. Be that as it may-perhaps they' have not 'pursued that particular course-the government is forced into this particular position. It is very important-indeed, essential-that the integrity of the car plan be preserved because that plan had a most beneficial influence on the development of this critical manufacturing industry in Australia. The government's policy on the motor vehicle industry to the year 2000 was outlined in the document Building a competitive Australia, which was brought to the Australian people in March 1991. The government's policy objectives in that document were very clearly articulated. It wanted to build a viable and internationally competitive car manufacturing industry in Australia. It also wanted the industry to produce high quality vehicles1 and to bring those vehicles to the marketplace at lower real prices to the Australian consumers. I think any realistic and accurate assessment of how the industry has progressed over the last five years would indicate that the government's objectives on all of those fronts have been largely achieved. Several essential elements of the industry arrangements were announced at that time. The first was the phased reduction in tariffs to 15 per cent by the year 2000. That did indeed contrast with the position that was put to the industry and to the Australian community by the opposition before the last federal election. It was a policy, I think it is safe to say, that was rejected certainly in my electorate, where Ford has a manufacturing facility, and in other electorates around Australia. The one important element of those industry arrangements was the modification of the export facilitation scheme. It seems from talking to people in the industry that perhaps no other measure has provided such an incentive to the industry to get into the export arena and to rake up the rather substantial exports that it has. We all know the projections for exports in this current year are somewhere in the region of $1.2 billion or $1;3 billion. That export facilitation scheme and its continuance are absolutely vital to the future of this industry. As we know, the industry does not operate under zero tariffs. For it to operate, it requires a particular scheme that has some measure of tariff protection. In effect, the government is pursuing a policy, through the export facilitation scheme, that encourages not only passenger motor vehicle manufacturers but also component producers to get into the export ring and to clock up ever increasing levels of exports. The third element of that industry package was the rather generous and improved labour adjustment packages for the retraining of displaced auto industry workers. This government has prided itself on the fact that when it has had to take the hard decisions it has done so with a degree of compassion and in such a way that workers who have been displaced from an industry are given adequate retraining and are supported in the adjustment period. The fourth element of the industry arrangement was the maintenance of the Automotive Industry Authority to monitor the arrangements under the plan; it has produced some excellent reports to the government on the status of the industry. As we know, the Australian motor industry is in a much healthier position than it was some five years ago. It is poised to take advantage of the emerging economic recovery both domestically and internationally. I suggest to the House that the existence of the plan, although it has had some undesirable consequences on the employment front, has certainly strengthened the industry and put it in a position where it can take advantage of an upturn in economic activity. The industry'S position over the past years has certainly been improved by several measures. The devaluation of the Australian dollar has provided a measure of protection which has cushioned the industry from some of the more harsh consequences of the phased tariff reductions to 15 per cent by the year 2000. Certainly the cost pressures in overseas markets that have been felt by our competitors have put the Australian industry in a far better position. Alongside this have come significant increases in productivity achieved by firms w""ithin the industry. The industry'S export performance is an indication of its improved competitiveness. If we review the industry today and compare it with what it was some five or 10 years ago, we now have a viable, competitive industry that is taking on the world. I think it is a tribute to the gentleman that I used to work for, former Senator John Button, who has now retired from the other place. He set in motion the various industry plans for this sector. He had the vision to set a structure and a framework that would allow this industry to become viable and internationally competitive and to sustain employment levels in the long term. If we look at the industry today, in the export area we have seen solid growth in 1992 against a background of international recession. Particularly pleasing in the growth of exports has been the growth in the component export sector. In the field of industrial relations performance, there has been a commendable improvement on this front. Honourable members might like to cast their minds back some years to the rather adversarial industrial relations culture which existed in this industry. It was not something I think the industry could be proud of, but I think it can be proud of its record today. The culture of the industry is changing and the level of industrial tion in the industry is actually lower than in manufacturing industry generally. One excellent result of the plan and changing culture of automotive manufacturing in Australia has been the output of quality cars. There has been a dramatic increase in the quality of Australian cars, which now match quality standards achieved by imported Japanese vehicles. I guess at this point we ought to ask the industry where it thinks it is heading under this very innovative and necessary plan that the government has put into place. I guess the answer to that lies in the investment plans that have already been articulated by the industry.·It is planning to invest really heavily over the next four years. This is being done against a background of reduced profitability. The pleasing feature of that investment is that it is related to improving productive efficiency. In the area of productivity, we have seen some very dramatic increases in recent years. This has occurred both in assembly and component production. It is important because it is being done against a background of low levels of capacity utilisation and low levels sales. The key to those productivity improvements has been the lean manufacturing practices that have been implemented. Factories have minimised inventories and eliminated waste. They have introduced flexibility and notions of teamwork to their work force. They have introduced motivational systems which encourage employees to contribute to the goals of the organisation. They have introduced a progressive element to their human resource management. This is paying off rather handsomely in productivity gains to the industry. We have also seen improvements in productivity brought about by improvements to plant automation. The industry is moving from a low level of automation to a medium level of automation. That, unfortunately, has brought some labour shedding, but in the end it will position the industry vis-a-vis its competitors and will guarantee its security in the long term. The industry has been able, through its thrust into the export area, to achieve significant production volumes, and this has helped disputait to achieve economies of scale. The industry's future depends upon producers becoming more efficient-certainly upon its suppliers becoming more efficient-and, indeed, other players in the equation, such as government, introducing necessary reforms to position the industry so that it can become more competitive. On the micro-economic front, I think it is fair to say that the government has delivered in the areas of transport, communications, taxation and other government arrangements. On the macro scale, we have the lowest inflation rate that we have had for such a long time. We have low interest rates and we have greater work force flexibility. All of these particular elements position this industry very well to take on the challenges of the late 1990s and beyond the year 2000. I should reserve some of my harshest comments tonight for members of the opposition. The honourable member who preceded me did outline with some clarity the coalition's policy on retrospective legislation, and I think certain elements of that are fair. of But I think that, on the broader aspect of the policy for this industry, the opposition stands condemned. (Quorum formed) I was starting to comment on the opposition's car industry policy. I think the safest. thing to say is that it does not have one. The government instituted a policy which would see a phased reduction in tariffs to 15 per cent by the year 2000. The opposition's policy is that it would phase tariffs down to zero or near to zero by the year 2000. That particular proposition was condemned by the industry; it was condemned by the unions involved in the industry; it was condemned by local governments; and it was condemned by communities which had car industry plants in their areas. Zero tariffs would have been a deterrent to the level of investment that is required to keep this industry going and make it competitive beyond the year 2000. It would have ended the export facilitation scheme which has seen an impetus to exports in the assembly and component manufacturing area. I refer to comments that have been made by members of the opposition since this session resumed. The coalition's recent pronouncements. on the car industry certainly leave a lot to be desired. In July, the shadow Treasurer and honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) claimed that Ford was considering closing its Australian factories because of poor productivity and restrictive work practices. This statement was hotly denied by Ford and the shadow Treasurer was roundly condemned by many for making it. These irresponsible, speculative statements by economic ignoramuses can have very adverse impacts on the confidence of employees in the industry and indeed on the community in which they live. In the wake of that particular statement by the honourable member for Mayo, an article appeared in the Geelong Advertiser headed 'Talk on Ford ""may threaten city business'''. The article states: Speculation about the future of Ford could threaten other Geelong industries, according to Australian Chamber of Manufactures. Regional manager, Mr Michael O'Brien, said last night continued reports that Ford would close its Australian plants could compound problems in a city already battling a confidence problem. He said speculation could be very damaging for Ford-Geelong's largest manufacturer with 2,500 employees-flowing through to a range of local industries. ""We should build up confidence in Geelong and confidence in the future,"" ... While the shadow Treasurer was strutting the world stage, being plied with a few drinks in the boardrooms of Ford in the United States and coming back here making very irresponsible pronouncements on the industry, he was damaging communities such as Geelong.

111,Mr ROCHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to correct an error in the drafting of customs by-laws associated with item 41A of schedule 4 to the act. Item 41A of schedule 4 is concerned with the export facilitation scheme which was introduced in 1991 and allows local motor vehicle producers who are participants in the passenger motor vehicle plan to obtain export credits that can be used to offset duty on imported motor vehicles and their components. Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd and at least one other importer of motor vehicles are seeking to exploit this error, to claim a refund from the Australian Customs Service of duty paid on all vehicles imported over a period of about 12 months. The claimed original intent of those. arrangements announced for the car plan in the 1991 industry policy statement was to deny duty-free importation to importers. The government is moving this amendment to operate retrospectively to deny any possibility of these claims being successful and to preserve the claimed intent of its legislation. The fact that retrospective legislation is being used once again to achieve the government's purposes should be of great concern. Until now, the coalition in opposition has steadfastly opposed the use of retrospective legislation in this way as being counter to the rule of law the upon which we all ultimately rely for protection from the capricious and arbitrary actions of government. IIi this case, the government is asking the parliament to address problems that have arisen as a result of its delegated legislation by the use of retrospective legislation with backdated effect to the beginning of 1991. The problems this legislation seeks to eliminate could arguably have been better dealt with through the use of the Acts Interpretation Act rather than through recourse to retrospective legislation which sets a terrible precedent and is inherently dangerous to future reliance on the rule of law in this country. If the government is secure in its position that its original intent was clear, it would not need to resort to retrospective legislation in order to protect itself from claims for refunds. The government contends that customs revenue at stake in this claim is around $500 million. IIi this case, the government has the distinct advantage of already holding these funds. It is interesting to compare the government's actions on this occasion with what happens when the government itself reaps a windfall gain of the type being sought by Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd and at least one other importer. When this government is found by the courts to have illegally collected funds from taxpayers, as occurred in the Mutual Pools case, we do not see it rushing legislation through to reimburse taxpayers for those funds .. Instead, we saw legislationagain retrospective-:-designed to negate the rights of taxpayers, given by.a federal court, to a reimbursement of those funds. 'So the government is not averse to keeping windfall gains when the opportunity presents itself but· it is firmly against conceding revenue to taxpayers in like circumstances; It has no qualms about using retrospective legislation to achieve that end. It should also be noted that windfall gains are not an unusual feature of the operation of our customs legislation. It is quite common praetice for importers to overpay customs duty to avoid penalties and subsequently to have refunds made to them. Indeed, had the importers in this case not paid the duties concerned-as they argue the law enables them to do-they would have been obliged to pay some stiff penalties had they then lost their legal argument. The effect of this legislation is to deny the importers the opportunity to mount their case before. the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, which they would otherwise be entitled to do. Also a feature of our customs legislation is that it generally proscribes the retrospective imposition of tariff proposals or anti-dumping duties. This bill is inconsistent with those principles hitherto embodied in our customs legislation. The government has claimed that dire consequences will flow from its motor vehicle plan if this retrospective legislation not enacted. Let me remind the House that all transactions involved here have been conducted. The action of this parliament or this government will not affect the car plan. Should the government wish to remove' the loophole, as it were, prospectively, of course it would have the support of the opposition. The government does have the support of the opposition to the extent that what it proposes is prospective. So let us not hear that furphy about this legislation being integral to the success of the car plan. It is simply a nonsense. It is equally a nonsense to say that the transactions which have taken place since January 1991 have given the importers a competitive advantage over local manufacturers, because those transactions have also taken place and the duty was included in the price of the product being sold by the importers. Not one sale would have been affected by these measures over that period. The implication is that it would be unfair, or in some way damaging, to those who have participated in the export facilitation scheme if others were allowed to come along and derive similar benefits without having met the same terms and conditions that were intended to be prerequisites for obtaining those benefits. The government claims: . Uncertainty in the plan's legislative mechanism could seriously undermine the benefits achieved [under the car plan] to date. That is a nonsense which grossly exaggerates what is at issue here. All relative commercial decisions and motor vehicle sales pertinent to this issue have already been made. Any further resort to the loophole in question can be closed off prospectively without the use of retrospective legislation. The participants in the export facilitation scheme are not going to be left any worse off as a result of the windfall gain to another party, even if that were to be the result of not passing this legislation. Local producers would not have sold fewer cars than· they otherwise would have, nor would .the importers concerned be able to - ell more cars on the Australian market without this legislation-although their profitability might be improved by the refund of customs is duty. What is at issue here are claims-for as much as $500 million, according to the government-against the government that might succeed if it does not enact this retrospective legislation. There is also the question of the $60,000 in application fees that some importers have paid to obtain a refund of their share of those funds in accordance with the law as it stands and in accordance with accepted practice. If this legislation is passed, those application fees will be forfeited. As I have already indicated, it is possible that the government could defeat the claim for a refund of customs duty under the Acts Interpretation Act without recourse to retrospective legislation. Instead, it has chosen the dangerous course of retrospective enactment to deny such a claim and to deny the importers the opportunity to make their case. No-one. would dispute that the government could use $500 million at this time to address its burgeoning budget deficit, which continues to plague the Commonwealth's finances. None of us is advocating fiscal irresponsibility, but we have to ask ourselves whether the use of retrospective legislation-with all the precedents it sets and the risks that such legislation entails-is worth any amount of revenue that would otherwise be forgone. Claims against the government of a possible $500 million should instead be .an expensive lesson for the government to get its delegated legislation right the first time around. Revenue potentially lost should not be an excuse to use retrospective legislation to bail the government out of trouble any, or every, time it makes a legislative mistake of this type, otherwise wereally will live in an even more uncertain world with much more uncertainty than might befall local car producers if their competitors were to obtain a refund of customs revenue. The other reason for not being overly concerned about the $500 million at stake here might be that the duties involved are basically obnoxious to anyone who believes that Australians should be entitled to import motor vehicles without paying a penalty to support the local industry. The importation of motor vehicles and components to this country is held hostage under the car plan to the production and export activities of local producers. It is a state of affairs about which we complain bitterly when those countries to which we export apply the same measures. Australians are massively ripped off by the government every time they buy a car in this country. They are ripped off for the sake of producers which seem to devote more energy to protecting their many local privileges than to competing in the world market. The fuel tax increases in the budget, along with the duties payable on car imports, mean that owning and operating a motor vehicle must be one of the most heavily taxed activities one can undertake in this country. It is therefore difficult to have any sympathy for local car producers should importers gain a windfall of customs revenue at the expense of government revenue. Let me say that if they should gain that windfall, it would be subject to normal company or income tax. The use of retrospective legislation is not warranted by the facts of this case. The retrospective conferral of a benefit is one thing but this legislation potentially denies a refund which the parties concerned might be entitled to under existing law. It also denies them access to justice to which we are all entitled from the government of the day. - ore importantly, if a tax-free transaction made yesterday were to be taxed by a law made at any time in the future, confidence in the rule of the law would be seriously diminished. - r GRIFFIN (Corinella) (5.39 p-m.)-I rise tonight to commend the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1993 to the House. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to put beyond doubt the construction of item 41A of schedule 4 to the act. Item 41A is a key component in the implementation of the government's passenger motor vehicle plan. This bill will remove a possible technical loophole in the Act which at least one producer is attempting to exploit. This bill will make it absolutely clear, as it is in the plan, that the only producers entitled to benefit from the export facilitation scheme are those who have committed themselves to an export oriented and world competitive future. This plan has given the stability that the industry needed to invest, to improve competitiveness and to integrate with the world industry. Under this government, and under this govermn.ent's plan, the automotive industry has been able to compete with imports at lower levels of government assistance and provide better quality products to consumers at lower real prices. This plan has exports of motor vehicles and components at record levels. The importance of these exports to our economy should not be underestimated. At $1.2 billion in 1992, automotive industry exports are fast rivalling those of wheat and other commodities. This is a clear indication of the success of the plan and the commitment of this government to export oriented manufacturing indus.tries. Regarding the detailed export facilitation, the Industry Commission report of 1990 stated: The primary objective of export facilitation is to encourage the passenger vehicle industry in Australia to rationalise, by providing it with an tive to focus production in those areas where it is most competitive. In general, firms utilising export facilitation will export those vehicles or components with no or relatively low cost disadvantages relative to tion overseas, and use the duty free entitlements they earn either to avoid duty that would otherwise be payable on vehicle or component imports, or to displace locally sourced vehicles and/or components with relatively high cost disadvantages against imported equivalents. Like the automatic by-law entitlement, the duty free entitlements earned under the scheme provide a cost saving to the industry. The comments of the industry itself are very relevant to this issue. I refer to some of the comments in the Industry Commission report from the companies involved. Toyota stated: TMCA exports require the full benefits of the . .. arrangements to break even. Ford observed that: . . . few, if any, of the present export programs would be viable without the EFS benefits. Holden's Engine Company said: The presence of export facilitation provisions was a key determinant in offsetting structural and geographical disadvantages associated with the Australian site-and tipped the scale in terms of justification of the investment decision. . . . given investments in place, there is no major reliance on EFS for subsidy at factory cost level. The impact of EFS assistance is, however, most significant to offset logistics penalties into European markets, to contribute to the management of debt associated with specific export facilities When we look at the history of the car industry in Australia, it is relevant to see where we were back in the 1970s. The response of the Fraser government to the deterioration in the competitive position of the local industry in the latter half of the 1970s was to increase protection against imported vehicles to a point where the tariff on fully assembled vehicles was 57.5 per cent in 1978. The actions of the previous Liberal government protected and insulated inefficiency, basically rewarding producers who were not having a go. The previous Liberal government was not providing the vision that this government subsequently did. ,In releasing the car plan on 29 - ay 1964, the then - inister for Industry and Commerce stated: Government policy since the mid-1960s has been incenincreasingly characterised by short term crisis containment and inward looking policies. In summary, the result has been an industry which has had rising levels of protection and producdeclining levels of performance, circumstances which are costly to the taxpayer and damaging to the industry itself in terms of its morale, prestige, security of the work force and capacity to plan ahead. The community is entitled to expect that over time the industry will adjust to a revetsal of the process I have just referred to and there will be an improvement in performance at less cost. The new arrangements were designed to address those deficiencies-again I quote from the minister of the day-by providing: . . . a framework in which the industry can develop with a sense of purpose and vision. They are designed to provide short term assistance to the industry to help it face up to the process of short term adjustment with a view to attaining greater efficiency and stability. They are designed to reduce the cost to the community and the disruptions to the industry and its employees which have occurred over the last decade. They are designed to allow an important manufacturing industry in Australia to show that it has the capacity to adapt and to· do well in the domestic and international markets . The Industry Commission in its 1990 report on the automotive car industry stated: For the first time in at least 20 years, there have . . . been ongoing reductions in assistance to the industry. And perhaps most importantly, the termination of import quotas and the local content scheme has removed the mechanisms which, for many years, automatically increased assistance to the industry whenever its competitiveness declined. Mr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells having rung",48
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Order! A quorum not being present, the sitting will be resumed at 5.55 p.m.",52
113,Unknown,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 5.50 to 5.55 p-m. The House having been counted and a quorum being present,52
114,Mr GRIFFIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,It says something about the constructive approach of the opposition when it regularly calls quorums of the House to disrupt the business. It also says something about what the opposition thinks about the car industry. An honourable member interjecting,52
115,Mr GRIFFIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I would not expect much more from a rural runt such as the' honourable member. Concerning the future of the industry, protection has been considerably reduced but there have been improvements in most areas of the industry, especially in relation to quality and productivity. Government initiatives in the area of micro-economic reform, combined with the stable planning environment provided by the government's.passenger motor vehicle plan, give us every reason to be optimistic about the future of passenger vehicle manufacturing in this country. We could not go on as we were. Although I, among many others, am concerned about tariff reductions in many areas, the car industry approach offers some hope of managing, through change, to minimise job loss and increase exports. The bill reduces a potential liability of the Commonwealth to refund over $400 million in duty paid by producers who are not owners of a determination under the export facilitation scheme. The retrospectivity is entirely appropriate as it merely clarifies the already clear intention of the government. The retrospectivity will not add any new costs to non-qualifying producers but it will mean that the Commonwealth will definitely not be providing windfall gains to producers who are not prepared to make a go of adjusting to an outwardly looking, world competitive industry. When we look at the way the plan is working and to the future we see likely investments of $1 billion over the next decade, through Toyota at Altona, GMH, Mitsubishi and Ford Australia. The other aspect I would like to focus on is industrial change in the industry. The workplace cooperation between employers and unions that this government has supported and helped initiate has seen a radical drop in the number of working days lost in the industry. Prior to these reforms, the vehicle industry was notorious for its industrial problems. In the six years to 1982, over 68,000 working days were lost due to industrial action. In the nine years to 1991 only 23,200 days were lost. By any measure this is a radical drop that has occurred under a Labor government. As more companies adopt enterprise bargaining this number should continue to decline. This period was also marked by a greater degree of worker participation in workplace decision making. Ford Australia is one noteworthy case. By the end of 1988, 300 problem solving groups had been formed across Ford Australia's operations. .This trend towarq employee involvement has since spread into other vehicle plants. In 1991, 27 per cent of employees in Australian vehicle assembly plants were involved in employee involvement programs or quality circles. An average of 1.2 suggestions were made by each employee regarding improvements to working life or productivity, 41 per cent of which were implemented. In summary, we had' a situation where industry was in decline, suffering from gross Liberal neglect. We introduced a car plan, and it is working. We have seen increased investment, increased exports and real change. This bill safeguards the plan's integrity. The retrospectivity is entirely justified. I commend in legislation the bill to the House.",52
116,Mr CHARLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It is my understanding that the purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is to correct a drafting error in item 41 A of the Customs Tariff Act 1987-the principal act-which could allow the duty free importation of vehicles by people who do not hold a determination under the export facilitation scheme. How many times must we come into this House with legislation to fix up bad legislation and drafting errors? It happens. time and time again. Part of the problem must. be either that the government is incompetent or that it is in such a rush to bring in so many pieces of legislation, such massive revisions to our law and such horrendous additions to the volume of statute in this country, that it does not have time to get it right. One of the problems that business in Australia has is that we not only add constantly to the volume of laws, to the rules that prescribe how a business shall and shall not operate, but we also introduce the uncertainty of retrospective legislation. This government, and I assume the bureaucracy behind it, needs to understand that industry is in business to provide products and services that our community and other communities around the world value. Business is not in business people off, to disadvantage its employees or to obtain a benefit which is beyond reasonableness. Business is in business to make products that the people need in their everyday lives or may desire to make their lives easier or more enjoyable-to give benefit to society. From that benefit, we provide real employment in this country for real people. We provide real jobs, which I note is something that the budget, which we will be discussing over the next few months, unfortunately does not address. This government has lost the plot. So we are here today debating retrospective legislation instead of trying to come to grips with some measures that might actually encourage industry to invest in additional productive capacity and provide meaningful jobs for Australians which will get them off the dole queues, reduce the social security bill and might actually help us to reduce our overseas debt and to become once again a profitable and wealthy nation-one where our living standards actually rise instead of fall. The government has had 10 years to get it right, but this bill is just one more example of getting it wrong. Let us take as an example the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill 1992. In 1986 the government introduced legislation which it passed through both houses of parliament to impose a sales tax on in-ground swimming pools because above-ground swimming pools were subject to a tax. It said, 'Those pool builders who are building in-ground pools are obtaining advantage over the above-ground pool builders in that they do not pay tax'. The government did not understand the complex nature of the construction industry. It did not understand that a shell put into a purposemade hole in the ground to form the base of a swimming pool is a bit different from manufacturing a vinyl liner and metal walls for an above-ground swimming pool. The industry had a few problems with the bill, as one might understand. Legitimate pool builders worked diligently under some mechanism or other to try to come to grips with precisely how much tax they owed for constructing the shell and digging the hole in the to rip ground because they were the components that were to be taxed. But it was very difficult to get an exact costing on each pool for exactly those portions of that in-built pool which were to be subject to tax. Some unscrupulous pool builders literally just stopped paying the tax or overcharged their clients for the tax - one or the other. That put pressure on the legitimate part of the industry. The industry had finally had enough and went to the High Court. The High Court found in favour of the pool builders. It found that once again this government had made a mistake. It was not a simple drafting error that time. Section 55 of the constitution states: ... laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only. But the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill did not. The High Court said that the law was invalid. So in 1992 we came into this House to debate the Swimming Pool Tax Refund Bill 1992. When we went to debate the mechanisms proposed in that bill to deal with the refund of moneys through pool builaers to pool owners and with the refund of moneys to pool builders after the time that they had issued the High Court challenge, when they stopped collecting tax from the owners-the government had got it all wrong and, potentially, hundreds of thousands of pool owners around Australia were going to be disadvantaged by the legislation-the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and his advisers could not understand how the swimming pool industry worked; how it actually operated in a practical sense. There was no politics whatsoever in that bill. The politics went out of it once the High Court found that the government had made an error. So the fix-it-up bill was a mechanical mechanism to try to do the right thing because the High Court said that parliament had to do the right thing. My colleagues and I tried desperately in this place, both during the second reading debate and in committee, to convince the Treasurer that he had got it wrong and that he did not understand the mechanisms of the industry. I have to say that some of my colleagues on the other side of the House stood up in this place and advised the Treasurer that perhaps he ought to listen. Did he listen? Of course not. That is our Treasurer. He does not listen because he does not believe he has anything to learn. So we took it to the Senate. Fortunately for the Australian people, our house of review has other procedures and it took that bill to committee. Committee hearings were held, bringing in outside people representing various segments of the industry-owners and whatever. Finally, the Senate modified the bill, largely-although not entirely-in line with the recommendations that I had made in the House of Representatives. We then brought the amended bill back to this House, debated it again and passed it. We could have saved all that time spent on a mechanical bill-which the government should not have got wrong in the first place, but did-had the executive, as represented by the Treasurer, simply been willing to listen. But the Treasurer was not willing to listen. Why are we here today? We are here once again to talk about legislation which retrospectively imposes a burden or withdraws a benefit. I maintain that such a position is abhorrent. How on earth do we expect industry and Australian individuals to cope with their everyday lives, to plan for the future to organise themselves in an efficient manner when we change the rules retrospectively? It is bad enough when we sometimes make bad laws that operate into the future; but this is a piece of retrospective legislation. I it because it sets precedents. Every time we debate one of these issues in this place involving bad government drafting, it is because of too much haste and not enough thinking, not enough consideration of the issues involved, and a lack of understanding of industry and business and how they operate. Too many times we come back into this place to fix up bad legislation. This bill imposes a retrospective burden because the company, Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd, which filed for duty rebate-that is why we are here-paid fees for each application that it made. It is my understanding that close to $60,000 is involved. Not only that but, were we not making this bill retrospective, other companies might also apply for duty refund, legitimately and legally as they are entitled, which happens, I understand, every day of the working week, every month of every year. Duties are constantly adjusted both up and down, down and up. This issue is not one of destroying the car plan or of destroying a legitimate car industry; it is one which now retrospectively will, if Volvo wins its case, deny that company a benefit. It effectively grants the export facilitation scheme tax credits to motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts importers who are not included in the scheme. That is to say, those who are not exporting Australian manufacturers might obtain a benefit for that brief period which the retrospectivity of this bill encompasses were it not for that portion of the bill. I believe that such an imposition is intolerable. I urge the government to do the right thing and at least consider refunding to Volvo the application fees it has paid, which I understand total close to $60,000. Volvo made its application in good faith, believing as it did that the legislation allowed it to ask for a refund of duty paid, and the government should refund those fees. There are proposals in this budget to imand pose in effect a retrospective burden on thousands upon thousands of Australians who have saved their long service leave and/or their holidays for a future benefit. I remind bill the House that the Secretary of the New abhor South Wales Trades and Labour Council this last week described this particular budget item as 'an act of bastardry'.  Speaker: I understand that the appropriation bills are before the House. I think it is inaporiginate propriate for the honourable member to refer to bills that are before the House.",52
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I attach some importance to the point of order. There is also the question of relevancy. But it has been a quiet period, and I am sure the honourable member would not wish to abuse the normal debating procedures here, so I would ask him to return to the topic, please.",55
118,Mr CHARLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Thank· you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The issue over and over again is that of retrospectivity. I urge this House and the executive of this government to consider a proposal which I have put forward that might help solve some of these problems. We should make the committees of this House statutory committees rather than committees by leave of each parliament. In between the first and second reading debates of each bill we should send the bill off to .the relevant committee for consideration. The committee might decide to accept the bill as written. It might decide it is a bad bill and send it back to the government. It might decide to propose amendments which would make better law. The executive and the government know that, through their numbers, they control the numbers in committee. But committees are bipartisan in nature. The honourable member  on a committee over two years. We achieved some really objective, forward thinking reports which we brought to this House, one of which has now been almost entirely accepted by government and written into law. Almost every recommendation we made was ultimately accepted by government, and we did it in a bipartisan manner. In the opening of that report into student financial assistance we slammed the government and the bureaucracy. We gave them no mercy. But we said, 'Here are a number of solutions which we believe collectively, in a bipartisan manner, will help make Austudy a better system'. And we were right. Eventually, over time, the government has come to see the logic of the work that we did. I maintain that we would catch many of the errors in these bills at this point, where they in the House of Representatives, and we would fix those errors long before we have to come back in here once again and argue about retrospectivity. The government should think carefully about my proposal. There is only one problem with my proposal and that is that we have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is so detennined to exercise at the pinnacle the power of his position and the power of the executive that, I have maintained more than once, he will make this House of Representatives superfluous. Look at the galleries: how many people are here, Mr Deputy Speaker? Look at the House: the House is almost empty. Day after day, time after time, the journalists fill the gallery and the television cameras operate when? During question time, a time of confrontation. Do they any longer concentrate on what is said in debate in this place? Does anyone care what I am saying? Will anyone read it tomorrow? Will it be on the front page of one of our daily newspapers? Will it be on television tomorrow? The answer is no, no, no, no. Only a very tiny fraction of the bills that we debate in this place is ever picked up by the media, because we took parliamentary debates off the ABC and put them on a frequency that nobody can ever find or get good reception on. Question time is all that people are interested in, because the executive rams everything through this parliament. I note that our Prime Minister is not happy with just being Prime Minister. At question time today, he reckoned he wants to be Queen as well.  was not much with which I agreed in the speech of' the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), but I do want to pick up on the points with which I do agree and they relate to the committee system. The honourable member may not be aware that in the last parliament a package of reform for House procedure was taken to the then Leader of Opposition Business who rejected it. The Standing Committee on Procedure has the unique opportunity in its current reference, which looks at the procedures of the House and in particular the committee system, to make some worthwhile reforms. Maybe they are not as radical as everyone might like, but I am sure we have an opportunity to make some worthwhile reforms. It requires not only government members to respond to that opportunity but also opposition members, particularly the Liberal Party, to take this opportunity seriously. I make a plea to the honourable member to ensure that that happens. Clearly, the Senate committee system has broken some new ground. We ought to try to examine what the Senate has done well and what it has perhaps done not so well. For example, I would advocate-I will return to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill after this point-that we should have joint estimates committees because they are a real way of examining the portfolios and getting a better understanding. The reference of annual reports to committees is working well. As indicated by the honourable member for La Trobe, we should seriously examine whether legislation should also be referred to committees. If people were listening to the debate-they are not, because it is not broadcast-they would think that the opposition is opposing this bill, but I understand that it is not. (Quorum formed) It is a tragedy for the car industry when the opposition resorts to tactics like calling for quorums in what is a most important debate. I am shocked that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said that the car industry has held Australians hostage because of the car plan that this government has been pleased to introduce. It is a tragedy that the opposition does not understand that the bill proposes to close a loophole. It is not an issue of retrospective legislation; it is a question some importers wanting to flout the car plan and, in this instance, rip off about $500 million that might otherwise have been spent on a whole range of worthwhile purposes. When some companies want to take advantage of a drafting error, we should not have the spectacle of members of the opposition standing up here and saying that these people should be allowed to take advantage of loopholes; that an intention of the government that they should not receive up to $500 million should be ignored and that they should be able to rip away to the tune of $500 million. I am sure it is going to come as a surprise to pensioners because, when there has been an overpayment by the Department of Social Security, I have never heard an opposition member say, 'Well, the pensioner should not have to pay back that $50 or $100 overpayment'. But, the opposition says it is okay for its industrial mates to rip off $500 million. This is the argument that the opposition has 'been pursuing in the House. That comes as a shock to me. I am also shocked that the opposition has learnt nothing about the way Australians feel about getting our manufacturing industry going. It is to the eternal credit of this government and former Senator Button that the car plan was introduced. It absolutely transformed the motor vehicle industry so that it is becoming more internationally competitive. The government wants to make it stronger and even more competitive. It is an absolute disgrace for the honourable member for Curtin to say that car manufacturers are holding Australia hostage by not allowing imports. The opposition never mentions the good work that the government, the manufacturers and the unions have done in transforming-as the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) has mentioned-the workplace situation from one of hostility, poor productivity and confrontation into one which involves people actually sitting down and problem solving, improving the standards of our car manufacturing, improving the standards of our parts manufacturing and enabling something of like $1.2 billion worth of exports. This is an outstanding success story; one that I would have thought the opposition would have welcomed. However, the opposition has learnt nothing. It has learnt nothing from its attacks on this industry in the last election when it wanted to introduce zero tariffs; it has learnt nothing about the fact that there can be a very legitimate role for tripartite operations in particular industries. The honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Curtin wanted to raise the taxation situation regarding inground pools. I want to say how virtuous they were towards the people of Australia. But, I did not once hear them say that the opposition was going to introduce a GST. I did not once hear them say what the impact on in-ground swimming pools would have been under a GST. Mr Lindsay-Did they mention Fightback?  Fightback. This standard of hypocrisy not only affects the opposition so terribly, but it affects all politicians. What the constituents want is a little bit of honest, free and frank talking. So, waltzing into this place and saying that this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is a terrible example of retrospective legislation is way off beam. The Australian public does not support those who have deliberately-whether by exploiting a fault in the law or by creative accounting-rip off the public purse. If anything, the Australian public wants to see more of these people brought to justice. It astounds me that the opposition can come in here advocating that it is good public policy to protect importers who, because of a drafting error, want to rip off up to $500 million from the taxpayers of Australia. I intend to point this out to my constituents in my electorate of Chifley, and I suggest should be pointed out to the constituents of every honourable member in this House. Mr Bilney-Not least those in the electorate of Kingston.  Kingston, who have an excellent memberone who has stood the test of time, so to speak, but who maintains a keen and vital interest in the car industry. When businesses connive to exploit loopholes, and when government introduces legislation to rectify that situation, it is absurd for the honourable member for La Trobe to suggest that this introduces: some element of uncertainty in the conduct of business. Certainly, business wants clear directions and wants to understand where the government is going and the import of the scheme. Mr Atkinson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",55
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Well, if he would not mind, would the honourable member for ChifleyMr Atkinson-I draw your attention to the state of the House., There is not a quorum, and the honourable member is speaking.",57
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Because the hour is 6.30 p.m., the sitting is suspended until 8 p.m.",57
121,Unknown,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.  about the customs legislation. I was making some observations on some of the comments of opposition members. One interesting comment which I found to be somewhat incongruous was when the honourable member for La Trobe was bewailing the fact that there had been a drafting error. It is also true to say that the Senate is imposing crushing deadlines on government legislation which, quite frankly, I think both sides of the House should object to. There is no doubt that it is putting a lot of pressure on not only departments but also the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. It comes as no surprise to me that in fact there are errors in the legislation and that there is a need to bring forward legislation to rectify them. What surprises me is that thete that it are comments from honourable members opposite suggesting that we should not redress a loophole that could cost taxpayers up to $500 million and thwart the plan itself. I have already passed an observation about the industry needing certainty, but I must say that some months ago I was very distressed when the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), whilst in America, released a press release with the following title: Ford confirms it could leave Australia There could be nothing more damaging than a shadow minister, when overseas, making such a suggestion following discussions he has had. That press release has become quite notorious. Indeed, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) suggested that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) should discipline his shadow Treasurer. I also wish to dwell on another important issue. The car plan, as I mentio,ned, shows that government, industry and unions can work together. The defence industry policy is a further good example of some of the very good things that can come out of such a relationship. I think I can claim to know a little bit about defence industry poJicy. Along with so many other people on Saturday, it was a pleasure of mine to be in South Australia for the launching of the Collins class submarine by Lady Collins. I think it is a real milestone for Australian industry. Honourable members will recall that, prior to this government coming to office some 10 years ago, approximately 25 per cent of defence capital purchasing was from local firms and 75 per cent was from overseas. The submarine represents a dramatic change to that ratio. Now, about 70 per cent of all work is being sourced locally and some 30 per cent is imported from overseas. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, it represents a magnificent advance by Australian industry and demonstrates exactly what Australian industry can do. The most exciting prospect, apart from the fact that a further five submarines will be launched with an all-up cost of something under $5 billion, is that in fact Australia very well be able to satisfy some of the regional needs for submarines by working in close cooperation with our neighbours and by offering the Collins class to them for consideration. This will represent a huge change. Studies have indicated that the submarines have made a difference of about $1.8 billion to the South Australian economy. Many jobs have been directly created, and even more have been indirectly created. The car plan, steel industry plan, telecommunications, communications and the defence industry represent, as I say, a cooperative effort between governments, manufacturers and trade unions in the interests of the nation. (Quorum formed) , It is a disgrace that, when I am talking about the Collins submarine, members of the opposition, the communists over there, want to go and call a quorum. Those opposite are a disgrace. They do not want a manufacturing industry; they take no pride in Australia's defence or in the achievements of Australian defence industries. They are an absolute, total disgrace. Western Australia is getting the submarines-(llme expired)",57
122,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (8.08 p.m.)The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill before the parliament tonight is probably more interesting due to the circumstances of its introduction than for the actual details involved. In fact, it is a bill brought before the parliament to correct some mistakes in previous legislation and consequently it draws the parliament's attention to why this.is so. This is another piece of legislation, designed to correct mistakes in legislative drafting, which will escape the scrutiny of this parliament due simply to the limited time afforded to honourable members to properly scrutinise such legislation, both outside and inside the parliament. That is probably what escaped the understanding of the honourable  complained that recent decisions taken in the Senate would make this more difficult. I have made the point on numerous occasions before in this place that the difficulty for the parliament is in not only the time available to actually debate bills, but. also the simple fact may that over the years we have seen the compression of time between introduction and actual debate. No politician in this place is an expert on every issue. We rely very heavily on the advice of the community and community interest groups. If very complex bills are introduced on a Thursday to be debated the following Tuesday, there is only one certainty: that those responsible, particularly in the the opposition, have little time to go through the process of ensuring that the legislation is workable and that community interests are protected. The decision taken in the Senate to demand of this House that it deals with its legislation, or at least introduces it, as early as possible will, once the parliament and the front-bench of the government come. to grips with the organisational difficulties, be of benefit to everyone. In fact, it just might be that the cabinet will be able more frequently to identify mistakes of the nature that we are here to correct. I have previously. said in this House that I consider the log jam of bills at the end of a session to be more than a conspiracy of the executive; I have always thought it to be something of a conspiracy of the bureaucracy. Sir Humphrey found it very convenient on many occasions to ensure that not even the government knew what it was passing. We have recently received suggestions from the Blewett committee about how the parliament might operate better. If those suggestionswere to include arguments for all routine legislation set down for a session to be introduced in the first fortnight of the House of Representatives sittings and then to be programmed sensibly, the committee would get even more support for the excellent work it is obviously doing. The second point to be noted about this legislation is that it seeks to pre-empt the decision of the courts. SOme honourable members have referred to that situation today. Consequently, the ranting of the Prime - inister today, when he accused the opposition of wishing to overturn a decision of the High Court, as though the High Court is somehow immutable and above this parliament-more importantly, above the peopledemonstrates the government's hypocrisyThe opposition's actions here tonight prove that it is seeking to do no such thing. The advice given to the government is that there is a possibility, as the legislation is presently constructed, that the courts would probably overturn it. So we are here tonight to change the goalposts-retrospectively-and we are doing that for the simple purpose of ensuring that the High Court, or whatever court was involved, does not have the opportunity to do what it otherwise would have done: recommend the· refund of something like $500 million to. some car manufacturers or, in this case, importers of fully built vehicles. They would have the money refunded and, presumably, it would then have filtered back over time to the people, the purchasers of vehicles. Mr Rocher-It would have been taxed for income purposes anyway.",58
123,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"That is right. When the Prime - inister (-r Keating) came out with his position on - abo, when he wanted Australians to understand that the High Court had spoken and that was to be the end of the issue-after seven persons, appointed to their positions, had stood up and made some decisions on their behalf-he wanted us to believe that nothing could be done about it. Well, here we are doing something about the situation. As I recollect, in our first 10 sitting days we actually dealt with another piece of legislation where the High Court had spoken. It was a case relating to - r Skase and bankruptcy which had gone through the courts and the government's legislation had been found wanting. So we changed it-this parliament overruled the High Court. Mr Rocher-We do it all the time.",59
124,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"We do it on numerous occasions every sitting. I want to destroy the myth that we do not. Of course, it is this piece of legislation that gives such a practical example of the rights of this parliament. It would be a dreadful place if they were in any other form. In practical terms, there is no difference between what we are doing today and any action that the parliament might take to overturn any other legal decision of the High Court or any other court in Australia. As was just interjected by the honourable member for Curtin, we do it all the time. When the courts determine something to be unconstitutional, the parliament's response is limited. The parliament's only option then is to refer the issue to the people by way of a referendum. When the courts rule something to be unconstitutional we still have the option to overturn the decision by referring the issue to the people by way of a referendum. This afternoon the Prime - inister was again ranting on about a political party having the temerity to suggest that a referendum was an option in an issue of great national importance. We have heard the other peopleMr Rocher-He's stressed out.",59
125,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Prime Minister is off the planet. He is starting to demonstrate his total incapacity to cope. He is a man of ideas who cannot deliver. He is an absolute embarthe rassme-t to me when he delivers a written speech. I think he has reading difficulties, really do. He cannot get his head more than about three inches above his written speech. We all know that prime ministers have to speeches-that they cannot go out and ad lib an issue'. on important issues-but he is dreadful. His predecessor, Bob Hawke, was a brilliant of presenter of a written speech, but this bloke is hopeless. He is an embarrassment. He should practise because Australians expect their Prime Minister to be a little different. This morning the Prime Minister was. raving and ranting on this issue, raving and ranting about somebody having the temerity to suggest that there might be circumstances-no more than that-in which the Mabo issue would be resolved by going to the people. I am astounded that a Prime Minister or anyabout body else could stand up here and criticise holding of a referendum. The Premier of Victoria made a very telling point, which should not be lost on the Prime Minister, and that was that we are here govern: It might be an idea for the Prime Minister to work out how he should govern in the people's interests on this he is now getting some pretty conflicting i-formation from his own backbench about what they are hearing out in the electorate. It is interesting. I have a friend in Sydney who is involved in the racing industry and who gave me hell over the GST in the leadmuch up to the election. He told me constantly wrong we were. He also told me on the point, phone-this may be of interest to those in the government -'Mr Rocher-He changed his mind?",60
126,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No. He said, 'You know, Wils, I think that this Mabo. business is Paul Keating's GST'. That is what he told me and, unfortunately, he is not a bad judge, either of racehorses or politics. The simple fact is that there are a lot of people on the other side of the House getting that message in their constituencies. Yet the Prime Minister is so thick or arrogant that he will not listen. Fancy any politician getting up and saying, 'The people cannot be trusted'. We have. seen letters to the editors. All those with this blinkered view of what Australia needs, I desperately fighting against a referendum, know what the outcome is going to be. They are so high and mighty and above it all that read they say 'You cannot go to the people with There are some rather interesting examples the ability of the Australian people to make the right decision. The one that I would like to draw to the attention of the House is when Bob Menzies tried to outlaw the Communist Party. I was old enough at the time to know what was going on and understand the issue. I could certainly understand the heat and hatred in the community that was generally applied to the Communist Party in those days. There were all those goings-on in Berlin and a lot of other things. People were really upset it. What happened? Menzies brought his the legislation to the parliament and, of course, had it passed. The High Court then ruled that it was unconstitutional. Menzies went to the people, and he lost. He did not lose because people loved the Communist Party but beto cause they were not prepared to give any government the power to outlaw a political party or erode our political structures. They issue because showed good judgment. Mr Rocher-Or the rule of law.",60
127,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"That is right. But for the Prime Minister to stand up in here today and belittle the referendum process does not say for his ideas of democracy. He belittles how the Australian people. It is an interesting because he was at pains to misrepresent the position that the Liberal Party took yesterday. It was a great victory, might I add, for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when the party moved that it: . . . believes that if the Prime Minister fails to come to an effective agreement with the States and seeks to act unilaterally with Federal Legislation, the Federal Parliamentary Party should consider all options which are consistent with maintenance of the respcnsibility of the States for control of land title including a referendum which reaffirms that responsibility. That is hardly a blind jump into the bucket of a referendum. Maybe the Prime Minister could have said something about that in his rantings. This legislation is all about the problems that confront our democratic structure in this place of greed. The government has been rushing legislation through the parliament. It has not considered it properly itself, and of course it has never given the opposition an opportunity to assist it in these matters. We are here doing something we do not like doing very much-supporting retrospective legislation. I can assure those opposite that was of deep concern to me, as one of those people who voted against Malcolm Fraser's retrospective tax legislation-along with the honourable member for Curtin, as I recollect; we have kept our very strong principles on this issue",60
128,Mr GEAR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Until now.,61
129,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Here we are: unhappy, but recognising the government's great dilemma. We do not want it to lose another $500 million in these circumstances. But it does not deserve our help because it has made such a mess. Those opposite have made a mess because they have been smart alecs, trying to rush legislation through this House when, quite frequently, there was no need to do so. This legislation is a classic example. If the government had taken another three months to get the original bill through the parliament it would not have made all that much difference-it probably took the government two years to make up its mind. Another aspect of this legislation is of considerable concern to me-and I hope that . the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) might be able to give us some assurances on behalf of the government in light of the fact that we did give the government our support on this issue. The fact is that we are shifting the goal posts and, as a consequence, those who have made legitimate claims for the refund of this duty should have their deposits refunded. The simple fact is that these people made applications and lodged the appropriate deposits. They should not lose their deposits because the goal posts are being shifted. I sincerely hope the government will give those assurances in the circumstances. Everybody is allowed to test the law in this country. If there is a financial commitment involved and the government responds by changing the law, the people should not lose because of that. I am very hopeful that the government will give that assurance because it is another area of concern. It is still fundamental that we are here patching up a mistake and we are pre-empting any decision of the High Court. As such, it these issues have to be better understood in the community because there is no doubt that the government has messed up on this matter. It is going to mess up on Mabo, as it has messed up on so many other issues. It is interesting that, unless the Prime Minister comes out of his bunker, he might even mess up on the republic. As I told our people yesterday, he is running around with a lovely packaged box, but when it is opened there is nothing in it; I would refer him to consumer affairs. It is about time he told us what he meant because nobody knows. I was delighted to see Turnbull interviewed by Paul Lyneham the other day",61
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Mr Jenkins)Order! I think I have been rather tolerant of the honourable member for O'Connor in his tortuous arguments in this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, but I hope he will be getting back to the subject matter of the bill.",61
131,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I just got a note from a very important bloke in our party telling me to make sure that I went for my full time. The whole issue I have touched upon is of great importance to me and to the industry. Let me take the opportunity in my remaining few minutes to talk about the car industry, as others have. I guess only time will tell whether the car industry workers, many of whom would have voted Labor, backed the right horse at the last election when one looks at what has happened to their industry in this budget. The first act of the government is to make it a lot more expensive for people to drive all vehicles, and it is making it a lot more expensive to buy vehicles. These problems will impact directly on the industry's ability to do business. The car industry is still delicately poised; is certainly not in boom times. It astounds me that the government has chosen to affect the industry'S future viability in this way as compared with other issues. There is no doubt that the recent devaluations of the Australian dollar have been beneficial to the car industry. We were proposing to take about $800 off the up-front manufacturing costs of the industry. I cannot work out why its cost accountants were not able to work out that that was a far better proposition than the one it acceptedsome five or 10 per cent differential in tariff by the year 2000. Within two years of coming to office, we would have reduced the operating costs of building a car in Australia by $800. Whether it be in the wine industry, in the car industry or in any other situation today, the issue is import competition. It is nice to mouth off about exports-thank goodness we have them and thank goodness they are growing. But the simple fact of life is that no industry will survive in any country without a well-established local market. The wine industry is trying to tell the government that, although it does not seem to be able to understand it. Of course, there is no basis for the possibility of exporting motor vehicles unless the local market is as large and as profitable as possible for our car producers. This is the other side of the equation. I point it out time and time again to people in my electorate who have responded to the call from small business spokesmen on the other side saying, 'But small business does not pay payroll tax'. I ask them, 'Have you got a motor car?'. They say, 'Yes'. I say, 'A car is made out of steel and plastic. Steel is made out of iron ore and coal. Iron ore producers pay payroll tax and coal producers pay payroll tax'. But the worse part about that sort of tax is that the industry actually builds it into its costs and puts a profit margin on it. It on-sells to BHP, which pays payroll tax and puts a profit margin on its own payroll tax and in fact the payroll tax of the miners. BHP sells the steel to the component manufacturers. They pay payroll tax and they put a profit on their payroll tax, the BHP payroll tax and the it miners' payroll tax. It goes on and on, and by the time we shift all those bits around this huge country-we added $1,000 a week, prebudget, to the operating costs of every semitrailer; and the Parliamentary Secretary, who represents a remote area, should understand that it all adds up to $800 in the manufactured cost of every motor car which has to be paid whether the manufacturers export or not. (Time expired)",61
132,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (8.28 p.m.}-in reply-This has been an interesting debate from the government side because of the eloquent elucidation and understanding of the government's car plan and industry policy as it affects the automobile industry in this country. Against that we had the speeches by opposition members on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill-with the exception of one speaker who concentrated on everything under the sun but the bill at hand. I congratulate the honourable member for  common sense approach to the bill. He made a constructive speech in which he displayed an obvious knowledge of the automobile industry. That is in stark contrast to the lack of knowledge displayed by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in some of his more recent utterances about how government policy affects the automobile industry in this country. This legislation concerns a number of decisions taken by the government over a period of time. The amendments do not take away benefits, nor do they impose any additional burdens. Manufacturers who were properly entitled to benefits as a corollary to the export of vehicles or components receive those benefits throughout the period in question. Those who are not entitled to the benefits pay the, appropriate duty on relevant importations. These amendments do not seek to retrospectively tax those who legitimately used export credits to offset their duty liability, nor does it impose any additional burden on those such as Volvo (Australia) Pty Ltd-a company mentioned by one of the opposition speakers-which paid duty in respect of imports. The history of this matter is quite simple. In March'1991, the government announced an enhancement of the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan by providing for component manufacturers to be able to use export credits they had earned under the plan with effect from 1 January 1991. The government's decision in March 1991 on the Industry Commission Report No.5 dated 17 December 1990 meant, among other things, that restrictions on the direct use of export credits by component producers would be removed. This was announced in the March 1991 statement by the government called Building a competitive Australia. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 10 of 1991 which was introduced on 15 October 1991, and which was operative from 1 January 1991, put this decision into place. The propobility sal was incorporated in schedule 2 to the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1992, that is, Act No. 96 of 1992. By-laws Nos 9140073 and 9140074 were signed by the delegate of the Comptroller-General on 18 October 1991. These by-laws were intended to describe goods which can be imported by component producers. Both the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in particular and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Thckey) made reference to a consultant's claims for fees. Mr Rocher-I didn't mention any consultant.",62
133,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The honourable member mentioned it in respect of a claim for fees. notice that he referred toMr Rocher-By the importer.,63
134,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"By an importer; an importer's claims for fees, I assume, through a consultant. Apparently, what the honourable member for Curtin was trying to say-I am not sure whether he said it but at least he tried to say it-was that the importer's or the consultant's view was that the wording of the by-law did not require the importer to hold export credits. The importer or the consultant, depending on what interpretation one places on the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin, was told on 22 February 1993 that the issue was beyond doubt and that legislation would be put into effect to remove any doubt with respect to this particular legislation. A new by-law No. 9340039 was issued with effect from 1 March 1992. A decision was also taken that item 41A in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 was to be amended to clarify the government's intention that passenger motor vehicles can be imported only by the holder of the import credit. I am not too sure whether the honourable member for Curtin was aware of that; I assume that he was not. If he was aware of it, his speech does not make sense. If he was not aware of it, I am explaining it to him now. These amendments that are the subject of this debate put beyond doubt the construction of item 41A of schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and, in so doing, remove the possithat a non-plan participant could import motor vehicles duty-free without' export credits under the export facilitation scheme. As the honourable member for Curtin well knows, they also confirm the government's policy intent under the passenger motor vehicle manufacturing plan that, for an importer to benefit under paragraph 41A(a) of schedule 4 to the act, the importer must be the owner of a determination under the export facilitation scheme. Mr Rocher-You would have won that under the Acts Interpretation Act.",63
135,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I will respond to the honourable member for Curtin, who refers to I the Acts Interpretation Act as having some sort of relevance in respect of this debate. Let me tell the honourable member for Curtin that the Acts Interpretation Act is not relevant to the bill before the House. The Acts Interpretation Act is a matter which a court can take into account when determining the meaning of words in an act. It is about time that the honourable member for Curtin got on top of his subject matter instead of coming into this chamber and talking about issues which he patently knows little about. The government's car plan is one of the best known and long established of its industry plans. The government, through the then industry minister, former Senator John Button, introduced the car plan, as the honourable member for Curtin well.knows, back in May 1984. This plan was aimed at establishing an internationally competitive automotive industry which provided Australians with quality, affordable cars. Under the plan, quotas which had provided very high, effective levels of protection were to be phased out over eight years and the tariff set at 57.5 per cent. An export facilitation scheme for the five plan producers of passenger motor vehicles at that time was established. In early 1988, a mid-term review of the car plan was undertaken which concluded that the devaluation of the Australian dollar in the mid-1980s provided an opportunity to increase the pace of restructuring of the industry. Accordingly, tariff quotas were abolished and the tariff was reduced to 45 per cent, reducing annually by 2.5 per cent to 35 per cent in 1992. Increased limits on credits earned under the export facilitation scheme were made available. In accordance with the 1988 announcement, the future of the car plan-that is, post1992-was reviewed by the Industry Commission late in 1990, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. That led, as I said, to the government's automotive policy to the year . 2000 and the Prime Minister's March 1991 statement Building a competitive Australia. The· objectives of the new policy were essentially the same as those put forward in the original car plan. The principal elements of the new policy were, firstly, a continuation of the rate of tariff phasing of 2.5 per cent imports of passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components, leading to a 15 per cent tariff by the year 2000. The tariff is currently 32.5 per cent and will be 30 per cent next year. Secondly, there was the removal of restrictions on the earning and direct use of export credits, including by component producers. The elements of the car plan,. in particular the tariff rates applicable on imports, and the operation of the export facilitation scheme, have been clearly understood and accepted by the automotive industry. That is the point I want to make to the honourable member for Curtin, for whom I have much respect, but he is wrong on this issue. Under the current policy, the industry has been transformed into an export industry. Automotive exports were worth $1.2 billion in 1992, as other speakers have stated. Component manufacturers have developed as a result of the policy which has facilitated access to the internal markets of the international automotive companies. For example, the emission control supplier, Johnson Matthey Ltd, signed contracts in the last year worth $400 million for the export of catalytic converters to Rover, Peugeot and Jaguar. In recent years, the gap in quality between local and imported vehicles has been closed, as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) rightly observed. Mitsubishi now exports vehicles to Japan, the United States and Germany. The value of vehicle exports is expected to be $350 million in 1993. Toyota's Australian plant is ranked second among Toyota plants worldwide in quality-and all credit to Mr Johnston. Toyota expects that almost one-third of its Altona production will be exported, building up to a value of $600 million by the year 2000. Current forecasts for local car makers indicate real investment growth of 19 per cent in the 1993-96 period compared with 198992, reaching the projected level objective of $2 billion. Government policies have succeeded in producing a strong passenger motor vehicle industry with the lowest levels of protection in Asia outside Japan. The rules were well known to the members of the plant. on The industry well knew what the rules were. No loss has been suffered by anyone, none at all. Mr Rocher-Why do you need to legislate?",63
136,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The point of legislation is to clarify beyond all doubt what the law is. Mr Rocher-So they didn't know.,64
137,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"They did know what the law was. It is to clarify beyond all doubt. Everybody else knew, except I assume the consultant or the person associated with Volvo. I also thank those who contributed in this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Corio (-r O'Connor) made a very constructive contribution. It is evident that he has a clear understanding of the government's car plan and of the benefits that the plan has brought to the Australian automotive industry. I thank the honourable member for Corinella - Griffin) for his excellent dissertation on a number of aspects of the automobile industry, and for his constructive remarks on the positive industrial relations change that has occurred in the industry under a Labor government. I also thank. the honourable member for Chifley for his eloquent statement of the government's achievements in that area. I appreciate the remarks of the honourable member for Forrest who-in my view, from the experience that I have had with him across this table-has always adopted a common sense approach in dealing with legislation. He clearly has a very bright future in the opposition. He certainly, compared with the shadow Treasurer, is far more competent and outstanding in his understanding and knowledge of various economic issues. The honourable member for Curtin spoke of at retrospectivity. He knows; as well as I do, implications of the case of the King against Kidman and the decision by - r Higgins in that case that this legislation is quite lawful and quite proper. He knows all about that. His various remarks earlier this evening were made, I assume, with tongue in cheek because, if he were a shadow minister in this chamber, and had made those remarks with respect to car components he would have been hauled over the coals by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The remarks by the honourable member for La Trobe (-r Charles) were simply, in my view, an eloquent harangue on swimming here'. pools. He carefully avoided any mention of Fightback and the industrial relations policy, which has not been changed yet under the coalition. I know that some members of the opposition have an ideology bent to oppose simply for the sake of opposing. But there honourable members on the other side of the House who do make-and occasionally the honourable member for Curtin does when he has a mind to it-constructive contributions towards very important issues that affect our country. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr Rocher--,-I ask that my dissent be recorded in accordance with provisions in standing orders.",64
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Mr Jenkins)That dissent will be so recorded. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. - otion (br Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.,65
139,Mr ROCHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the - inister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (-r Lindsay) obviously had the chance to look at my remarks if he were not listening attentively when I spoke and to hear exactly what I said. He chose not to do that and to imply meaning which would not be gleaned from the words I actually used in my speech the second reading stage. It is therefore the unfortunate that he seeks· to base a case on some misunderstanding that he may have had Justice about what I actually said. What he did say in his rather lamentable justification of the government's approach to this matter is that intention is irrelevant. That seems to me strange, because it was specifically mentioned in the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary. It was a main plank of justification for retrospective legislation. Apparently, in the meantime, the parliamentary secretary has had some advice from his advisers in the box and he has said, 'The Acts Interpretation Act has no application For what reason, he did not make plain. Let me tell the parliamentary secretary that, if it were not·a matter of intention on which the Collector of Customs was to rely, the collector certainly gave that impression to the claimants of refunds. They were made certain are in no obscure terms whatsoever that the existing legislation was adequate. That being the case, I argued-and so did others on this sidethat it should be a matter for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to determine. Failing satisfaction on the part of the claimants with that decision or any decision from the AAT, the claimants may then, under procedures laid down in the relevant customs legislation, refer the matter to the Federal Court. What could be fairer than that? One goes to the court and one gets a decision. If one cannot rely on intention-and the parliamentary secretary has admitted that he cannot and did not rely on that in his main plank justification for the legislation-let the matter go before the respective tribunals. The .truth is that this matter is a stuff-up. It is parallel to what the then Commissioner of Taxation did to the coalition government in relation to bottom of the harbour schemes way back in the early 1980s. The commissioner came along and said, 'I haven't got the law to deal with these crooks'. They were crooks; no-one denies that the perpetrators of the schemes were crooks.",65
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Mr Jenkins)Order! i· remind the honourable member for Curtin that the third reading debate is a rather narrow debate which should be to the final form and content of the bill. He should not too widely reopen the second reading debate.,66
141,Mr ROCHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I did not mention that matter in the second reading debate, nor did anyone else. To quickly get off the point, the commissioner came back, got his retrospective legislation, then found in a subsequent court decision that he had jurisdiction under section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The point I really wanted to make in the narrow confines of the bill was that the bureaucracy will come back to its ministers and say that it wants more law when it already has adequate law. I suggest that that is the situation in this case. At least the adequacy of the existing law should be tested. It never has been, although the Collector of Customs said .to the claimants-and to all and sundry· I understand who have bothered to ask-that the law as it stood was adequate, and that the claims were bound to fail. Instead, the government has resorted to retrospectivity. The other thing that the minister has gone on to do-because it is part of the rhetoric and the propaganda, and I guess there is an excuse for that-is to refer to the car plan. This has absolutely no relevance to the efficacy or otherwise of the car plan. If the claims submitted by importers were successful, and there is a question mark about that, it has no effect on the car plan at all. It is all history. The sales have been made; it has nothing to do with what has happened in the past. It does not affect the competitiveness of the local producer against the imported product. It has got nothing to do with that at all. I understand that he wants to make a political point about the car plan, but· I stress that it has got nothing to do with this legislation whatsoever. It is quite irrelevant. In conclusion, I would prefer to let thcourt decide, without the government resorting to retrospective legislation. The Collector of Customs seems to be so confident in his position. I am not a lawyer, but I would tend to agree with his assessment. It was the intention of the government in its original legislation to close off any opportunity for importers to escape duty. If that is the case, let it be sorted out before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If the plaintiffs or claimants in that case were not happy with the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal let them, at their expense and at great risk of incurring substantial expense, p-t it before the Federal Court. Let the Federal court decide. We do not have to resort to retrospective legislation when there is perfectly adequate law already in place and the adequacy of that law is admitted by the bureaucracy in the person of the Collector of Customs. That is the point I want to make and the point that was conveniently overlooked by the parliamentary secretary. 1f he had read the plain meaning of my words-he had the opportUnity to get the greens ftom Hansardhe could not have arrived at the conclusion he did. He did not do it. He can shake his finger at me all he likes, but I know he did not do it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr TIM F1SCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (8.52 p.m.)-I am very happy to speak on the resumption of the debate on one· of the worse budgets ever presented to this parliament, Labor's 1993 budget of betrayal. Rarely in Australian political history has a budget been as quickly deserted and in many ways destroyed as has been the 1993 budget of the Treasurer (-r Dawkins). . I note that the Assistant Treasurer (-r Gear) is at the table. Typical of reaction to the. budget all around the countryside is an article in a copy of the Rockhampto'n Bulletin. Under the heading 'Under Siege' there is a photo of the Assistant Treasurer and the very marginal Labor honourable member for Capricornia - s Henzell). And they are under siege, The Assistant Treasurer was trying to defend the indefensible and, of course, he failed in that regard. As things stand, the Treasurer does not yet know what is in or what is out of his budget presented a fortnight ago. This is the Treasurer who said that the budget was not a negotiating document. Negotiations are going on in the morning, the afternoon and the evening. The famous right wing meeting this morning concluded with a list of demands of what was and was not acceptable to it in the changes sought to be brought about in this budget. Just a fortnight later, the whole budget is up for grabs. Since the time - artin Ferguson made the statement in plain English, 'It is impossible to defend the indefensible', the writing has been on the wall in relation to this budget. Now we know that the whole document has collapsed like a pack of cards and along with it any shred of credibility that the Treasindustry. urer, the Prime - inister (-r Keating) and indeed the whole government ever had. It was interesting to go to the Senate tonight and listen to the debate on the budget and hear Senator Sandy - acdonald making his maiden speech. Not only those· in both houses of parliament but those in just about every house in the landscape of Australia realise they have been sold a dud with this budget of betrayal. They are angry about this budget and they want to see the parliament react to the budget in a responsible way. I would now like to address some of the specifics of the budget. In relation to the matter of fuel, the fuel excise tax increases were an ill-considered and regressive slug on all Australians. Despite the government's fall back position on fuel, the fuel excise increase on leaded flJel of 7c a litre will raise an additional $4.9 billion in revenue, which means more than $8 billion in terms of total fuel excise for this financial year. This is an absolutely outrageous tax slug on Australian motorists, poor Australians, drivers of leaded vehicles, Australian farmers and, above all else, Australian exporters. These costs will be passed through the production chain at every level. Further, they discriminate against those who live outside the capital cities and whose goods are transported sometimes long distances before they· are purchased. It should. not go unnoticed that, just to rub motorists' noses in it, whilst the government is raking off more and more. from motorists it is spending· less and less on road funding, including roads in the Ipswich area. In return for increasing fuel excise the government is slashing road funding by about half over two years. Commonwealth road funding in 1992-93 is set at $1.6 billion, whilst the budget papers tell us that the estimate for road funding for the next financial year will in fact come down to $813 a million. That is halving of the federal road funding commitment at a time when the road infrastructure across so much of Australia is under great duress and in need of upgrading and modernisation. In short, Labor is absolutely ripping off Australian motorists and the road transport In order to disguise this outrageous increase in fuel taxes, the government tried the argument that this was all for the benefit of Australian children. In this House just over a week ago the Treasurer said that thedecision regarding fuel excise on leaded fuel was made 'essentially for health reasons' because he was 'concerned about the deleterious effects on the intellectual capacity of young children'. Who will forget the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) saying that the fuel tax decision was made 'primarily because we want to protect the childrtm of AustraHa'. What has happened in the last few days? Well might we ask. What has happened about Australian children? The arguments go on in relation to the fuel tax. This gov;ernment will do anything and say anything to justify increased taxes. What we do know about increasing fuel excise is that it is particularly damaging on those whom Labor calls the true believers. It is those who are lesS well off, who live on fringes of our large cities, such as Ipswich, and who therefore have to spend a higher proportion of their income on petrol, who will suffer most, including those also beyond Balranald, Burke and Burketown. It is those in rural and regional AustraHa-and not too many of them are wealthy, thanks to Laborwho have to spend a high proportion of their income on petrol. The decision is not, too bad for those living in Mosman, Woollahra or Elizabeth Bay. Firstly, they do not spend nearly as muc4 on petrol; and secondly, it is more likely they will have a new car which uses unleaded fuel. Recently, there have been some interesting statistics on this from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority. In areas like Chatswood and Castlecrag, fuel outlets dispense 60.9 per cent of their product in the fonn of unleaded fuel. But at Windsor or Richniond only 28.8 per cent of their output is for unleaded fuel. It is a huge disparity, admit. Areas where more than 50 per cent of fuel usage is unleaded include Woollahra, Mosman, North Sydney, Kur-ing-gai and Lane Cove. In contrast, only 37.4 per cent of vehicles use unleaded fuel in the local government area of Bankstown-that is the Prime Minister's electorate-;n areas such asYagoona, Greenacre and Revesby. Pity help the so-called true believers because they are the ones being slugged outrageously and regressively by the very nature of the original proposed fuel excise tax arrangements under this budget-and the ones who, it would seem, continue to be sl1}gged under the adjustments which are still unfolding at 9 the o'clock tonight following a further round of crisis meetings with the right wing caucus, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and just about everybody else. This is the budget that has been rewritten on the hour, every hour, ever since it was produced in this House by the Treasurer. . I now tum to the wine industry. The application of the budget's sales tax slug on the wine industry represents a real and major threat to this vibrant industry. ,The point should be made that the wine industry is highly value added-up to 7 112 times fann the gate value. Honourable members will remember how often we have been lectured by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) on value adding, and here he is slapping down one of the true great value adding industries of Australia-the AustraHan wine industry. To lumber the industry with additional taxes-growers already pay a levy appHed by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation-in addition to a failure to deliver on improvements to the national infrastructure is appalling. ' It needs to be recalled that only one-seventh of the cost of a bottle of wine is that of the grape. The rest is attributable to labour costs, transport, processing and containers. It is this proportion of cost-that is, the remaining sixsevenths of the cost of wine-that bears the brunt of the government's failure to address the problems of infrastructure. In tenns of export, in addition to the overheads associated with the production of a bottle of wine, waterfront charges are likely to be well in I excess of Australia's European or United States competitors. .. What about the domestic scene? Costs of electricity, road improvements and telecommunications are all well in excess of the product's competitors elsewhere in the world. Allied with this is the fact that many of the industry'S producers are well within the small business sector and can ill-afford the costs that are being increasingly added on to the Australian wine. industry. An important factor associated with this industry is that costs are still being borne during the period before any crops are produced. It takes five years or more before any investment is realised by the wine producer. All of this time, the prbducer-the small business person whom the government says it recognises as the key to Australia's prosperity; more so because he is an important exporter-is being driven further into debt. He will be kneecapped on the vital domestic market by a sales tax increase, which is some 55 per cent, lifting the sales tax rate as we speak from 20 to 31 per cent. But honourable members should not hold their breath, because this budget is under massive surgery. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) quite rightly has strongly highlighted the impact that this particular measure will have on the Murrumbidgee irrigation area and so many of the wineries of the Riverina, just to nominate one area. The Australian wine industry is a major contributor to regional growth in the MaBee region, the Riverina region or even the Hastings area and elsewhere. It provides a labour intensive source of employment to many people across Australia. However, at the outset the government fails to deliver on a promise for the wine industry and, indeed, by bringing in this huge sales tax increase, jeopardises the export growth of this wine industry. For example, Brown Brothers at Milawa has gone from nowhere to everywhere, and is today generating some $5 million of exports annually. This tax increase will kneecap that export operation. So ignorant is Treasurer Dawkins that he said today that sales tax does not apply to exports. He is even wrong on that score. It does not apply to exports directwhose ly, but indirectly sales tax applies to large sections of the freight component. Brown Brothers wine has to be shifted from Milawa to the airport to bring about its export. Let have less nonsense from the government. Let us get in there and protect a great and vibrant industry from the treatment it is being given by this government. Let us also look at the tax treatment of leave. Michael Easson, who can hardly be described as a supporter of conservative causes, said that the budget was an 'act of bastardry'. It was more than just the build-up to the ACTU congress, which the Prime Minister will address tomorrow. It has had to pull out every stop to ensure that there is no walkout when the Prime Minister walks into the ACTU congress tomorrow. It will still be a near thing, but no doubt the ACTU will stitch a deal to ensure that there is no walkout on the Prime Minister, although the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) might not get through so - moothly. Retrospective taxation of leave is offensive as a principle. It is an offensive, unfair and unjust tax. Government members know it. That is why they had their crisis right wing caucus meeting today. Just a few days ago a New South Wales policeman came to see me in my Albury electorate office. I will tell honourable members what he told me about the Treasurer's budget. He said that for every minute Treasurer Dawkins was speaking he was dropping $600 of his savings. This is a man who has served the community for decades, who has given dedicated service in a series of postings around Sydney and country areas, who has planned his savings on an appropriate interpretation of the law as it stands and who has accrued these long service leave and annual leave entitlements. The government will strip this man of $20,000 under the original budget version mark 1, although he might get a slightly fairer deal under budget mark 2. But he is just one of thousands of examples. Members of the defence forces-navy, army and air force personnel-will be hit hard, especially as they come from organisations culture is not to take long service leave. Many of them are not permitted to take long service leave and will now be hit so hard by the tax treatment on accrued annual leave us and long service leave. It is grossly unfair, especially on those servicemen who are serving tonight in Cambodia, the Sahara, the Middle East or elsewhere, that they will suddenly have this ripped off them. Government members should think again. They will have to, because the Senate will force them to do so. It is an absolute disgrace that the Treasurer came in here in the first place with a retrospective grab at the savings of workers. He should hang his head in shame for doing so. I now tum to the total lack of strategy in the 1993 budget. The Australian public can understand the need for pain if there is a clear sen-e of strategy, if there is some gain at the end of the day. But this budget is blowing out because of the irresPonsible and undeliverable promises which Labor made during the election campaign. The government never thought that it would have to deliver on them. We have only to read the Prime Minister's famous Friday night speech on election eve. Some ministers were in deep shock on Sunday morning-I confess I was in deep shock for the opposite reason-because they won the election they did not expect to win. The government has had to deliver a budget that basically says, 'We'll deliver X, Y and Z, but you'll be paying more tax on leaded and unleaded petrol, diesel, wine and so forth'. The government wants to go to the Australian people and say to them, 'We are delivering on our promised tax cuts'. Worse still, we go through all this pain and all these tax increases; and at the end of the day what are we left with? We are left with a budget which is still $16,000 million in the red this year and with very little prospect in real terms of getting out of that debt bind over the next four years, the period for which some aspects of the budget documents apply. The truth of the matter is that we have all this pain and very little gain. We have a savage deficit which will do great harm to Australia and to future generations of Australians who will be forced to pay off this debt. That is mirrored by some of the figures released today. It is in every way, shape and form an ugly, unfair, unjust and unwarranted budget which does little to provide the strategic thinking, the strategic vision, which will get this country back on its feet. The budget does little for the export sector as well. Yes, there are some specific programs in relation to boosting trade, with some $99 million to be expended over several years, coming down to about $30 million a year. The truth of the matter is that the sales tax increases on the domestic market directly, and indirectly on exports, and the fuel excise tax increases, especially on diesel, wipe out any gain which might be afforded by the programs provided for under the budget. In other words, we might be taking one small step forward on the trading front-and this country needs to boost its export sector in fundamental termsbut we are taking about 20 steps backwards when the total impact of the budget is examined. If honourable members think they can be complacent about the balance of payment figures today, they certainly cannot. In real terms, imports are still out of kilter in comparison with our export effort. But think of it in another way: are we really getting on top of best international practice? The truth of the matter is that, according to a recent BCA study, we are not. The study made detailed research of five industries-electricity, rail freight transport, telecommunications, road freight transport and the waterfront. I quote from John Ralph's letter arising from this study. He said: The results of the studies to date (with the exception of the road freight study) are not encouraging. In many areas-such as price, quality of service, labour and capital productivity-Australian systems do not compare at all well with world's best practice ... The BCA produced a detailed table as proof of that. He continued: The two most recent studies-road freight transport and waterfront (ports), show that government taxes and port authority charges have operated against the competitiveness of Australian industry as they are substantially higher in Australia than in overseas countries ... The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) has given many examples, especially comparing New Zealand practice and performance with Australian practice and performance. The truth of the matter is that Australia is lagging further and further behind the eight-ball in best international practice. If we think that we can rest on our laurels, let me tell the members of the gallery that Singapore, an island state smaller than the Australian Capital Territory, generates more exports in dollar value than the whole of Australia. While it is a hub port, and that does have some bearing, that is not the full story. Taiwan, which is half the size of Tasmania and has the same population as Australia, generates far more exports in dollar value than the whole of Australia. We have to lift our game. This budget does nothing to lift our game, to provide the proper framework to get our export sector truly on its feet and generate more trade to Asia, the Middle East, greater Asia and the rest of the world as is necessary. We can understand Martin Ferguson saying that he is not going to 'defend the indefensible'; we can understand Michael Easson saying that the budget was an 'act of bastardry'; and we can understand Ross Gittins saying: The more I think about the Budget the more appalled I am by the despicable trick Paul Keating has pulled on the true believers who voted him back into office. Gittins is right: the budget is a betrayal of all Australians. The government has no mandate to increase these taxes. That is why we will oppose the taxes all the way. The government has no legitimacy and, effectively, the 1993 budget is dead in the water.",66
142,Mr LES SCOTT,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) was rather interesting. I thank him for acknowledging the substantial roadworks that have been undertaken in my electorate over the last few years. Mr Bruce Scott-It's called pork-barrelling.,71
143,Mr LES SCOTT,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No. It is necessary to upgrade the highways, as the honourable member for Maranoa would obviously realise because he travels through there quite often. One can just about travel from my electorate now into Brisbane without having to stop at a set of traffic lights. That is as a result of the great cooperation between the commonwealth and state governments. Tonight I was hoping that the Leader of the National Party would give me some substantial matters to respond to. Unfortunately he . has not been able to deliver. That is not surprising because National Party members were running around in the last election wanting to tax everything that moved and everything that did not move, particularly food items, with the proposed goods and services tax. They really have no credibility when they stand up here and start talking about taxation. The Leader of the National Party referred to current speculation around the place-it has been covered by the media well enough tonight; I am sure he would have looked at that as well-about proposed changes to the budget strategy. That is important. Honourable members can get those news briefs off the computers in their offices. Many budgets often have areas which people look at after the budget, and discus, sions go on. Those discussions have been proceeding and genuine concerns have been expressed by a number of people in our community, as honourable members quite rightly point out. We really have to look at the budget itself. Budget strategy must be maintained. The emphasis in this budget is the need to reduce our deficit. A commitment has been made to reduce the deficit to one percent of our GDP by 1996-97. If there have to be some minor changes in the areas contemplated tonight in many media broadcasts and in questions to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) today, they are important matters which should, be looked at. It shows that this government is prepared to listen to the people, which is important. If there are areas of concern, the government is prepared to sit and listen to those people and will do something about those genuinely held concerns. I believe that at the end of the day when these matters are sorted out everyone will be a lot happier. But the government must maintain the general strategy of the budget: to address the deficit problems. (Quorum formed) Before I was rudely interrupted, I was responding to some of the comments made by the Leader of the National Party. He expressed opposition to speculation that there may be some changes to the budget strategy. I was saying that this government is prepared to listen to the genuinely hdd concerns of the community, not the non-genuinely held concerns of members of the National Party, who really had nothing to deliver here tonight in response to the Leader of the National Party. One can see why 'Sinkers'-I should say the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)-has come back onto the front bench. I imagine the Leader of the National Party would be rather concerned about that. Mr Costello-Les, you have bored them. They have all gone again.",71
144,Mr LES SCOTT,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Surely not. Do not call them back, they will be right. They have probably heard it all before. As those opposite are well aware, the budget contains a whole range of taxation measures. I make no apolo-, gies for some of those measures being directed to middle income earners because they need some assistance. Over the past decade, the federal government has implemented a whole range of initiatives designed to assist low income earners. I refer to family payments and Austudy. Middle income earners need to be picked up in those areas. Middle income families have missed out on many of the benefits of these programs due to income and asset tests which apply to these benefits. Reducing personal income tax rates is one way of giving financial assistance to those families. Generally speaking, those families need assistance with their education and health, et cetera. In addition to tax cuts, this budget includes other measures. Let us look at the positive things. When we look at the budget, we ought to look at the whole budget. The problem is that those opposite look at bits and pieces and home in on the negatives instead of looking at the big picture, which is absolutely important. They know that, but will not admit it. That is nothing unusual. The budget includes a whole range of measures that will be of great benefit to working families; in particular, refinements to the government's child-care program and the payment of an allowance to women who choose to stay at home to care for their children. As from 1 July next year, families with children in child care will be able to advantage of a tax rebate of up to $28.10 per week for one child and up to $61.20 for two or more children in care. From 1 September, families where one parent stays at home to look after the children will be eligible for the home child-care allowance of $30 per week announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keatirig) in February. Over 840,000 families are expected to benefit from the home childcare allowance, while over 230,000 families will benefit from the cash rebate for child care. A substantial number of families in my electorate will benefit from such an initiative. While the tax cuts and child-care assistance will give welcome relief to those in work, the number one priority of this ,government remains assisting the unemployed back into the work force. With my colleagues on this side of the House, I have a very strong commitment to that initiative. Last week, in my electorate, a member of the opposition took the opportunity to bag the unemployed and accuse them of not really wanting to look for work. That is certainly not true in my area, and I am sure it is not the case with people right across Australia. This budget contains a number of measures which will directly assist unemployed people in their efforts to enter the work force. The $120 million increase in spending on labour market programs will be of assistance in promoting employment growth. The reduction in income tax will generate employment either directly or indirectly because of the extra cash that will be available to consumers to spend. Those measures are disregarded entirely by those opposite. I have devoted a great deal of time to finding ways of promoting employment growth in my own electorate-and nationally as well. In May this year I established my own local employment advisory group to assist in ways which could help me and the government's employment task force-which is jointly chaired by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford)-to help the unemployed. The members of my local advisory group have met with local employers, training providers, officers of the take Department of Employment, Education and Training, and members of the trade union movement to gauge the effectiveness of current government employment policies in my region. The group is currently finalising a submission to the government's committee on employment opportunities. While as a whole the government's employment and labour market programs have been quite successful, it is important that the effectiveness of these programs be constantly reviewed to ensure that resources are not wasted, and that funds go to areas that will create the most jobs. My electorate of Oxley-with its well established training network including the Regional Development Corporation, three skillshare programs, group training schemes and private trainers-is well placed to pick up on the initiatives outlined in this budget. I will certainly be encouraging the pick-up of those initiatives as much as I can. The budget will establish a $3 million community activity program that will assist up to 7,000 unemployed people this financial year through a number of pilot programs throughout Australia. These programs will enable people to gain valuable work experience in the community sector. The program will add an important new dimension to the range of opportunities available for unemployed people to maintain their attachment to, and active involvement in, the world of work. Local organisations, such as the Ipswich mates skillshare program, which already operates its own volunteer program, are in an excellent position to take advantage of that. I am hoping it will become the pilot program. .The expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme, which provides financial assistance and advice for unemployed people who want to establish a small. business, will also directly benefit unemployed people in my electorate and in many other parts of Australia. In the past two yearll, over 40 new small businesses have started in the Ipswich region under this program. It is a real success story. A high proportion of people who started a business under the program are still going stro-g-and that is important. The expansion .of the successful group training schemes is also welcome news for the Ipswich region, containing as it does the Ipswich and Moreton community apprenticeship scheme-IMCAS-which has played an important role in finding employment opportunities for young apprentices who would otherwise be unable to complete their apprenticeships. That organisation also undertakes a whole number of traineeships as well, which is of particular assistance to people wishing to follow a career through the traineeship program. The decision to provide some 10,000 commencements under the landcare and environment action program-LEAP-at a cost of $65.5 million is also welcome news, as this program was already operating effectively in my community. Last week I had the pleasure of attending a morning tea with some 11 young people involved in the Denmark environmental park project, in the middle of the city of Ipswich, under LEAP. That shows the success of those programs. These young people are learning skills including bush regeneration, plant identification, weed removal, selective tree planting, landscaping and horticulture. In addition, they are also undertaking training in carpentry, the use of chainsaws, and trail construction activities. The person who is supervising that group trained under the jobskills program with the Ipswich City Council, and he is now a trainer himself. That is another success story of one 9f the government's labour market programs. Participants in the project will also undergo off-the-job training in subjects including plant identification and . culture, nursery practices, and landscape practices . The Denmark Hill project is one of a number of projects currently under way under LEAP in the Ipswich region, with 49 young people currently participating in the program and a further 50 to commence very shortly. The $10 million increase in federal funding for LEAP in this year's budget is just one of the initiatives that will promote employment opportunities in many parts of Australia. The $13.2 million expansion of jobclubs and the $19.5 million for the new enterprise incentive scheme is good news for many people seeking employment. In addition to the direct assistance for the unemployed, there is also a package of measures designed to increase business competitiveness and encourage stories businesses to take on additional employees. While labour market programs play an important role in assisting the unemployed back to work, it will only be through private sector investment that sustained employment growth of the level required to substantially reduce the unemployment rate will occur; reduction of the company tax rate from 39 cent to 33 per cent, along with the introducwould tion of a development allowance and a $94 million package to encourage export development by small and medium sized firms, provide further incentive for business to invest and provide further job opportunities. With inflation at its lowest level for 30 and interest rates at their lowest for 20 years, these measures will be of great assistance business. I encourage busineSses to advantage of them and give those people who desperately need those jobs a chance of importance employment Another measure which has positive implicontinues cations for my electorate is the establishment of a regional tourism development program. The $42 million regional tourism package, which includes expenditure of $23 million a regional tourism development program, will involve the provision of grants to local ernments, tourism associations, and regional development bodies for regional tourism projects. These projects will involve the development of strategic regional plans that analyse the present position of their regional tourism industry, as well as opportunities the future. Under the regional tourism development program, grants will also be available for projects that enhance existing tourism attracthe tions. Other elements of the regional tourism package include expenditure of $10 million on the implementation of the national ecotourism strategy, and $9 million for three programs to facilitate growth in niche marketnation ing, and for the establishment of a tourism forecasting council. It is pleasing that the government has recognised the need for further funds to promote the growth of the regional tourism sector. The growth of the tourism industry has been one of the great economic success of the past decade, with the industry now providing a large proportion of Australia's export income. Unfortunately, two-thirds of international visitors who currently holiday in Australia do not spend a night outside of the capital cities or the international gateways such as the Gold Coast or Cairns. The A number of organisations in my own region per have recognised the potential benefits that flow to the area through further development of the region's tourism industry. - uch of the funding from the local capital will works program announced in last year's budget went to projects that will increase my region's attractiveness as a tourism destinayears, tion. The regional tourism development program will be of further assistance in the to deVelopment of the growing tourism industry take full in many parts of Australia. I tum to one point which is of extreme to us all. In this International Year for the World's Indigenous People the budget the government's record of support for policies which aim to achieve economic and social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Funding for the Aboon riginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-ATSIC-'-will increase by 10 per cent govto $867 million this financial year. The government will spend $73 million on implementing its response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which represents an increase of $18 million over the last financial for year. Funding for the community development employment project, the CDEP, will be increased by 9.9 per cent. This remains ATSIC's single biggest program. Currently scheme involves over 22,000 people and 218 communities across Australia. The scheme is a real alternative to the unemployment benefit for many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islander people, and shows the determiof Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to take control over their own lives and destinies. The national Aboriginal health strategy, which has improved·the poor health status of indigenous people, will also be boosted by $25.8 million to $70.123 million. Overall, the budget demonstrates the government's continued confidence in ATSIC and its commitment to the process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The government has also continued its support for ex-service personnel and their families, with an increase in funding for the Department of Veterans' Affairs of $220 million, bringing the total budget of the department to $5.62 billion. The changing needs of the ageing veterans community has meant a change in the programs offered by the government through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This budget delivers on the government's election commitment to make available a seniors health card to all veterans, spouses and carers who meet the age requirements and are eligible for a service pension but whose assets are greater than the limit allowed under the assets test for the pension. From 1 July next year ex-service personnel in possession of a seniors health card will be entitled to benefits including cheaper pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, a free hearing aid from the Australian Hearing Service, a two-stage dental scheme for emergency and general dental health services, and optometry services under Medicare. It is important that we look at the whole spectrum of this budget and its full ramifications, rather than just cover the negatives as the opposition has done. I commend the budget to the House.",72
145,Mr COSTELLO,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Higgins) (8.32 p.m.)What an absolute joke! What sort of farce is being transacted here? The government is sending people such as the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) into the House of Representatives to tell us how good the budget is when the rest of the caucus is at a caucus committee meeting burying it. The AAP wire flashed up at 8.29 p.m. under the following heading,75
146,Mr HOLDING,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,You'd know a lot about flashing.,75
147,Mr COSTELLO,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"You are still alive, are you, Clyde? I thought you were brain dead. There is still a living body around that dead brain, is there? The AAP flashed up on the wire: ANGRY CAUCUS LASHES KEATING, NA . .. Federal treasurer John Dawkins told an angry caucus committee meeting tonight the government would cancel an extra three-cent-a-Iitre impost on leaded fuel, restore Medicare rebates for eye tests and change the tax treatment of untaken long service leave . . . The treasurer did not say how much the concessions would add to the budget deficit this financial year. What are we debating now? The government had a budget deficit of $16 billion, but what is it now? Do you know? Does Dawkins know? Does Keating know? Does anybody know?",75
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAWKINS,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member shall refer to ministers by their titles.,75
149,Mr COSTELLO,DAWKINS,"How seriously can we take these budget papers? They were introduced only two weeks ago, but all the key components have already been taken out of them. We also read in· the AAP wire that it was supposed to be a meeting of the caucus economic committee. Do honourable members know how many people turned up? There were 60 at a meeting of the backbench caucus economic committee. The word was going out around this place: 'Come down for'-what did the chairman call it?-'a full and frank exchange'. Do honourable members know what that means? That means a lynch mob in Australian Labor Party terms. There are only about 10 people on the committee, but 60 turned up. Dawkins was down there, they had 'a full and frank exchange' and Dawkins backed down on all his key measures. But at the very same time the government has people in this House defending the budget. They have come down to praise Caesar when the rest of them are knifing him off. Old Cassius has the knife out, but government members are down here praising him. What a surreal experience we have here! Do honourable members opposite take what they are debating seriously? The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) will get up shortly. He was in the Herald-Sun the day after the budget came down-I was in there too-giving marks for the budget; this is the budget that did not two weeks. What did the honourable member give it? He gave it seven for initiative and vision-it did not even last two weeks. He gave' it a score of eight. The' community is against this budget, the opposition is against this budget, the Australian Democrats are against this budget, and the caucus is against this budget. Paul Keating and John Dawkins, a telephone box minority of two, are left standing to try to defend the budget when the whole world is against them. They are the only two who are out of line. Everybody else can see what an absolute disaster it was. John Dawkins cannot even carry his own budget for two weeks.",75
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAWKINS,"Order! The honourable member shall refer to ministers by their titles. MrCOSTELLO-John Dawkins, the current Treasurer, cannot even carry his own budget for two weeks. If he cannot make a budget last for two weeks, how long will he last as Treasurer? This will be the death of a thousand cuts",76
151,Mr HOLDING,DAWKINS,Longer than your leader.,76
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAWKINS,Order! The honourable member for - elbourne Ports should not interject other than from his seat.,76
153,Mr COSTELLO,DAWKINS,"He is trying to show that he still has some electrical waves in his brain. If he cannot carry his budget for two weeks, how long will he last as Treasurer? This is the death of a thousand cuts that was suffered by Frank Crean. John Dawkins is the walking dead of this government tonight. He has been rolled by his own caucus. His budget strategy is in tatters. He cannot even say what the outcome will be. He has put the whole thing on hold until he announces details. But where does Australia stand in the meantime? I must say to the caucus that it was absolutely right to roll Dawkins on this.",76
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAWKINS,Order! I again remind the honourable member to refer to the Treasurer by his correct title.,76
155,Mr COSTELLO,DAWKINS,"The caucus was absolutely right to roll the Treasurer on this budget. The members of the caucus could see what Australia could see-that this budget last was a disaster. The tragedy was that the Treasurer could not see it. He introduced it in the first place; that was the tragedy. He started off by saying that the primary objective of this budget was jobs, yet he talked about growth in the labour force over four quarters being 11/4 per cent and unemployment at the end of the year being as high as it is now-1Q3/4 per cent. If the prime objective of this budget is jobs, and it is measured against the fact that unemployment is as bad at the end of it as it was in the beginning, how does it meet its objective? Even by the government's own yardstick-its own objective, the measurement that it put down-it fails: 103/4 per cent unemployment at the end of the year with a falling participation rate. It is as bad at the end of all these measures as it was at the beginning. But I will tell honourable members what will be much worse at the end of the year. Inflation will be worse, the current account deficit will be worse, the Commonwealth debt will be worse, foreign debt will be higher and there will be no improvement in unemployment. Inflation will go to 3112 per centlargely fuelled by these indirect tax increases-which will put our inflation rate above that of our major trading partners. The Commonwealth deficit on the budget goes up to $16 billion from $14 112 billion on the Treasurer's figures-and I will come to them in a moment. This is a deficit reducing' strategy. It is supposed to be bringing the deficit south, but it is going north. It is like going from Sydney to - elboume and starting off by taking a trip to Brisbane. The Commonwealth deficit is higher and the current account defiCit goes up. The Commonwealth has to seek $21.9 billion in financing and at the end of the year, 1993-94, the Commonwealth's own debt, what the Commonwealth itself owes, will be $85 billion-$5,000 for every man, woman, child and baby in the country. If we take a family with mum, dad and two kids, and the government asks that family to pay up its share of the Commonwealth's debt, that family would be paying $20,000. That is what the government would be looking for. That is what it will be at the end of 1994. Three years ago the Prime Minister said: In three years' time there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It's an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia. It was an enormous claim; it was enormously false. He said that there would be no government debt, yet the budget papers tell us that at the end of this year there will be $85 billion of government-owned debt. That is an $85 billion mistake. How does someone make a mistake of $85 billion? The answer is: by making false claims in the first place. In 1989, in relation to the current account deficit, the Prime Minister also said: If the private sector of Australia was just half entrepreneurial as the Government, we wouldn't have the current account deficit. Aren't we glad that we have such an entrepreneurial government! Today we saw that the net foreign debt has gone to $172 billion. That is $172 billion owed. overseas by Australia. As I say, aren't we glad to have such an entrepreneurial government as that?",76
156,Dr THEOPHANOUS,DAWKINS,Don't be dishonest. That is not all public debt.,77
157,Mr COSTELLO,DAWKINS,"It is $85 billion of Commonwealth owned debt. That is in the budget papers. This is English; take it into account. The net foreign debt, public and private, is $172 billion. The Commonwealth's share of that is $85 billion.",77
158,Dr THEOPHANOUS,DAWKINS,It is not all Commonwealth debt.,77
159,Mr COSTELLO,DAWKINS,"The parliamentary secretary should listen to the figures. The net foreign debt is $172 billion. The Commonwealth owned debt is $85 billion. The government should not run around with arguments which it might be able to get away with at the ALP branch meeting at Broadmeadows. These are the facts; they come out of the government's own' budget papers. There is $85 billion of Commonwealth debt, and that is after the Prime Minister's promise three years ago that it would be zero. These are undeniable facts. The government may not like them but it should not run away from them. The parliamentary secretary should stand up and say, 'Yes, we mucked it up', and apologise, instead of trying to run away from the facts. What' the people of Australia really resent about the budget is the fact that that' they were given the impression that they could elect a government that would give them income tax cuts, would not reduce public expenditure and would not be increasing indirect taxes. They thought that was the government they we-e electing. They find out that the income tax l-a-w proved as easy as one bill to repeal-because that is what the deficit reduction bill does. They then found that they got indirect taxes on unleaded and leaded petrol, increased wholesale sales taxes, wine taxes, and tax on as accrued leave. They feel angry, betrayed and let down. Every time the government goes back through these quotes and tries to pull out something which justifies what it has done the people feel angrier and angrier. It is this refusal to actually face up to it and acknowledge it-the justifications-that make it worse. The way in which the government is carrying on now is the reason why' 82 per cent of Australians, according to the opinion polls, think that the government. has broken its promises. There has never been a' figure like that in the history of opinion polls: 82 per cent of Australians saying that the government has broken its promises, and eight per cent saying that they do not know. Try to find the remaining 10 per cent! For the parliamentary secretary to sit there and carry on as he has, with false justifications, does not make it any better. He ought to acknowledge the situation. We find out that the whole thing is predicated on the government saying, 'Look, it may not be all that good this year but we can get the deficit back to one per cent by 199697. Don't worry about things in the interim'. The Commonwealth deficit might beheading north when it should be going south but we are told not to worry; that it will all be back by 1996-97. When one looks at the budget papers, one sees how that is done. It is all done on the back of the GDP numbers for four yearsfigures which are put out at artificially high levels to produce a good result in four years time. That is the same trick that was being pulled at the time of the One Nation statement. At that time the Prime Minister said: So let's say we say, oh look 4 per cent is too ambitious, we'll go back to 23/4 per cent, so that means .we won't even take. the new entrants to the workforce, so we'd have a continuing rise in unemployment. . . ' . . . if we cannot make four per cent growth a year, the whole of us ought to give it away. Right, Prime Minister. That is completely right. What is the actual forecast for this year? It is 23/4 per cent. He was saying a year ago that if the government could not make 4 per cent then it ought to give it away. That is completely right. Then there are figures-again, it is the same trick-appearing for the outward years. But when one looks at the budget fine print, Treasury does not stand by these. figures all. Page 1.2 of Budget Paper No. 1 says: The values attached to major economic indicators ... for the outyears are necessarily indicative do not constitute a forecast. They are not even forecasts. The government has predicated the whole return for 1996-97 on four per cent growth rates which the a budget itself will not even say is a forecast. It calls it 'necessarily indicative'. This way the One Nation statement was cobbled dollar together. The word 'forecast' disappeared the word 'projection' started to appear. we are talking about 'necessarily indicative' numbers but not 'forecasts'. That is how the government does the pea and thimble trick. I want to concentrate on the $16 billion deficit. Who knows where it is supposed to have savings, from knocking off Medicare benefits for optometry tests, of $50 million. That has gone. We were supposed have revenue from retrospective tax on used leave. That has gone. There was to more revenue from the lOc a litre on leaded petrol. That now looks like 7c. Who knows what the budget actually says about the deficit now. Even the budget figure of $16 billion includes asset sales. Asset sales are being treated as revenue. In the whole history of the Labor Party's asset sales program, it has never brought its asset. sales in on budget. In 1991 it was saying it would get $1 billion and it got $161 million. In 1991-92 it said $625 million; it got $300 million. Last year it was going to get $1.6 billion; it got $800 million, which is 50 per cent. Now it is saying it will get $2.4 billion. Who knows how much it will get. Even if it does get it, selling off assets like Commonwealth Bank shares cannot be called negative outlay or revenue. It is selling off an asset and using it for the year's income. No reputable company would be allowed to do that. That would not be permitted in a prospectus. Companies that start selling capital assets and applying them to current year income are generally marked down for receivership. Everybody knows that that is the last act of a company heading for receivership. Then the government pulls money out of the GBEs-out of Australia Post and Telecomat which means one of two things: they either run down their infrastructure or they put up their charges. The government gets $850 and million out of that. It gets $3.2 billion out of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank actually makes money on the foreign exchange market, punting on faIling Australian dollar. Talk about speculators in the international market! The Reserve is the Bank turns an abnormal profit because the is falling; it is seIling foreign reserves and and getting more. The government is running Now down the contingency reserve. As private sector forecasters are saying, the Commonwealth budget deficit is probably nearer the $23 billion mark. It is over five per cent of GDP. It is the worse deficit-worse than the now? We were WhitIam experiment. That is where the government is. We have heard all this talk about reducing outlays but to where are they? Where are the reduced unoutlays? One measure was cutting Medicare be benefits for optometry. The budget papers said that, in real terms, the outlays were going to go up by 3.9 per cent. People in Australia should think about this, about why there is a bigger deficit when the government has all these new taxes. It is not because it is reducing outlays. If there are all these new taxes and the government is reducing outlays, the deficit should be falling-but it is increasing. According to the budget, in real tenns it is per cent. So we have increased petrol tax, wine tax, wholesale sales tax, a tax on annual leave, but we still have a bigger deficit. The Australian people feel cheated, bruised and betrayed. As Martin Ferguson said, 'How do you defend the indefensible?'. That is quite right. There have been many backbenchers, and the parliamentary secretary too, making a meal of trying. to defend the indefensible in this budget. The worse thing about the budget is that it falls heaviest on average Australians, average wage earners. Those opposite know this. That is what is being said in the caucus economics committee, to which 60 people turned up tonight, where people talk freely. The optometry measure was always going to be a disaster. The Australian Optometrical Association said that. It was based on a whole lot of assumptions that will not come in. The fact is that if a cut-off date is announced a lot of people will come forward to have their tests. People will swap between optometry and ophthalmological services. There were also false assumptions made in relation to the percentage of people who have been on health care cards. That was always a saving that was going to evaporate. As a result, it is now dead; It was all pain for no gain. The Australian people feel like that: all pain for no All these increased taxes; and where is the gain? Where are the jobs? Unemployment at the end of the year is as bad; foreign debt is worse; the current account is worse; the budget deficit.is worse; and inflation is worse. So where is the gain in this budget? The Prime Minister used to .call himself the Placido Domingo of Australian politics. He is no Placido Domingo of Australian politics. He is the Pinocchio of Australian politics. The Australian public knows that. They heard all of those promises. The government should not try to tell them what it thinks it said. The people know what they heard. What they heard before the election was that the Prime Minister could give it all to them, and he has not. They feel betrayed. I say to the caucus economics committee, 'You are quite right, it 3.9 is a no-good budget, and you were quite right to roll it tonight'. The government ought to go right back to scratch and start - again. It might find it easier to start again with a better Treasurer. The Treasurer will have real problems redesigning the whole budget. This is a no-good budget. It does not do anything for the economy; it does not do anything for average wage-earners; it does not do anything for the poor; it does not do anything for inflation; it does not do anything for debt; and it does not do anything for jobs. It is a bad budget. It did not deserve to last the nearly two weeks that it lasted.",77
160,Mr TANNER,DAWKINS,"In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 199394, I address an issue that sadly has received relatively little coverage in the media with respect to the budget, in spite of its obvious importance, and that is the issue of unemployment. In doing so, I will endeavour to avoid the dialogue of undergraduate harangue, although I cannot resist one very brief response to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). His speech very neatly encapsulated the response of the opposition on this budget: lots of false outrage on specifics; no serious position on the macro position economically; and· asking the government for a lower deficit to deliver the tax cuts that it promised and not to make any other tax gain. increases. Sadly, those positions, all put together, do not add up. On a cyclical basis this budget is definitely a good one with respect to unemployment. We now have a budget deficit of $16 billion which, by implication, the honourable member for Higgins would like to be smaller and therefore less stimulatory. We also have the ongoing One Nation stimulus which is still flowing through our economy. The most disappointing feature about the budget, in my view, is the fact that the structural unemployment question has largely been left aside. We have a very good ongoing countercyclical strategy with the budget stimulus which will further boost economic growth, but we also need to tackle the structural unemployment problem. We need to tackle that now, not to wait for the white paper process and the caucus committee process, of which I am very pleased to be a part. The unfortunate feature of the counterproduction cyclical strategy is that the days when growth will solve unemployment problems are well and truly gone. It is correct to say that Nation is providing a substantial public sector stimulus to ecotlomic activity in this country. It is also correct to say that the relatively large deficit that the Commonwealth is now running will further stimulate economic happening. activity, particularly through the device of the tax cuts. But, unlike previous situations, face numerous additional challenges in tackongoing ling unemployment-challenges which are not amenable to relatively simple solutions such as higher growth. New gro\Yth in the Australian economy tending to focus more and more in relatively capital intensive and knowledge intensive industries. Unlike past recessions, we are seeing substantial job losses in previously relatively immune areas such as large areas the services sector. It has been estimated Professor Bob Gregory that we need a susomy tained six per cent annual growth rate in order ing. to return to full - mployment and that roughly 3 1/2 per cent growth will allow us only to more or less stand still. This is because have a labour force growing at roughly 160,000 per annum together with a gradual increase over time in the participation rate. It is worth noting-I think this is a good way of putting the outrage of the honourable member for Higgins in some· perspectivenomic that the type of problem we face in this country is occurring in virtually every OECD country. There is a major structural economic problem which we and most people in the Western world .are having to address. Why is the situation different? the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is not here to ask, 'What about Asia?', but I will deal with that later. The questions we.have to address are: why is the situation different from the past when growth was a major solution to unemployment problems? Why is it happening across the Western world? The key answers are internahad tionalisation of economic activity and particuwealth larly the shift of mass employment based manufacturing to the newly industrialising economies of Asia. Our ability to relocate has expanded enormously. The ability to control production processes from afar through things such as the fax machine, One communications technology and the like, global deregulation and dramatic reductions in the cost of transport ·and communications have made it a lot easier to relocate mimufacturing elsewhere. That is precisely what is Added to that, we have the substantial flood we of new technology, which is producing an revolution within .the work force, particularly in the manufacturing area, but now starting to hit the services area and soon . to hit the agricultural area through biotechnolis ogy. Phenomena such as micro-electronics, robotics and biotechnology are producing an ongoing wave of mass job destruction. They are also creating jobs-all new technology creates jobs as well as destroying them-but of internationalisation and technological change by are tending to destroy more jobs in an econsuch as Australia's than they are creatThe combined effect of these phenomena is negating the value of the easy options such as we pumping up growth, import primage, which has been suggested, and blunter instruments of taxation. All of these approaches, which probably would have been much simpler in the past, are now causing us to face substantial negative consequences from macro-ecopolicy as well. Internationalisation is a global fact of life which Australia has to other face up to and which this government is facing up to. In the long term net sense, internationalisation is not only a good thing for the Australian economy but also a good Unfortunately, thing for the world. It is a force which, in my view, will ultimately erode the corrosive power of nationalism and militarism which we still see as a dominant player in world affairs. Unfortunately, what internationalisation of our economy is doing at the same time is gradually destroying the long-established mechanism we have in this country for redistributing national that has been earned substantially by resource, agricultural and pastoral industries through exports across to a brdad base of the population by the device of manufacturing and services associated with manufacturing. That type of economic structure is clearly changing dramatically. Also changing, and relevant to this debate, is the structure of work itself and the structure of the labour market. Across the Western world the returns to higher income earners provided in the labour market are increasing and the returns provided to lower skilled, lower income earners are reducing. In the United States between 1983 ·and 1993, the average wage for a low-skilled male employee has dropped by 20 per cent. A respected columnist from the Financial TImes, Mr Edward Balls, writing in the New Statesman and Society, said: No developed country has avoided the collapse. in demand for unskilled male labour over the past decades. A recent visit I paid to the Ford factory in Broadmeadows brought home this point where the traditional old-style production line job is being replaced by a radically different type of production line job that involves a much higher skill, a much greater level of training and a much more direct involvement of employees in decisions. A radical change that also entails fewer workers is occurring in .the most traditional areas of production in this country. Market pressures are downsizing in the private sector; micro-economic reform is downsizing in the public sector. We face even more job losses in the future through the ongoing process of tariff reduction, no more so than in the car industry. The federal government is also implicitly supporting retrenchments by state governments in many public sector areas such as in the education system and the health system, no more so than in my own stateand regrettably so, in my view-in the pursuit of a narrow concept of efficiency. Increasingly, middle income jobs are starting to disappear. In the last 15 years, according to Professor Gregory, most of the employment growth in this country has been at the extreme ends of the spectrum-in the high income jobs and in the low income jobs. This is leading to a new phenomenon about which I had a good discussion the other day with the National Skillshare Association-that is, the gradual emergence of a class of former middle managers who are now downgrading, so-called, into manual jobs, into much lower paid jobs, and in so doing displacing or competing with lower skilled workers who previously have held or competed for those jobs. Large enterprises are shrinking and we are also seeing a substantial alteration in the structure of economic activity. There is more temporary work, more contracting out, and the development of small firms in networks and relationships with larger firms. An approach is now starting to unfold where there is a new category of person in the labour market. There is not yet really a title to describe that person, but he or she could be called a mixed two income individual who fluctuates between occasional reliance on social security benefits, some income from part-time work or casual work and some income from self-employment through some form of business activity. The growth of this sort of activity is restricted by the existence of poverty traps which threaten people not only with loss of social security benefits but also with loss of fringe benefits and particularly with loss of eligibility for labour market programs. It is also threatened by the continually conservative attitude of our banks to providing loan funds to smaller businesses that do not have enormous amounts of collateral, bricks and mortar, on which to borrow. The phenomenon is also to some extent restriCted by devices that we have had to put in place to ensure proper superannuation and workers compensation coverage. I, for one, think that it was very unfortunate for this country that the Whitlam government was unable to get through its national superannuation-(Quorum formed) There is also major change occurring in the area of training and education which is no better illustrated than by the comments I made before about the change at the Ford factory. We now face a critical structural problem that we have not really had to deal with beforethat is, the threat of a very large number of people remaining unemployed for extended periods of time. We are now heading towards a figure of 400,000 long-term unemployed people. It is overdue both in the media and in politics that we start to move away from the obsessive focus on the raw unemployment figure each month and focus more on both the long-term unemployment figure and on the very long-term unemployment figure, because they tell us a bit more about what is actually going on in the economy and about the true seriousness of the problem. Between 1983 and 1990, 1.6 million new jobs were created in Australia. Seventy thousand of those new jobs went to long-term unemployed people, in effect. I think we can ask, with some degree of trepidation: where does this mean that currently long-term unemployed people will be in the next few years? With regard to training and labour market programs, the government clearly has got it very right. I applaud the increase of $120 million in the budget for labour market programs. However, there are many people out there now suffering from what I would call training saturation, who have been through four or five different courses, still cannot get jobs and are now in need of training or skill maintenance rather than yet another new training program. Labour market programs also tend to be excessively complex. The analysis of outcomes is unduly arbitrary. The question of where people are after three months is a very simplistic way of looking at it. The eligibility criteria are often quite rigid. There is substancally tial room for reform and I have no doubt that the government will grapple with the need for change. With regard to labour market deregulation, the experience in Britain in particular provides a good illustration of a country where there is now no regulation of the labour market, other than restrictions on trade unions, yet its unemployment problem remains roughly the same. Growth provides some of the solution but not all of the solution. We have a situation where the ordinary worker has no faith in private enterprise providing the solution because the ordinary worker has lived through the 1980s when increased profits were effectively squandered through speculation, building of high-rise office blocks and the like. Many higher income earners, it has to be conceded, lack faith in government to be able to rechannel additional taxes into employment creation. We have a bit of a political log jam in trying to deal with the employment issue, in trying to ensure that we can redirect the money flow through our economy in such a way that more jOQs will be created. Where will the jobs come from? There is no simple, big bang initiative, no magic solution that can be put forward. We have to craft a package of solutions which focuses on the medium term but which is developed now-or at least the process of development should begin now. I would like to conclude with some options which I believe the government should be considering now, leading into the white paper process and not waiting for that process to deliver the goods. The tax mix clearly has to be altered in order to enable us to assist those who are losing out in the existing situation as a result of structural adjustment. The market is already giving increased incomes to those in the higher income brackets and it is appropriate and just that those people should pay(Quorum formed) Australia and most other OECD nations face an enormous social challenge from the unemployment problem. The easy ride that the Western world has had for most of .the last century in dominating the world economihas now gone with the emergence of, first, the OPEC nations and the oil problems and, now, manufacturing in Asia. Unemployment is becoming an intractable endemic problem. The market is exporting jobs; it is downsizing; it is introducing new technology more than it is creating. We are now facing the threat of an entrenched unemployable underclass which potentially will become an explosive social problem in the future, and represent enormous poverty, deprivation and despair. We need to tackle these problems now and pursue proper initiatives that will do so. (TIme expired).",79
161,Mr ROCHER,DAWKINS,"The budget represents the victory of the true deceivers of the Australian Labor Party over both its own true believers and the trust of Australian people. Never before has the Australian electorate been so massively conned by an incumbent government than it has been by this Labor Government. The con is all the worse for the fact that it has been perpetrated largely at the expense of Labor's own constituency-the now maligned, true believers. The people who misguidedly put their trust in the Australian Labor Party have had that trust thrown back in their faces by the government's budget betrayal. The true deceivers have prevailed over the true believers. The government's actions .are appalling, not the least because of the utterly shameless way that it is going about defending the budget. There is not a hint of apology or contrition in what the government is saying or doing. Labor does not have the guts to own up to what it has done. The reception has been so bad that the government is already backing away from some of the measures it proposed on budget night. The spectacle of Labor using the imagery of small children to justify its grab through the petrol pump is simply pathetic, and can serve only to heighten the new extremes, the cynicism towards the people from Labor. What have we got? We see a Prime - inister (tdr Keating) who is stressed out; we see a Treasurer (-r Dawkins) who is spaced out; we see the Australian jobless locked out; and, on top of that, we see the caucus frozen out. We got this from a Labor regime. Anyone who has the audacity to question the government's claims or its economic strategy, such as it is, has to cop personal abuse of the worse order from the Prime - inister and other Labor members opposite. Their aim is to bully and cajole people into acceptance of the government's deceptions and economic irresponsibility. No amount of political thuggery from the Australian Labor Party is going to save this budget from being condemned for the travesty that it is. The budget deficit estimated for 1993-94 amounts to some $16 billion, which is equivalent to 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product. When one adjusts for the impact of asset sales, Reserve Bank profits, dividends from the government business enterprises and other like factors, the underlying deficit is more like $23 billion. That is a huge increase on the budget deficit outcome for 1992-93 of $14.5 billion, yet this budget is supposedly designed to put·the Commonwealth's finances back on an even keel consistent with the government's stated objective of reducing the Commonwealth budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. On the basis of the estimates in this budget, this target will entail a budget deficit of $5.8 billion in 1996-97. What we should be aiming for, of course, is a budget surplus by 1996-97 and not a budget deficit. The government recognised this as being a desirable goal in its One Nation economic statement of just a year or so ago. That document called on the government to produce a budget surplus within the same time frame as the government now anticipates producing a budget deficit of nearly $6 billion. It is interesting, however, that Labor's most recent budget deficit for 1996-97 is based on growth forecasts that are tax even more optimistic than the universally lampooned forecasts contained in the now infamous One Nation statement. So we have every reason to be worried about whether the government's new fiscal targets will be reached, dicey as they undoubtedly are. The government has imposed on this country a chronic budget imbalance of a magnitude that dwarfs the few budget surpluses of just a few years ago-a chronic budget imbalance which seemingly has no end in sight. Rather than a reduction of the budget deficit, what we have. under Labor is an increase in the size of the budget deficit for the current financial year and an increase in the public sector's call on national savings. If the government's growth forecasts are not realised, which historically would be the usual outcome under this administration, the Commonwealth's finances are in even more serious trouble. The budget deficit entails a gross Commonwealth financing requirement of just under $22 billion for 1993-94. The ratio of the Commonwealth's debt outstanding to gross domestic product will be around 22 per cent at the end of 1993-94 on budget estimatesnever mind real world assessments. The net public sector borrowing requirement will rise to 5.1 per cent of GOP in 1993-94, which is up from 4.8 per cent in 1992-93. This budget means that the accumulated total of public sector deficits since 1991-92 will be over $70 billion by 1996-97 - a figure that makes the surpluses of a few years ago look paltry by comparison. These public sector deficits will result in a massive increase in public debt interest payments. Public debt interest outlays will increase by 25.7 per cent in 1993-94, or 22.7 per cent in real terms. It is instructive to note that public sector debt interest outlays will amount to some 5.8 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays in 199394 compared with 4.8 per cent only last financial year. We are inevitably going in the wrong direction. The increase in the budget deficit, and in the public sector's call on national saving, is attributable to Labor's complete failure to tackle the difficult exercise of expenditure restraint that has occurred, despite the brazen tax grab in the wake of the last federal election. On the revenue side, the government is engaged in a massive exercise of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. The result is that total revenue collections this year will increase by 4.5 per cent on those same collections last year, a real increase of 1.8 per cent. These revenue collections will amount to 23.5 per cent of gross domestic product and will rise to 24.3 per cent of GOP by 1996-97. If the government had to raise in tax revenue this year what it plans to spend this year, then the increase in the overall tax burden would have been even higher. But the Bankcard mentality lingers on. With this budget, Labor will preside over an increase in the overall tax burden despite its clear undertakings to the Australian people before the last election that no such increase would occur. No amount of obfuscation on the part of Labor can conceal this breach of faith with the Australian people. The proposed increases in taxation are to be condemned for the way in which they take away that which was promised by Labor in the form of personal income tax ahead of the last election. Half of those cuts have been postponed until some· indefinite point in the future, most likely never to be delivered at all. The taxes that Labor is proposing to increase are among the most pernicious in the Commonwealth's taxation arsenal. Of all the taxes that could be increased, the government is making use of those taxes that are the most destructive of the welfare of the greatest number of people. The government is acting as if it were in total ignorance 'of the economic evidence that has been mounting against these taxes over many years. One can only conclude that Labor has no regard for the impact of these taxes-it simply wants to grab hold of the associated revenue and hang the consequences. The wholesale sales tax increases, the increases in fuel excise and other indirect taxes constitute an attack on the living standards of pretty well all Australians, but unequally. Such tax increases also add to the costs faced by business and attack the international competitiveness of our exports. These taxes have inflationary implications that have effectively put an end to the prospects for any further reductions in interest rates by greatly increasing the inflation rate that has been forecast for the year ahead. It is perfectly true that the declining state of Australia's indirect tax base is something that needs to be addressed. We have acknowledged that. But what Labor has done has been to increase a range of pernicious indirect taxes that are highly damaging to our economic well-being, without actually doing anything about genuine and equitable reform of the indirect tax base. The government is not doing anything to restore the indirect tax base. It is not doing anything to introduce an efficient and equitable indirect tax system that would take some of the weight off personal income taxes. The government is shamelessly grabbing back that which it promised during the election campaign by way of personal income tax cuts and has been unable to deliver in full as promised. Taxation by stealth is the government's preferred method of revenue raising. What is left of the promised personal income tax cuts is still heavily skewed away from low income earners, despite the fact that high income earners will now also miss out on those reductions in personal income tax that were promised to them before and during the .election campaign. The Labor Party's own constituency, who may mistakenly put their trust in the true deceivers, will be severely short changed as a result of these measures. They are left with an income tax rebate of $2 a week-guilt money-which will have to go to pay for higher. indirect taxes and an unchanged personal income tax burden. Only Labor would have the barefaced cheek to bundle all these tax increases together into one bill and try to get it through the Senate by calling it the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, an Orwellian title if ever there was one. These tax increases join the host of other promises and programs that the government has ditched since the election, most of them designed to dupe the Labor Party's own constituency. On the expenditure side, we have seen with this budget a totally irresponsible failure to come to grips with the need for fiscal restraint. The government will be spending more money as if it were going out of fashion. The budget serves to' confirm the fears of senior bureaucrats and many others that the whole expenditure review process has collapsed and needs to be radically reformed. Like some great amorphous mass, the Commonwealth government has adapted to the economic review process so that now only token cuts are made to government programs. The net result of the failure of the ERC process is that outlays will increase by 5.2 cent in nominal terms or 2.5 per cent in real terms during 1993-94. Outlays will be equivalent to 27.3 per cent of gross domestic product in this year. Over the period 1989-90 to 1992-93, outlays have already increased by 16.7 per cent in teal terms. The budget will add to that. The government simply has no idea how to cut its spending. Mr Bevis-Where do you want to make the cuts? MrROCHER-Be patient, my friend. All good things Come to those who wait. All Labor knows how to do is pay off special interest groups for their support during the election campaign, such as the 12 per cent increase in spending on the arts portfolio to reward the support of some members of the arts community for the government. Again, these benefits will be largely enjoyed by those who could easily afford to support the arts out of their own pockets. Instead, the cost of these programs will be spread across the entire community, particularly low income wage and salary earners who do so badly out of this budget and do not get much out of the arts. In order to get an idea of what could be achieved by a government serious about spending reStraint, one need look no further than Des - oore's annual review of Commonwealth government expenditure for the Institute of Public Affairs. In the most recent version of that paper, Des - oore outlines a possible total reduction in outlays over two years of nearly $9 billion. That answers the honourable member for Brisbane (-r Bevis) who interjected earlier. Coupled with a more intensive program of privatisation, he shows how the deficit can be reduced by nearly $22 billion in three years. These reductions do not involve cutting the public sector as the stressed-out Prime - inister so colourfully suggests, but rather bring the Commonwealth budget sector under the same financial discipline that can be routinely found in the private sector, and which the Commonwealth has itself sought to impose on the States in recent years. The budget shows that the government simply has no idea how to increase national per savings, which its own FitzGerald report identifies as one of our most pressing economic needs. The FitzGerald report found that Australia's national savings are at their lowest levels this century, when one excludes from consideration the national emergencies of the Second World War and the Great Depression. Dr FitzGerald also made very clear who the main culprit in this decline was when he said: The main contributor to our long term decline in national saving is a decline in public sector saving. This major structural decline he traced back to the mid-1970s-the Whitlam years-but it is clear that this government has made a substantial contribution of its own to lower national savings in recent times; While Labor has been claiming that the deterioration in public sector saving has been cyclical in nature, Dr FitzGerald' makes it clear that this decline has been anything but cyclical. He notes: The main cause of the fall in our saving performance is not cyclical factors (as saving is still low even after recovery) but underlying structural factors-particularly the structural decline in sector saving. Dr FitzGerald notes that reversing this structural decline in our national savings will require a major effort on the part of the public sector to restore public sector finances. No such effort is to be found in this budget, however, I am sorry to say. As part of his suggested national saving strategy, Dr FitzGerald recommends: At each level of government, the general. government sector should seek to move to a position of persistent significanf surpluses on current transactions-that is, to generate positive saving, so as to finance internally at least some of government's investment. This would entail financing out of current revenues all recurrent expenditure and some capital expenditures as well. This would serve to return the Commonwealth to its natural position of the last 30 years, which has been to run an overall government budget surplus. On average, the Commonwealth general government sector ran a surplus equivalent to 1.7 per cent of GOP during the 1960s and early 1970s. NA",82
162,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Snowdon-I require the question to be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed.",86
163,Mr ROCBER,ADJOURNMENT,"Dr FitzGerald argues: To maximise our national choices, we should aim higher-seeking to restore national saving over the coming decade to around the average of the pa,st three decades, 22% to 23% of GOP (still below 1960s levels)-and to do so in conjunction with a sustained program 6f microeconomic reform to raise productivity and competitiveness, including lifting the efficiency of our investment to best practice. All this is basically what the coalition parties have been proposing for some years now, but public it is a message apparently loston Labor, even when coming from one of its own advisers in a report that the government has itself commissioned. If there is one thing that is certain, it is that increased. taxes do not increase savings. I hear no objections from anyone in the House. They may serve to transfer savings from the private to the public sector,but the disincentives they put in place ensure that savings will be lower than they would have been under a regime of lower taxes. This budget fails all of its own tests. It does not contribute to national saving. It does not create one single new job. Indeed, it probably reduces employment through increases in job destroying taxes, Finally, and most damning, the budget represents a massive betrayal of the trust the Australian people put in this government at the last federal election. The true deceivers have prevailed over the true believers. Debate (on motion by Mr .Snowdon) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Snowdon) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Breast Cancer",86
164,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"In his shallow victory speech last March to the true believers in subterfuge, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) thanked A\lstralia,n wotnen and is quoted as saying, - We won't let you down' . I report to honourable members tO,night that the Prime Minister and the Labor movement have let women down. In fact, this government is actively and consciously ignoring the health needs of Australian women. Australian women are dying of an epidemic, yet this government believes' in the minimalist approach to saving them. The government's commitment does not extend beyond its rhetoric. Breast cancer kills six Australian women a day, yet the federal government is slow to react to increasing community pressure to extend the public health system and Medicare facilities to provide for a most basic and drastic need in the field of women's health. There has been no effort to make preventative screening for all women for breast cancer rebateable under Medicare. Despite the shallow assurances by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) and his spokespeople that the government would address the issue of funding and that the government had already publicly recognised the need for more funds to research and combat breast cancer, nothing has happened. Let me for a moment put it into a personal context. In the words of the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Foundation: Breast cancer more than any other disease strikes at the very fabric of the individual-the woman's sexuality, motherhood and self image, and affects the whole dynamic of her family. Like other malignancies it robs the community and the work force of valuable members . . . The funding disparity between breast cancer research and other diseases is alarming. This is not a criticism of other funding projects, but an urgent call for some parity in funding. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome-AIDS-attracts $62 million annually in research assistance, with a substantially lower mortality tate than breast cancer. Breast cancer kills six Australian women a day. In the last 10 years AIDS' has taken toll of a total of 2,500 lives. In my own state of Western Australia, over 700 women are diagnosed with cancer every year, with the mortality rate as high as one-third of these women. What level of Commonwealth support does this epidemic attract? In 1992-93, $17.5 million was spent on the national program for the early detection of breast cancer. In this financial year the Commonwealth will spend 'approximately $29.8 million. Compared with the United States of America, this is abysmal. In the USA, breast cancer research attracts $US4oo million. To show more clearly the paradox of the poor way in which this government treats women's health issues; here is an example. A young woman, perhaps one of our Hansard reporters, could go to the doctor tomorrow to get a cancer check-up as 'she is concerned about her own health. If she has a Pap smear to test for cervical cancer, the cost is chargeable to Medicare. At the same time, she may take the preventative measure of having her breasts checked for potential cancers. The cost is not covered by Medicare, yet the chance of getting cervical cancer is one in 70 compared to the one in 16 chance of having breast cancer. An epidemic in the area of women's health-a one in 16 chance of having breast cancer and a mortality rate of six Australian women every day-and the government's record is one of ignorance and non-action in regard to research. In Western Australia the screening program is reaching only 15 per cent of the targeted over 45 age group. The targeted population in Western Australia was identified as 190,000 women. To, December 1992, only 27,000 women had been screened since the breast cancer screening initiative was announced in 1990. I would like to use this opportunity to echo the demands and concerns of Australian women everywhere. In doing so, I reinforce the community calls for greater Commonwealth public health moneys to be spent on breast cancer research and for the breast cancer screening to be rebateable under our Medicare' system. In conclusion, as the minister considers these requests, I remind the government of an old saying which it would do well to remember: 'Hell hath no fury like 'a woman scorned'. If the government takes no action on this issue, it will surely see hell within 30 months. Brisbane Women's Soccer Association",86
165,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I cannot resist the temptation to point out the hypocrisy of the position being put by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans), a person who went to the last election as a candidate for the Liberal Party of Australia on a platfonn of abolishing Medicare for all Australians except those who are health benefit cardholders. He has the gall to stand here tonight and talk about an extension of the scheme to people in a budget situation where, by his own figures, there has been a nearly 100 per cent increase. It is absolute hypocrisy of the worse kind on a matter that warrants a little more seriousness and consideration on a bipartisan basis, rather than a cheap, petty shot from a person who does not believe we should. have Medicare for any women in Australia .except those on a health benefit card. I did not rise to speak this evening to respond to the honourable member for Cowan, but 1 could not resist the provocation. Yesterday morning 1 had the opportunity---': and very pleasant it was, too-to attend the grand final of the fifth division of the Brisbane Women's Soccer Association, which was held in Brisbane. As you know, Mr Speaker, I am a keen follower of many sports and in the last 12 months or so I have had the pleasure of going to a number of women's soccer games. Yesterday was particularly pleasant because that fifth division grand final was won by a team which included my daughter, as the goalkeeper, and my wife. It was a good finish to a very good season for a group of people most of whom had never before kicked a soccer ball, much less played the game. I would like to' record the names of those involved in that match. The captain of the team was Michelle Peile. The other members of the team were: Sue Tehan; my daughter Emma; my wife, Cathy Bevis; Kathy Dimitrova; Judy Fielding and Michelle Fielding, which was another mother and daughter combination in the side; Debbie Gillick; Shay Johnson; Shirley MCKinnon; Kathy Pacey; Jenni Verhoeven; Vaharo Weir; Morag White; and Sally Edgerton. Out of that team, two had in fact played soccer before the season started. At the start of the year when they commenced play I suppose there was a fair bit of doubt in the minds of some of the spectators as to how they would go in the season. Mr Snowdon-Were you the sceptic?",87
166,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is at the table, accurately points me out as one of those sceptics. It was a' great tribute to those women in that team that they really took up the challenge of playing a sport which was. pretty foreign to them at the start. Iris also a great tribute that a team of newcomers was turned into a team of champions, which is in fact what they ended up as yesterday morning-they won that grand final. It would be appropriate also to acknowledge the contribution of their coach, Robert Askew, who took on the responsibility of teaching and training those women, so that they really developed into a top-flight team. One of the things that became clear to me during the season-and it is something which I have spoken about previously in the parliament-is the way in which women's sport is often neglected by not just the media but also the authorities. It is a sad fact that the fields that the women played on most often were substandard fields. The home ground for Brisbane women's soccer is a field that would not be used by any senior male team, and it was only rarely that the women got to play on a field that would be regarded as acceptable to the senior men's team. That, unfortullately, is the lot of women's sport in a whole range of areas. Regrettably, it happens not just with soccer and not just in the administration. I noticed that overnight the Australian women's hockey team managed to clinch .the international trophy. They are the champion international side. Today's press coverage referred to the fact that they are only the second team in history to complete the five rounds of the championship trophy women's hockey tournament undefeated. Yet one has to search the papers to find any comment about it. Mr Snowdon-Coached by Ric Charlesworth.",88
167,Mr BEYIS,ADJOURNMENT,"As the parliamentary secretary points out, the team was coached by Ric Charlesworth, a former member of this House' and a fine Labor Party representative in the parliament. It is a pity that the media do not give women's sport the recognition it deserves. It is a pity that the government does not provide the funding to ensure it is properly resourced. I take this opportunity to urge the government to review that matter and to ensure that proper recognition is given to women's sport in the future and that it is properly resourced so the facilities the women use are of a quality similar to those available to men. National Flag",88
168,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"At a time when the government is seeking to gut Australia's national institutions, at a time when the government is seeking to spend $50 million on a plan to destroy Australia's flag, it should be noted that National Flag Day falls this week on 3 September. Australia's national flag is a symbol of nation that has been respected almost since the nation was formed. Our flag is symbolic of our system of government. Its three Christian crosses together form the Union Jack. The federal star indicates that we have six states and the seventh point on that star indicates we have Australian federal territories. If we ask any child in this nation what the Southern Cross is, we will be told that it indicates our geographic position in the world. So Australia's national flag is a symbol of this nation throughout the world. It represents our Christian heritage, our system of government and our geographic position in the world. At a time when Australians are facing unprecedented pain as a result of government actions, as indicated in the budget is an absolute tragedy that $50 million of taxpayers' money will be squandered on a committee and on designs for a new Australian flag.",89
169,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Hear, hear! Shocking!",89
170,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member is correct. I would like also to draw to the attention of the House the wonderful work done by the Bribie Island branch of the Australian National Flag Association. People on Bribie Island, like people in other parts of the country, are absolutely outraged over the government's attempts to subvert this important national symbol. In a very short space of time, they collected a petition with more than 500 signatures, absolutely opposing what the government is seeking to do. I would like to publicly recognise in the national parliament the work done by the President, Jim Courtney, the Vice-President, Gordon Lee, the Secretary, Mrs Meg Courtney, and the committee members, David Denton, Bob Taylor, Joyce Lees, Arnold Montaut, Les Quaife, Barbara Crombie and Colin and Vi Winnett. I think that, really, a nation that basically challenges the fundamental institutions it stands for is a nation that is in real trouble. We have only to look at the 13 March election, at the great number of promises that this were put forward-that the government was not going to increase taxes and that somehow we were going to have a brave new Australia without some difficult decisions-to see that the Australian Labor Party is indeed a party which stands condemned. The way the Labor Party is seeking to undermine our national flag is yet another indication that it is not fit to be the government of this country. I mentioned my admiration for the flag. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia support our flag 100 per cent. Some people may have read the poem, Keep Our Flag, by an unknown solider, which sums up the depth of feeling and the sense of identity that surrounds this important symbol. I would like to read into Hansard this very important poem. It states: Our flag bears the stars that blaze at the night recently, it In our southern sky of blue, And the little old flag in the comer, That's part of our heritage too. It's the English, the Scots and the Irish Who were sent to the ends of the earth, The rogues and the schemers, the doers and dreamers Who gave modem Australia its birth. And you, who are shouting to change it, You don't seem to understand It is the flag of our law and our language, Not the flag of our faraway land. There are plenty of people who'll tell you, How, when Europe was plunged into night, that little old flag in the comer, Was their symbol of freedom and light. It doesn't mean we owe allegiance To a forgotten imperial dream, We've the stars to show where we're going And the old flag to show where we've been. People have fought and have died under that flag to make sure that we in this nation are able to enjoy the freedoms that we have. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Labor Party have no mandate to do away with this important symbol of our nation. The government has no mandate to do away with our identity, our past, our present and our future. We should celebrate Australia's National Flag Day as we would our own birthdays-with joy and enthusiasm, looking back on the past, living the present to the full and looking forward to the future.",89
171,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (10.47 p.m.)On 13 May 1991 the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, signed on Australia's behalf the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children. In doing so Australia made a commitment, in the words of the declaration, to 'political action highest level' to protect children everywhere from war, violence, poverty, malnutrition and disease so that their lives may be 'curious, active and full of hope'. The signing of the declaration followed the history-making World Summit for Children held at the United Nations in New York at the end of September 1990. The UN summit agreed on a new set of goals for the 1990s including: one, a halving of child malnutrition; two, a one-third reduction in death rates for children under five; three, a halving of maternal mortality rates; four, a universally available health care and family planning service; and five, basic education for every child. The signing of the world declaration has now been undertaken by some 138 national leaders. The target date for reaching the goals set out at the world summit is the year 2000. All countries. ratifying the declaration have agreed to develop a national plan of action to look at ways of funding the goals from within their aid budgets. UNICEF estimates that funding the goals will cost about $US25 billion a year worldwide. At present 35,000 children are dying every day from malnutrition and disease. This is only slightly better than the 40,000 child deaths a day at the time of the world summit. In case there are reservations about the amount of money required, my constituents Mark Hope and David Clare have tried to put into perspective the worldwide figure of $US25 billion per annum. They assure me that this amount is less than what the people of the USA spend on cigarettes every six months. It is, they say, less money than what the people of Europe spend on alcohol every three months. Currently less than 10 per cent of all international aid for development is directly devoted to meeting basic human needs such as adequate food, safe drinking Children water, primary health care, family planning and basic education. According to the United Nations development program only about two per cent of Australian aid goes to these basic development priority areas. UNICEF and the UN development program both strongly recomat the mend that at least 20 per cent of governments' aid spending should be allocated to meeting human priority needs. A restructuring of national aid budgets would therefore help considerably in finding the funds needed to meet the goal. Immunisation of 80 per cent of the world's children and the widespread availability of oral rehydration therapy are examples of the changes quietly being made and which are saving the lives of four million children a year. The goal of 80 per cent immunisation was little more than a promise on paper at the beginning of the 1980s. The promise was made a reality as a result of widespread support from the public, the media, politicians and the consistent support of the international community. Around the world, 100 million children are now being vaccinated on several occasions in the first year of life. This shows the extraordinary capacity available to put pure life saving and life enhancing technologies at the disposal of the world's one billion poorest people. It also shows that a high level Of political commitment makes progress possible even· under very difficult circumstances. But where does Australia stand amongst the 138 other signatories to the world declaration? Since September 1990 we have been navel gazing. One of the promises of the declaration was that a national program of action would be completed by the end of 1991. Nearly two years later there is still no adopted plan of action for Australia. The plan was off for years with the Prime - inister's department. It appears that only the eyes of the government bureaucrats have been fit to gaze upon it in all that time. Compared with the 54 other countries which have published detailed national plans of action, Australia is far behind. When will the currently responsible minister, the - inister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (-r Howe), prise the national plan of action from the bureaucracy? When will the government meet the promise and the goals. to which Australia committed itself back in 1991? Certainly Australia must do it well before the year 2000 when, according to the terms of the world summit, goals are supposed to be met. Time is running out for Australia to meet its obligation to the world's children. Australian Citizenship",90
172,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT," Speaker, with your indulgence I want to read to the House an essay that was written by a Tara - cGillivray of 91 The Esplamide, Henley Beach South, Adelaide, who attends Fulham North Primary School. Tara wrote this essay in response to an essay competition I held last year, and it is such a good essay, and has such a good spirit about it, that I would li""e to read it to the House. It reads: Proud to be Australian I am proud to be an Australian because the wage for Australians is probably $10.00 an more than in many other countries. Just the other day I heard· on television that an overseas shoe company paid their employees fifty cents an hour, that's approximately six dollars for a twelve day. The conditions they work in are much worse than ours as well. We aU help each other in an emergency. Volunteers help people whose homes have been destroyed by floods, fires, cyclones or earthquakes. Other people help by donating money, food and clothing. We don't usually have to worry about an operation if we need one. Our country has good doctors, surgeons, medication and hospitals. The schooling in Australia is very good compared with other countries .in the world like Kenya or Yugoslavia. Some schools in other countries don't even have pens or paper. Our water is clean compared to other countries and people are complaining about the quality when they could be drinking mud which would give them diseases. Everybody should be able to see that we are much better off than many other countries. But the most important thing is from the age of eighteen you can vote for your choice of leader for the country. Some citizens of other countries don't have the freedom to do this. Aren't you glad to be an Australian? The young girl who wrote that does not give her age, but I believe she was .11 years old. I think that was a very nice essay, and it is great that our kids are proud to be Australian. Education Budget 1993-94",91
173,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,I might just add to the comments,91
174,Mr SOMLYAY,ADJOURNMENT,Double dipping?,91
175,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Indeed. Further to the comments of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (-rs Gallus), I might add that one of the pleasures of this job is visiting schools, at both the primary and secondary level, to talk to the students about parliamentary process and related citizenship activities. I think we have all found that the level of their interest and, in many cases, their knowledge is a great tribute to them and their teachers. It is a source of some comfort when we consider that in the not too distant future they will be adults casting a vote. The level of education in these matters has improved dramatically-I guess more dramatically in a state like average Queensland which, for many years, was hour or shackled by a system which deliberately precluded the introduction of social education materials such as - ACOS, High Court hour explanatory booklets and a whole range of other fairly basic educational material which, at the time, was freely available everywhere else. Mr KaUer-' Social engineering' is the phrase I would use.",91
176,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not surprised that the honourable member for Kennedy would want to interject, because he was part of the National Party regime that enforced that fairly blinkered myopic view on education that was headed up by the Bjelke-Petersen government. I would have thought he would have kept his own counsel on an issue like that. Mr KaUer-On the contrary, I am very proud of it.",92
177,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased for Hansard to record the honourable member's pride in being part of a government which refused to allow educational material on the constitution of Australia to be used in Queensland state schools. That government refused the inclusion of the material such as Man: a course of studies, a social education material project which was written by officers of state education departments, including representatives from the Queensland Department of Education. All those documents were banned in Queensland state schools. The honourable member may have some interest in listening to this: the irony was that those materials were available and. being used in private schools in Queensland, but they were banned from use in state schools. Mr KaUer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Brisbane accused me of being part of a government that refused to allow these things to be taught in schools in Queensland. That is totally incorrect.",92
178,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! There is no point of order. I remind the honourable gentleman that, if he abuses the forms of the House, appropriate action will be taken.",92
179,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"At the time when these events were occurring I was involved in the education system in Queensland-with a keen intereSt in the political system as welL I can well .recall that the honourable member for Kennedy was a member of the Queensland parliament at the time when these things occurred. At a later time. I would be happy to provide him with the documents if he would care to have a look at them. I want. to pick up some of the comments that have been made during the debate on the budget, in the appropriation bills. It appears to me to be passing strange that the opposition has come into this place and complained about tax increases that have been included in the budget, .about some restrictions on services-in some cases, complained about both at the one time-when' in fact until the last election it had a policy which involved a massive reduction in public sector outlays. I think the current budget provides for a reduction in the order of $3 billion in outlays. In the previous year-1992-93-the opposition proposed in Fightback that as part of a staged reduction of $10-12 billion, our budget should have had a $7 billion cut in outlays. The speeches of the opposition do not tell us which a:reas of services we now provide they believe should be cut. How do we fill up that $4 billion gap between what the opposition said should be the case last year and what has in fact happened this year? Is it to abolish Medicare? Is it to do away with the child-care fee relief, or the payment to child care? Is it to prevent the introduction of the dental care program which this government is introducing to' ensure that people on low incomes are able to access proper dental care? Is it to abolish or restrict the labour market programs? (Time expired) Trade Unions: Queensland",92
180,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Kennedy) (10.59 p.m.)The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) made mention of the government of Queensland-of which he was a very great critic throughout his period of time serving the trade union movement. I would like to say a few words about the tra:de union movement in the state of Queensland because the honourable member for Brisbane,' along with other trade union leaders in the' state of Queensland, worked very hard to get, the Labor state government elected. Since that government has been elected, it has taken almost one in three jobs in the area of railways-most certainly over one in four jobs. Six thousand jobs have been removed in the space of three years. Not one single word has been uttered by the trade union movement. Now we have had cutbacks' almost across the board in the public service in Queensland, and there has not been one single word from any of the trade union representatives. Men who have stood in the hot sun all day handing out how-to-vote cards for the ALP· have found themselves betrayed 'in the most shoddy and appalling manner.",92

The following answers to questions were circulated: Airport Terminals: Concessions (Question No.8) Mr Jull asked the minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 5 May 1993: (1) When was the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) administration circular No. 20/88, Procedural guidelines for the awar</ing of airport bu-iness trading contracts, last reviewed. (2) Do the guidelines permit the FAC to enter into joint ventures with other parties to operate concessions at the FAC's airports. (3) Is or was Mr Brian Maxwell, FAC Manager of Commercial Activities and Manager of New Business, a member of the committee appointed to award concessions. (4) Is Airport Fine Foods a joint venture company between the FAC and Taihoh Global and does it operate the Australian Produce Shop at Sydney and Brisbane airports; if so, is or was Mr Maxwell the general manager. (5) Will the FAC alter the guidelines to prevent a situation from occurring where it appears the FAC is determining a matter in which it has a direct financial interest; if not, will the Government intervene to remove any doubts about a possible conflict of interest. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Federal Airports Corporation (PAC): (1) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) administration circular No 20/88 ""Procedural Guidelines for the Awarding of Airport Business Trading Contracts"" is a working document and its relevance to the Corporation's commercial objectives, together with its appropriateness from a commercial probity and legal perspective is under a continual state of review each time a new trading contract is awarded. (2) The guidelines are not ting the Corporation to enter into joint ventures with other parties. to operate concessions. at the FAC's airports. The Corporation has the power to enter into joint ventures to operate on its own airports pursuant to NA subsection 8(1)(b) of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC)' Act 1986. (3) Mr Brian Maxwell in his capacity as Manager, New Business for the corporation does at times sit on particular evaluation teams which subsequently make recommendations to delegates nominated pursuant to the FAC Act for the awarding of airport trading contracts. Where contracts are related to a specific airport, for example duty-free contracts, Mr Maxwell may be invited by the General Manager of that particular airport to sit on the evaluation team and assist in its deliberations leading up to a recommendation to an approved delegate. (4) Airport Fine Foods Pty Ltd (which fonnally traded as AustraHan Produce Shops at Sydney and Brisbane) is a joint venture company between a subsidiary of 'the FAC, namely FAC Investments Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Taihoh Global Co Ltd, namely Taihoh. Global Australia Ply Ltd and a subsidiarypf Lagerlow Pty Pd, namely Airsas Pty Ltd. Mr Maxwell was initially appointed as General Manager of Airport Fine Foods Pty Ltd for a specific limited term of .,. months to see the company through its initial development stages. Mr Maxwell's term as General Manager with the company ceased prior to Christmas 1992. The position was then temporarily filled on a consultancy basis pending the outcome of a recruitment exercise. A new General Maooger has been selected and commenced duties with the company on 17 May 1993. (5) The Corporation conducts its cOlT)mercial affairs, including the formulation of guidelines for the awarding of commercial contracts, pursuant to powers conferred on it uRder the FAC Act. Inter alia the Extent of Functions of the Corporation under section 8(1)(b) of the Act allows ""carrying on commercial activities at,' or in relation to, Federal airports (including carrying on such activi. . ties in co-operation, or as joint ventures, with other the vehicle for permit- persons)"". The Corporation has through its subsidiary company Federal Airports Corporation Investments Pty Ltd entered into the Airports Fine Foods joint venture arrangement with other parties in accordance with ""sound commercial practice"" which is a prescribed operating criterion for the Corporation pursuant to subsection 7(1)(j) of the FAC Act. The Corporation has no reason to alter its existing guidelines relative to its involvement through its subsidiary company, Federal Airports Corporation Investments Pty Ltd, in the joint venture company Airports Fine Foods Pty Ltd. In establishing the FAC the Government made it clear that the Corporation is required to operate in a commercial manner and to .be responsible for the day to, day management and control of its assets. Telephone. Services (Question No. 17)",93
182,Mr MCARTHUR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 5 May 1993: (1) Do the heads of agreement between Telecom, Optus and Austel for the proposed ballots of telecommunications subscribers include a clause that suggests that where an area code ,has more than 80 per cent availability for both carriers, the ballot is to be' conducte<\ within 9 months of initi.al availability of the second carrier. (2) Were 82' per cent of subscriber lines within the 052 area code available for connection to either Telecom or Optus as at 15 April 1993; if not, what proportion was available. (3) What proportions of subscriber lines within the (a) 049 and (b) 042 area codes were available for connection to either Telecom or Optus as at 15 April 1993. (4) Has Austel decided in consultation with the carriers whether the proposed ballots for Geelong, Newcastle and Wollongong can proceed on the same date as Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra; if so, what is the date; if not, why not. (5) Has Austel directed telecommunications carriers to regard speed in holding ballots as a prime - nsideration in forming heads of agreement; if not, why not. (6) What is· the estimated direct cost per telephone subscriber of holding the ballot. (7) Does the estimated cost vary between differendysized areas; if so, what is the estimated cost for the (a) 03 and (b) 052 area codes. , (8) What was Austel's full-time staffing equivalent level at (a) 1 January 1993 and (b) 1 April 1993. (9) Has, Austel researched price variations in telecommunications services since.199 I; if so, (a) what is the nature of the research and (b) are the results available to the general public. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Austel, is as follows: (1) Telecom and Optus have entered into Heads of Agreements on the implementation of preselection. While Austel has, by mediating and arbitrating between the parties, facilitated Telecom and Optus in reaching agreement, Austel is not a party to the Heads of Agreement. The Heads of Agreements do' not refer to geographic areas covered by area codes. The grouping of customers for the purposes of' access to the second carrier's network is expressed in terms of Inter Carrier Charging Areas (ICCAs). ICCAs are defined to coincide with current network charging boundaries, not numbering boundaries. There are currently 54 area codes (ie, numbering areas) within Australia, and 204 ICCAs. In' the cases of major capital cities and a few other particular instances the ICC As correspond to numbering areas, but for the majority of regional Australia they do not.. The initial availability of the second carrier in an ICCA (by means of Dial ""1"") is to be followed within nine months by commencement of the ballot for preselection in that ICCA, provided at .least 80 per cent of the customers in that ICCA have haq modem exchange capability for not less than five months, (ie they can access Optus by means of Dial ""1""). After balloting in an ICCA, preselection. will be implemented promptly and Dial ""1"" will be withdrawn shortly thereafter. (2) No. The 052 area code contains two ICCAs (Geelong and Colac). These are treated separately with respect to percentage capability for equal access and timing of 'introduction of Dial ""1"". The Geelong ICCA has an installed local exchange capacity for customer connections of 107,542 lines. The total for the Colac ICCA is 1l,726Jines. Not all'of this capacity is in use at any - iven time. On 15 April 1993, 83 per cent of the local exchange capacity within the Geelong ICCA had the capability to· provide access to the second carrier via the Dial ""1"". Optus was offering Dial ""1"" service in Geelong as at 15 April 1993. By contrast, on 15 April-993, 21 per cent of the local exchange capacity within the Colac ICCA had the technological capability to participate' in Dial ""1"" access. In view' of this low proportion Optus had not chosen to negotiate with Telecom the implementation of Dial"" I"" capability in the Colac ICCA at that stage. (3) (a) The Newcastle (049) area contains a single ICCA. On 15 April 1993 the total local exchange capacity for customer connections within that ICCA was 224,148, of which 42 per cent had access to the second carrier via the Dial ""1"" method. Optus was offering Dial 1 service in Newcastle as at 15 April 1993. (b) The Wollongong (042) area also contains a single ICCA. On 15 April 1993 the total exchange capacity for customer connections within that ICCA was 108,604, of which 25 per cent had access to the second carrier via the Dial ""1"" method. Optus was offering Dial 1 service in Wollongong as at 15 April 1993. (4) No. Preselection and the associated customer choice process are elements of the equal access and interconnection regime, which having regard to section 137 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 are, in the first instance, the subject of negotiation and agreement between the carriers. Therefore, the timing of ballots in all areas is a.matter for agreement between the carriers. Austel would not decide the timing of ballots unless the carriers cannot agree and the matter is submitted to Austel for arbitration. The decision on whether ballots in Geelong, Wollongong and Newcastle should be synchronised with those fOf Melbourne and Sydney respectively is a matter for the carriers to agree on. A starting date must accord with the carriers' agreed time frame for the commencement of the ballot after Optus' services begin in· an area ..The Canberra ballot began on 15 July, the Sydney ballot began on 3 August. The ballot is scheduled to begin in Melbourne on 1 September. Optus has announced that the Geelong and Mornington ballots will begin on 4 October. Ballot dates for Newcastle, Wollongong and other areas have yet to be announced. This is a matter to be settled by Telecom and Optus. Telecom and Optus have agreed that Optus has the right to trigger the ballot in each area, within specified parameters but also on the basis of its own commercial and strategic judgement. (5) No. The speed in holding ballots relates to two issues-the modernisation of customer exchange lines so that pre selection is technically operational, and how quickly the ballot is J:!eld after a customer gains access to Optus through Dial 1. The suitability of an ICCA for introduction of preselection is dependent on the percentage of modernised customer· lines in exchanges in that area. In August 1991 Telecom was directed by the then Minister for Transport and Communications to undertake a program of modernisation which would ensure that all customers would be subject to preselection by 1997. This modernisation program is resource-intensive, which limits the speed of its implementation. Thus, the timing of preselection availability and the ballot in each ICCA is predicated to a large degree by this modernisation process. It is Austel's role to oversee the introduction of all aspects of equal access, including exchange modernisation and preselection, within the time-frame specified in the Minister's direction. The carriers' plans for progression of preselection are monitored by Austel. The timing for introduction of Dial ""1"" access in any ICCA is negotiated between the carriers, but is largely dependent on the same exchange modernisation process which must precede preselection. The carriers have mutually agreed to an arrangement whereby the ballot will be triggered in any ICCA within a five to nine month time window after the date of introduction of Dial ""1"" access in that ICCA. This provision was agreed to ensure that consumers will have an adequate opportunity to try the second carrier's services before being asked to participate in the ballot. The carriers are negotiating the timing and sequence of the introduction of preselection in accOrdance with section 137 of the Telecommunications Act 1991. This section of the Act also provides for arbitration by Austel where agreement is not reached. Austel has not been requested to arbitrate on issues relating to the timing or sequence of preselection. However, in its role as a mediator, Austel has sought to expedite the carriers' agreement on the implementation of the ballot. (6) & (7) It is not possible at this stage for Austel to separately estimate the costs of the balloting process for large cities versus smaller centres. The carriers have contracted the successful candidate organisation for the Ballot Administration task, and there is a degree of confidentiality relating to detailed costing within that contract. It is a matter of public knowledge that the gross cost of the task has been quoted at $3Om nationally. This figure would suggest a national average cost of about $4 per customer line for the ballot and related costs such as printing, postage, data management and information transfer to customers and carriers. (8) (a) & (b) Austel's full time staffing equivalent level at 1 January 1993, and also at 1 April 1993, was 140. Of these, approximately 50 were involved in licensing and technical standards activities, approximately 50 were involved in consumer affairs, competition policy arid industry analysis activities; and approximately 40 were involved in corporate and support roles. The staff numbers above include 10 persons outposted to offices in capital cities other than Melbourne. (9) Yes. (a) Austel is required to administer the Price Cap arrangements under the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991. Under this Act the dominant carrier (Telecom) must, in real terms, reduce its prices for the main communications services in Australia by the level specified by the Government. The price cap formula applies to charges for Telecom's connections, business and residential rentals, local, long distance and international call and mobile telephone charges. It also includes domestic and international leased line service charges. Proposed variations to charges for connection of eligible services to the public switched telephone network, public payphone calls and calls for directory assistance must also be notified to the Minister who may seek Austel's advice as to whether the variations should be disallowed in the public interest. Further, under the Telecommunications Act 1991 all licensed carriers are obliged to supply Austel with details of their tariffs for basic carriage services. Austel may disallow tariffs which do not comply with the requirements of section 190 of that Act. These relate to such elements as the form in which the nature and detail of the charges are notified, how they have varied and the terms and conditions under which the relevant service is supplied. Austel is also required under section 399 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 to report to the Minister on carrier performance. Austel's 1991-92 Section 399 Report included extensive analysis of telecommunications price movements. (b) Yes. Relevant details of Austel's pricing research are published in Austel's Annual Report. A discussion of price control operations is found at page 64 of Austel's 1991-1992 Annual Report. Austel's research as presented in its Annual Report found that for domestic telecommunications users the prices for the basket of price-capped services have fallen by 13 per cent in real terms over the term of the arrangements on a cumulative basis. These real price reductions achieved by Telecom are in line with the Government's expectations when formulating the price cap. For international services, prices for services subject to the cap have fallen some 25 per cent in real terms over the same period on a cumulative basis. Telecom has delivered price reductions of about twice the level required by the price cap. Austel's Report to the Minister under s 399 of the Telecommunications Act was tabled in Parliament on 27 May 1993 and is a public"" document. A discussion of price and tariff issues is found at Chapter Four of the report.

Mr WiUis-The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The total sums paid in rent and for building leases during 1991-92 were: (a) former Department of Administrative Services and associated agencies-$65.173M* (b) those elements of the former Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories portfolio now part of the Arts and Administrative Services portfolio-$8.642M* Total $73.815M* *Note that these figures contain s()me property related expenses (eg cleaning, security and energy) which could not be separated from the overall sum paid. People's Republic of China: Passports (Question No. 52) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1993: (1) Do newspapers in Australia frequently display notices declaring the loss of passports issued by People's Republic of China (PRC). (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the Sunday Telegraph of 3 May 1992 referring to the notices and claiming that they had led Australian authorities to suspect the existence of a racket. (3) Did a spokesperson for the Minister's Department tell the journalist who wrote the article that (a) the Department thought that the persons declaring the loss of their passports believed it would enhance their applications for refugee status and many passports were being stolen. (4) Has the Minister or the Minister's Department investigated the matter; if so, with what result. (5) Is an investigation (a) in progress or (b) to be conducted; if so, by whom. (6) How many PRC passports have been declared stolen in Australia in 1992. (7) What advantage might be gained by a person who (a) had lost a PRC passport or (b) acquired another person's lost PRC passport.",98
184,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am advised that my Department is aware that notices have frequently appeared in newspapers in Australia over the past few years notifying the loss of passports issued by the People's Republic of China (PRC). (2) Yes. (3) I am advised that the officer of my Department who spoke to the author of the article indicated that the Department had no specific knowledge of the motives of PRC citizens who advertised their passports as lost. The spokesperson speculated that the advertisements could indicate the existence of a passport selling racket or a mistaken belief on the part of those placing the advertisements that the loss of their passports might somehow help them stay in Australia. (4) & (5) An investigation last year by my Department into a sample of passports advertised as lost revealed a number of anomalies. These are being examined further. (6) My Department does not monitor all newspaper advertisements reporting lost or stolen passports. Various foreign governments advise Australian authorities, both in Australia and overseas, of passports which have been reported stolen or lost by their citizens. These passports are recorded on my Department's alert systems so that any attempts to use them can be investigated. (7) (a) The loss of a PRC passport does not the obscure a person's immigration status in Australia, which is recorded separately on Departmental information systems. A passport does however contain information about an individual's movements outside Australia which will not be recorded by my Department and which he/she may wish to conceal, such as travel to a country other than Australia. Whether this provides an advantage to the individual is dependent on the circumstances of the individual case. The special temporary entry permit for which (b) PRC nationals present in Australia on 20 June 1989 are eligible is subject to automatic termination should the holder travel to the PRC. Advertising a passport as lost may enable the holder to obtain a second passport. In the case of PRC nationals who have been granted the special temporary entry permit, it is possible that one passport is being used to exit and enter Australia and the other passport used to enter and exit the PRC. (b) Acquisition of a ""lost"" PRC passport by a second person may assist that person to assume the identity of the person to whom the passport was issued and to obtain any benefit available to the original passport holder by means of the passport e.g. entry to a country for which there is a valid visa in the passport. Cambodia: Documentary (Question No. 54) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 5 May 1993: (1) Did ABC TV refuse to broadcast a documentary about Cambodia made by the journalist John Pilger; if so, who decided that the ABC should not screen the documentary.  argued in the documentary that current Australian policy in Cambodia attempts to ignore and minimise the crimes of the former Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge regime and that Australia's wi11ingness to deal with the Khmer Rouge as a legitimate party is a major blunder and contrary to the interest of Cambodians. (3) Is it a fact that the head of ABC TV Docu Cambodia to be important and that he wanted to broadcast it but was overruled. (4) Is the Minister able to say why the ABC is not willing to facilitate the expression of an alternative view of the prominent role taken by the Australian Government and particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs in formulating the policy now pursued by the UN in Cambodia. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (1) The ABC declined to purchase the documentary by John Pilger, Return to Year Zero. The decision was made by the Network Programmer, in consultation with senior management from the News and Current Affairs and Documentaries areas. The program was subsequently shown by the SBS. (2) I am advised that the documentary contains this line of argument, which is obviously a view totally rejected by the Australian Government. I further advised that this view was rejected by a panel of discussants following the SBS showing of the film. (3) The ABC has advised that the Head of Television Documentaries was absent due to i11ness at the time the decision not to screen the documentary was made. However, another senior member of the Department, the National Commissioning Editor for Independent Documentaries was one of the group which made the final decision. (4) The ABC has advised that it declined to purchase the Pilger documentary because it duplicated Cambodian coverage already planned by its own News and Current Affairs Division, and other program purchases. For instance, on 1 May the ABC current affairs series, Foreign Correspondent screened an extensive piece by the British journalist and author Wi11iam Shawcross, also widely known for his Cambodian work. As was the case with the Pilger documentary, Shawcross raised concerns over the continuing influence of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodian affairs, as well as their status under the United Nations Peace Plan. The role taken by the Australian Government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cambodia in recent times, had no bearing on the ABC's actions in this matter. The ABC has indicated it wi11 continue to provide a comprehensive coverage of the Cambodia situation, in accordance with its charter to reflect a range of views on this and other issues. ABC Television Service into Asia (Question No. 5S) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 5 May 1993: (1) Was the Broadcasting Act recently amended to enable the ABC to seek cornmercial sponsorship funding for its new television service into Asia (ATVI). (2) What sum has been raised from commercial sponsorships for ATVI. (3) Is it a fact that the ABC has not been able to raise sufficient revenue for ATVI from 'commercial sponsorships; if so, (a) what is the extent of the shortfall in commercial sponsorship revenue and (b) how is the shortfall being covered. (4) Is the ABC redirecting funds from its free-toair service to cover a shortfall in commercial sponsorship funding being experienced by ATVI; if so, (a) what sum is being redirected and (b) what effects wi11 the redirection have on the free-to-air service. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Transport and Communications Legislaam tion Amendment Act (No 3) 1992 amended the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 to, inter alia, permit corporate sponsorship on the ATVI service (now known as Australia (2) The ABC has advised that revenue received in respect of Australia Television from July to 31 May 1993 (the latest available figures) from all external sources, excluding the Government start up grant of $5.4 million, is $0.228 million. (3) The ABC advises that costs for Australia Television over the same period total $2.531 million. The ABC's business plan for Australia Television relies upon funds from a number sources including income from sponsorships initial grant of $5.4m from the Government. The ABC undertook the service on the basis that it would be self-funding after the initial Government grant. The ABC is confident the business be achieved. Marketing agents are now being appointed both for Australia and the region. Australia Television is also seeking sponsorships directly. The ABC estimates projected revenue from advertising and sponsorship on Australia Television at $2.9 million in 1993-94 and $5.2 individuals. million in 1994-95. (4) See (3). As part of the conditions attached the initial $5.4m grant, the Government required that Australia Television be operated through a subsidiary company so that any assistance provided by the ABC would be transparent. The ABC responsibilities. advises that assistance provided to Australia Television will be reflected in the Australia Television accounts, and has not involved a redirection of funds from the ABC's free-to-air services. Yachtsmen: Taxation Inquiries (Question No. 85) Mr Ronaldson asked the Minister for the Environment, Spoitand Territories, upon notice, on 11 May 1993: (1) Has her attention been drawn to dawn raids by officers of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Australian Taxation Office on a number of Australia's leading yachtsmen on Wednesday, 5 May 1993. (2) Did she receive a detailed briefing from her Department on the matter. (3) Is she able to say why the sportspersons and their families were subjected to the raids.

Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I assume that the honourable member is referring to the actions which I, as the Minister responsible for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, have been able to take since the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia to dismiss my appeal against the judgement in the Federal Court by Justice Wilcox under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1976. I can advise the honourable Member that since that decision I have appointed a senior public servant, Mr JG Menham, to prepare a report on those matters which are set down in section 10 of the Heritage Protection Act. Mr Menham has publicly called for submissions from interested parties, and visited Perth for consultations. I anticipate that I will receive his report soon. Until I have received that report I am unable to exercise my power of making a decision under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 regarding the Old Swan Brewery site. Republic (Question No. 272) Mr Slipper asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: Will he provide a detailed response to the points raised in question No. 84 (Hansard, 26 May 1993, page 1025).",107
