15,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Mernda) [2.36] - B y arrangement with the honourable member for-Parramatta, I have agreed to open the debate this afternoon. It is not my intention on this occasion to deal generally with the Budget, and I shall say little in are regard to it beyond congratulating the Treasurer upon its delivery, and the peoofficers, ple of the Commonwealth upon the great prosperity which it indicates. In my Deopinion, it must take second place when out compared with the important issues raised by the right honourable gentleman at the conclusion of his speech, and by the publication of his memorandum on the financial problems of the Commonwealth, dealing with the assumption by the Commonwealth of the debts of the States. The questions which he has well entitled the financial problems of - the Commonwealth are, to my mind, of surpassing importance, and I think that there is a general feeling amongst honourable members, and throughout Australia, that they should be faced and dealt with in the interest of the States and of the people. I have, since the passing of the Constitution Act, taken a considerable interest in these matters, and it has been one of my chief objects in remaining in politics to give my aid and help, if possible, in their settlement. The seriousness of the position, as J affecting future loans, altogether apart from the difficulties arising between the States in connection with financial adjustments, ought to be pressed upon the attention, not only of honourable members, but also of the public at large. During the fourteen years from 1907 to 1920 no less a sum than £124,000,000 , or an average of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, will have to be provided for in connection with loans falling due-in addition to any requirements for new works and obligations. Honourable members will thus see that it is important that this question should receive not only serious, but immediate, attention. We are approaching the time when the first of the gieat obligations contracted by ths various States during the years of so called prosperity will have to be met. We have had the pleasure of spending the money, and we shall soon have to face the less attractive duty of meeting our obligations. The outioolk for the immediate f u ture is not a pleasant one, and I think that ' the Treasurers of the States, when they realise what is before them, must come to the conclusion that it is their duty to join with the Commonwealth Government in facing the situation. I observe that some of the States Treasurers are making arrangements on the assumption that they will-not meet with difficulties. But we have to remember the enormous sums that are about to fall due, that the lending classes, who have given us the use of their money, are well aware of the obligations that the States have to meet, and that during the next fourteen years there will be not one borrower, but in .many cases five, in the London market. Therefore, the competition between the States in order to secure the renewals of their loans must of itself bring about the most serious and dangerous difficult v. Mr Harper.",14
16,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,-But there is no indication that the people who have lent their money in the past will not continue to do so.,15
17,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I shall deal with that point later on. For the present I would merely tell the honourable member that it is impossible for us to say what the lending classes may think twelve or fourteen vears hence. We know, however, that the money market is managed by a comparatively small circle in London, to whom our necessities are well known, and that if the States compete one with the-other in endeavouring to obtain renewals of loans, the financiers will endeavour to make the best possible terms. They may be quite willing to lend their money, but may require high rates of interest. It has been said by representatives of the States, at the Premiers' Conferences and elsewhere, that the credit of the States is as good as that of the Commonwealth. I think, however, that if they rely upon that assumption they will find themselves most grievously mistaken. I am in entire accord with the Treasurer, who, as the result of inquiries made by him in London recently, has come to the conclusion that it is most dangerous to seek to obtain large renewals of loans in the London market, when there are a number of competitors, each endeavouring to do the best he can for his own State. In my opinion, if the States compete one with the other in obtaining renewals, they will probably not only be unable to do as well as in the past, but have to renew their loans at a rate of interest considerably higher than they are paying at present. Therefore, the question of placing the finances of the States on a satisfactory footing should be dealt with without delay. I believe that without some organization, and the assistance of the Commonwealth, the States will run very serious rislks of disaster. I have already referred to the statement of the Treasurer in this connection, and I may further point out that my view is supported by Mr Coghlan in the paper that he recently issued on the question of the States debts. He saysThis is a most serious clanger-on e which can only be adequately met by the Commonwealth intervening and taking up the renewal of these loans, and dealing with them in the future. It 'seems to me that the time has come when this Farliament ought to grapple with the question, and decide upon the best course to be adopted. The following table shows the amount of loans falling due each year, from 1907 to 1920, and the number of competitors in each case :Year. a in 3 t/5 Debt s P6 take n £ 1907 (5) 2 1908 8,038,838 (4) 7,205,980 1909 5>S49,7°3 (5) 4,052,623 1910 4,73 -575 (5) 4,484,75 8 1911 5,417,611 (4) 5,076,30,0 1912 10,266,07s (5 ) 6,775,647 i9'3 8,037,570 (5 ) 7.41.57° 1 1914 1,499.530 (3 ) 863,611 19,459,260 (4 ) 17,860,367. 1,598,393 191S 9,746,645 (2) 9,338,445 1917 6,701,973 (2) 6,482,927 1918 14,300,700 (2) 14,300,600 1919 4,441,050 (3) 4,246,050 1920 13.994,7°° (5) 12,444,700 1,550,000 non-party one. 124,530,879 105,839,419 NOTE - In six of these years five States be competing; in three years f o u r States will be competing; in two years three States will be competing; and in three years two States will be competing.",15
18,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"H as the honourable memthe other. ber prepared figures for later years? MrH ARPER - I have not dealt with the loans falling due 'beyond 1920, because the Treasurer spoke only of the first twenty years from the establishment of the ComI monwealth. The loans falling due between 1920 and 1930 run into enormous figures.",16
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL," ^31,000,000 will f all due.",16
20,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"E x a c t l y . Therefore, for some considerable time, we cannot look for any relief. I do not wish to overstate, but rather to understate, the case. What I have said should be suflicient to indicate the importance of this question, and the necessity of dealing with it forthwith. I think we are indebted to the Treasurer for having brought the matter forward upon the present occasion. In delivering his last Budget, it was scarcely .to be expected that he would be in a position to deal with it, inasmuch as he had only assumed office a few days previously. However, he has since been giving it his consideration, and the result of that consideration is before honourable members in the memorandum which he has included in the Budget papers. I have to thank the right honourable gentleman for his attitude towards me in connection with the discussion of the question. As lie informed the Committee the other evening, he consulted me in reference to it, and he found that his views and my own were not in accord, but .a he magnanimously-and with great public J= > spirit, I think-decline d to dismiss the prou * u ° posals which, at his request, I had formu5 in C 5 w ej rt can b lated. On the contrary, he has afforded ^ o. g 2 every facility for their consideration by 0 having them printed, and laid before hon5. 95,3 9 2 orable members. 832,858 i,497,oSo Mr FISHER - He was quite fair. 53>825 Mr HARPER - He was exceedingly 0 2 34i,3"" 3J.490J43 fair, and his magnanimity indicates that 1 626,000 he realizes-as indeed we all do-the vast 635,899 importance of this question. He is anxious to hear all that can be said upon it, quite 408,200 219,046 regardless of the particular side of the 100 Committee from which criticism may come. 195,000 I say that this question is pre-eminent! v a It is a question in which every honourable member is interested, and 18,691,460 we should be failing in our duty if we will did not face it fairly, and-afte r having given it full consideration-decid e what is the best course to adopt. The difference between the Treasurer and myself is not as to whether one scheme is better than From the first, our difference was that the right honourable gentlemanowing to circumstances to which I shall presently allude-viewe d this matter from a different stand-point from that at which looked at it. Therefore, it was impossible for us to"" amalgamate our proposals, to blend them one with the other. The right honourable gentleman saidIn 1924, My reason for not making any proposal of a permanent character is that I do not believe it possible at the present time to formulate a plan that would be acceptable for all time, to both the Commonwealth and the States. The difficulties in the way at present are too great, and we are only beginning to think f e d e r all y. He afterwards stated that he disagreed with me because he did not think that the scheme which I proposed-and which is designed to secure finality as far as that is possible, because there can be no absolute finality in a matter in which Parliament is concerned-wa s practicable. He added that there was plenty of room for criticism and for differences of opinion in respect to this matter, and declared that he merely desired that those who did not agree with him should suggest some better scheme. Evidently he has an open mind upon the subject, and if he were satisfied that a scheme which would secure finality as nearly as it is possible to obtain it were practicable, he would be prepared to consider it. That being, so, I am relieved of all hesitancy in dealing with this question. The right honourable gentleman indicated his views in this able and friendly manner, assure both himself and the Committee that the criticisms to which I shall in a few moments subject his proposals, are only such as I deem to be necessary in order to show why I differed from him ab initio. The Treasurer's proposals seem to me to be dominated by the opinion expressed in the remarks which I have just quotedthat no scheme of finality would at the present time meet with success, and that to secure some settlement of the question it was better to allow things to continue as nearly as possible under present conditions until public opinion was better prepared to deal with a final solution of it, and until we had begun to think federally. I admit that there is a good deal of force in his contention. I acknowledge . that in many respects we have not yet acquired the habit of thinking federally. But it seems to me that the best way to encourage, not only the people, but the Governments of the States, to think federally is to propound schemes which are Federal in their principles, and which will, by their beneficent effects, induce them to conclude that, after all, Federation is the right thing. they will begin to think federally. way in wihich we deal task which we have to face in dealing with this question will, I trust, have the effect of inducing a more favourable view to be taken of the aims and objects of our Federal Government. Having taken up the position which I have indicated, the ideas to which I have referred dominated the Treasurer's mind. In drawing up his scheme, so far as I can judge, the right honourable gentleman had constantly pressing upon him the obligation to meet the objections which have, from time to time, been urged against any action in the direction o.f altering the existing state of affairs, which is dominated what is known as the "" Braddon clause."" If I may be permitted to say so without giving offence, and without any sinister meaning being attached to my statement, I would say that, in dealing with this matter, the Treasurer, Owing to the pressure of these ideas upon him, has followed what I might call the provincial lines, whereas I Iir. Har'fer. think-and here is where the difference between us comes in-this question should, and can, be approached from the Federal standpoint. I propose to deal first with the finanhaving cial relations of the Commonwealth to the reason- States, because it seems to me that the secI can tions of our Constitution which relate to this matter dominate the position. The Treasurer's proposals cover a period of ten years, namely, from 1910 to 1920. Dealing with the question of the financial arrangements",16
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If we could settle the other question, that to which the honourable member refers would regulate itself, I think.",17
22,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I will deal with the other question at a later stage. I am quite willing to deal with it first, but perhaps it will be better if I am permitted to work the matter out in my own way. The Treasurer's proposal is to pay annually to each State from the end of 1910 to 1920 a fixed sum equal to the average annual amount of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which that State has contributed during the five years preceding 31st December, 1910. In addition to this, he also proposes that if the three-fourths of the total net revenue collected by the Commonwealth exceeds the aggregate amount of the fixed sum so payThen able to the States, it shall be distributed The among them. with the Sir PHILIP FYSH - On a per capita basis.",17
23,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is so; but that fact makes very little alteration in the position. It might affect individual States, but my opinion is that it would not do so. evidently Mr KNOX - It is an unnecessary complication.",17
24,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I recognise that from the stand-point of the Treasurer, it is necessary to do something in that direction, but it is an exceedingly embarrassing, proposal. While it would do away with the Braddon section, it would re-create it by i,:i a more objectionable form. That can be easily demonstrated. The Treasurer's proposal is, I think, inequitable to the Commonwealth, and I propose to give an illustration in support of that view. Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity of calculation, that the fixed sum is based oa a revenue' of - ^8,000,000 per annum. Three-fourths of that amount is .£6,000,000. That amount, according te the right honourable gentleman's scheme, would be the fixed sum payable to the States for ten years plus any increase beyond the total revenue of £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. It might well be that for some years the revenue would reach £9,000,000. In that case the States would receive not only the £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, but £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 , representing three-fourths of the additional amount of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, or a total of .£6,750,000. On the other hand, the Commonwealth would receive £ 2 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 instead of the £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which it would retain if the revenue were only £8,000,000 . We have to consider, however, what would be the position if in any one year the revenue fell, away to £7,000,000. It is not unreasonable to assume that such a decrease, which represents only 12J percent, may take place. I have known the revenue of this State to f a ll away for a number of years to the extent of something like £2,000,000 per annum. What would be the result if , under the Treasurer's scheme, the Commonwealth had a similar experience? The position would be that we should have a net revenue of £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; that the fixed proportion going to the Slates would be £ 6 , 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 , and that the balance of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be retained by the Commonwealth. In other words, the whole of the shrinkage would come out of the proportion retained by the Commonwealth, with the result that this Parliament might suddenly find itself in a position of very grave difficulty. In such circumstances, the only wav under the Treasurer's scheme, so far as I can see, to overcome the difficulty, would be to impose a special tax, which would be ear-marked to make good the deficiency.",17
25,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Treasurer of the Commonwealth would have to do what every Treasurer ihas to do when faced with a deficit.,18
26,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"U n d e r any scheme there might be a deficiencv in the revenue, but the gravamen of my objection is that under the right honourable gentleman's scheme the whole of the deficit would be borne by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Parliament would thus have to adopt one of two courses. could not, under the Treasurer's scheme, impose a general increase of duties to raise the sum necessary to make good the deficiencv. it would have to promulgate a new tax on some specific article or articles and ear-mark the revenue so obtained to make good the deficiency or impose a direct tax tor the purpose.",18
27,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,O r curtail expenditure.,18
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But there would be no inducement to the States to curtail expenditure.,18
29,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I should like the right honourable gentleman to enlighten the Committee as to the course he would pursue in the contingency I have named. How could he so curtail expenditure,18
30,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"How could the Treasurer curtail his expenditure from £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ?",18
31,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Exactly. The risk is enormous, and is one that ought not to be run. It is all-important that the Commonwealth-if it is to take over the liabilities of the States, as we know it ought to do-shoul d show the outside world that it can meet its obligations, and that it is not subject to the danger of deficits which may disorganize its finances and upset its general business arrangements. When, the right honourable gentleman considers this phase of the question-as he will do if he has not done so already-h e will see that this is a position that would be absolutely subversive of the best interests of the Commonwealth. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, the Treasurer's scheme would impose on the States no obligation to economise.",18
32,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"As the population increases, our Customs revenue must increase.",18
33,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I have great sympathy with my right honourable friend. He has spent the greater part of his life in a State which began to ascend rapidly only during his career as its leader and guide. For many years Victoria and other States also experienced a constant accession of prosperity; but the day came when there was a great reverse, and all who had any responsibility, however sanguine they may have been before, had then a lesson which they will never forget. Whether it be in regard to the affairs of an individual or a State, we can never reckon upon continual prosperity. We may rest assured that the Since it greater the prosperitv the nearer we are to a. reaction. That is the experience of Australia, and in view of that fact it behoves us to be careful that in arranging the finances of the Commonwealth, in its infancy we shall proceed on lines that will be suited not only to fair weather conditions, but will also enable us to withstand the blasts of adversity.",18
34,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"There has been a drop in Victoria from £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 £6,000.000 odd.",19
35,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,How did they amount manage in Victoria?,19
36,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"V e r y badly, I think.",19
37,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I suppose that a other people would not manage too well, under such conditions.",19
38,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The right honourable gentleman misses the point, which is that the necessity for retrenchment would fall on the Commonwealth, which, from its circumstances, could not retrench. Here I call the right gentleman's attention to the fact that able friend the Commonwealth is steadily, year by year, taking over from the States with. nearly all the non-remunerative and exStates pensive Departments, and leaving the States with but a comparatively few of the Departments which involve very heavy expenditure. I suppose that the Educawould tion Departments chiefly cause the large expenditure in most of the States. I take over these obligations, and carry the work for the benefit of the whole, of the States, they must be paid for, and, the operation of this provision in the right honourable gentleman's scheme, he would, in a time of adversity, throw the whole the strain on the Commonwealth Parliawhoever ment and Government, and leave absorevenue, lutely untouched the States, which would have greater ability than we to retrench in other directions.",19
39,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The States have great obligations placed upon them.,19
40,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is so; and I shall refer later on to what the States have to do. In the meantime. I am not under-rating the functions of the States, but calling attention to the functions and obligations that we are assuming. Under the circumstances, it would be dangerous for us to deal in the way proposed with the finances of the States. It would be preferable to leave the Braddon section as to the States? it stands. M:'. WATSON - The States share loss under the Braddon section.",19
41,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Let me use illustration I have already presented to honourable members to illustrate the working of the Braddon section. If we take the basis of £8,000,000-that is, £6,000,000, £2.000,000. or three-fourths and one-fourth-and there were a fall of revenue to £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, the States, under the Braddon section, would get only £ 5 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 they would suffer three-fourths of the loss 0 0 to - whil e the Commonwealth would get £1,750,000. In other words, though the of our one-fourth would be decreased, the States' receipts would also decrease-in other words, there would be partnership i r losses as well as in profit. Under the scheme of the right honourable gentleman, however, a certain revenue, whether the receipts were large or small, would go to the States, and the Commonwealth would be left Io do as it best could.",19
42,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We have the right to raise revenue for specific purposes. honourable Mr HARPER - But my right honorhas not provided for that, and that is what I find fault In addition to giving the a fixed sum, and making no provision for a deficiency, the Treasurer would tie the hands of this' Parliament, because then, either a direct tax) have to be imposed, or certain sources of revenue would have to be earf we marked to meet the deficiency. But it on might well happen that if the scheme of the right honourable gentleman were carried by out, and the practice of ear-marking were introduced into the finances- a practice which I do not think we ought to introof duce-the Treasurer for the time being, he might be, who was short in might find that all available sources had been ear-marked prior to his should l,ave necessity arising.",19
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does the honourable member mean to infer that the scheme is too liberal to the States?,19
44,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am criticising the scheme as a financial proposal, and trying to bring the probable effects of it before honourable members. I am not dealing with the question of liberality or parsimonv, but with the question whether or not this is a sound business, financial proposition.",19
45,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does the honourable member say that the scheme is too libera!,19
46,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member the savs that the scheme is unsound. Mr HARPER , - I have never used the the same words ""too liberal.""",19
47,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But the honourable member savs that we have done more than we ought to have done-that we guarantee and more than we should guarantee.,19
48,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It is quite evident that the Treasurer is getting near to an election !,19
49,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Why doss the honourable member for Wide Bay say that ?,20
50,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I hope this is not regarded as an election question, because it relates to a very serious business. I hope that we shall not be diverted by any consideration of that sort to the right or the left in our decision regarding what isj or should be, a business proposition.",20
51,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"He a r , hear !",20
52,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In the case I have supposed, there would be a community or partnership in losses, as well as in profits. It would be far better, so far as the point under consideration is concerned, to permit the Braddon clause to continue, than to .adopt the proposal of the right honourable member.",20
53,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The States would have no security.,20
54,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,W it h regard to the question of security,20
55,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is the object.,20
56,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Then the object is not attained, as I shall show in a few words.",20
57,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is the object. Ms. HARPER - That may be, but we very often have objects, and do not take the right way to attain them. I shall show that the scheme does not give the certainty that the right honourable gentleman thinks it gives. For the sake of argument, let us take another illustration. I trust that honourable members will forgive me ""for using illustrations, but, in dealing with this matter, they bring more clearly before us the working out of any particular proposition. Let us suppose that we have a series of prosperous years"" after this scheme is adopted, and that the revenue, instead of being £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , remains steadily at £9.000,0 0 0 for a number of years. Let us f urther suppose that in each of the years, the States are receiving, not only their guaranteed amount, which is a certain and fixed sum, but £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year in addition. Under such circumstances, if there were a sudden change, and the States began to receive only £6,000,000, their finances would be more or less deranged. Does the right honourable gentleman think for one moment that the States would then be satisfied? As a matter of fact, they would be crving out. as they are now, that their finances were deranged, and that we ought to have done something different. The right honourable gentleman has only diminished the margin of variation; he has not removed it. In our ever.y-day life, a man who is receiving £ 4 0 0 a year may grumble, but if his salary is raised to £ 5 0 0 , and after remaining a few years at that figure, is reduced by £ 2 5 , he feels more aggrieved than if his position had never been improved. A nd so it would be with the States. We must look at this matter from a reasonable ' and sound business standpoint, and I contend that the scheme is inequitable to the Commonwealth, and does not give stability to the finances of the States, except to a limited extent.",20
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member must remember that the amount returned would not be influenced by our expenditure, but only by our receipts; the position would not be as it is now, when, if we spend the money, the States do not get it.",20
59,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That does not meet the point I am discussing. My point is that the scheme does not give fixity to the amount received by the States. I am not going into the causes. That is a different matter altogether. I come now to the proposal relative to ear-marking special items of revenue to provide for certain specific objects. I submit that it is one that ought not to be adopted. It is a clumsy and unsatisfactory way of attaining the object in view. The case of old-age pensions was mentioned by the right honourable gentleman. Suppose that under his scheme certain duties were imposed, and were ear-marked for the purpose of paying old-age pensions. What would be the effect? Parliament would impose certain taxation which it would be assumed would meet the object in view. If it should happen that the amount estimated was not obtained-that the amount required for the object in view was larger than the amount of the duty realized-the n either the payments would have to be limited to that extent or the duty would have to be increased, or some other duty would have to be imposed. The result would be to disturb all commercial transactions, so far as concerned the article or articles affected by the duties. If , for instance, n duty were placed on tea for the purpose of providing old-age pensions, and 3d. per lb. were the amount of the tax which was estimated to be sufficient, and if it were found not to be sufficient, would not every tea merchant in the country say- "" Parliament will now be imposing a. duty of 6d. per l b ? "" U n certainty would be introduced into trade, because people who observe these thingseven the man in the street reading the indications-woul d know that something else would have to be done. Another objection is this: Suppose the amount of the duty imposed for the purpose of old-age pensions proved to be more than sufficient for the purpose. Then it is likely that the whole amount would be absorbed, perhaps by extravagant administration or in some other manner. I cannot conceive a more mischievous way of endeavoring, to give reasonable facilities to the Commonwealth than this, because it would, in my humble opinion, be always a disturbing element in business operations. The proper and systematic way to attain the object is that the Commonwealth Parliament should provide enough out of its general revenue-ou t of the whole proceeds of its taxation-to meet the object in view. I think that these questions are deserving of the very careful attentioii of Parliament. I am sorry that I have not had an earlier opportunity to put my views before honourable members, but I express them now with confidence that the considerations I put forward will receive attention. As to the inconvenience of the present position, I am in thorough agreement with the right honourable gentleman that the Braddon and bookkeeping sections have caused, and are likely to cause in the future, considerable embarrassment to this Parliament in carrying out its legitimate duties. The reason for that is that we in this Parliament cannot do anything as a matter of policy with the freedom we ought to 0 have as men responsible to our constituents, and to them alone. In seeking for an illustration of this inconvenience, it struck me that I might take the right honourable gentleman's proposal to institute penny postage. I am in thorough agreement with it, because I think that it is in accordance with the spirit of Federation that the same rate of postage should prevail in all parts of the Commonwealth. It does seem to be absurd that in Adelaide one should have to pay 2d. to send a letter from one street to another, whilst in Victoria a letter is carried to any part of the State from any other part for i d . There are similar inequalities in other directions. When I make the remarks to which I am about to give utterance it will be understood, therefore, that I am not hostile to the proposal to reduce the postage rate. But I wish to use the proposal as an illustration of the embarrassment which will be caused; and my reMr Harper. - marks' are applicable not only to this, but to any other proposal which this Parliament, as a matter of policy, may favour under existing circumstances. I find on looking into this question of the postage, and reading the paper circulated by the Postmaster-General .after the Treasurer's Budget speech, that he says that it is estimated by the officers of his Department thatIf penny postage were established, the immediate reduction in revenue would be £265,000 a year if limited to the Commonwealth, or about .£300,000 per annum if extended to all places within the .Empire and to other parts of the world. The proposal of the Government is to adopt the higher scale, giving penny postage, notonly within the Commonwealth but outside of it, involving a loss at first of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 en year. I find, on looking through the paper circulated by the Postmaster-General, that a curious mistake has been made. I discovered it only this morning. It does not alter my position, nor does it affect the desirableness of carrying out the proposal; but it is just as well to point out the error. Three instances are quoted as precedents for the proposed action in reducing the postage rate. The first is Canada, the second New Zealand, and the third Victoria. In each case statistics are given, but the curious thing is that in each instance the average increase stated is wrong. In Canada the returns are set out, and are said to show an average increase of 51.18 per cent, per annum. The average should be 15.18 per cent. In New Zealand, the average increase is stated to be 54.04 per cent., whereas it is 13 per cent, per annum. . In Victoria, the increase is said to be 35.25 per cent, but it is 9.87 per cent.",20
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Perhaps it is the total increase from the beginning which is meant?,21
61,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It places the Postmaster-General in the unfortunate position of saying, "" In view of the experience in other countries, which has just been quoted, I venture to think that the increase of 40 per cent, in correspondence in the first year may be safely anticipated, which would reduce the amount for that year to £150,000.""",21
62,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It will be found that the percentages are correct.,21
63,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Is it the increase per annum or for the total number of years?,21
64,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is the increase for the total number of years. An increase from 150,000,000 to 285,000,000 letters not an increase of 51.18 per cent.",22
65,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Ove r how many years?,22
66,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That increase is spread stance, over six years.",22
67,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I expect that it is ready a deficit of £ 8 1 , 9 3 4. the total increase from the beginning the present time.",22
68,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I admit that I read £ 1 the figures very hurriedly, but it does alter my position. I merely call attention to the fact that there must be some mistake.",22
69,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I have checked the figures very carefully, and I think honourable member will find that they are absolutely correct.",22
70,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"They do not prove our hands. much, even if they are correct.",22
71,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is a ter of opinion.,22
72,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not wish to dwell upon the matter. The Treasurer is, believe, entitled to assume that in the the first year there will be an inwe can, crease of 15 per cent., although he turbance estimates that it will be from 30 to present financial arrangements. 40 per cent., but that, in my opinion, does not affect the question very much. consider that the reduction is justifiable, even if the increase should be only at rate of 15 per cent, per annum, because believe that in five or six years the ciency would be 'wiped out.",22
73,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the honorbut able member's figures were correct, how could the new revenue of Canada increase in a period of four years to very much mere than the old revenue?",22
74,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The increase referred to in the number of letters-of course, do not know how the calculation was armonwealth, rived at - is from 150,000,000 to would 285,000,000, but that would not work out at 51 per cent, per annum.",22
75,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I am very glad to hear that the honourable member supwould ports the proposal even with a smaller perto centage of increase.,22
76,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I thought that there was a mistake, but it does not affect position. The point to be considered is how States would be continued. would the proposal affect the States. T show .how inconvenient it is to continue the should be surmounted. Braddon section or any arrangement simifuture lar to that, let me point out the way which this one proposition, which the Comfloat mittee in its wisdom might adopt, as a ter of public policy, in the interest of the Commonwealth, would affect, to a certain is extent, the revenue of all the States, and would necessarily have a bearing, on their view of the matter. Take, for inQueensland, which, according to the Treasurer's statement, has alB y adding to its proportion of the loss on penny postage, the deficit would be increased to about 1 3 , 0 0 0 . It is facts such as these which not cause anti-federal feeling. Every Federal proposal which affects a State Treasurer's financial statement, especially in those States which have been hardly hit by the the arrangements necessary under the Commonwealth, causes the State to feel aggrieved, and to think that it is suffering unjustly at",22
77,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The State Treasurer matsays, in effect, "" You are spending our money.""",22
78,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is the position. I The question is, how is it best to deal with subject, so as to get rid of, as far as the feeling'of irritation and the diswhich arises in connection with the I shall come presently to the suggestions which I seem to me to be desirable for the accomplishment of that purpose. Before doing the so, however, I would mention briefly the I arrangements proposed for taking over the defiStates debts. The Treasurer wants powei to take over the whole of the States debts, he does not propose-in fact, that would be impossible-to take them over at once. He proposes to take them over as they may f all due, or as he can convert them. That process, of course, would take a long time. In the meanwhile, the States I would pay their own interest, and the Comas it assumed the obligations, pay its own interest, receiving that interest back with one-half per cent, sinking, fund to meet the obligation. The sinking funds to be provided under this scheme be vested in trustees, with power invest the money and ear-mark each fund for the purpose of liquidating its own particular debt. By this means, unfortunately, the the separate treatment of the different That is a o defect in the proposal which, if possible, With regard to loans, all that is proposed is that in the Commonwealth shall be empowered to loans for the States on terms to be matagreed upon, that the States shall not borrow in London until 1920, and that the States borrowing within the Commonwealth shall be liable for their own debts. scheme in this respect seems to me to.be one to gradually take over the debts as they fall due, and nothing else. But the debts, as they were assumed, should be practically unified. In that case, as they fall due they would become Commonwealth debts. seems to me to be very much more desirable to manage the debts as one common fund, than to deal with, each one ear-marked for a particular State, and so make special arrangements for the liquidation of the debts separately. The right honourable gentleman proposes to meet these obligations by the establishment of consols at 3 per cent., interminable, except at the wish of the Commonwealth, or, upon six months' notice, in thirty years. In regard to that proposition, I find myself entirely at one with him. I believe that it would be wise to have only one denomination. It is true that the consols might noi at first reach par, because, being a new stock, they might not attain their proper value. But it is tetter to fix a stock at a rate of interest like 3 per cent., which, as things go, is a fairly low rate, and then the prices given for the stock from time to time would indicate its value in the market. it might not fetch par at the commencement, still I believe that with proper management and the fact being made absolutely evident to the investing public that it was a first class security, the time would not be far off when 3 per cents, would be floatable at very close to, if not at, par. I therefore thoroughly agree with the proposition. The information which Treasurer obtained in London is valuable, because he has ascertained beyond question that anv movement in the direction of the unification of the debts or the taking over of them by the Commonwealth would be received with the greatest favour in London financial circles. He has also arrived at the conclusion, after inquiry, that 3 per cent, stock is the one which would be the best for the purpose which we have in view. With regard to the embodied in my paper, which has been circulated today, and which a few honourable members have had the opportunity of looking through since we last met by getting early copies, I may say briefly that the objectives I had in view in dealing with this problem were first of all to take over Mr Harper. all the existing debts, and practically unify them. i The Mr HIGGINS - Does the honourable member mean to include those debts which have been incurred since Federation?",22
79,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . The Treasurer proposes to do the same thing, but only after an alteration of the Constitution. I, It though not a lawyer, have ventured in my proposal to suggest that it may be unnecessary to alter the Constitution for that purpose, because in section 96 it is specially enacted that the States may receive financial assistance from .the. Commonwealth on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit, and it seems to me that there is nothing, to prevent the Commonwealth from lending money on terms to the States in lieu of the obligations which may have been taken up on their behalf.",23
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Commonwealth, could be said to be lending money to the States only if , and so long as, it gave them a better credit. If something occurred to lower the credit of the Commonwealth, so that it became unable to give the States a better credit than they have now, it could not be said to be giving them financial assistance, and might, in having taken over the debts, have acted to their Although financial disadvantage.",23
81,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I had not conceived that the Commonwealth might ever be in circumstances, or might ever do anything, which would make its credit lower than that of any State. The honourable member has suggested to my mind a possibility which I had not calculated upon;.",23
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We are told that the the Commonwealth credit would not be better than that of a State.,23
83,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We have not yet been able to test the matter. It is because I consider it of paramount importance that the Commonwealth credit should be well and soundly established that I am anxious that we shall follow lines which will impress the public mind of Australia and other countries with the thoroughness of our financial position. My desire is that proposals the existing debts of the States shall be taken over and practically unified in time as a Commonwealth debt, represented by 3 per cent, bonds, terminable after, say, twenty years-the Treasurer would prefer thirtv years-and not earlier except at the option of the Commonwealth.",23
84,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What mode of financial assistance does the honourable member propose in regard to States debts which did nob exist when Federation was inaugurated? Would the honourable gentleman lend the States money?,23
85,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I propose to lend them money. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - To take the place of the States with a better credit.,24
86,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . If the honourable member reads my memorandum, he will see that those debts are covered. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth will in time become the creditor of the States, because the existing debts will be paid off, Commonwealth bonds taking their place, and the interest will be met out of the revenue of the Commonwealth. That is a position which must ultimately be reached in regard to both the debts which can be taken over by the Commonwealth and those which, according to one reading of the Constitution, cannot be taken over. The average rate of interest payable on the debts of the States at the present lime is about £ 3 . 6 per cent.",24
87,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is very difficult arrive at the average rate. Air. HARPER - The calculation is simple one. So many millions of money have been borrowed, and so much is annuloan ally being paid as interest on the sum, average rate being. £ 3 . 6 per cent. I monwealth bonds can be floated at par, bearing interest at 3 per cent., the saving which will result will provide for the rest and the extinction of the present debts of the States in sixty years, without any sinking fund. We have to face the conyear, tingency that the Commonwealth may have to pay more than 3 per cent., or the equibility valent of a higher rate, but in that case all that would happen would be that the States debts would not be extinguished would be wiped out. within the period I have named, and ^he annual sinking fund payment, amounting to £8.500,000 , would have to be conwhat tinued for a somewhat longer period. This, Excise revenue? however, would not derange our finances in any way. Commonwealth consols, the First few years, may have to be sold under par, which may add a few of pounds to the debt; but as they reach par the difference will become inconsiderable, and will not derange the general plan. My idea is to take over the debts of the States as they stand, making them a Commonwealth obligation, and freeing the States thenceforward from all obligations connected with them. Instead of returning money to the States, as we do now, we shall pay the interest on their debts as it falls due. 'We should determine the amount coming to the States under the Braddon provision, upon the basis of the. payments of the last four years. The States, instead of paying to their creditors the difference between the amount I have mentioned, and the total amount of the interest on their debts, would pay it to the Commonwealth, which, by adding it to the amount payable to the States under the Braddon section, would be able to meet the interest on the debts.*",24
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Would it be more satisfactory for the States to pay us the money, than for the Commonwealth to pay the States?",24
89,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I think it would be much more satisfactory, hecause it would place the States and the Commonwealth in their proper positions. If we assumed the States debts, and removed from their balance-sheets the big debits for interest, that now appear annually, it would be only to right for the States to pay to us the difference between the amount to which they a are entitled under the Braddon section, and the sum that would be due by them to their creditors. Under this plan, instead the of having an uncertain sum to provide for, f Comas would be the case under the proposal of the Treasurer, we should, year by year, give to the States a cumulative rebate intewhich would ultimately reach the sum of £ r , 8 6 0 , 0 0 0 . To this extent we should relieve them of their financial strain. Each as the States went on making their payments to the Commonwealth, the liawould be reduced by 5 per cent., and ultimately the whole obligation of the States with regard to interest payments",24
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"When the debts were paid off by means of the sinking fund, would become of the Customs and",24
91,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That could be refor mitted to the people of Australia.,24
92,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Would any part of thousands it go to the States?,24
93,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No . Mv assumption is that the sinking fund would be created by the use of the credit of the Commonwealth. At present the States pay interest on their debts at an average rate of £ 3 . 6 per cent. If we could borrow money at 3 per cent., and credit the sinking fund with 0.6 per cent., we should create the fund by the use of our credit.",24
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Would not the honourable member give back to the States any part of the Customs and Excise revenue, after the debts have been paid off?",25
95,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"At the end of the twenty-year period, I would allow the Parliament to determine what should be done. If, after having been relieved of its obligations, Parliament had a large sum of money in hand, it might determine to make a gi ant per capita 'to the States. cannot look into the future, at any' rate, so far as that.",25
96,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Would the whole of the States debts be pooled, or would each State pay off its own debts as. it went along - woul d Queensland pay off £ 8 0 per head and Victoria £ 5 0 per head, or would both share alike?",25
97,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the right honourable gentleman refers to my statement, he will see that the whole position is made clear.",25
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Commonwealth would merely act as a trustee for the States.,25
99,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes, we should take over the whole of'the debts. 1 may seem somewhat subtle, but in reality it is very simple. The Commonwealth Government would take over the whole of the States debts as they stood.",25
100,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But , in some States, the debts have reached £ 8 0 pen head, whilst in others they represent only £ 5 0 per head.",25
101,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the right honourable gentleman will follow my argument, he will see how the difficulty can be overcome. Assuming that I am correct in my view that we could borrow money at 3 per cent., we should save one-sixth per cent, interest on £233,000,000. My belief is that, if there is no organization on the part of the Commonwealth to take over the debts, the States, when they renew their loans, will have to pay quite as high, if not a higher rate, of interest, than at present. 1 say, we can save 0.6 per cent, of the present interest charge, we shall in sixty years be able to pay off the whole of the debts of the States. I contend that we shall not be robbing any of the States, or doing them any harm if we devote the amount saved by the exercise of the Commonwealth credit to this purpose. shall be doing it for the benefit of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. With regard to the question that has been raised by the Treasurer, I would point out that we ought to remember the position of some of the States. From the very outset I have felt the greatest sympathy with Queensland and Tasmania, because they have suffered most severely at every turn. I think that we should deal with this question in a generous spirit. We should not look into every detail with a microscopic eye, in order to see that this or that State does not gain a shilling at the expense of the others. But we Sir JOHN FORREST - That is not in accordance with section 105 of the Constitution.",25
102,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"W it h regard to that point, I would repeat what I have already stated. Assuming that we can borrow money at 3 per cent.",25
103,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Is there any reason for that assumption ?,25
104,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . In addition to the information obtained by the Treasurer, when in London, we have the experience of Mr Coghlan, who thinks that ere long the Commonwealth w i l i be able to borrow money close up to par at 3 per cent. This question I believe that that is an accurate view of the situation, and I think that the forecast is more likely to be realized if this Parliament propounds a scheme of finance which will commend itself to the investors of the old world.",25
105,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"What .attitude would be . taken by a State now paying J per cent, 3 interest on its loans as against, say. South Australia, which is paying 5 per cent. ?",25
106,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"So u t h Australia is not paving 5 per cent, for her loan money.",25
107,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Sh e is paying that rate upon some of it.,25
108,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We should take over the whole of the obligations of the States, and create a fund which would enable us without doing injustice to any State, to confer a benefit upon those States which at the present time have much the heaviest per If , as capita burden of debt. Then we have to weigh another consideration. Queensland and Western Australia are per capita much more heavily indebted than some of the other States, but what will be the position twenty years hence? What are the probabilities? Is it not likely that in the great States I have mentioned, with their Targe We areas of land suitable for settlement, population will increase at a very much morerapid rate than in Victoria? Certainly it will. There is another point that Ave ought to remember, namely, that up to the present time New South Wales and Victoria have 0 been the largest gainers by Federation. The complaint of Queensland was-and ) there was some justification for it-tha many manufacturing industries which were being established weite retarded by the operation of Inter-State free-trade, under which Sydney and Melbourne obtained' the trade which otherwise she would have built up within her own borders. The same remark is applicable to the other States. We ought to recollect that. I there be a big population in Victoria New South Wales, we should remember that a considerable portion of it is the direct result of those States manufacturing and selling goods which, but for Federarevenues tion, would probably have been made into be. Queensland, and would have employed an - increasing population there. In considermember ing this matter, I desire to deal with the paper. States in a large-hearted and generous manner, so that, after all, they may be to believe that Federation, has not been a bad thing for them.",25
109,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The duties credited to the States in which the goods are consumed.,26
110,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But the people not employed there. I trust that I have made my meaning clear concerning, isting debts of the States. I hold that the Commonwealth should take them over, handle them in its own way. Bv the use of the Commonwealth credit, a profit no ear-marking. would be derived which, in a certain number of years, would be sufficient to wipe off the total amount of the States indebteda ness. The profit which is derived the use of the Commonwealth credit should be appropriated to equalizing conditions of the different States. Can anything fairer than that be proposed? In the Argus today I read a letter regarding my proposals from Senator Pulsford. The I am afraid that he has rushed in before amount by floating bonds. he knew what he was attacking. As a matter of fact, his communication shows that he has not yet begun to grasp the which underlies m^scheme.

My proposal is that the Commonwealth shall borrow for the States upon the conditions which are set out in my paper, and which are similar to those with f which the States comply when they issue and a prospectus for a loan upon the London market-that is, they state the purposes for which the loan is required, how it expects to meet the interest, and what the from the undertaking are likely",26

My proled posals are before honourable members, and I shall be glad, at a subsequent stage, to explain any point upon which informaare tion is desired. I do not wish to enter into a discussion cf all the details. The principle with which I am concerned is are that the Commonwealth shall borrow the money, and that a sinking fund of \ the exper cent, shall be established. .",26

114,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,No ; there would be,26

116,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Commonwealth the Debt Commissioners would deal with the matter. Let us suppose that an application were made for the loan of, say, £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , with which to build a railway. Commonwealth would raise that The Debt Commissioners would then .hand it over to the State which had made the apidea plication, and which, under my scheme, merely be required to repay to the Commonwealth the exact cost that had been in the flotation of the loan, plus J per cent, for a sinking fund, and any and little additional charges which may have",26
117,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does the honourable member propose to restrict the States in,26
118,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not. Referring the to the mode of dealing with a loan to a State, an actuarial calculation would have to be made. The State would annually repay to the Commonwealth an amount representing 3^ or £ 3 . 6 per cent, upon the loan. By doing that for sixty years they would extinguish the whole of the debt. In short, my proposal is to make use of the terminating annuity principle. I am assuming that if the Commonwealth credit were established upon a 3 per cent, basis, and the States paid back at the rate of 3J per cent - the y would not be able to borrow upon their own account for less than that-the y would in the course of sixty yeairs pay not only the interest, but the whole of the principal. It seems to me that we have a unique opportunity in public finance, one which has not been enjoyed by any other country. We have to deal with £233,000,000, and we can provide for paying that sum out of our revenue by making a permanent annual appropriation of £8,500,000, the sum the States have heretofore paid for interest alone. should gradually pay off the entire sum by means of the savings which we effected. In this connection I may mention that Mr Coghlan, in his paper, says that by-and-by we could effect a saving of £1,300,000 per annum. That money would need to be re-invested. ' It couldunder the scheme I have outlined-be reinvested either in our own obligations or in loans to the States, and the latter would simply be required to annually pay to the Commonwealth 3^ per cent, upon such loans, which rate, in sixty years, would not only cover the interest charges, but - also wipe out the principal. The result would be that in forty or fifty years the original debt of £233,000,000 would be greatly diminished, and it is quite conceivable that sixtv or seventy years hence we might have public works valued at £500,000,000 , upon which there would be a debt of not more than £250,000,000. It seems to me that now is the time for us to face these ques-' tions in a broad patriotic spirit. We should deal with them as large questions which affect not only today, but the future. The works for which the Commonwealth would raise loans must be reproductive works, and I have defined that term in my paper. In regard to other works, or to temporary loans, the States should be at libertv to borrow within their own borders, as they would be responsible for them",26
119,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What dees the honourable member call non-productive works? Mr Tlarfer.,27
120,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I would call a lunatic asylum, or a school-house, or anything which did not return a> revenue, a nonproductive work. Honourable members will observe that, under my scheme, the fullest liberty would be given to the States. I do not think that we ought to hamper them, but, on the contrary,- we ought, by evenmeans in our power, to stimulate them to develop their own territory. For that reason I make no proposal to interfere with their railways. Under my scheme they would have all the railway revenues with which to do the best they could, and they would be able to obtain more money whenever they had a sound proposition for which they were prepared themselves to accept responsibility. They would merely be called upon to provide interest and sinking fund, which would enable both themselves and the Commonwealth to wipe out their obligations within sixty years. Sixty years is a long time in the life of We an individual, but it is nothing in the life of a nation. If we lay down proper lines, and build upon a sound foundation, this country, .a couple of generations hence, will have great public works, and comparatively little public debt. Surely that is an object to be sought for, and, if possible] attained. To the uninitiated, itseems an uncanny statement that if they have a debt of £ 1 0 0 . and pay it off at the rate of \ per cent, per annum, in sixty years they will wipe it out; but it is a mathematical fact. The point is, of course, that that result is achieved by means of compound interest. If we got in any money in respect of the States debts of £233,000,000 , we should immediately invest it in the purchase of either State or Commonwealth loans, or by way of loans to the States. In this way we should derive 3 per cent, interest, so that the money would be fructifying from the first, and the result would be that sixty years after taking over these obligations, we should have our debt paid off. If we reinvested, the monev, the resuit would be that 111 a comparatively short period we might have a very large amount of public works with a very small debt upon it, and that debt mainly owing to the Commonwealth. I trust that honourable members will not consider that I am too enthusiastic with regard to this proposal. It is a matter of calculation, and any one mav make the necessary calculations for himself. It seems to me that we have a unique opportunity to put our public finances on a foundation that may be exceedingly beneficial to us in the future.",27

The money, whatever it costs the Commonwealth, must be repaid, plus the \ per cent, which will go into a sinking think I have dealt sufficiently with the Question of what should be substituted for the Braddon and the steps we should take with regard to the amounts at present paid to the several States. I may be accused of being too liberal to .the States. my proposal, we should, after 1910, give back to them annually a very large sum. In the first year, we should give them back £ 9 0 , 3 3 9 ; in the second year. , £ 1 8 0 , 6 7 8; in the third year, . £ 2 7 1 , 0 1 7; in the fourth year, £ 3 6 1 , 3 5 6 , and in the fifth year, £ 4 5 1 , 6 9 5 . Let us take, by way of illustration, the position of Queensland, and consider what effect mv proposal would have upon it. She would have to pay to the Commonwealth £ 7 3 6 , 0 0 0 to meet her debt obligations. At the end of 1911, under my scheme, she would have to pay to the Commonwealth ^£609,438 ; in the second year, , £ 6 6 2 , 6 2 5 ; in the third year, £ 6 2 5 , 8 1 3 ; in trie fourth vear, £ 5 8 9 , 0 0 0 ; and in the fifth year, £ 5 5 2 , 1 8 8, and so on.' It will thus be seen that there would be granted annually to the States relief aggregating a very large sum. The relief so received would be quite as much as could be fairly expected under the Braddon section, or any other scheme. It would be a fixed sum upon which the States could reckon, and the States Treasurers could make up their Budgets twelve months ahead if they chose to do so, since they would know exactly what they had to pay back to the Commonwealth in a particular year. They would - run ..no risk. The Commonwealth would undertake anv [84] risk that might accrue; but that risk would not be very great. The relief afforded to the States annually for twenty years would be provided for by an annual increase of The average r capita is £ 2 4s. per annum, so that anannual addition of 41,000 to our population would practically cover the amountwhich the States had to receive from the .1 Commonwealth through the 5 per cent, reFrom 1891 to 1901 we had a gi eater average increase in population than 41,000.",28
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Meantim e this increase of population would mean, at the It is, after all, a end of twenty years, greater cost of government.",28
126,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"To all parties, but mainlv to the Commonwealth. If our fund. I population increases to the extent of 41,000 per annum, the amount which the States are to receive from the Commonwealth will section, be covered. On the other hand, we have to remember that, as local production is encouraged by protective duties, the quantity of dutiable goods coming from abroad Under will be decreased. Making a fair allowance for that fact, however, I think that the Commonwealth would be perfectly safe in undertaking to pay back to the States a large sum annually/ My proposal really means that a large sum annually would be returned to the States. Although it would take the form of our remitting the charges which we had upon them, still, when reduced to its simple elements, it would mean their receiving a large sum annually. I have provided in the simplest way for the machinery necessary to give effect to my scheme. In order to avoid expense, I have provided for the appointment of debt Commissioners, who would form practically a branch of the Treasury. The Treasurer himself would be a member of the Commission, and its executive officer would be the Under-Secretary to the Treasury. There would also be four other members, two of whom might not be Members of Parliament.",28
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,They would be paid Commissioners?,28
128,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I have not entered into that question, which is, after all, a matter for consideration. No doubt if we secured the right men they would be worth paying. It is desirable to have continuity of management in connection with a schem<: of this kind. It is desirable that it should have a tradition; it should have men are accustomed to cany on the particular work that is required-the floating of loans, the paying of interest, and the genera! management of loan transactions. In view of the facts that I have, put before the House, I think that honourable members will recognise that the Commissioners for some vears would not have a very easy task. Their duties would require the exerquestions tion of the very best ability to finance the enormous transactions, to meet the obligaand tions as they fall due, and to make reasonable provision for any additional quirements. Therefore, we desire to have the best men; and it ought to be a of the Treasurer's Department, and semiindeoendent-that is to say, free from question. political influence.",28
129,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It is ability sfabilitv that we desire.,29
130,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I agree with the honourable member that we shall require both. As a matter of fact, my proposal provides all the requisite machinery. It occurred to me that disputes might arise through different States desiring money at a time when it might be inconvenient to float loans ; that is, one State might wish to get more than a fair proportion of loan money at a particular time. Under such circumstances, disputes might arise; and I suggest the appointment of a board of arbitrators; and in order to get the most detached and neutral body I could think of",29
131,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,A second board?,29
132,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Not a board, but arbiwould trators to be called to act only when quired; and it is very likely they would seldom required. As these would be appeals from sovereign States against the Commonrow wealth, or vice versa, I propose that, being approached by an appellant, the vernor-General should appoint four arbitracontinuously, tors with himself, he being President. I do not know whether the Governor General would be allowed to undertake such a duty under the Colonial Office regulations; if he were allowed, there is no doubt that would be the right course to pursue . The its pavment. Chief Tustice and another Justice of the High Court would be arbitrators, I suggest the appointment of two gentlemen, one of whom should be the manager of one of the leading banks.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - As a rule, Judges are not good financiers.",29

The to be settled would be questions of fact, calling for reasonable arbitration the exercise of sound judgment.",29
134,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Does the honorreable member think, in such cases, there would be any difficulty in obtaining money branch sufficient for our requirements?",29
135,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I cannot answer, that",29
136,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I should think as well as there would not be.,29
137,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I should think that if the credit of the Government were good, and the demands were reasonable, there would, under such a scheme, be created a security second to none in the world. The States which'borrowed would be responsible to the Commonwealth for the interest; and to raise if the undertaking did not pay, the particular State, out of its funds, would have to find the interest. The Commonwealth would have the monev, and would be responsible; and its credit would also be behind the security. I cannot conceive of any higher security that could be given; because a gilt-edged security of the first class would be created. Under such circumstances, the money could be got, I think, at 3 per cent., and the whole of our financial business be brought to a focus, one section rebeing the complement of the other. The be Commonwealth would borrow on interminable securities, while the States would borfrom the Commonwealth on terminable on annuities; and one would work into the Goother in such a wav as to reduce the debt and more or less rapidly.",29
138,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Commonwealth would act as banker for the States ?,29
139,Mr HARIER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Not as banker; the but, Commonwealth would simply be the medium for the collection of interest, and 1",29
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Commonwealth and then would be the agent?,29
141,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Commonwealth would be the creditor of the States, and, as the honourable member for Parramatta points out, to some extent also, . the The Commonwealth's credit would enable the States to get such terms that they would probably pay no more than they would have to pay if they borrowed on their own account, and the debt would be cleared in sixty years. I am afraid I have trespassed too long on the time of the Committee; but I feel, as I said at the opening of my remarks, that it is the duty of a public man to give these questions the utmost consideration. I should have liked to promulgate these views earlier, because I quite admit the difficulty, in dealing with such a huge subject, of being able, in one speech, or even half-a-dozen speeches, to meet all the points that may arise. trust, however, that honourable members will give me credit for not seeking, as a faddist, to bring forward a proposition simply because it is my own, or anything of that sort. I have thought this matter out as a business man, and I desire to place my views before honourable members in a business aspect, with the desire that I shall be given the credit, at any rate, for having simply submitted these views as a matter of public duty-for no other reason, and with no other purpose. I am sure that the Treasurer will feel that the remarks I have made about his scheme are the result of conviction and of the necessities of the case. That scheme is, I think, intended to solve in a temporary way a question which, in my opinion, ought to be settled finally. The difficulties that have been created in the Treasurer's scheme are, I think, as I said at the beginning, the result of the difference between his position and my own. The position I take is that the question should be settled now, without the delay of an hour. paper I say that by the 30th June, 1907, the whole matter ought to be settled; but, as a matter of fact, it ought to be settled at once, because £12,000,000 falls due next year, and then follow £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, £10,000,000, and so on. Under the circumstances there will not be breathing time, and anything which may be done ought to be done at once, to be effective. Consider the result upon the minds of financial people of the promulgation by the Commonwealth of a clean-cut, clear, definite policy. They would see that we knew where we were going-that we were not intending to drift into London, like waifs on the financial sea, one Agent-General"" endeavouring to raise money as against another Agent-General. If we put before [84]- 2 the world a sound business proposition, which commends itself to financial authorities, and show that we intend to create a security second to none, we shall succeed in placing the credit of this country on the soundest possible basis.",29

143,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does the honourable member not think that financiers might be afraid of labour legislation?,30

I express no opinion upon that point. But if we put ourselves in the best position as borrowers, show that we understand our business, that we mean to meet our obligations, and to pay our interest, and that the Commonwealth, backed up by the States, will be responsible for all these debts, I have no doubt that we shall succeed in placing ourselves in an In my exceedingly favourable position. There may be points that I have missed; and if , in Committee, honourable members choose to ask me any questions that may occur to them, I shall be pleased to give them any further information that I can give.",30
147,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Did the honourable member mean to convey that it is possible that the Commonwealth will have to pay more in consequence of labour legislation?,30
148,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not know. I said in reply to an interjection that I expressed no opinion as to that.,30
149,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member, I understand, had no intention to convey that the Labour Partv would repudiate the responsibilities of the Commonwealth?",30
150,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I certainly had no such intention. I am pleased that the honourable member has put that question. The interjection was whether labour legislation would make a difference, and it was said that Mr Coghlan had stated that it would. I replied that if people believed it, they might make us pay more for the use of their money. But I express no opinion whatever upon the point. fact is that people who wish to lend money generally look to the security, and if they think that the Labour Party' is likely to impair their security, they will form their own opinion, and act accordingly.

153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Parramatta) [4.32] - I think that the Committee is indebted to the honourable member for Mernda for a very able and very lucid speech. In my experience of Parliament, I have before to-dav learnt that a House is never better occupied than when listening to an honourable member who has made a subject peculiarly his own. That is one of the reasons which induced me, not merely to stand aside for the honourable member this afternoon, but to urge him to take an early opportunity to explain his scheme more fully to the Committee than he had already done in his memorandum that has been circulated. After listening to him, I feel that I have been well repaid in inducing him to deliver at this stage a speech of the character and calibre of that to which we have just listened. I do not pretend to any special financial ability, and, therefore, my observations upon the proposals of the Treasurer will occupy only a very short time. There is one matter to which I wish first of all to allude, and I do so the more readily because neither the Treasurer nor the honourable member for Mernda has touched upon it to any great extent. I refer to the book-keeping question, and the determination of the book-keeping period which takes place this year.",31
154,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Whic h may take place this vear, but need not.",31
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . Generally speaking, I think every honourable member will arrive at the conclusion that the present financia'l arrangements with the States cannot continue. They are not upon a satisfactory basis. They are anomalous. The}' were never intended to be permanent in their present form. As the honourable member for Mernda has mentioned quite clearly in his paper, they were only intended to meet a temporary The and tentative condition of things until a more permanent order could be safely ushered* in. The anomaly consists in this, to put it briefly: that the less we have to spend the more the States have to spend. If we give them more, the tendency is for them to spend it upon an extravagant basis - and I am speaking plainly now, I hopeas witness the political Largesse which is being distributed now out of the surplus by the .two large States in particular. On the other hand, if we give them less, there is a tendency ' arising within the Federal arean, towards extravagance. I am afraid that we have more than a suspicion of that in the Budget proposals of my right honourable friend the Treasurer. No one, I think, will, for a moment, say that they are of an extremely simple and economical order. Rather do they take a plunge in the direction of extravagance, as I hope to point out a little later on. At present we have one authority whose obligation it is to raise the money, and another authority whose function it is to spend it. The Commonwealth raises the money; the States spend it. Each authority is at present watching the other with a degree of jealousy and irritation which, if it be continued, cannot bode any good either to the States or to the Commonwealth. The inevitable tendency, wherever there is plenty of money to spend, is, of course, to spend it. The Treasurer never said a truer thing than when he said the other day that that was his own experience in connection with his own affairs. H is experience is that of every one else. Where there is plenty to spend it becomes the easiest thing imaginable to live up to the amount of the income, and so naturally extravagant ways are entered upon. A question arises in connection with this Budget as to whether we, as a Commonwealth, may not as well spend some of the money, which results from our booming trade and conditions just now, as hand it all over to the States, and leave ourselves in an attitude of Spartan simplicity as regards expenditure, while they are doling out money in a very extravagant way. The present arrangements cannot continue. They will be provocative of irritation as long as they exist, and the sooner they are ended the better for all concerned. I have already said that the present arrangements were intended to be temporary. That is made plain by the book-keeping sections, which, it is contemplated, will expire at a later period of this year. We must all admit that these book-keeping provisions, as long as they remain in> force, constitute neither more nor less than a negation of the Federal principle. We are put by them in the position of mere trustees for the States. Nay, more, they put us in the position of mere book-keepers-mer e clerks-for the States. The result can only be a continued derogation of the proper dignity of this Commonwealth; and, as I have already said, there must continue to be irritation between the two entities. The irritation arises in this way: At present we have absolutely no Inter-State free-trade. There is no such thing as Inter-State free trade today. It is true that the barriers at the borders only exist now for the purpose of regulating the disposition of imported goods. In other words, after we have collected the duties on imports into this State, we have to follow the goods to their point of consumption, and credit the consuming State with the amount of such duties. I suppose that the adoption of the bookkeeping provisions was necessitated by the diverse conditions of the various States, and a feeling of jealousy regarding their own revenue and financial stability. We have had an experience of Federation extending over five and a half years, and, as the figures show, there has been a constant effort at equality in the financial conditions of the States. We are coming more and more to a per capita basis in regard to spending and earning. To my mind, the question is whether the time has not already arrived when we should put an end to the bookkeeping system, and destroy at once the irritation and trouble consequent upon its operation. Here is one of the troubles which it occasions. I am told that last year 90,000 entries, relating to Inter-State trade had to be put through the Sydney Customs House, and that in each year 300.000 entries are passed through the various Customs Houses in the Commonwealth. When we think that each entry carries with it a liability to prosecution for error we can understand the degree of irritation which is produced throughout the trading community. Not only is there that liability to error in the making up of the entries.,- but there is also involved therein a very acute and detailed analysis of the various dutiable articles which enter into the manufacture of composite garments. For instance, a suit of clothes has to be analyzed for bookkeeping purposes. It is necessary to assess the duties which have been paid on the buttons, the thread, the cloth, and every other dutiable article which has entered into the manufacture of the suit. We can readily see what enormous expense, trouble, and irritation are involved in making the analyses, and the risks which are run in consequence of the liability to which persons are subjected.",31
156,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,How does the honourable member propose to adjust the matter?,32
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I confess that I have not a proposal to submit.,32
158,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The honourable member is aware that the greater proportion of the goods is landed in the big States-Victori a and New South Wales.,32
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . It could only be done, I think, by a rough and ready striking of a balance as between the various States. If all the factors to which the bookkeeping system relates were taken into account, I do not think that it would be very difficult to strike a balance. But even if we could not balance, the matter without resorting to some other method of adjustment, I do not see why offers could not be made to those States which would be the heavier losers by the transaction. After four or five years' experience of the system we could very readily strike an average as to the loss that would probably occur to the large States. I do not think, however, that a narrow view ought ta be taken. Suppose, for instance, that tomorrow we were to sum up the pros, and cons of the effects of the bookkeeping system upon the various States. The first point which strikes bne is that in the year 1904-5 Queensland paid £ 8 4 , 0 0 0 more than her proportionate share of the defence expenditure. Again, take the case of South Australia, which, for very many years, has been struggling with the Northern Territory, at an enormous cost, for its upkeep. We are all interested in the upkeep of the Northern Territory, if only from the stand-point of defence alone. So one might go on enumerating things as to which individual States are handicapped compared with those which are in easier circumstances. The expenditure on defence in Victoria last year was, I believe, very indeed. However, the expenditure on this head has been very much more in other States than it has been in that State. in the matter of defence, the States are equally interested. If we were to make up the sum, it would not be very difficult to strike a balance such as would enable us to be within easy reach of the solution of the bookkeeping system. Again, suppose that the large States would be affected adversely. It must never be forgotten, as the honourable member for Mernda has just pointed out, that, from the manufacturing and producing point of view, the two large States are becoming very rapidly the manufacturing centres of Australia. That is one of the outstanding features of our Federal evolution, so far: Both Queensland and Tasmania have been hit very hard indeed, from the manufacturing point of view. Indeed, one of the things which handicap Tasmania so much today is the fact that her manufacturing interests have been so heavily hit by Victoria since the abolition of the Inter-State borders. Thereforej one does not need to take too narrow a view in order to be just with regard to the abolition of the bookkeeping system. I believe that would contribute so much to the development of good-feeling between the States as would the abolition of that irritating condition of affairs. In this connection I should like to say I am not sure whether we have any moral right to institute penny postage while the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution continue in force. As I have said, we are only in the position of bookkeepers for the States while those provisions operate, and I doubt if we have any moral right to begin to spend the moneys of our principals in a way such as is contemplated by the Postmaster-General. If we were free, and we had no bookkeeping obligations to the States ; if we were each independent in our own sphere, I should hold up both hands for penny postage the more readily as being a great and immediate gain to the bulk of the people within the Federal sphere. But I doubt whether we have anv right to so cut into the revenues of the States while those provisions exist. I propose to say more about that matter directly, and I only make these remarks in passing. At the present time our principals are the States, and there arises a question of political morality in taking their reMr Joseph Cook. venues and disposing of them in the way light which the Postmaster-General contemplates.",32
160,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Does the honourable member mean that New South Wales, Yet, with a surplus of £1,000,000, cannot afford the cost of penny postage?",33
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"N e w South Wales and Victoria can both afford to bear the cost of penny postage, and under our present anomalous condition of affairs it i= just a question, particularly as regards the larger States which have surpluses, whether we should not spend the money available to the Commonwealth rather than allow them to distribute political largesse as they are doing. Every one knows how Mr . Bent, the Premier, is acting the part of My Lord Bountiful in Victoria. We have to consider not only the view point of the States which have surpluses, but the view point of the States which are in financial difficulties. We ought never to forget that we are, in the broadest and highest sense, trustees for the solvency and security of the States, and should give the most earnest and close examination to the weakest links in the financial chain. I shall not make more than one or two criticisms of the general financial proposals of the Government. I agree with the honourable nothing member for Mernda, and the Treasurer, that there is no room for dogmatism, or for an autocratic, know-all attitude in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. On the contrary, there is need for the fullest inquiry, and the most complete scrutiny of any - proposals that may be brought before us. The importance of the subject will not be questioned. Much depends upon striking out upon right lines in the first instance. If we commence upon wrong lines, our troubles may be incalculable and interminable, while, if our financial machinery is properly started, the gain will be an increasing one. Our finances in the future will be better or worse, as the scheme adopted is a .good or a bad one. According!}', the Treasurer very properly invites suggestions, and all who can should try to help him in the elucidation of. the problems which have to be faced. I agree with the honourable member for Mernda that they are neither very clear nor very simple. The ideal to be aimed at is independence on the part of both Commonwealth and States. The States now grumble because they do not receive enough from the Federation; but I am afraid that if we adopted a system necessitating the ear-marking of their finances, they would grumble at having to pay money to the Federation.",33
162,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,They have to pay it to their creditors now.,34
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes ; but the reason for the payment would be removed from their balance-sheets, and that would soon lead to a different view being taken of the matter. At the present time there appear on their balance-sheets Loth the payments and the reasons for them, and if the Commonwealth took over their debts those reasons would disappear from their balance-sheets, and they would grumble as much as they are now doing. curred to me that there is a happy mean between the proposals of the honourable member for Mernda and those of the Treasurer, though I have borrowed the 'sugf estion, which I am about to put forward rom Mr Coghlan, Mr Nash, and some others. It is a proposal to take over so much, of the debts of the States as would strike a balance, leaving practically no payments to be made from the Commonwealth to the States. Last year the States paid in interest on their London debts ,£7,291,000, while the amount returned to them by the Commonwealth was £7,308,000, so that if the Commonwealth had paid the interest due in London it would practically have squared the ledger. Such an arrangement would enable us to at once proceed to the abolition of the Braddon, section, and of the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution.",34
164,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Commonwealth paid to the States £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than they were entitled to under the Braddon provision, so that the arrangement which the honourable member suggests would pinch our finances.",34
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It might do s temporarily; but the difficulty would be very small, considering our nowers for righting ourselves, in comparison with the great advantage which would be obtained by freeing the Commonwealth from obligations to the States. The arrangement is one which, in the nature of things, would expand, and would pave the way for any further adjustment that might be required. It would have the advantage that it would lead to the Commonwealth at once monopolizing the London market. The honourable member for"" Mernda has spoken eloquently of the chaos now existing, and of the foolish and' excessive competition which is damaging Australian credit in London. The Commonwealth could regulate borrowing as the States cannot, and that would increase our security and credit in London. The first thing that we have to do is to establish a Commonwealth credit such as we have not today, judging by the utterances of authorities on the subject. Our first task is to make for the Commonwealth a credit superior to that of the States. We must do that before dealing with the difficulties in which the mechanical part of the scheme will involve us. The monopolization of the London market is the first step towards It has oc- establishing a Commonwealth credit. F o l lowing upon that will come the ability to convert at a decreased interest, and the substitution of the Commonwealth consol, suggested by the honourable member for Mernda. We should offer a stock of greater attractiveness than any now placed upon the London market by the States. The States would then have an inducement to cultivate the Commonwealth instead of fighting shy of us. If we had something of a tangible character to give to them, the public would soon compel the States to come to the Commonwealth, instead of it being necessary for the Commonwealth to run after the States. In other words, we should be able to give the States greater facilities for the transfer of the balance of their loans, and they would be swift to take advantage of the situation. We should at once be able to do away with the necessity for the back payments which are contemplated under the schemes of both the Treasurer and the honourable member for Mernda. The honourable member for Mernda proposes that the States should ear-mark, for the purpose of paying interest to us, revenue amounting to-nearly £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. If any such action were taken, it would be bound 0 to create dissatisfaction and friction between the States and the Commonwealth. My point is that if we can do awav with the necessity for back payments of interest by the States we shall assist to restore that good-will which, unhappily, has disappeared, and shows no sign of making an immediate return. .",34
166,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"U n d e r my plan, the States would pay their own interest until we converted or redeemed their stock.",34
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But when we did convert the stock, the States would have to pay us the interest. Under the Treasurer's proposal the States would be separately liable for all time. We should be their agents until the loans were liquidated. Our object should be to at once establish a better credit for the Commonwealth. It has always occurred to me that it was unfortunate that, when we took over the post offices we did not also assume control of the savings hanks. If we had done this we should have had at our disposal money which would have enabled us to steady the London market at any time. now a total of £37,000,000 to the credit of investors in the - savings banks of. the various States.",34
168,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Not in post-office savings banks.,35
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am perfectly aware of that. We could have taken over the whole of the savings banks, and would have been able to form a financial nucleus for the future operations of the Commonwealth, which would have enabled us to take advantage of a falling market to buy up securities.",35
170,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There is no reason why we should not establish a Commonwealth savings bank now.,35
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It would be an entirely different matter for us to enter into competition with the States now. should have taken over the Post-office ings Banks at the beginning. \ Sir JOHN FORREST - The States might not have been agreeable.,35
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"They could not have helped themselves. The Treasurer seems to forget that the States made over to us the telephone service, and many other things which do not come strictly within Federal domain.",35
173,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We have power to legislate with regard to banking. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We have the power to do a great many things, but I pointing out what wouid have line of least resistance. If we had followed that, we should have found it much easier than to adopt any of the new-fangled posals ,'be introduced? schemes that have been put forward by honourable members. The honourable memcan ber for Brisbane would settle question in quick time by means of a printing press. The honourable member for in view. Bland would begin by forciblv extracting £-8,000,000 from the coffers of the banks.",35
174,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What is the differend ence between the honourable member's posal and that of the honourable member for Bland?,35
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In one case we should deal with public money, and in the other with private money.",35
176,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Private money would have to be dealt with in either case.,35
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Not at all. Of course, the deposits in the savings banks are the property of private persons, but they are in public institutions, whereas the investments in the banks are in private inThere is stitutions. I do not iknow that the depositors in the savings banks would object to handing over their money to the Commonwealth ; but I can conceive of grave objections on the part of bank shareholders to having their money commandeered in the manner proposed. Then, again, it seems to me that if the States were let loose on the London market after a term of ten years, as proposed by the Treasurer, our credit would be absolutely ruined. What would be easier for the States than to save up a lot of floating debts, and at the end of the ten-year period rush the London market with a view to take advantage of the Commonwealth credit. If any such thing were even suggested our credit would be ruined.",35
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable We member does not trust the States at all. SavThe people of the States are also the people of the Commonwealth, and are as trustworthy and as capable of looking after their own interests as we are.",35
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Treasurer has shown that there is a great difference - between the States and the Commonwealth. He says that our credit would be very much the better than that of the States. Therefore, the question is not one as to whether the people of the States, are also the people of the Commonwealth.",35
180,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Commonwealth am credit is the credit of the people of the been the States-the y are the same.,35
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If they are the same, why should all these elaborate proWhy should the Treasurer formulate his scheme unless he do better for the States than they are the whole doing for themselves ?",35
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is the object,35
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I say that if the States go to the London marlcet at the of the ten-year period they will enprotirely break up the credit which in the"" meantime we shall have been steadily fostering.",35
184,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Why do they not do that in Canada?,36
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"There is no analogy between our case and that of Canada,. Our States are a great deal more like sovereign States. States stand in a position resembling that of our city corporations.",36
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The member has not been to Canada or he would not say that.,36
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am not speaking of their general importance, but of their financial relations with the London money market, as compared with that of the Dominion. There is no analogy between our case and that of Canada, as I shall show when I refer to the precious penny postage scheme of the Postmaster-General. However, I do not wish to be diverted from the thread of my present argument. The first essential is that we should create our London credit-and this cannot be done by financing alone-at least, so Mr Coghlan says. He is clear and emphatic that political considerations are affecting our credit in London at the present time. They may be doing it improperly, but they are doing it, and it is with facts rather - than with reasons that we have to deal in our financial relations with the mother country. Mr Coghlan points out that before we can hope to create a better credit in London, we shall have to pay some respect to the government of Australia, and to the legislation which we enact from time to time. I should like to read an extract from his paper in this connection. Speaking upon the subject of the causes which are influencing the price of our stock, he says: No class of persons are less influenced by sentimental considerations than are the investing public and their brokers; nevertheless, there is no class whose political predispositions and prejudices more largely affect their dealings. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that, of the considerations affecting the price of Australian stocks, not the least important, so far as concerns the London market, is the repute of the State to which they belong, and the policy of its Government. If for any cause that repute should be low, then the conjunction of various other conditions usually looked upon as favourable would not avail to maintain the price of its securities. Such being admitted, it is therefore evident that so long as Australia seeks further money from the London market, either foT new undertakings or for renewing old Joans, attention will have to be paid to the opinions of the British investor on certain political matters. I think that that statement is as clear as language can make it. He continuesIt must be confessed that the difference in the attitude of the British investor towards Australia can be accounted for only on the suppositiou of mistrust arising from considerations, not of The Canadian the resources of the States, but of their politics. Nothing can be clearer than that. It means that our Commonwealth legislation honourable is affecting our credit in London.",36
188,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,F r o m what is the honourable member quoting?,36
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Fro m Mr. Coghlan's paper which reached Australia a few weeks ago. I do not think that the honourable member will accuse Mr Coghlan of belonging to the "" stinking fish"" party. If the latter has any sympathy at all, it is with radical. Australian democracy. Yet, with every disposition to make the credit of Australia stand as high as possible in London, that is what he writes concerning the causes influencing the prices of our stock. Mr Coghlan, who spends almost every week c f his life in answering the animadversions of our"" critics in London, declares that our politics are unquestionably influencing the price of our stock, and that before we can hope to improve our credit, we shall have to pay. more heed to our legislation. I now propose to quote another statement of his bearing upon the same matter. Speaking of the transfer of the State obligations to the Commonwealth. He says:If the Commonwealth were to take the place of the various States in the London loan market, it would probably not be able at first to obtain money on better terms than the States could do for themselves. Some of the leading brokers who deal with Australian stocks in this country - me n of wide knowledge of financial conditions - hav e been consulted in this matter, and their views are in agreement with those herein expressed, which have been formed from independent observation; but they also say that in the course of time the Commonwealth will undoubtedly stand in a superior position to that of any of the States, provided that the confidence of the investor in the policy of the Government remains unimpaired. Should there be an immediate transference of the States debts, the Commonwealth must be prepared, for n few years at least, to content itself with results no better from the point of view of price than the States new obtain. That is another declaration that our credit in London at the present time stands at zero-that , in point of fact, we have no credit beyond that which the States themselves enjoy.",36
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member should not quote one portion of Mr Coghlan's paper bearing upon that matter, and omit another portion.",37
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Mr Coghlan says nothing which qualifies the statement that I have quoted.,37
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"He says that"" the Commonwealth credit will be better"" than that of the States by-and-by.",37
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But he also says that we must first create our credit in London. One of the - neans which he suggests for accomplishing that object is the consolidation of the States debts. We need to rehabilitate our credit,37
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We have not yet commenced operations in London. How can the honourable member use the word "" rehabilitate""?",37
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We must rehabilitate our Australian credit-the credit which compels us to borrow today at 4 per cent, where we used to borrow at 3 per cent.",37
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The honourable member must know that money is dear at the present time.,37
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It seems to me that our first step should be to monopolize the London market for Commonwealth purposes. We must do that before we can Hope to create a Commonwealth credit. When we have done that, we shall begin to beget confidence there. After all, the chief difficulty which we have to encounter does not lie in the formulation of financial schemes, but in-securing their acceptance. I admit that the Treasurer has formulated a scheme which will stand a much better chance of acceptance by the States than will that of the honourable member for Mernda. The right honourable gentleman drags political considerations into his proposals, pays a good deal of respect to the feelings of the States as such, and leaves them loopholes by means of which .they may escape from the thraldom of Commonwealth financial control if they choose to do so. Yet it does not follow that in its essence the scheme propounded by the Treasurer is sounder from a financial stand-point than is that of the honourable member for Mernda. I admit supreme difficulty which must be f a c e d by anybody who is charged with the practical sortition of this problem lies in formulating a scheme which will be acceptable to the States. This leads me to say a word or two in regard to the plan which has been outlined by the honourable member for Mernda. I am afraid that it is too good a scheme-that it is too ambitious and too complete, that it involves too much in the way of surrender on the part of the States, and too complete a .control of their present functions by the Commonwealth, for them to accept it within, a measurable period. The scheme rises to boldness, and even to audacity, in some particulars, with its Board of Commissioners, Board of Arbitration, its payments by the States, its rebating by the Commonwealth, its practical determination .of the railway building of the States, and its exaction of guarantees. The scheme seems too much like putting in a receiver upon the States, with regard to some of their financial undertakings.",37
198,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That could be altered.,37
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I admit that these are only details, and I must confessthat the more I look into the principles, underlying the scheme submitted by the honourable member for Mernda, the more fully I concur in their soundness. But it is these details which make all the difference between an acceptable and an unacceptable scheme. I am afraid that my honourable friend's proposal would be satisfactory only if we could eliminate the prejudice and political feeling now existing between the Commonwealth and the variousStates.",37
200,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Educatio n will do much.,37
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The process of education is not so easy, particularly when the Commonwealth and the States are at arm's length. When ""we get closer to the States we may educate them much morereadily than we are likely to ""do while our relations are, as at present, somewhat distant. My honourable friend's scheme seems to be an admirable one from the point of view of a bank or other large financial institution; but I am afraid that, in working: out his details, he has not made sufficient allowance for political motives, which must; always colour and enter into the consideration of these supremely difficult mattersThere is a difference between a purelyprivate concern and our system of government, as conducted under political condithat the tions. I am afraid that the scheme submitted by the honourable member for Mernda is altogether too good to permit of its beingat present acceptable to the States. In some of its details, it rises to heights of* audacity. F o r instance, the honourable member proposes that the States shall give us for nothing all the transferred properties.",37
202,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I forgot to refer to that and one or two other points, but shall do so later on.",38
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I hope that the honourable member will. He not only asks that the States shall give us the transferred properties, but proposes that South Australia shall give us the Northern Territory.",38
204,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If would be a very good thing if she did so. Mi:. JOSEPH COOK - Then there is the suggestion of my honourable friend that we should construct the Transcontinental Railway, and guarantee its finances for twenty years.",38
205,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,F o r fifteen or twenty years.,38
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Does the honourable member think that there is any likelihood of Western Australia, at the end of fifteen or twenty years, taking over the financial obligations in respect of that line? She would regard it as an affront to be asked to do so.",38
207,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member for Mernda, as a level-headed business man, recognises that the line will be a great business success.",38
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I expected such a comment from a representative of Western Australia.,38
209,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We should confer no favour on Western Australia.,38
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am afraid these detail's will require to be more closely scrutinized before they will prove acceptable. The scheme is an able, large, and complete one, but the gravest difficulty will be experienced in inducing the States, at present, to accept it. The next best thing to do is to find some proposal which will fit the existing condition of affairs. The more I look into it, the more it appears to me that the monopolization of the London market, and the management by the Commonwealth alone of the London debt, would be a self-regulative proposal.",38
211,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That could be done only by an amendment of the Constitution. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I know that, and I think that that would be the least difficult obiect to achieve.",38
212,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"He a r , hear.",38
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The advantages which would at once begin to accrue would be so great that the remaining difficulties would very speedily solve themselves. ' The moment that we can give the States a credit that is better than their own, that moment we shall have them seeking to obtain it, and they will be ready to propose terms for taking over of their debts, instead of waiting, as they are doing now, for the Commonwealth to take the lead. The honourable member for Kooyong put a very pertinent question to the Treasurer, when he asked this afternoon when he contemplated making a beginning. The Treasurer had no reply to make.",38
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I said that we would take action as soon as we could.,38
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That was a very safe answer to give; it carries us .no further. In criticising that reply, I am not underrating the difficulties in the way. I know that they are very great, but there are reasons why this matter is urgent.",38
216,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"He a r , hear; we recognise that.",38
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"They were furnished today by the honourable member for Mernda when he referred to the debts that are maturing at a very early date. We have had this problem under consideration for six years. Various Treasurers have discussed it, and in view of the multitude of financial counsel which inheres in this Parliament, and out of it, we should have arrived by this time at a definite starting point. All that we get from the Treasurer is the statement in his Budget that his proposals are not final. He does not say that they are the best. It is time we decided upon some scheme which would furnish a starting point.",38
218,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I was quite definite in my statement, without being absolutely dogmatic.",38
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I hope that I am not doing the right honourable gentleman an injustice. He said that he did not regard his scheme as the final or the best one.,38
220,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I said that I believed in it.,38
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The right honourable member expressed his most emphatic belief in it. He told us, I think, that he had made up his mind, and that when he did so there was a tendency on the part of some people to regard him as an autocrat. If the right honourable gentleman has made up his mind as to the soundness of his financial scheme, that is an additional reason why he should able to tell the House when he proposes to take'action, and what he proposes to do.",38
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I suppose that honourable member will give me a day or two?,39
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"So far as I am concerned, the right honourable member may have until after the general election. I entirely agree that the Board of cludes the £34,000,000. Control which would have to manage the debts could not be appointed too soon. of this kind. After all, these further proposals which have been formulated are simply ampliby fications of the proposals made some ago in skeleton form by the honourable member for Kooyonir. The sooner we the States. have these commissioners the better. they are to be the best financial experts that we can secure in the Commonwealth, surely we might even appoint them before we actually make our preparations in the surer. way of legislation. Why could the Board not undertake a preliminary inquiry with States. a view to framing legislation, or suggesting lines on which legislation shall proceed ? If we are to have the financial ability of experts placed unreservedly our disposal, why not have it in the initiation of the scheme, as well as in its working and operation? I see no reason why the appointment of experts should be undertaken at once, so that their ability might be brought to bear on the consideraas tion of the initiatory proposals which precede the final accomplishment of such scheme as this. In the meantime consoliof dation itself would mean a saving? It said that consolidation is unnecessary; I do not agree with that view. I think the mere consolidation of the debts, and management of them by one authority alone, on the London market. would tend to very great saving indeed London. But the urgency arises from the fact that in the next five vears 4 per cent, leans to the amount of £34,000,000 fall due. That, I submit, is a very serious outlook for the States. As Mr Coghlan points out. if we converted this self £34,000,000 into 3 per cents., there would be an immediate saving in -'Interest £273,000 a year.",39
224,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member for Parramatta is quite right; there be a saving, as he states, of £273,000 a few vears.",39
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What is the rate interest now ?,39
226,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Nearl y 4 per cent., and be Mr Coghlan says that that, capitalized, would pay £4,000,000 off in forty years.",39
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Then , again, in the eleven years £78,000,000 fall due; so that this matter is just about as urgent as it possibly could be.",39
228,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Does the honourable member mean an additional £78,000,000?",39
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The amount inThe question arises as to who is to benefit under proposals If there is to be a saving of, say, a quarter of a million of money a partial conversion scheme, who is to time get the benefit? The Treasurer suggests that the saving should be handed over to The honourable member for If Mernda and Mr Coghlan suggest that it would be much better and safer to make the debt redeem itself rather than to carrv out the scheme contemplated by the TreaIt would be unfair, I think, to hand over any saving of the kind to the",39
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It would help the States very much, and my object was to at give early relief.",39
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Of course it future would, but in a direction in which the States are not entitled to be helped. Anynot thing done with these savings ought to be in the nature of a redemptive scheme; and, contemplated by the honourable member must for Mernda and Mr Coghlan. the debt a ought ta be made to redeem itself by means the profits arising from the conversion. is But I come back to mv initial point that, but precedent to all this, there should be the exclusive right continued to the Commonthe wealth in perpetuity to convert or to renew Once the conin nexion between London and the States is cut, there ought to be no more going; to London by the States except through the Commonwealth. Otherwise, the result would be disastrous _ to the Commonwealth credit. On this point I have alreadv expressed myin pretty strong terms, and I do so again, because I think that to permit the of States of themselves to go to the London market would involve breaking the Commonwealth credit into "" smithereens."" I hope the Treasurer will understand that I would am now merely stating points for in criticism, because of the rest of the scheme I shall probably be found to of approve. It is quite clear that there must be further temporary arrangements while these financial proposals are maturing and operating. As I interjected when the honourable member for Mernda was speaking, if we could settle the debts problem satisfactorily the Braddon section would solve itself-ther e would be no further need for it. But during the transitional period, there is need for further consideration being given to the continuation or otherwise of what is known as the Braddon section. The honourable member for 'Mernda has already pointed out the defect, in this connection, in the Treasurer's scheme; and, after all, it is a very serious defect. The Treasurer proposes the abolition of the Braddon section, and the substitution of a fixed amount on the basis of the yield for the five years preceding 1.910. That is to be the minimum guarantee to the States-it is to be an invariable guarantee-and that is the trouble. If three-fourths of the revenue exceeds the guarantee, the Treasurer proposes to distribute it per capita; and, in my opinion, that would set up a troublesome system of bookkeeping to begin with.",39
232,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It would be very simple.,40
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It would not so simple. We should have to deal with the States in two distinct relationships; should have to distribute one part of the revenue on the basis of a fixed amount, will increase. and distribute another part on a per capita system.",40
234,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,At the end of the year.,40
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That would lead to a great deal of unnecessary trouble bookkeeping, and cause misunderstanding and friction.",40
236,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Not at all.,40
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"And that other is not the smallest trouble, in conthe nexion with the scheme. difficulty is that this has to be an invariable amount-a n amount that does vary with the conditions of the Commonable wealth revenue, as such. There is every dication that the next five years are to very good years-ther e is every reason hope and believe this-bu t there is also every reason to fear that the succeeding five years may be lean years-and it lean years for which the Treasurer makes no provision in his scheme.",40
238,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not believe that those years will be so lean as the honourable member fears. 397,40
239,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Customs revenue increases in lean vears, as has alreadv been shown. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - I am afraid that that is not always the case. My right honourable friend guarantees the States that, however bad the seasons may be, they shall not suffer, so far as the Customs revenue is concerned. However good those years may. be, they are to share in the benefit. "" They shall share,"" my right honourable friend says, "" but they shall not under any consideration suffer."" We have to do the suffering. I point out as the honourable member for Mernda did, that it is not merely a question of paying liberally to the States. This may prove to be in itself the very essence of an illiberal proposal. Even from the States' point of view, supposing we were.' left with £1,000,000 revenue instead of the £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 necessary to meet our requirements, what would happenr",40

Abnormality has characterized all its financial relations. On the hand, we have had to contend' with ebb of the financial tide as well asThe great with its flow. What has happened may readily happen again in Australia; and the not trouble in connection with mv right honorfriend's scheme is that it contemplates incontinued booming prosperity, and makes be no provision for years of stress and' strain. to Five years is not a period long enough for what mv right honourable friend proposes to do. In striking an average, ten years is the would be a fairer period to take.",40
243,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I only say, "" Say five vears.""",40
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If a fixed . amount is to be paid, a ten years' period would be far better in which to ascertain the rise and f all of the revenue, in try which is likely to be affected by changcut ing seasons and by drought, as well as, the other hand, by prosperity. If there to be a fixed payment, the longer the on which the average is calculated the fairer to the States, as well as to the monwealth. The more I look into the ter the more I incline to the belief that we could fix a - per capita distribution the basis of, say, a ten years' average, would simplify all our arrangements in the finitely, and the result would not be anyI thing but what would be substantially fair as between the States and the Commonproceed wealth.",40
245,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We might do that in 1920.,41
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I think we may do it in 1910.,41
247,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I considered that idea, but it was not satisfactory to me.",41
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We are constantly coming nearer to a per capita basis in our spendings and our revenue, in our earnings - and in our general conditions; and I believe that by the <time 1910 arrives we might get an average, extending, say, over ten years, and, on that basis, strike a per capita allowance for the States as a whole. I do not care whether it is made an allowance of 35s. per head, or whatever the amount is. Make it a fixed allowance for a fixed period, subject to revision at the end of that period; and then, I think, we shall have arrived at a much simpler arrangement than that contained in my right honourable friend's proposal.",41
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There is not much room for greater simplicity. My proposal is all contained in one paragraph.,41
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"My right honfor orable friend's is a very simple proposal in that respect, but it is a very far-reachable ing one, and, as I think, very unfair to Commonwealth. I am concerned to sugin gest a means which would be fair both to the Commonwealth and the States. can see no fairer and simpler way what we desire than to take a period of, say, ten years - it would give a better average than five years, in all bability, five prosperous years. If , on the basis of an average of ten years we struck a per capita allowance, we should have arrived at a much simpler and fairer arrangement than that contained in the Treasurer's proposal. The first step, as think, to a better understanding, between a counthe States and the Commonwealth, is to this knot-and it is largely a financial' 011 knot - by which we are tied up in our is present irritating financial bonds and relaperiod tionships. We must stop trenching on each other's domain, particularly in these Commatters of finance, before there will be mata good understanding and general good if feeling. There must be complete finanon cial independence of the States on the it one hand, and of the Commonwealth on other. When that is attained, it will, think, be the signal for a revival in the credit ofi both; and on this basis we may. to the consideration of those other matters which have to do with the building up of the financial credit of Australia, to enable it to stand the stress and strain; of the future, leading us up and on to greater progress and prosperity. I hope that the honourable member for Mernda and the right honourable the Treasurer will not lose their* grip of this financial problem until, between them-wit h any other help that may be forthcoming-the y formulate a scheme which can be propounded definitely for dealing with this most urgent, far-reaching, and vital question. Speaking, of the Budget as a whole, it indicates a period of great prosperity. My right honourable friend said that last year was the best year that we had had since we entered into Federation. Looking at both sides of this Budget-expenditure and revenue-it occurs to me that the revenues of the Commonwealth at the present moment furnish an unanswerable reply to the extreme protectionists of Australia on the one hand and to the Socialists on the other. They are a reply, also, I would say in passing, to the Treasurer's suggestion for increasing taxation, whether ear-marking purposes or any other. I think that they likewise furnish unmistakreasons against the proposal of mv the honourable friend, the member for Bland, the direction of land taxation. The plain outstanding fact of the situation is I that we have all that we need for"" our, of doing purposes at the present time.",41
251,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The figures show that prowe have too much taxation already.,41
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I would not say that we have too much, but I do say that we have plenty. In determining whether we have too much or too little, my honourable friend must always rememI ber the smaller States of the group, the financially weak links of the Federal chain. We must give heed to their, needs when discussing the question whether our revenue is too large or too small. But at any rate, the outstanding feature of the situation is that we have a booming revenue, bocming trade, and a great commercial expansion. From time to time we have heard a great deal about the injured and strangled industries of Victoria. Here, it seems to me, is am answer to all these allegations. The figures of the Budget show that Victoria is advancing by leaps and bounds from every point of view, and from none so much as from the manufacturing point of view. That in itself is an unanswerable reply to all the statements made about her strangled and crippled industries. I admit that on the fiscal platform the note is constantly changing. Of late it has changed very rapidly. The other day the Prime Minister went to Sydney and told the people that all their prosperity was due to the Tariff, that all they wanted was ""more Tariff, and still more prosperity."" But when he returned to this State, and went on the fiscal platform, he brought in quite other considerations. The great outstanding argument for protection nowadays, particularly in Victoria, is derived not so much from the condition of things obtaining within the State as from the condition, of things obtaining outside the State. In this respect the note is changing altogether. It must do so, because of the booming prosperity in manufacture which is seen in Victoria, perhaps more than in any other State, at the present time. So we find honourable members saying now "" We want more protection, for the purpose of peopling Australia, making, ourselves self-dependent in case of war,"" and pointing to the international menaces and perils from outside, both racial and military, as reasons for further interference with the fiscal conditions of the Commonwealth. The Budget shows that manufacturing development is not fettered or hindered; but that on the other hand, in spite of what is called a low Tariff, it is going ahead by leaps and bounds. Some of the figures presented by the Treasurer read more like a story in the Arabian Nights than a confirmation of that terrible tale of woe which we constantly hear from some of the platforms of the country in fiscal controversy Taken from anv stand-point, the figures denote the throb of those gigantic natural forces which are making Australia great, in spite of all the gloomy vaticinations of the Socialists on the one side, and of the pessimistic statements of the protectionists on the other. From the protectionist, in some quarters, we hear nothing but tales of woe and disaster; but as Alacaulay said concerning England at one time, "" We see nothing but prosperity and progress on every hand."" Listening to the recital of these interesting facts by the Treasurer, it would seem as though the blue skies of Australia laughed in derision at those persons who are making such a fuss about nothing today, and for purely political purposes. I can conceive of nothing which, in my judgment, will tend so much to dissipate the pessimism of the moment as will this Budget. In the financial columns of the Sydney Morning Herald, the other day, I read an article on the value of hope and enthusiasm as a commercial factor. There is no gainsaying the fact that the pessimistic, gloomy business man is one who very soon will find himself upon financial rocks. All those honourable members who have had to do with large business operations know the value of hope, springing ""eternal in the human breast,"" when they are beset with temporary difficulties. I can conceive of nothing so calculated to stimulate the hopes, and to dissipate the pessimism of Australians, as will this Budget. ""I hope I may be forgiven for saying that all this booming prosperity must not be attributed to the Government policy.",41
253,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I did not sav that.,42
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am' only speaking apropos of the statement made by the Treasurer's leader in Sydney, that the policy of the Government had led to this prosperity. That was a ridiculous, and, of course, incorrect, statement to make.",42
255,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Government s always talke credit for anything that is good.,42
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We are all, including the Government, unconscious instruments of large natural forces, which, luckily for the country, operate in spite of all Governments. They, of course, cannot be facilitated or hindered by anything that we may do. It occurs to me that the magnificent tale of steadily advancing prosperity is the best argument which we can offer to those who would upset our social order, and set up a new one in its place. Looking at the operation of these gigantic forces, making as they are for the prosperity and solidity of the State, one wonders why people should desire to put themselves in the grip of the steel casing of repressive Socialism, and so strike a blow at their present prosperity. The great lesson of the Budget is a lesson of individuality, of freedom to take advantage of the throb of these great forces, guiding and moulding them for individual ends, always seeking, of course, in its broadest aspect the prosperity of the country as a whole. In a period of prosperity like the present, the usual temptations follow. My honourable friend was absolutely accurate when he said that his experience was that the more a man has the more he spends. That is the experience of nations as well as of individuals, and I am afraid that the Budget furnishes evidence of that.",42
257,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I have left a good balance-£311,228 , I think.",43
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Commonwealth is enjoying an era. of prosperity, and the policy of the Budget is to let fly and make things hum merrily. And in consequence, we have, what I think I shall be pretty safe in describing as nothing more nor less than an electioneering Budget.",43
259,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Not at all .,43
260,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Do that.,43
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Let us take a brief glance at the revenue returns for last year. We are told by the Treasurer that the receipts amounted to £11,879,000, there being an increase of .£199,000 in the amount raised from Customs duties. That increase may seem a large one, but it is really small in proportion to the increase in population. The figures have been alluded to as an indication that the rates of duty are too low, and that, consequently, our importations are too high; but, in reality, the increase is a normal one for a time of prosperity such as we are now passing through, having regard to the increase which has taken place in the population. The returns of the Post and Telegraph Department are a better index to the prosperity of a free country than any other revenue returns, and ours unmistakably point to the existence of booming times. Last year the receipts from duties of Customs and Excise £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, but I venture to say that, when Federation was first accomplished, it was not thought that those figures would be so soon reached.",43
262,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The v were exceeded in T902'-3, the year of the drought.",43
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That was because of abnormal conditions. There has been nothing exceptional to inflate the revenue of iast year. It is instructive to note that the large increases have taken place in New South Wales, where they amount to £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and in Queensland, where they amount to ,£87,000. Those States naturally import more than do the other States, because their exportations are larger, since they rely greatly upon primary production. In Victoria the increase is only_ £""48,000, and in South Australia only £""9,000; while in Tasmania there was a decrease. The inference which cannot be escaped is that a Tariff facilitating exchange with the markets of the world is the best for a young country like Australia. Where there is an abundance of virgin country, and few hands to till it, there must be a great surplus for export, and the more facilities given for the exchange of our surplus products in the markets of the world, the more nearly is an ideal condition of things for our people brought about. To fasten upon a particular State, and argue from its conditions that our Customs duties should be materially and radically not say altered, is to take a one-sided view of a very big and complex question. The figures I have given freely indicate what is the right policy for Australia as a whole, and make it apparent that we should not fetter or hinder the exchange of our natural products in the markets of the world. It is estimated that next year the increase in our revenue will amount to only £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 , or £ per cent - a very small increase. The receipts from Customs duties are likely to be larger by £ 1 1 5 , 0 0 0 than those of the .financial year just concluded; but the introduction of penny postage and other proposed expenditure will bring down the total increase to only about i per cent. In this connection it is worthwhile to consider the effect of Federation upon the revenue of the States. New South Wales has had a roaring, roystering, time ever since Federation was inaugurated, but some of the other States have had to suffer stress and strain. For instance, the Treasury of New South Wales has received from the Commonwealth £""7,500,000 more than it would have reexceeded ceived had there been no Federation. The Victorian Treasury has also received a slight surplus ; but the Queensland Treasury has lost, in the aggregate. £2,600,000.",43
264,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Y e t Queensland is the most solvent State in the Commonwealth.,43
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not think that there is any doubt about the solvency of Queensland; but the Premier of the State complained very much at the recent Conference of the manner in which its finances have suffered because of Federation.,44
266,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We have paid our debts, and are going on all right.",44
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The falling off of revenue has caused a great deal of trouble and inconvenience. The Tasmanian Treasury has also suffered heavily, it being estimated that by the end of the next financial year its losses will have amounted to £1,000,000. These figures have an important bearing upon the proposal to establish penny postage. In considering proposals for increased expenditure we must bear in mind the position of the States which are weak financially.",44
268,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Is the honourable memmer in despair about Queensland?,44
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am not in despair about any State. There is no need for despair. But there is reason for the exercise of caution and prudence. finances of Tasmania have been entirely dislocated by the Federal Tariff. I have been told that her direct taxation amounts today to 24s. 3d. per head. South Wales imposed direct taxation at the same rate, she would be raising £1,800,000 from direct taxation, while Victoria under the same conditions would be raising more than £1,500,000. A State which has to resort to direct taxation at that rate is in a very serious financial position.",44
270,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Whic h is largely due to unproductive loan expenditure.,44
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does it help us to be told that?,44
272,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It shows the unwisdom of borrowing.,44
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"And the unwisdom of proposing a land tax of 4d. and 6d., as the honourable member has done. M!r. WATSON - M a n y of the Tasmanians themselves say that the best thing that could happen to the State would be the imposition of a land tax.",44
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No doubt the honourable member thinks so; but I differ from him. In my opinion, seeing that the direct taxation of the State provides 60 per cent, of its total local revenue, the time is not opportune to propose to increase it. The proposal of the honourable member and his party justification nor principle to recommend it. It has-no justification so far as financial considerations are concerned, and no principle from an economic point of view. I make these remarks merely in passing. The financial position of Tasmania requires all the sympathy that we can give. The people of that State are shouldering in a manly and heroic fashion the burdens which have been imposed on them by Federation. Turning to the expenditure side of the balance-sheet, I should like, in the first place, to refer to what I consider the misleading statements of the Treasurer and the Postmaster General.",44
275,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Not intentionally misleading.,44
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Of course not. The Treasurer, for instance, mentioned the fact that last year we gave the States £ 8 2 9 , 9 2 5 over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution.",44
277,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is right. The Mr. JOSEPH COOK - But the Treasurer put it in this wayWe returned to the States £829,925 more than was constitutionally obligatory. If New That is a very misleading way of putting it. We are constitutionally obliged to return to the States every penny that we can. The obligation rests upon us to return every penny above the three-fourths limit, as well as every penny under it.",44
278,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Constitution merely provides that the Commonwealth shall not spend more than one-fourth of the total Customs and Excise revenue.,44
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,E x a c t l y j and we are obliged to return to the States all we can over and above the three-fourths to which they are entitled.,44
280,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Not if we spend it ourselves.,44
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am objecting to the way in which the Treasurer has put the matter. The Postmaster-General falls into the same mistake. The Treasurer is assuming an attitude of great generosity towards the States, because the Commonwealth is not spending the full amount of one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. That, however, is not what is intended by the Constitution, which requires that we shall give back to the States all the revehas neither nue that we cam possibly spare, but that, in any case, we shall not spend more than one-fourth of the total amount. Therefore, the constitutional obligation extends below the limit as much as above it.",44
282,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That means nocount thing.,45
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We shall see A great whether it means nothing when we consider the manner in which the Treasurer has tributed this amount. He goes on to sayIn other words, if we had spent that sum of ^829,925 which we had a right to do under Constitution, the States would have received that much less from the Commonwealth. I say that we had no right to spend it all for the mere purpose of spending it.",45
284,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I did not mean we had done that? that.,45
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am not so sure that the Treasurer did not mean it. He went on to sayI only mention this to show that the facts do not bear out those charges of recklessness carelessness which are often levelled Parliament by ill-informed people who criticise us. If this House wanted to get kudos for itself by spending as much as it could throughout the different States, thereby gaining to some tent the approbation of the people, we could have spent very much more than we did. But, instead of so doing, we have handed over to the States an immense sum during allowing the States Governments to spend the money, and thereby to gain any kudos that might be attached to the eKpenditure.",45
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We could not help ourselves.,45
287,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I beg the honourable member's pardon; we could easily have spent the money ourselves. We could easily have wasted it ourselves.,45
288,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We have been very economical.,45
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Does the Treaproposing surer suggest that we could have reasonably spent the high sum that we have handed to the States ? We have no right to spend any money except economically, and, therecent. fore, it is totally misleading for the surer to assume an attitude of extreme generosity to the States because, after spending all that ought reasonably to be spent, he gives back to them more than within our constitutional rights."" three-fourths of the Customs and .Excise revenue to which they are entitled.",45
290,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I was fending the Commonwealth against the charges of extravagance that had been preare doing so. ferred.,45
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not know that it will help us to overstate our case.,45
292,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I hope I did not overstate the case: . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I should like to remind the Treasurer that when he speaks of this £ 8 2 9 , 9 2 5 as having been returned to the States, he does not take into acthe fact that we are occupying certain buildings for which we pay no rent. proportion of this £ 8 2 9 , 9 2 5 should be passed over to the States as rent for disbuildings which they have handed over to us, and which we are now occupying.",45
293,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the money returned the to the States in excess of three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue had been devoted to paying for the transferred proat perties, it would have been good business.",45
294,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes , suppose that",45
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We should have had no right to do such a thing.,45
296,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,He w shall we pay for the transferred properties except out and of our one-fourth of the Customs and against this Excise revenue?,45
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The right honourable gentleman's leader proposes to pay exfor the transferred properties by' wiping cut the debt incurred in respect to them.,45
298,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"When you pay a debt the past 6£ years, you wipe it out.",45
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes , but the - Prime Minister does not propose that any money shall pass. He expects the transferred properties to buy themselves out. That is no doubt a very easy solution of the difficulty, but I am afraid that it will not prove satisfactory. The Treasurer thinks that in view of the generous attitude that the Commonwealth has taken up in regard to the States, he is justified into spend £ 5 2 5 , 0 0 0 more than last year. This is an increase of 12 per cent, oyer the previous year, whilst our revenue shews an increase of only £ per I say that in view of this proposal, Treaa charge of audacity and recklessness might be fairly levelled against the Treasurer. All the defence he puts forward foe this huge outlay is that ""We are well I say that we have no constitutional rights to spend money unless we lay it out economimerely decally, wisely, and well.",45
300,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We claim that we,45
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is the whole question. To begin with, I doubt the morality of our spending money in the way proposed by the Treasurer, whilst we are acting: as the agents of the States. It must be remembered that, in a financial sense, the States, as I have already said, are our principals whilst the bookkeeping period lasts.",45

I doubt whether the Treasurer is observing it in proposing before the bookkeeping period is brought to an end to make use of the money in States the better. the manner contemplated. smaller States are more concerned the larger ones. New South Wales and Victoria can afford to put up with the consequences, but I doubt whether the smaller States will be in the same happy position. The Treasurer proposes to turn to the States during the current, year only £311,000, and I say that in so doing he is deliberately overstepping the limit fixed by the Constitution. course, to our liability in connection the transferred properties. At the very lowest estimate, an amount in excess of the ,£311,000 would be required by the Commonwealth to meet a fair interest charge in regard to the transferred properconstantly ties.",46

My honourable friend rightly says that new obligations are fast approachit ing, that new taxation will probably be rendered necessary, and that, therefore, the sooner we straighten out the financial relations between the Commonwealth and' the However, the Sir JOHN FORREST - Where does he say than are anything about new taxation ?",46
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In connection with his proposal to ear-mark the fund for the redemption of our indebtedness. Now I come to another little figment which is recontained in every Treasurer's Budgetthe figment relating to the cost of Federation. The Treasurer tells us in a eock-awhoop style that Federation today is costI refer, c f ing only one shilling, and sixpence a head. with We have not nearly reached the cost of keeping the dog yet, and I am afraid that we never shall if we continue to adopt the clever method of covering up the legitimate expenses of the Commonwealth which is resorted to by succeeding Treasurers. In saying this, I am not accusing be the present Treasurer of having done anything which has not been done by precedTreasurers. We have the same sort of table presented in each Budget, and every tells us that Federation is costing so much per head. Of course, they take to deduct from the expenditure upon the which that amount is based, the cost which the has been incurred in consequence of Federation. For instance, they say that the cost the sugar bounties must be excluded we from the calculation. I apprehend that we We should never have had to pay those bounties if we had not entered into Federation. Similarly, we should never have been burdened with the cost of administering New f Guinea if the States had not federated.",46
309,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Some of the States had we to bear that cost before Federation.,46
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We should never in have had to provide for the repatriation of Kanakas, which, next year, will absorb £25,000, nor should - we have been faced with the huge expenditure for new works which will come out of our revenue next year. These items of expenditure ""have to be eliminated from the amount that is regarded as "" new "" expenditure before it can bo reduced to the dimensions set down by the Treasurer. I hold that that is a misleading way of putting the matter, and the sooner this little bit of cant is obliterated from the Treasurer's Budget the better will it be for all concerned. The cost of Federation is that whi'ch has been incurred because of Federation, and which would not have been incurred but for Federation. That is the only test which ought to be applied to the question of what constitutes Federal expenditure. When we come to discuss what Federation has cost, we ought to consider the question from the stand-point of the taxpayers. Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have told us that the taxpayers of the States and the Commonwealth are the same persons. Applying that argument to the cost of Federation, what is the position ? The cost of Federation seems to me to be the difference between the total cost of governing Australia before we entered into the Federal bond and its cost to-dav.",46

312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I will deal with that point presently. To-day, the cost of governing Australia-Stat e and Federalis 20 per cent, more than it was when we entered into the Union.

319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"There are more services in that some of the services have been duplicated, but the honourable member should recollect that the same persons have to pay for that duplication.",47
320,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There may be additional services of different classes.,47
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But the same taxpayer has to provide the funds. There has been an increase in our population during the period in question of 8| per cent.,47
322,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Post Office today spends a little more than it did a few years ago, but it also receives much more on account of the services rendered.",47
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am dealing with the total cost of government. I am not altering the basis of the computation in any way, and I am not bringing in anyextraneous matter. I simply say that the cost of governing the whole of the States when we entered into Federation was £28,000,000, whereas it is today nearly £34,000,000. In other words, there has been an increase in our expenditure of 20 per .cent., and an increase in our population of only 8J per cent. If we could point to an increase of population corresponding with the increase in our expenditure, the position would not be so bad, although, as a matter of fact, any increase of population ought to mean a decrease in the cost of government.",47
324,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Is not the increased cost of government due to extravagance on the part of the States? Mr JOSE PH COOK - That does not matter. I am merely pointing out that the same taxpayers have to pay the increased cost. It does not matter whether the States are extravagant or not. The total cost of Federation is the cost by which the government of Australia as a whole has increased, between the period when Federation was accomplished and the present time. The figures show an alarming rate of increase in our expenditure-a n increase of 20 per cent-as against an increase of 8| per cent, in our population. That increase, I think, is due to the financial relations which exist between: the Com- \ a monwealth and the States. The latter are receiving the moneys which we raise. They have no obligation to raise them for themselves. Theirs is the privilege of spending them. No doubt a great deal of their exbe. penditure is upon a very lavish scale, so that the statement of the honourable member for Gwydir is quite right, so far as some of the States are concerned. is. no doubt that the States Governments spend money freely and make themselves popular by so doing.

I am pointing out to the people of Australia, who have to foot the bill, that Federation, at any rate, has resulted in no economies, either in the State or Federal arena.",48
329,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I said nothing about the Government; all that I asked was what proportion of the increased cost was due to Federation ?,48

335,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The inference that the cost of governing Australia would not have increased had there been no Federation is purely hypothetical.,48

342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am speaking of revenue, not of loan expenditure. The borrowings of Australia have no doubt increased in due proportion. But the main outstanding feature of our Federal relations to-dav is that we are duplicating functions, and not substituting Federal for State functions. That appears to be the trouble. I am not blaming the Federal system for this state of affairs; but it is time that the taxpayers took the matter in hand, and said that, if certain things are to be done by the Federation, there ought to be a corresponding saving im the cost of the government of the States. In some wav or other they ought to relieve themselves of the burden of double government which is pressing upon them so severely, as these figures appear to show. There is another matter to which I The Prime Minister has told us of the careful way in which we are husbanding the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue that we are entitled to spend. I think it was  who, during the late Conference of Piemiers, said that a careful analvsis of the Constitution showed that we had taken over from the States 12^ per cent, in value of the functions which they previously performed for themselves. If that is so, and if , in order to finance that 12^ per cent., we have a revenue amounting to 25 per cent, of the revenues of the whole, it seems to me we are not so badly off in the Federal arena. I admit that this is only a rule-of-thumb method to apply to such a very important matter; but that was the view propounded by Mr leake at the Premiers' Conference in Sydney.",48

356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I d not know, 0 but I should certainly say, seeing that this is a proposal by the Treasurer, that the trawler will be used in the waters of the Western Australian coast. In thefitnessof things, the trawler ought to be used in tothose waters; and, if more be caught than so much the better. The more one finance looks at the Budget the more one finds that it is an electioneering Budget. There would not be so much to take exception It to. if it were not for the fact that the whole Budget shows, in my judgment, an unincrease on last year's expendiand ture, while showing, at the same time, a very small increase on the revenue side of the ledger. That brings me to the quesis tion ofi penny postage. The Postmastersome General has issued a memorandum of very Budsome observations, in order to show how to deftly the whole matter has been wrought to and how the honourable gentleman has skipped over certain factors which would have made his calculation look very different in regard to the question whether penny postage is the great success he they claims for it in other parts of the world. Of course, one can appreciate the Postmaster-General's first reason, that the adoption of penny postage would be an of Australian Union. But when it comes to paying taxes, we are not so much concerned for the outward and visible signs as we are for are inward and Spiritual grace; and I am for post afraid there is not much financial grace, have so far as the small States are concerned, we in a proposal of this kind. We are tcld is that our postal conditions in this connection are a standing illustration of the incompleteness of Federation. But we should, I think, be very happy if that were the only indication of an incomplete at the present time. The Postmaster-General, in his memorandum, goes on to deal with some of the objections which are urged against the principle of penny postage as he has heard those objections from time to time in Australia. The first objection is the loss of revenue involved, and the second is the fact that the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department has each year exceeded its revenue, and that, therefore, to incur anyserious loss would be inadvisable. The Postmaster-General deals with the first objection in a very easy way, by declaring that the experience of countries which have adopted the penny .rate, shows that the idea that there is a loss of revenue involved is fallacious, seeing that an increase in the amount of correspondence immediately commences, and, in a short time, restores the equilibrium. But has that been the case in Victoria? Later on, the figures of the Postmaster-General show that that result has not followed in the State I have mentioned.",49
357,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The revenue in Victoria is now higher than it was when penny postage was established.,50
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I should like to ask the Postmasters-General what the expenditure is in Victoria today as compared with the period to which he refers?,50
359,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Le t orable member take the case of Newj Zealand, in regard to which we have exact figures. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I should like, in passing, to ask the Postmaster-General whether the view expressed in his memorandum is departmental, or whether it is his own personal view? If the honourable gentleman were able to assure us that the Department believes the loss of revenue to be a matter of no concern, I should attach the greatest possible weight to that view; but I am not prepared to accept his individual opinion.",50
360,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"What does the honourable member mean by "" departmental view "" ?",50
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I mean the view of the officers of the Department. Is the comment in the memorandum that of the officers of the Department, or that of the Posmaster-General himself?",50

363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"And very often with abundant justification, particularly in matters of Estimates.",50
364,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We expect an old Postmaster-General to support penny postage.,50
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not say that I am not going to support penny postage. I am concerned with putting the matter straightforwardly and clearly before the people of this country, and I do not think that that has been done in this memorandum. Reference is made in it to foreign countries which have adopted a penny postage rate. We are told that penny postage prevails in the United King dom. But the Postmaster-General does riot tell us that when it was adopted there the United Kingdom had a population of 17,000,000. Nor does he tell us that in the United Kingdom the cost of distributing the mails is a mere, fleabite compared with the cost in a continent like Australia In the ^United Kingdom the utmost distance to be covered is only 400 miles. Here we have 3,000 miles over which to distribute our mails. Our expense - per capita is, therefore, much in excess of the expense in the United Kingdom. I point to those facts as worthy of consideration-that in the United Kingdom there was a population of 17,000,000 when the penny postage rate was adopted, and that there the mails have to be distributed over a country whose greatthe hon- est distance is 400 miles, whilst here we have 3,000 miles to cover. In the case of France, which is the latest country that has adopted penny postage, we have a country with a populationi of 40,000,000. France does not furnish a parallel with this country either in respect of population or financial resources.",50
366,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We shall have to turn up some of the honourable member's old speeches on this subject!,50
367,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That cheap, empty claptrap will not deter me from what I am going to say, nor will the honourable member's ugly looks. I am appalled when I IOOK at him.",50

His memorandum goes on to sayOur experience of cheap uniform telegraph are rates has been altogether satisfactory. I should like to see proof of that.

Canada today, with her penny postage, and her largely increasing population, it a fact stated by the Postmaster-General ten words. himself that the total annual revenue of the Canadian Post Office is only £ whereas our revenue £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . These figures Post Office in Canada and our own have nothing in common.

Here I should like to remark that I think that mv honourable friend would do well is 5 or 10 cents. if he would see about issuing a Year Book. The Post Office has been six years under Federal control, and vet no prise ! report has been presented to Parliament.

I do not see why we cannot have a report presented to Parliament, just as He reports used to be presented to the States Parliaments. At present we are in the dark in addressing ourselves to this subject. We have no statistics with which to make comparisons. We have no information to act upon. Turning back to Canada, the information which I have been able to obtain shows the following to be the case with regard to Canadian telegraphs.

I know - that that is a little that honourable members opposite pointare constantly regaling the populace with when they are discussing their own form of Socialism, which, however, is a different matter. We say that things that are inherently and necessarily monopolies should be under the control of the State. Only in that wav can they be conducted with satisfaction to the people as a whole.",51
389,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is what we want. We will take that.,52
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member will take that, but our quarrel with him and his friends is that they will not stop at that. If they did there would be. no trouble. But the fact that Canada only gets £ 1 , 0 5 3 , 0 0 0 per annum from the Post Office, as against £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 which we derive from our own Department, with a very much smaller populationsmaller by 50 per cent - shows- I was going to say the absurdity, but I will not say that-the unwisdom of endeavouring to make a parallel between our own Post Office and the Canadian. Sir JOHN' FORREST - The Post pays very well in Canada.",52
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not know that it pays very well. I know that a surplus of £100,000 is shown. But if the Canadian Postmaster-General adopts the same method that our own Australian Postmaster-General does, I should think his surplus would, on analysis, soon be wiped out. Mv honourable friend boasts-this one of his main arguments for pennv postage-that the Post and TeleThe graph Department is this ye'ar showing a surplus. What I have to say in reply to that is this: that if interest were paid on our Post Office the Department would not show a surplus, but a very large deficit. The accumulated deficit on the Post Office, our own. on the basis of its paying its own fair charge for interest since it came over to during the last six years. Federation, represents a ,£1,750,000 sterling. That is the deficit per annum. on the Post Office in Australia since came under Federal control, to increase during the same term. which the honourable gentleman asks this Parliament to foot an additional bill.

Tf we make a deficit in connection with increased State Socialism we wine it off at the of the year, and nothing more is heard about it. But here is the loss on the opethe rations of the Department as given to by the Statistician for New South Wales. He figures out that if the Department were charged with the interest on the buildings it would be in debt at the present moment to the tune of £ 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 .",52
392,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What is a million to the Postmaster-General ?,52
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is nothing to the Postmaster-General since he got so near to the multi-millionaires of America and the other places which he visited. This is the Department which he declares is paying, and the success of which he furnishes as a reason why we should proceed to the dispensation of these favours. New Zealand presents no parallel in connection with the cost of distributing mails. It is a narrow strip of country, not much more than 200 miles across at the widest point. The authorities have not to send the mails from the highways more than 100 miles in any direction, except in, perhaps, a few instances, and, therefore, the cost of disOffice tributing mail matter is at a minimum, and furnishes no parallel to the case of Australia, where the cost of distribution is so great. That fact is made apparent by the figures which the Postmaster-General quotes in his memorandum. He points out, as an argument, in favour of his proposal, thatThe additional cost of handling this extra is volume of matter in New Zealand did not adopting amount to 5 per cent. honourable gentleman shows that the cost of Idi's^ibutingl and handling mail matter there is at a minimum, and that therefore it is not a parallel for Australia.

The' same thing may apply to Canada, and I should say that it would.",52
394,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,During that term we have had the introduction of the picture postcard mania.,53
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is so. In Canada there has been a large increase, but that, is a country which is going ahead by leaps and bounds, both in population and in every method of development.",53
396,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We are just as prosperous.,53
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I believe so; but is not that a reason why the fact should be shown in this memorandum? If our postal revenue is going ahead by leaps and bounds it would have been a good thing, I think, to have let us know all about it. Instead of that, however, we have not a figure which would enable us to make any comparison. Then the Postmaster-General goes on to say that, according to his officials, the estimated loss from the penny postage would be ,£265,000 a year.",53
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"-They do not make any allowance for increase of business. That estimate. I understand, merely refers to present business.",53
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Of course, I must not suppose that the officials know very much about the matter. As a rule those who devote their lives to the business do not. That is the view often taken.",53
400,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,They are naturally conservative.,53
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is always the outsider who has been at the business for five minutes who knows all about it. At any rate, the officials of the Department say that the cost would be about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year, and the Prime Minister suggests that the loss would be a very small amount, and would continue for only a few years. We have to make up our minds as to whose figures we had better take.",53
402,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Why refer as a loss when it would be simply a saving of that amount to the people?,53
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That , I admit, is another way of putting the matter. But, of course, the same thing might be said of the States in all their financial relationships.",53
404,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It might be said that persons out back save money because postal facilities are not given to them.,53
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is a compulsory saviner. Altogether, I think that the memorandum of the Postmaster-General is not of much use so far as this question is concerned. It does not help us to make any comparison. It does not show from any solid basis of the past, so far as Australia is concerned, what are the probabilities of the future.",53
406,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Does the honourable member think that it should be headed "" Special pleader "" ?",53
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I * take the estimate for what it is worth. But I think that a sum between the official estimate of £ 2 6 5 , 0 0 0 and the amount stated by the Treasurer will be found to be very much nearer the mark.",53
408,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That estimate does not take into account any increased business.,53
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I am aware that it is an estimate of the immediate loss.,53
410,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,My estimate was not so generous as that of the Postmaster General.,53
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The probable loss will be a sum ranging between the amount estimated by the officials as the immediate loss and the amount estimated by the Treasurer.,53
412,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I wish that the honourable member would say "" the saving to the people,"" because it would sound much nicer.",53
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"L i k e the Treasurer, my honourable friend is great upon the people when he has any political favours to dispense. But here he makes a sharp distinction between the Commonwealth and the States, although they comprise the same people. For instance, one of his reasons why we should face this loss, if loss there must be, is contained in this statement, which is also found in the BudgetThe Commonwealth returned to the States for last year ,£827,879 more than it was required to to it do under the Constitution. Here is one set of people returning to another set of people-it is the same people, I fancy, in each case -,£827,879 . And 1 the same people are very generous in their Commonwealth relations to the same people in their State relations.",53
414,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We are refusing to take that sum out of the people's pockets. MT . JOSEPH COOK - I do not see that it makes much difference which way the 'honourable member turns the figures if he is not going to draw a broad distinction between Federal and State finance. My only object in criticising his memorandum is to show that as a basis for any forecast it is worthless, because it furnishes no means for making a comparison, and that if we are to have the penny post inaugurated, we must make up our minds to face a very substantial loss. This is not: a matter which would affect the large States appreciably, but it would affect very materially the small States, whose Governments are straining every nerve to make both ends meet. In Tasmania, for instance, the people are bearing direct taxation to the tune of 24s. 3d. per head, and still the Government cannot make ends meet. Here is a proposal to take from them immediately £ 1 5 , 0 0 0. From the view-point of the smaller States, the position is a very grave one indeed. The larger States could afford to meet the burden, because in view of their surpluses the introduction of the penny post would not make any material difference. If things were equal I should applaud the proposal as being as good a way of spending the surplus revenues as any I know of within the Federal purview. I make these criticisms now because I feel that, while the bookkeeping system continues, we are but trustees and clerks for the States, so far as their finances are concerned, and should be careful how we dispose of large sums of money belonging to them, and not to the Commonwealth.",53
415,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The people the States and the people of the Commonwealth wealth are one and the same.,54
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes ; but we case, must honour the bookkeeping system so long as it remains in force.",54
417,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Commonwealth is entitled to spend one-fourth the net revenue from duties of Customs and,54
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Undoubtedly; but there are put forward ini the right honourable gentleman's Budget proposals for the ear-marking of special taxation, which show that he expects that the time will soon arrive when he will spend more than one-fourth. In my judgment, the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States will never be satisfactory until the different entities are financially independent, and the sooner we approve of a scheme which will place the relationship on a proper and independent footing the better. By doing so, we shall create a better feeling and more harmonious relations, paving 0 the way for each, within its own sphere, to move onwards to a prosperous future.",54
419,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Bland) [8.13] - Although the honourable member for Parramatta differs from the Treasurer on some points, he views a satisfactory 'Budget from practically the same aspect, the general effect upon both gentlemen being almost identical. The Treasurer sees in the record of a good financial year the opportunity to throw money about, careless of what the consequences may be, while the acting leader of the Opposition takes it as an indication that all is well with the country, and nothing more requires to be done. According to him, ail excuse for social legislation disappears with the presentation of a Budget disclosing a handsome surplus.",54
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I agree with the honourable member, if he substitutes "" Socialism "" for social legislation.",54
421,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Surely the honourable member must be aware that the condition of the public revenue is not an unfailing index of the condition of the people. He ought to know that, only lately, in England, a period of the greatest prosperity, judged by statistics of imports and exports and of manufacturing, activity, was coincident with the greatest destitution and want of employment. Mere statements of revenue and expenditure showing a surplus do not go to the root of matters. The fact that we in Australia are able to raise of enough money to pay our debts, and that is being produced here in much larger measure than was previously the is no complete criterion of the conditions of the people. Although there is a greater measure of prosperity amongst our people to-dav than they were enjoying a of little time ago, much remains to be done before the condition of the masses will be reasonably satisfactory.",54
422,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There is much to be done in the equalization of the distribution of wealth.,54
423,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Undoubtedly. The production of wealth is one thing, and its distribution another. I share the sentiments of the poet who wrote111 fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay. We can congratulate ourselves upon the good seasons which have enabled our financial institutions to recover their stability, and upon the fact that money is plentiful, and that while work is not as, plentiful as it might be, there is more employment offering than was obtainable a little time ago; but there still remains the fact that Australia is not progressing as its resources should make it progress.",54
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member seems to have joined the "" stinking fish "" party.",55
425,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"So far as I have read, no country offers opportunities for the making of homes equal to those offered in Australia today; but, if we adopt the attitude of the honourable member, and say that nothing more remains to be done, because the Treasurer has shown a surplus, the posi tion of our people will not be likely to improve.",55
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I did not say thing of the kind.,55
427,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member said that the Budget shows that there is no need for protection, nor for repressive legislation.",55
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I did not say that. I said that it was an answer to those who demand extreme protection and Socialism.,55
429,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member said that it showed that there was no need for higher protective duties, on the one hand, nor for repressive legislation which might interfere with the development of enterprise, on the other hand.",55
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I did not say that.,55
431,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is a new role for the honourable member to express himself as anxious as to the possibility of legislation proving repressive. It seems to me as yesterday when he was one of the chief advocates of legislation to repress the rapacity of individual employers in regard to the great bodv of the public. In my view there is need for a great deal of legislation. The honourable member said that the Budget shows that there is no need for the proposals put forward by myself on behalf ot the Labour Party for a progressive land, tax. which he condemned as lacking principle and various other valuable elements. In support of his position he advances only the fact that we have temporarily an overflowing Treasury.' I ask him: Is Australia progressing as it should? Is settlement increasing as it should ? b""rne found for would be settlers who are nlreadv in the country, and will land be available for those to whom we hope to offer inducements to come here?",55
432,Mr TOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It never will be, when men like W. N . Willis can get hold of it all.",55
433,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"W h i l e , in the main, the land transactions to which the New South Wales scandals relate, should not have passed into the hands of those who got it, it is not such as I would select as the choicest for settlement. They were central division lands, mainly in the western part of that division, and were not suitable for farming, although adapted for small pastoral holdings.",55
434,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The honourable member does not offer that fact as an excuse for the mal-admlnistration of the Lands Department ?,55
435,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Not at all. But I say that it is idle to suggest that the land which anywas improperly obtained would have been available tor agricultural settlement if it had not been locked up. With regard to the Budget, it certainly appals me to contemplate the light-hearted manner in which the Treasurer proposes to throw money about. Apparently, he is so imbued with the spirit of the boom prosperity of the State with which he was so long associated that he cannot divest his mind of the idea that our revenue is going to bound along just as it did in Western Australia in the early days of the gold-fields,. He does not realise that there is a possibility of a falling off in the revenue. To my idea, however, there is very great danger to be apprehended in that direction. So far as the mere programme of the Government is concerned, I think that we are within measurable distance of the end of our financial tether. If honourable members will look at the expenditure of the last few years, they will see that a steadily-increasing amount has been laid out by the Federal authorities. I am bound to admit that some of the expenditure has been inevitable from the stand-point of policy. We entered upon the payment of the sugar bounties with our eyes wide open, and in other directions there were increases that were impossible to avoid.' Some of these were due to a better recognition of the rights of public servants to fair treatment at the hands of their employers, the people, and some were attributable to other causes. Is land Now we have placed before us a number of proposals for very large increases, which, if agreed to, will raise the total expenditure for the current year up to about £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the outlay for last year. Setting on one side increases which are inevitable, such as the £130.000 in respect of the sugar bounties and £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 proposed to be spent upon the general elections, there are a number of proposals which seem to me to demand close attention. Take, for instance, the additional £ 7 7 , 0 0 0 which it is proposed to expend upon the Military Forces. Some four years ago the leaders of different parties in the House came to an understanding-and in the absence of any disclaimer from individuals, we may assume that honourable members were unanimous-that the Military Estimates should be limited to £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 . That amount was to be exclusive of any votes for special armaments or war materiel of a specific character. Since then we have added ,£96,000 to our Defence Estimates on the account of the Naval Subsidy, and as that increase was approved of by a distinct vote of the House, no exception can be taken to it, so far as the administration is concerned. Since then, however, there have been steady and repeated attempts to increase the vote until we find that the present Estimates exceed the amount previously agreed upon by £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 .",55
436,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Military Estimates amount to only £ 6 7 6 , 0 0 0 , because £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is payable under the Naval Agreement.",56
437,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"A f t e r allowing for an increase of £ 9 6 , 0 0 0 under the naval subsidy, there remains a net addition to the outlay upon the Military Forces of ,£80,000 over and above the sum previously agreed upon. I think that we should be prepared, at the earliest possible moment, to make Something like adequate provision for coastal defence. It is utterly nonsensical for us to spend such a large amount upon our Military Forces, whilst we are making practically no provision for coastal defence. I do not wish to discuss the policy of the Naval Agreement. It is there, and we have to adjust our arrangements in view of the continuance of the agreement for the full period. We must, however, provide for local coastal defence, which the Imperial Squadron on the Australian Station does not pretend to give. The Imperial authorities look upon the squadron as being intended for general defence purposes, and as available for service in the China seas at any moment if occasion should require. Therefore, it seems to me to he in the highest decree suicidal for us to spend no time or money in making provision for the defence of our harbors and coast line. If there is to be anv increased expenditure, it should be UDon the Naval side of our defence. If the Government had proposed t ° spend £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in building suitable craft for the protection of our harbors, I should have been very glad to give them all the assistance possible. While, however, remaining silent upon that important aspect of our defences, they propose to increase the estimates for the Military Forces, which, after all, are only our second line of defence, by £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 .",56
438,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There are 50.000 rifles to be provided for.,56
439,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am not speaking of the expenditure upon rifles or war materiel, but of the annual expenditure upon the training and maintenance of the Military Forces. I make no complaint with regard to the money proposed to be spent in the purchase of rifles or field .guns or ammunition, but I submit that it is altogether unjustifiable to so largely increase the Military Estimates, and leave the Naval side of our defence unprovidedi for. Apart from the question of spending ,£100,000 or £1:50,000 per annum upon the development of our Naval defences, there is need for the establishment of an ammunition factory, a small-arms factory, and the nucleus of an arsenal. All these are items of extra expenditure for which monev will have to be found at no distant date. ,1 find that it is proposed to spend an additional £167,00 0 upon works and buildings. I do not know how far this expenditure may be justified. In some cases. I know that not nearly sufficient care has been exercised by Ministers with regard to expenditure. T know of one case in which, whilst I was in office, I refused to sanction a very large expenditure upon the erection of a new post office, upon the ground that the report of the inspector showed that the existing building was adequate to meet all requirements. Yet the work in question has since been put in hand.",56
440,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Where ?,56
441,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not wish to particularize, but I can give the Treasurer the information later on.",56
442,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Probably the necessity for its erection has become more pressing since.,56
443,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"/Upon the inspector's report, it was estimated that with a very small expenditure, the old huilding could be made to serve its purpose for another ten years. There is need for us to carefully scrutinize the items of proposed expenditure under that head. draw attention to the fact that the Treasurer esfimates .that at the end of the current financial year, he will have a surplus - ou t of our one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which we are empowered to retain under the Constitutionof £ 3 1 1 , 0 0 0 . It is well, therefore, for us to give some thought to the other items of expenditure which are practically inevitable, especially m view of the fact that the Government propose to sacrifice a very large sum of money, which is easily collected, and the payment of which is practically felt by nobody. diture which seems to me to be inevitable, I put nothing down for the establishment of an ammunition factory and a small arms factory. It is impossible for me to estimate how much their establishment would cost, or what sum we should require to spend on their maintenance. of all , we have to provide for old-age pensions. The Government tell us that they intend to do something tangible in that direction. I do not know of any particular method of raising money for that purpose which can be counted upon to yield all that is required. I know of no special source which will provide the necessary sum in the absence of contributions from other sources. The cost of providing for old age pensions is estimated at ,£1,500,000 annually. .Payment for the transferred properties, it is calculated, will involve us in more than £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.",56
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Not so much as that, if we adopt the balancing method.",57
445,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If we adopt the balancing method, I admit that the cost will not be so much.",57
446,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is the only method which ""we can adopt.",57
447,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Personally , I am in favour of a modification of the proposal which was put forward by Mr , now Justice, O'Connor,. when he represented the vernment in another Chamber. But, even upon the basis of any reasonable modificafuture tion of that scheme, a fairlv large sum will tional still have to be taken from the Commonannum. wealth Treasury for some time before those properties can be paid for. Any - which is likely to meet with acceptance by the States, will involve us in an expendiclass ture of at least £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually.  gained by paying for those properties?",57
448,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The r e is nothing to be But I wish to gained from the stand-point of the Federal authorities ?  from the people's stand-point?,57
449,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"So far as the people as taxpayers are concerned, it does not matter whether they are paid for those properties or not. But the provision is contained in; our Constitution, and it is extremely doubtful whether the States-if any of them cared to take action-coul d not compel us to deal with the question of paying for them.",57
450,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,If we f a il to agree In the expen- the mode of compensation is left to this Parliament to determine.,57
451,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am aware that in default of any agreement being arrived at, this Parliament has the power to decide the manner in which the debts shall be But first liquidated. But that does not afford an excuse for Parliament delaying a settlement of the matter.",57
452,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We are not delaying its settlement. The States have not been very anxious to make their valuations.,57
453,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"At any rate, after the lapse of five years, we ought to have formed some idea of what we are going to do' in the matter. Under the most favourable scheme that we can put forward the transferred properties will involve us in a payment c f at least £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. The cost of coastal defence I set down at a minimum of £ TOO , OOO per annum, in addition to the amount which is already being spent.",57
454,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That sum would not go very far in building the fleet that is necessary.,57
455,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I take it that any scheme which we can adopt in regard to naval defence must be upon the lines of making steady provision in that direction. Personally, I would prefer to see a much Golarger sum spent, but I recognise that there is not much probability in the near of our getting more than an addisum of £ r o o , o o o or £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per",57
456,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,How many craft could scheme we obtain for that amount?,57
457,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We can get a firsttorpedo boat for about £ 2 0 , 0 0 0, 1 think.",57
458,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I thought that they cost about £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 .",57
459,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"A goctl torpedo boat can be built for £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , but I understand that torpedo destroyers cost somewhere about £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 . But even if we only spent £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually, in addition to our present expenditure, it would be better than doing nothing.",58
460,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,C o u l d net we hire the vessels ?,58
461,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"When I was in office, 1 did suggest to the Admiralty authorities that we would be prepared to hire boats of that description, but for various reasons, they were not able to f all in with the suggestion, and so we must have recourse to building them to meet our own requirements. Then there is the question of the construction of the transcontinental railway. If that undertaking is to be regarded as a possibility, it will involve the Commonwealth in a fairly large deficit for some years after its completion. I do not think that even our optimistic Treasurer will argue that it will pay from the start.",58
462,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It within three years of its completion, I think.",58
463,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not think so. It would be a most remarkable circumstance if it did. In any case, we should have to face a deficiency in connection with it. The engineers who reported upon it as men who are accustomed to making estimates of that character, bearing in mind the country which it would traverse, and the population which it would serve at either end, calculated that it would involve us in a loss of £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 annually for ten years. I am net arguing that that is a loss which the Commonwealth should not be prepared to face. The New South Wales Government constructed a line of railway dewn the south coast upon which they lost £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 annually for a good many years, and upon which they still lose a very large sum. For the Commonwealth to be called upon to face a similar annual loss upon a railway constructed for developmental purposes would be a comparatively small matter.",58
464,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I that the loss would be anything like that amount.,58
465,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"-That is a matter of opinion. I have merely quoted from the testimony of experts. There is no doubt that some loss would have to be faced in connection with that line, and it is well for us to keep it in mind. Then there is the sugan bounty. The Treasurer estimates that during the current year we shall have to pay about £ 2 7 8 , 5 0 0 in this connection. There is a very large increase in the sum payable this year, as compared with the amount expended last year, owing to the expected increase in the quantity of sugar produced by white labour. No doubt the Treasurer anticipates that next year the expenditure in that direction will be still larger. As I have said, it is estimated that the expenditure this year, when black labour will be in some measure available for the production of a large proportion of the sugar, will amount to £278,500. But next year black labour will not be available in the same degree, and consequently we shall have a larger expenditure, since every grower who employs white labour exclusively will naturally apply for the bounty. As we receive only £ 1 out of the £ 4 per ton Excise duty, and have to pay from the Federal Treasury £ 3 per ton by way of bounty, would pay it stands to reason that there will be a largely increased demand upon the one-fourth of revenue retained by the Commonwealth. I do not know whether the Treasurer has looked ahead to ascertain how far his revenue will be affected in this way. I am inclined to think that, owing to the greater proportion of sugar grown by white labour, he will expend next year at least ^£150,000 more than he is paying away this year in respect of the bounty.",58
466,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is to say. the States will get it.,58
467,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Quite so. I am only pointing out that we have ahead a number of commitments: that will affect our power to expend the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue to which we are entitled.,58
468,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We must try to make the payment a rebate.,58
469,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In the first instance it was passed as a rebate, but the Crown Law officers said that that was unconstitutional. We had therefore to retrace our steps, and describe the payment as a do not think bounty. The right honourable gentleman may find some method of overcoming the difficulty. The leader of the Opposition once said that when he came to a stile over which he could not jump, he crawled round it. In the same way, apparently, the Treasurer thinks that if he runs himself into financial difficulties, instead of meeting them boldly, he will get round them in some peculiar way.",58
470,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,He has large ideas about money.,59
471,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Evidently . There are some other items of expenditure in respect of which we may expect an increase. We have to remember the natural growth of the Departments. Some of them should grow. They have very important duties to perform ini the interests of the people, and it is only natural that the number of their officers should be increased as opportunities for benefiting the people present themselves. We have, for instance, such proposals as the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture in connection with the Department of Home Affairs, and the taking over of the Department of Meteorologv, which will involve an increased expenditure. That increased expenditure is essential to secure increased efficiency. And so in other directions the Departments will naturally grow. We aTe told by the Government that it will cost something to advertise the Commonwealth in connection with the immigration proposals; and a much larger matter which will demand attention in the near future is the taking over of the Northern Territory. I do not know whether the Treasurer has considered how far the taking over of the Territorv will detrimentally affect the finances of the Commonwealth. Sir TOHN FORREST. - The question not vet come before me.",59
472,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"E very honourable member must be convinced that we are doing a wrong to the people of Australia by allowing that large area to remain in the hands of one State, and practically undeveloped.",59
473,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Unoccupied , practically.",59
474,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is undeveloped, and we are practically holding out an invitation to the hordes of people living to the north of Australia to occupy it. The taking over of such a Territory must inevitably involve for some time a considerable expenditure without anv immediate result.",59
475,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We should need a loan for that purpose.,59
476,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The improvident financier always falls back on a loan. »,59
477,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We could not provide for the development of the Territory out-of the revenue.,59
478,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I hope that the Commonwealth will not have to resort to borrowing for some years. It is all very well for the right honourable gentleman to speak in this light-hearted fashion about resorting to loans, whilst at the same time he is prepared to throw revenue into the sea.",59
479,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Do not say that.,59
480,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Practically that is what is proposed to be done.,59
481,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Why does the honourable member say that?,59
482,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We have to face the enormous prospective expenditure to which I have briefly alluded, and vet the M in istry are quite prepared to forego a revenue of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum now raised by the Post and Telegraph Department in a way that has, aroused no dissatisfaction on the part of the people.",59
483,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We must observe the Federal spirit, and give some conveniences to the people.",59
484,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I agree with the right honourable gentleman that we should afford conveniences to the people; but I am afraid that what he now terms a proposal to grant a convenience to the people will be used as a reason for denying conveniences to those who most deserve them, and who most need assistance at the hand of the Commonwealth. What is the invariable excuse for refusing' to grant a request by country members for increased postal facilities? When an honourable member asks for an additional mail service to a collection of has settlers on the rim of civilization, he is told that it will not pay, or that the Department have not sufficient money for that purpose. I am prepared to say that if the average city man were asked to choose between the granting of increased facilities to settlers in the back-blocks on the one hand and penny postage throughout Australia on the other, he would declare for the former.",59
485,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The residents of nearly all the towns in the different States have penny postage, and those in the country do not enioy that privilege.",59
486,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Thos e living within the radius of towns, or within a certain area in country districts, in most of the States todav eniov pennv postage.",59
487,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,W h v should people in country districts be denied that which is given to those residing in the towns ?,59
488,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The denial of penny postage throughout Australia is. a small matter when compared with the denial to country districts of facilities in the way of postal and telephonic extension to which they are justly entitled. The complaint will possibly come from those are quite prepared to pay the additional penny per letter.,59
489,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is unfederal to require one man to pay 2d. for a letter, another to pay only id.",60
490,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I think that the right honourable gentleman is allowing himself be swayed by a number of sentimental siderations which need have no place in deliberations with respect to the financial problem. The suggestions he has made to falling into line with the rest civilized world and other vague generalities of that sort do not seem, from my that. stand-point, to be of importance in the sideration of a matter that is, after all, one of practical working politics.",60
491,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We must cast our bread upon the waters.,60
492,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am afraid that it will be manv days before this particular ness. bread will return to us. I have no objection per se to penny postage. If we were making monev out of the Post and Telegraph Department I should say at once, "" Reduce the postage, and give increased facilities in every direction."" But as matter of fact, as has already been shown, the Department is today losing very siderably. As the honourable member for Parramatta mentioned, - it has lost the £1,750,000 in five years, because, although the Postmaster-General talks of his Deafter partment being a pavable one, he knows full well that it can only be said to ing when we leave out of account the interest on the capital expenditure that available. has been incurred in respect of it. The immense capital sum that is being spent on the Department generally no interest, and is, therefore, contributed by the taxpayers generally for the benefit of those who use the Post Office.",60
493,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Surely the orable member does not say that the Post Office ought to be made to pay ?,60
494,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Not at all. The Post the Electoral Department. Office should be run in the interests the people, and afford as cheap and easy facilities as possible.

496,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does the honourable member not approve of uniformity?,60
497,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not think that and uniformity is so essential as seems to be supposed. In my opinion, it does not matter particularly, so far as the people of to the Commonwealth are concerned, whether conthere is absolute uniformity or not. It our would be preferable, I admit, to have uniformity, if it could be obtained without as any undue sacrifice; but when it means of the giving up £300,000 of revenue",60

502,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Every one know that there were special circumstances in Victoria, a where, owing to the protectionist policy, there were manufactures in proportion conlargely in excess of those of the other States, and, because of its central position, State had a larger share of the distributing business than fell to her neighbours Federation.

[REPRESENTATIVES.] Sir JOHN FORREST! -- Why should the people of Victoria have an advantage over those of New South Wales?",60
505,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The right honourable gentleman knows that no figures have been submitted in regard to New South Wales; but, if there had been, I am inclined to think they would have disclosed quite as large an increase as we find in the case of Victoria.",61
506,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The people of Victoria have an advantage over those of New South Wales and all other States.,61
507,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The people of Victoria have to pay for the loss on penny postage at present. The large proportion of the increased business in Victoria is due to the expansion consequent on Federation, while a fair amount is due to the fact that the Commonwealth Departments now pav postage.",61
508,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,And the States Departments also.,61
509,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Both Commonwealth and States Departments have now to pay postage. It ""will be a proper thing for the Fostmaster-General to analyze the figures, and ascertain exactly what the departmental postage amounts to. It could be easily ascertained how much the States Departments contribute to the postal revenue now, as compared with the contribution before Federation.",61
510,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Would the honourable member apply the same argument to the reduction in the charges for Tasmanian cable messages?,61
511,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No ; I think we ought to treat Tasmania as we treat the other States. There are a number of long land lines which do not pay. and the loss on which is borne by the Commonwealth generally; and if there is a short section of cable that is not remunerative, I do not see why there should be any distinction drawn between that and non-paving lines on the Continent. I see no difference in principle; and, therefore, I say that in this connection Tasmania should be placed On the same basis as are the other States.",61
512,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is uniformity.,61
513,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is uniformitv in that regard, simplv because it would be unfair to denv to Tasmania a privilege which is granted to other. States. But in the case nf Victoria, the mmnv r.os,tn»-p is npiri for by the people of that State. T doubt very much whether the Treasurer and myBudget. self will see the end of the bookkeeping system for some little time to come. We may talk about the desirability of abolishing the system, but I see no prospect of any alteration for a long time ahead.",61
514,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We are surely not going to have the system in perpetuity?,61
515,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"So long as there is such a marked disparity between the contribution per head of the people of Western Australia, and the contribution of the people of Tasmania, for instance",61
516,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Western Australian contribution is going down rapidly.',61
517,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It is still double that of Tasmania.,61
518,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"There is an enormous difference still, and the bookkeeping system must be continued.",61
519,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Tasmani a is getting close up.,61
520,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Tasmani a is still a long way behind Western Australia with a contribution of, I think, £ i 16s. per head, as against £ 3 odd per head.",61
521,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The difference is only about 3s. 6d. per head.,61
522,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does the honourable member say that that is all the difference between the contribution per head of Tasmania and the contribution per head of Western Australia?,61
523,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am leaving out Western Australia, and comparing Tasmania with the other States.",61
524,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There is not such a difference on that comparison; but the people of Western Australia have a reasonable and* proper objection to the money which they contribute being divided amongst the people of the other States.,61
525,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Then - they are not Socialists ?,61
526,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,They are not Socialists to that degree. 0,61
527,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Wester n Australia cannot afford to lose the-money.,61
528,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"What I want to say is that, so far as the Post and Telegraph Department is concerned, we already grant reasonable facilities. We have the cheapest telegrams, I think, that are to be found anywhere in the world) so far as I have been able to ascertain.",61
529,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There are sixpenny telegrams in England.,61
530,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Considerin g the distances and our population, I think our telegrams are cheaper than telegrams elsewhere.' I do not know any place in the world where it is possible to telegraph teen words for is. for such a distance as it? that from Tasmania to the Gulf of Carpentaria or Port Darwin, or , Perth. That in itself is an extremely cheap rate; and I am doubtful whether we did not go too far in that direction.",61
531,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The cheap rate very useful.,62
532,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In any case, great faciI lities are granted to the people in this Our mail services generally are, very perly, I think, even at a loss, taken right to the doors of our back country selectors, and further facilities in this connection should be granted. But no reason has been advanced in favour of penny other than the extremely illogical or sentimental reason that its adoption us in line with the rest of the world. Our expenditure must inevitably expand almost by leaps and bounds; and in view of the fact that a vast amount of administrative work, which should be taken over by the Commonwealth, has not yet been taken over, we are not justified in giving up the £200,000 odd,"" which is the modest estiupon mate of the Postmaster-General of the likely to result from the adoption of the penny postage.",62
533,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The Postmasterexpended General's estimate is less than that.,62
534,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Postmaster-Genehonorable ral estimates the loss at ,£209,000.",62
535,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is my estiare mate ,62
536,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That would pay our convoted to the question. tribution to the Naval Subsidy.,62
537,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I wish we could knock off meed of justice. that subsidy.,62
538,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I trust, therefore, in spite of the fact that the Treasurer points to an expanding revenue, honourable members will hesitate before they approve of any such scheme of penny postage. have all those additional items of expensay diture which have been mentioned, and, addition, the Government sav that within short time they intend to introduce a Tariff that will have greater protective incidence than the present Tariff. That must mean falling off in revenue. If it does, what becomes of the glowing anticipations of the Treasurer? If the revenue contracts, where is he going to find the money to meet inevitable expenditure? Is ha going to confess to the people of Western Australia that the transcontinental railway will to stand aside because there is no possisixbility of meeting the loss in connection with",62
539,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,He will .fall back upon from Brisbane to direct taxation.,62
540,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am extremely doubtful whether he will; but I see no chance whatever of raising sufficient money by any. is scheme of direct taxation that I can contemplate, to carry out the things which have enumerated, and which I regard as way. essential for the proper development of prothis Commonwealth. Even though we do obtain some help from direct taxation, we shall still require all the legitimate revenue we can get hold of, if we are to carry out yet the many functions which are demanding postage, attention at our hands.",62
541,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We have hot touched diwould place rect taxation yet.,62
542,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I know that; and when the Commonwealth does touch it, we shall have to supplement it before we can carry out the proposals I have indicatedI do not intend to say more with regard to the Budget, but there are one or two other matters to which I should like to refer, and which the Treasurer touched in his loss speech. He mentioned the question of the States debts. I wish to say that I for one appreciate highly the care that has been in the consideration of this question, both by the Treasurer and by the member for Mernda. The two memoranda submitted by those gentlemen highly interesting, and give evidence of most careful thought having been deI do not think that any one can deny them that I admit at once that there is an extreme difficulty in dealing that, in any satisfactory way with a problem with so many facets as this presents. For myself, I do not pretend for a moment to be a financial expert. I approach the We question as a layman. But I am sorry to that I cannot agree with either of the in proposals that has been put"" forward up to a the present. The Treasurer proposes that we shall take over the debts as they mature.",62
543,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That we should a take power to assume responsibility for them when they are converted or redeemed.,62
544,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"So far as that bare proposal is concerned, I am quite at one this with the right honourable gentleman. It has always appeared to me that it would be extremely unwise on our part - to assume re have sponsibility for the debts, even to the extent that the'Constitution permits us to do - that is for the debts as existing at the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth-in any lump fashion. I remember ^bat when the Convention was debating this point, the present Teader of the Opposition stated, as his opinion, that to take over the States debts in one lump, or to assume responsibility for them as a whole, would mean making a present to the bond-holders of an immense sum of .money, represented by the difference between the price that could be obtained for Commonwealth bonds and that which could be obtained for the bonds of the States. ' Sir JOHN FORRES T - The honourable member will notice that the financial authorities in London are of the same opinion.",62
545,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Quite so. When that statement was made by the right honourable member for East Sydney in 1897, it struck - me as being an extremely sensible remark. If we say that we as a Commonwealth will pay the interest on the debts of the States, and will be responsible for them when the money becomes due, we assume the whole responsibility for them.",63
546,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"How much is to be paid for them when they are due? ' Mr WATSON - That is not the question. We pay par for them when they become due unquestionably; but does not the honourable member see that if we took over the debts tomorrow-if we assumed responsibility for them tomorrow-it would not be a question of how much we should have to pay, but of how much we were presenting free of encumbrance to the bond-holders, who are now the creditors of the States?",63
547,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I cannot see that at all.,63
548,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It means, it seems to me, that we forgo the opportunity of making the better terms which we have a right to expect from a Commonwealth security.",63
549,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That idea prevailed when it was expected that the Commonwealth would convert on a large scale - step,63
550,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"As 1 understand the proposal of the Treasurer, it is that we should take legislative power to convert and renew maturing loans. Well, I quite agree with him in that. I mentioned my belief in that method two or three times during the recess. At Hobart, for instance, and also at Adelaide, I spoke in favour of that course being taken. But I disagree from the Treasure! in thinking that that can be done without an amendment of the Constitution. ' Mr HIGGINS - Hear , hear; quite right.",63
551,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Treasurer, in his memorandum, proposes to amend the Constitution.",63
552,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,No ; not in this regard. The Treasurer says that legislation by this Parliament is sufficient for that; but he proposes' to amend the Constitution in another matter.,63
553,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is in taking over the whole of the debts.,63
554,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Yes . . .,63
555,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I think the Constitution is quite wide enough for what I propose.,63
556,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not think so. Section 105 lays it down that the Parliament may take over from the States the public debts as exisling at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof, according to the respective numbers of the people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. The Treasurer will see, I think, that there are only two alternatives- (1) To take over the whole of the debts as they existed on the 31st. December, 1901; ' or (2) to take over a certain proportion of the debts of each State. I contend that neither of those two courses would be wise. Therefore, in my view, an amendment of the Constitution is essential before the best course can be taken; that is, that Parliament-whethe r Parliament sees fit to delegate that power afterwards to the Treasurer is another question-shoul d be endowed with power to take over as much or as little of the debts of each State as it thinks desirable. There mav be a difference in regard to the details, but the main thing is that the Federal Treasurer, with the authoritv of Parliament, should be enabled to step into the market at a favourable moment if he wishes to convert, and that the same authoritv should be able to in and buy State bonds, keeping them up to a certain level, or taking an opportunity of, perhaps, saving some hundreds of thousands of pounds because of a temporary fall in price; and, on the other hand, there should be power to renew on Commonwealth security State loans' as they mature.",63
557,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We have that power under the Constitution.,63
558,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not think so. It must be done in certain regular proportions. The Treasurer must see that, if in Victoria a £5,000,000 loan, were falling due next month, it might be-it would be, I think-desirabl e for the Commonwealth to take it over and renew it on its own security, but it would hamper the business to say that, at the same time, we should make ourselves responsible for a similar proportion of the debts of every other State.",63
559,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is not proposed at all.,64
560,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is what the.Constitution provides.,64
561,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The Constitution says that the Commonwealth may take over the debts which had been incurred at the time it was established; but .we propose to amend the Constitution, with a view to take over the whole of the debts.",64
562,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"As a layman, I speak with diffidence, but I think the Treasurer will find that a further amendment of the Constitution will be required. Sir JOHN ""FORREST - I am advised not.",64
563,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The right honourable gentleman may be a much better authority on this point than I am.,64
564,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The terms of provision in the Constitution are pretty wide.,64
565,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"As I read the Constitution, there seems no doubt but that we are confined to two courses, neither of which, in mv view, would be wise, or likely to prove economical.",64
566,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,In what way does the honourable member suggest it ought to be done?,64
567,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"What I suggest to the Government is that, before this session closes, they should put forward a proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give this Parliament the pOwer to deal with the debts in the manner I have indicated.",64
568,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We may do that yet.,64
569,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I think that it ought to be done, so as to allow the Commonwealth to start at once with the renewal of maturing loams, and not to bother about the proportion which it is to take over.",64
570,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That would simplify matters a good deal.,64
571,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I think so. The first thing to do is to get legislative power to deal with this big question in a' way which would commend itself' to the Parliament. If we 'got that power there would be no trouble at .all, I think. We should soon learn, from experience, what would be the best thing to do. In the meantime, the question of. renewing maturing loans would be quite enough for us to take up as a problem. If we were to deal with all loans as they matured we should gradually reach a position when, as was indicated by the honourable member for Mernda, the financial conditions as between the different States would have so changed that there would be no need to consider these questions at all. He put forward many other admirable suggestions. For instance, his proposal to establish a sinking fund, and to place the money in the care of debt commissioners-that is, permanent individuals, with the assistance of the Treasurer, but - in the main independent of politics^is an excellent suggestion. I do not think that any sinking fund, would be safe so long as it was at the mercy of a temporarily embarrassed Treasurer.",64
572,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,O r any one who could lay his hands upon it.,64
573,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Exactly , and I do not suppose that any one of us could be trusted in that regard. To secure ourselves against the temptation, it would be wise to create a body which, in a measure, would be independent of Parliament, and which we could trust to perform this very important duty. It need not cost a great sum, and it would be a wise course to take.",64
574,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It would not cost very much.,64
575,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No Then, with regard to the right of the States to borrow, I''do not think that a great deal can be said for the suggestion which the honourable member put forward in that regard. It is quite hopeless to expect that any great benefit would result from the Commonwealth taking over the States debts if the States are to continue as competitors in the London market. For that reason, there ought to be some constitutional barrier placed in the way of their' appealing to that market, perhaps in competition with the Commonwealth acting on behalf of all the people of Australia.  through the Commonwealth.",64
576,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . I am inclined to think that some such arrangement would be a wise one. There is a great need for early action to be taken in the direction of amending the Constitution. As the honourable member for Mernda very pro1 perly said, it is becoming a matter of 4 ieproach against the Parliament,- that, although this question has been in our hands for so long, we have done actually nothing towards its solution, except to talk.",64
577,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We have had three conferences.,65
578,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes , but we have taken no active steps in the direction of solving the problem.",65
579,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We are commencWhat ing now.,65
580,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member might just as well say that we commenced when the honourable member for Balactrusted lava, as Treasurer, put forward a scheme the details of which had much to comthe mend them, but we got no further; and so we are likely to go on. I would urge upon the Government that the first step to be taken is to secure such an amendnet ment of the Constitution as would allow a freer hand to Parliament than it posany sesses. There is another aspect of. this financial question which I think merits little consideration, and that is the suggespared tion of the Treasurer to get over the operation of trie Braddon section. If, I understand, it is put forward as a ter of Government policy, I am very sorry indeed that that course has been adopted. The scheme, as was pointed out by the orable member for Mernda, seems to be so arranged that the Commonwealth ' would take all the risk of loss, while the States would take all the chances'of profit.",65
581,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We do not conafter sider that there would be any risk.,65
582,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I am inclined to think that the right honourable gentleman duly optimistic in that regard.,65
583,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is quite safe, think.",65
584,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I notice that despite all his experience as a Treasurer, it never strikes the right honourable gentleman that it is a wise thing to start in a fat year to build up a reserve which would the lean year, which must inevitably come.'",65
585,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Yes ; we are posing to do that under this scheme.,65
586,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not understand that.,65
587,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is proposed have independent finance, and not to turn any surplus of the Commonwealth fourtb to the States.",65
588,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"This print must be for rather badly arranged-by the typea free snatchers, I suppose.",65
589,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No ; the honourable member has not, I think, understood it properly.",65
590,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"As I understand it, the Commonwealth' is to start with a fixed payment to the States from the end of 1910. The only reason which can be given for adopting a fixed payment is that it should take effect immediately. is the objection to the Braddon section? The objection - is that it unduly hampers the Parliament of the Commonwealthin the exercise of the functions into it by the people of the States. Apart from that, there is no objection to section. Those of us who object to it say that we are "" cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd,"" because it lays down that the Commonwealth may use only one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise duties. On principle, I, for one, object to constitutional provision which ties the hands of the people in the future. a I object on principle. I have been prec> for some time past to support a proposal for the substitution of a fixed payas ment for the returns under the Braddon matsection, but merely as the lesser of two evils. The Treasurer wishes to provide for a fixed payment after the termination of hon the Braddon provision. This Parliament, however, representing the broader aspirations of the people of Australia, will have the right to please itself as to what it will do with the Commonwealth revenue the Braddon provision has ceased to have effect. At the end of 1910 the Parliament will be free from the restrictions is unimposed by the Braddon section. The Treasurer wishes to make provision for a we fixed payment, to take effect after that date; but I shall resist that proposal with all the energy of which I am capable.",65
591,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We cannot provide for a fixed payment earlier, because of the tide us over Braddon provision.",65
592,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"A fixed payment has purbeen suggested to the Premiers of the States as something which could be substituted for the Braddon provision, to take effect at once, which would give them ato securitv they do not now possess. The repayment need not necessarily be the payonement of a fixed sum; it mav be a fixed proportional amount. But, if substituted the Braddon provision, it would give us hand so far as the expenditure of the balance of our revenue was concerned.",65
593,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,1I have not heard anything about any proposal for the repeal of the Braddon provision.,66
594,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Then the right honourable gentleman has been inattentive on some occasions.,66
595,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The existence of the Braddon provision is one of the conditions"" under which the States federated.",66
596,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In New South Wales, one of the chief objections taken to the draft Constitution was that it contained the Braddon provision. I do not think that the people are fond of it. They object to it as strenuously now as they did seven years ago.",66
597,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The members of the Convention desired that the Braddon prothat vision should have perpetual effect.,66
598,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Fortunately for the welfare of Australia, their wishes will not thatbe carried out.",66
599,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We must keep to the bargain or substitute something equally duties good in its place.,66
600,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am prepared to do so; but if the people of Australia are preThere pared to make the constitutional change necessary to alter this arrangement, shall be readv to help them.",66
601,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I should not vise it unless every one is agreed as to expediency.,66
602,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the Treasurer inmonwealth, tends to substitute a fixed payment Braddon provision only after 1910, why does he trouble us with the proposal now, when so many pressing problems are awaittions, ing solution?",66
603,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Surely the honourable member does not object to my action in making plans for the future ?,66
604,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not believe in meeting the devil half way. The right any balance. honourable gentleman proposes to pay to the States annuallv for ten years after 31st December, 1910A fixed sum equal to the average annual amount of three-fourths of the. net revenue Customs and Excise. That means, broadly, that we shall congard tinue to pay what we are now paying.",66
605,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes ; but should not return any portion of the maining one-fourth, as we do now.",66
606,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"This is ""the posalIf three-fourths of the total net revenue received by the Commonwealth from Customs and increase. Excise in any one year after 31st December, I'gio, exceeds the aggregate amount of the annual fixed sum guaranteed to all the States, any such sum in excess to be distributed among the States per capita. There it is provided that any surplus is to be returned to the States.",66
607,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But we shall have one-fourth intact, which is not the case now.",66
608,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The righY honourable gentleman ignores the fact that the one-fourth would be mortgaged up to the hilt. Most of the expenditures to which I alluded the other night are inevitable, and will cause the one-fourth to disappear.",66
609,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Eve n admitting that may be so, there is a third proposal ",66
610,Mr VVATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The third proposal is After 31st December,"" 1910, the Commonwealth may impose additional Customs and Excise for specific purposes, and may specially appropriate and retain and ""earmark"" the whole of the revenue. are to be no duties for specific Commonwealth purposes until after 1910. I Everything involving expenditure of importance must wait until then. The right adhonorable gentleman is so anxious about its the States, and so fearful of building up a reserve fund in the interests of the Comto enable it to tide over lean for the years, that he insists thatIf any surplus remains in any year after providing for such specific purposes from the revenue derived from such special appropriathree-fourths of the surplus to be annually returned to the States per capita.",66
611,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We shall keep, our one-fourth.",66
612,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But there would not be,66
613,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There would be a balance if specific duties were levied.,66
614,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I do not think that the Treasurer can indicate specific duties from which would yield anything like enough to provide an old-age pensions fund, for instance. The Government's proposals in reto the alteration of the Tariff, so far as they can be understood, make it unlikely ve that the revenue from Customs duties will reincrease. Every step in the direction of higher protection should, and must, mean second proa decrease in revenue.",66
615,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But population will,66
616,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the population grows the charges on the Federal Government will increase, quite apart from any additional Departments that may be taken over by the Federation. The charges-in connection with the existing Federal Departmentswill grow at least in proportion to any increase of population. I should like to, see submitted to the electors by means of a referendum the question of whether we should not have the power to deal with this question at a date earlier than that indicated by the Treasurer. I do not, for a moment, advocate that the States should 'bp left absolutely in the lurch. Indeed, I am quite prepared to make something like reasonable provision with respect to their finances for ' a considerable time ahead. But I contend that it is against the interests of the Commonwealth and of the people of Australia that we should be bound down in an iron-clad fashion as at present by the Braddon section. I understood the Prime Minister to suggest in Svdney that the fixed payments to the States should begin at once. I had no idea that they were proposed to be entered upon only at the expiration of the Braddon section.",67
617,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If we paid the interests on the States debts we could easily overcome the difficulty, because we should absorb the money.",67
618,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That would introduce another complication. If we forthwith assumed the responsibilitv for the States debts-settin g on one side the question of whether that would be a wise financial operation, and whether we could not make a more profitable arrangement- a complication would arise, because the interest charges in one State exceed by ^ 7 S , the amount of Customs and Excise revenue to whioh the States are entitled.",67
619,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The States would have to pay that amount in excess to us, instead of to their creditors.",67
620,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The proposal made at the Hobart Conference was that the operation of the Braddon section should be extended until 1920.,67
621,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes , and I took every possible opportunity to denounce that proposal.",67
622,Sir TOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,My proposal is better than that.,67
623,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If is so little better that it is not worth making an attempt to carrv it into effect. I hope'that Parliahonorable ment will never consent to extend the operation of the Braddon section, or to do anything that would have the effect of hampering the activities of the people in any direction. I am speaking quite apart from any narrow party aspect of the caseIt is with me a basic principle that, once the people have made up their minds, they should be allowed to go in whatever direction they desire in the matter of legislation. If they wish to become free-traders, well and good; if they desire to become protectionists, also well and good. They have a perfect right to please themselves as to the manner in which they raise their revenue, whether it be by means of Customsand Excise duties, or by direct taxation. The people should be allowed - the utmost freedom, and they cannot exercise perfect freedom under the Braddon section.",67
624,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The best way in which to get rid of the Braddon section is to adopt an absolutely free-trade policy.,67
625,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable member's associates have never voted for, nor even advocated, absolute free-trade, so Far as the Federation is concerned. If the honourable member were ready to lead a crusade in favour of absolute free-trade and direct taxation, a number of honourable members who are not behind his leader would be ready to support him.",67
626,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I am very pleased to hear it.,67
627,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It would, however, be rather a novelty for any honourable member on that side of the Chamber to show that he had the courage of his convictions. We are in danger of being led into a serious dilemma. We shall have to provide for a number of items of expenditure which seem 0 0 0 0 inevitable, and even desirable, in the interests of the people as a whole, and with these possible commitments right ahead of us, it would be unwise to forego a large source of revenue in the manner proposed in the Budget. I hope, therefore, that when we discuss the Estimates in detail, the Committee will insist upon considerable modifications of the proposals embodied in the Treasurer's statement.",67
628,Mr HTGGTNS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL," I have had the advantage of reading the speech of the Treasurer, and of listening to the thoughtful and valuable contributions of the honourable members for Mernda and Bland. I am pleased that, after a long interval of talking against time, members are again alert to the importance of transacting public business. The Treasurer has adopted a policy upon lines similar to those suggested by me during the previous Budget debate, and has approached more closely to a solution of the problem than has any of his predecessors in office. However we may differ with regard to the details of his proposal, there is no doubt that the right honourable gentleman has applied his mind to this matter, and has contributed some valuable suggestions. I am glad to gather from the Prime Minister that there is no truth in the statement published in the newspapers this morning to the effect that he had stated that no proposal would be made for taking over the States debts until 1910. If that were true, this would be nothing more than a mere academic debate. I think that the Prime Minister, and the honourable member for Mernda. recognise that the questibn of reducing the burden of interest payments upon loans is of tremendous and immediate importance. For instance, if we could reduce the rate of interest payable on our loans by \ per cent., we should save the people of Australia over -£1,000,000 per annum. If we could reduce the interest charge by 1 per cent., we should lighten the burden of the taxpayers by over £ 2 , TOO , OOO per annum. ference to the Budget papers will show that next year ^5,000,000 will have to be provided for the repayment of loans. In the following year, £7,000,000, in the next year, £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in the succeeding year, £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in the ensuing twelve months, £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , will have to be found for the renewal of loans. Thus, every year large loans are falling due, and the whole question will have to be tackled. If the situation.is not faced by the Commonwealth, the States must act on their own behalf under all the disadvantages attached to having to go into the London market as competitors, without the backing of the Commonwealth. This problem can be dealt with, irrespective of any amendment of the Braddon section. That provision in the Constitution is an important one, but its amendment is not essential to enable the Commonwealth to take over the States debts. The Braddon section provides that the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is now . paid over to the States, may be disposed of either in that way, or by being applied to the payment of the interest on the States debts taken over by the Commonwealth. [86] The Treasurer clothed the dry bones of his figures with a good deal of flesh and blood. He has put his whole heart into his subject, as he always does. Having said that, it is, perhaps, quite pardonable to find that he devotes one of his valuable two eyes to Western Australia, and a good portion of the other also. At all events, I shall show presently that, very naturally, he feels great concern lest his State should get the worse of the bargain.",67
629,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not want to see any injustice done to it.,68
630,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"There is one important feature of the Treasurer's scheme which differentiates it from all other schemes-it has the approval of the Government. That means that it is to be taken up by the Government, and it is extremely important, therefore, that honourable members should offer such critiques as they may think necessary before it is placed before the people in a definite form. The Treasurer proposes to make one amendment only of the Constitution.",68
631,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,T w o . I thought that there might be one.,68
632,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Then , I understand that, in view of what has been said, the Treasurer recognises that it will be exA re- pedient to. make a second - amendment of the Constitution ?",68
633,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I said in my Budget speech that only two sections of the Constitution are affected, namelv, sections 94 and 105.",68
634,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I think, it will be necessary for the right honourable gentleman not only to amend the Constitutioni, so as to permit the Commonwealth to assume the responsibility for the debts which have been contracted by the States since Federation was accomplished, but to amend it in such a way as to enable the Commonwealth to take up the States loans as they approach maturity.",68
635,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"We intend that, as will be seen by reference to my Budget statement, page 2034 of Hansard.",68
636,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Q u it e so. I am very glad to find that the Treasurer, as the result of his visit to London, has arrived at the conclusion which I ventured to urge at this time last year. He has put it in very apt words. He says The financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on State stock before conversion, as such action would prevent the possibility of any profitable conversion, and would be making to the existing holders a present of any increase in price caused by the additional Commonwealth security.",68
637,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"That is, if they verted.",69
638,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No . If the Commonwealth were to say, "" We will see that these debts are paid,"" it would send up their value at once - I recollect the case of a young man who had got into debt through extravagance. H is creditors were willing to sell his debts for a shilling in the pound, but his aunt stepped in and said, "" I am going to see that all of Edward's debts are paid."" The result was that the creditors would not accept less than 20s. in the pound. Of course, I recognise that I am putting an extreme case; but, after all, this is only a matter in which we must exercise common sense. The meaning of the words "" take over"" is perfectly clear. They do not mean that a State shall not continue to be liable to its creditors. It will still be liable. But the Commonwealth will have practically said, "" We will also be liable."" My point is that the creditor of any State will then know that in addition to the liability of the State there will be the liability of the Commonwealth.",69
639,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But a creditor cannot get more than £ 1 0 0 for £ i o o - worth, of stock.",69
640,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If the member will permit me to develop my argument, he will see that I have taken into consideration everything that he has said. I embodied my conclusions in an article which appeared in the Telegraph and the Age of last year. Rightlv or wrongly, I hold that there will be a most material improvement in the stocks of the States, when once they are backed by the Commonwealth - guarantee. It now appears that the Treasurer, as the result of the interviews which he had with financial men in London, has come to a similar conclusion. The point which, the late Treasurer ignored in all his interviews with the Premiers has been seized very thoroughly and clearlv by the present occupant of that office. The only thing that I wish to say to the right honourable man is that he must recollect only power which the Constitution .gives us for taking over the States debts is conholders tained in section 105. That power is take over either all or a proportionate of the debts of the States. words, what we do for one State we do for all. When the Constitution was being framed, the fear was expressed that one State might get more advantage from are conthe Commonwealth backing than would another State. That was the reason why the clause was drafted in its present form. If we take over all the debts of the States at one swoop, we shall be giving the existing bondholders a ' big premium for nothing. Let us suppose that a Tasmanian bond carrying interest at 4 per 1 cent, is worth £ 1 0 0 , or par tomorrow. If the Commonwealth were to declare, "" We will assume responsibility for the payment of that bond,"" I venture to say that it would be worth at least £ 1 0 2 .",69
641,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,How would that affect either the Commonwealth or the Tasmanian Government?,69
642,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I say that it is something to bargain with, and that as a result the Commonwealth could give a bond carrying a lower rate of interest. I have in my mind an instance of a Queensland loan which will mature in 191:5. In that year a debt of .£11,400,000 will fall due. If that debt were taken over in, say, 1907, the State of Queensland would still remain liable for it, but the Commonwealth would have pledged itself to see both the principal and the interest upon it paid. In other words, there would be honourable behind that debt, not only the Queensland promise to pay, but also the Com-, monwealth promise-the better security of all the States. Moreover, in London, the stock would be more marketable, because Daily we should have a large uniform stock. I am told upon very good authority that just as consols are used in London today for mercantile transactions-in the knowledge that there are plenty of consols available so long as people are willing to pay the price demanded for them-w e shall find, so long as Commonwealth stock is uniform and invariable, and there is plenty of it to be had upon the market in time of stress, that not only investors, but financial men also will purchase it.",69
643,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What disadvantage will there be to the States or to the gentleCommonwealth if we do not take over that the their indebtedness at once?,69
644,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If we said to the of £ 1 0 0 worth of these Queensto land bonds, which carry interest at 4 per part cent., ""Your debt will fall due in 1915. In other We are prepared to .give you the same must amount of Commonwealth stock at $\ per cent, if you will exercise your option vert within a certain time,"" they would see the advantage. A large number of invesbecause tors hold trusts for long terms, and do like changes; they do not like being paid off. They would much rather have bond which, as proposed by the Treatake surer, is not to be paid for a period of say, thirty years, . or is intertralia minable, than one which is to be paid within a few years. And so they would . say, "" The rate of interest is still falling, no matter what we do, and we cannot tain better rates. We will exchange the Queensland £ 1 0 0 bond for a Commonral, wealth bond at a lower rate, but issued a longer term.""",69
645,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,They might do that when the loans are approaching maturity. But I interest ? do not think they would do it during the next seven years.,70
646,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am quoting an exnearing maturity. - treme case. I know that as the bonds get closer to maturity there will be more likelinearer hood of securing an exchange. The member is aware that in London there are investors of all sorts. There are big panies and societies, and also big investors who want nothing so much as a fixed inwould vestment. The amount of interest payable is not so material as is the requirement that they shall not. be disturbed, and, .the time approaches for payment of the per cent. bonds, they are extremely likely to being to make an exchange. As soon as all the stock has been taken over, as it is to be save £57,000 hoped it will be, we shall have a stock presenting no less than. ,£236,000,000 work upon. That is a huge sum. The year of £114,000. larger it is the better for the purposes investment, and for those who are engaged in finance. At present, a number of men do not touch Australian securities because terest, save Queensland £228,000. of the trouble experienced in ascertaining the terms-the various States issuing them, the rates of interest payable, and general conditions. All these conditions are embarrassing, and consequently, these quired, let us have it quickly. men invest in consols or something else simpler. It is an immense advantage have a uniform stock with an undoubted security and simple conditions.",70
647,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,British trustees were barred from investing in Australian securities.,70
648,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I understand that they now have limited power to invest in them, but that power has not been largely used. In consequence of my law associations. [86]- 2 2 to conI have a good deal of experience in these matters, and I know that it is largely of the differences in the conditions not and terms, and the uncertainty with regard to the different States issuing bonds, that a so many people in the old world do not them up. The people of England are far more likely to understand what "" Aus"" means than what "" T as m a n i a "" or off even "" New South Wales "" means. We should also give bond-holders an option. We should advertise that holders of bonds obrepresenting the £11,400,000 should apply, say, within six months to the Agent-Geneor whoever may be appointed, who will fo i give them, if they wish it, 'Commonwealth stock in exchange for their bonds.",70

As an amendment of the Constitution is reI feel convinced that if the Government put a comto plete, well-recommended scheme before the people, they would be given carte blanch?..",70
654,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Would it not be sufficient if we struck out of section 105 of the Constitution the words "" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth "" ?",70
655,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I must ask the right honourable gentleman to again consult his advisers. I think that he must have misunderstood.,70
656,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I certainly was informed that we could do this. Mr H l GGINS - The r e is no power under the Constitution to carry out the scheme that the Treasurer has very properly suggested for taking over the debts as they mature or approach maturity. - Sir JOHN FORREST - Has and learned member read what I propose in sub-clause i of clause 8 of my memorandum? It is to be found at page 2034 of Hansard.,71
657,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I have noticed that the right honourable member proposes that a law be passed enabling the whole of the States debts to be converted or redeemed "" by such successive operations as may be thought fit."" That is a proper idea, but effect cannot be given to it under the Constitution.",71
658,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Does not section 105 authorize the taking over of the debts as they mature?,71
659,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"No ; it merely allows 3 the taking over of all the debts, or a proportion of them, at the one time.",71
660,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The clause in my memorandum to which T have directed the honourable and learned member's* attention was carefullv settled.,71

668,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,A layman would certainly think that the debts could* be taken over as they matured.,71
669,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"M v honourable friend is the first layman I have met who takes that view. As to the Treasurer's proposed substitute for the Braddon section, I think that the objection of the honourable member for Mernda is a just one.",71
670,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"T n the Constitution we have the words "" take over."" not legislate as to the way in which we shall take over the debts?",71
671,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We can legislate only as allowed by the Constitution.,71
672,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"In section 105 of the Constitution we have the words "" take over,"" but nothing as to how we shall take the honourable over the debts.",71
673,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It says, in effect, that we must take over the whole or a proportion of .the debts.",71
674,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is what we are going to do.,71
675,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If we took over the whole, we should give to the bond-holders the present that the honourable member for Mernda has mentioned. We are in the dilemma that, if we took over the whole, we should put the Commonwealth brand on the States debts, without any equivalent, while if we did not take over the whole, we should be going against the Constitution.",71
676,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable and * learned member will see that sub-clause 2 of clause 8 of my memorandum provides exactlv for what we want to do. We propose, to. do it by successive steps.",71
677,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I understand that the Treasurer wishes to have successive steps; and that the only question between us is whether what he proposes can be done withalways kept out an amendment of the Constitution.,71
678,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I shall look into, the point.",71
679,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"As to the substitute for the Braddon section, I must say that I think that the criticism of the honourable member for Mernda is right and just. If there were a reduction in our revenue receipts, the Commonwealth would have to bear the whole brunt of it. If we had bad Constitution times, and if , as the honourable member for Mernda says, there were a f all in revenue from £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £7,000,000 , then the States would get their fixed proportion, while the Commonwealth would receive only half of what it receives today. That would put the whole brunt of the difficulty on the Commonwealth. I am as hopeful as any one that' we shall not have a great reduction of the kind in our receipts; but, having regard to the experience of Victoria, with which the honourable member for Mernda and myself are most acquainted, I must sav that such an event is quite possible. I recollect that in a boom year the revenue in Victoria was £9,000,000 . whereas a few years later it was only £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , showing a fal l of one-third. Can we The Treasurer has had his lines cast in pleasant places in the glorious West, and can hardly understand what it is to have a deficit.",71

681,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But the more the population increases, the more women and babies there will be, and, therefore, the less revenue per head.",72
682,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I do not think so. I was taking into account new people.,72
683,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The reason that there is such an expanding revenue in Western Australia is that in that State there are more men who drink and smoke; and I must say that the Treasurer is right when he reminds us that it is the drinking men and the smoking men who keep the Commonwealth solvent-that but for such men we should be in sad case. As a solution of the difficulty to which the honourable member for Mernda alluded, I suggest that there should be some slight modification of the Treasurer's proposal for fixed payments. 105. That proposal has much to recommend it, inasmuch as it would make for certainty the States Treasurers, and would away with quarrelling and trouble. Every year we are told that we are spending much, but if there were fixed payments the fact would diminish immensely the fricthe tion between the Commonwealth and the States. I should like, however, to see some provision made by which, if the revenue were to fall considerably below, say, f example, £8,000,000, there should be a proportionate reduction in the fixed paythe honourable member. ments.",72
684,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I have no fear of that occurring.,72
685,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am very glad to hear the Treasurer say that, and I hope he is right. I only say that I should feel more 'secure if there were a provision that if the revenue fell considerably below, say, the £8,000, 0 0 0 standard, which the honourable member for Mernda mentioned, there should be a proportionate reduction in the pavment to the States.",72
686,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,An automatic reduction?,72
687,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Yes .,72
688,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I did not propose such a provision, because I do not think the circumstances are likelv to arise, and, in any case, do not think it necessary.",72
689,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But I am sure the Treasurer has no objection to any suggestion which may help his scheme to a consummation.,72
690,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"If there were a de-' ficiency we have specific powers to finance was looking at ourselves; we are responsible, like the States, for making both ends meet.",72
691,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I am exceedingly anxious that the relations of the Commonwealth and the States should go on with diminished friction; and I think fixed payments would help to that end. At the same time, if a crisis ever does occur, I do not want the whole brunt to f a ll on the Commonwealth Government, because any difficulty ought to be shared by both States and Commonwealth. I think I am not wrong in saying that the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda depends on his reading of section 96 of the Constitution. The honourable member regards that section, which gives power to the Commonwealth to grant financial assistance to any State, as involving the further power to take over the debts, practically irrespective of section",72
692,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I regard the section as for giving the Commonwealth power to lend tend to do the States money. Air. HIGGINS - That was to me a new too aspect of section 96, which I thought was well worth looking into, and I have come to conclusion, right or wrong, that we cannot give financial assistance in that way by practically taking over the debts. If there were no section 105 in the Constitution, o r there would not be so much difficulty in coming to the conclusion presented to us by But section 105 sets forth the conditions under which we may take over the debts, and we must give effect to that section equally with section 96-w e must read them both together. I have no doubt that the Court would come to the conclusion that section 105 provides the only way in which we can take over the debts, and that the granting of financial assistance was meant primarily to apply to the case of a State which threw out the flag of distress, and asked for help.",72
693,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That was the reason for the section.,72
694,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But , according to the honourable member for Mernda, the section means that we may grant assistance to all the States, and in the same degree, without being asked. That is not the granting of financial assistance which was meant.",72
695,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,It would involve an amendment of the Constitution?,73
696,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Yes . We all recollect the circumstances of the insertion of section 96. It was not passed by the Convention, which is, therefore, hot responsible for it. It was a provision serted by the Premiers in 1899 after the first referendum, at the instance, I believe, of New South Wales. That State felt that a low Tariff would suit its purposes, but recognised that, at the same time, a low Tariff would almost ruin Tasmania, and, perhaps, Queensland and South Australia. On behalf of New South Wales it was then said, ""Well, in place of being coerced into a high Tariff, let us have a provision by which the Commonwealth can assist a State."" I do not know who was the exact propounder or proposer of section 96, but I apprehend it must have been the honourable member who leads the Opposition. No doubt that was the intention of section 96, namely, to avoid the pressure of the argument that there' must be much Customs taxation in order to meet the needs of the poorer States. I admit that the historv of the section does not affect its interpretation; we must take a section as it stands in the Constitution. But I have little doubt that the interpretation of the two sections would be that the only power to take over the debts is that conferred by section 105, and that the only application of section 96 is to enable the Commonwealth to hold out a hand to a State which cries for aid. - Mr HARPER -- Not to lend money simply. - Mr HIGGINS - I may also point out that it is not enough for our purposes to exercise a power which we believe we have. It is too doubtful a power to exercise. In London investors and others will obtain advice about these things, and if a doubt is thrown upon what we are doing, it will mean that many investors will fight shy of this security. It is not enough for us to make a safe security, but we must make a security which also seems to be safe. On these grounds, I do not think that it would be well for us to attempt the experiment the honourable gentleman has referred to. My feeling is that the sooner we get to a per capita distribution, the better, and that we ought not to be deterred by any difficulties with regard to small sums, of money. Still, it must be remembered thlat Western Aus-' tralia is in an exceptional position. Her revenue for next year is estimated to be £ 3 14s. rod. per head of the population, whilst that for New South Wales is only jQz 3s. 4d., and for Tasmania £ 1 16s. There is the difference of more than double between Tasmania and Western Australia, in- owing to the habits, right or wrong, wicked or good",73
697,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The reason is, I think, that there are more men than women and children in Western Australia.",73
698,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Exactly; because where there are more men there is more drinking and more tobacco is smoked. As the Treasurer properly says, the greater part of our revenue is derived from the consumption of alcohol and narcotics.",73
699,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Wome n and children also consume less than men.,73
700,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The more women and children there are, the smaller the consumption, because women and children do not consume drink and tobacco as men do. Why, I myself, in company with the Treasurer, saw in Kalgoorlie, men four deep waiting for drinks* around a bar. The Treasurer need not think that his favourite Western Australia will always consume at such a great rate. He himself has told us that in the first year of the Commonwealth the consumption in Western Australia was not £ 3 14s. iod., but £ 5 16s. 4d. per head. In other words, when the Commonwealth started five or six years ago, Western Australia had per head two and a half limes the revenue of Tasmania. Now she has only one and a half times as much revenue, a falling off of 50 per cent. I expect that when we reach the year 1910 the States will have approached very near to an equalitv. The Treasurer, at page 2032 of his Budget statement, saidMy confidence is somewhat shaken, however, when I notice that resolutions have been passed in Conference and in Parliament asking for a fer capita distribution, under which the State of which I am a representative would suffer a loss of about ^300,000 a year. Those figures show that we are approaching very near to the state at which we ought to have a per capita distribution. .For that reason, I think that the Treasurers scheme based upon a five years' average is not a sound one. Suppose that by 1910 the consumption of Western Australiahas approached almost to an equality with that of Tasmania?",73
701,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I have thought of that. But Western Australia is more likely to increase in population than any other State.,73
702,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"But there is population and population. The more babies, thert .are, the smaller the revenue in proportion. The Treasurer's proposal is this: He says, *"" Fay to the States a fixed sum from 1910 to 1920 based upon the five years from 1905 to 1910."" But that would mean that Western Australia Would get for the ten years 1910 to 1920, payments upon the basis of 1905 to 1910, which might not l« fair to the other States.",74
703,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I think it would be.,74
704,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I venture to say that, as the disproportior! in Western Australia has been lowered by '50 per cent, in the last five years, it will probably be lowered by 50 per cent, in the next five years.",74
705,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,But there will be more people there.,74
706,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What I suggest to the Treasurer is that we should have a sliding scale after 1910 for the term of five years.,74
707,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,That is a matter of opinion. I merely suggested means.,74
708,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I think that the surer is anxious to have a per capita system as soon as it would be fair to the States.,74
709,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Yes .,74
710,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I agree with him that it would not be fair for us to force upon Western Australia a per capita, distribution unless the people of«that State recognised that it was fair.",74
711,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,We want to be fair - that is all. The question is: How are we to arrive at it ?,74
712,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"It is extremely important, as soon as we can, to have a per capita distribution.",74
713,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,I think so.,74
714,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I suggest that after 1910 we should have a sliding scale, by which the proportion of extra payment to Western Australia would be gradually diminished.",74
715,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,There is a difference of 8s. or 9s. between New South Wales and Tasmania now.,74
716,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"There is a difference,, but it is not very great. I think that New South Wales and Victoria would be willing - to forego some of the advantages which 'they now get from their greater receipts per head, as long as there were not such tion. an extreme disproportion as there is now in the case of Western Australia. In regard to the White Australia policy, Victoria, Tasmania, and the other States have shown that they are not by any means without generosity. The only States which benefit from that law are Queensland and part of New South Wales. The growers of sugar get a good deal of money from it, whilst Victoria and Tasmania, get nothing.",74
717,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,No r do Western Australia or South Australia.,74
718,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Wester n Australia, I suppose, would be very glad to get the use of the Kanakas, because the climate of that State is warm. But I am putting the extreme case of Victoria and Tasmania. They get no advantage, direct or indirect, from our White Australia legislation, but they wish to see Australia kept white. Victoria has paid £219,000 to keep Australia white and free from the Kanakas, and she has not grumbled a bit. Tasmania has paid £32,000 up to the present for the same purpose, and there is no grumbling.",74
719,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,Ne v South Wales pays a a larger bill.,74
720,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"The honourable memTrea- ber knows why I have not mentioned New South Wales. She has paid a larger bill because she has a larger population; but I have not mentioned her because it would be said that New South Wales gets back through her sugar-growers a larger proportion of the money which she pays, and she also gets her borders freed from the invasion of the Kanakas.",74
721,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,What has Queensland paid back?,74
722,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I have not said a word against Queensland. We are only too glad to make these payments to secure a White Australia. I was not going to say a word about coastal defence until I heard the honourable member for Bland refer to it. If I had any weight, I should like .to throw it strongly into the scale in favour of my honourable friend's argument. - I do not think that we have yet rightlygrasped the nettle of our defence system. I said last year that with an island continent, the first thing to be' looked for is coastal defence. Notwithstanding all the rifles, guns, and forts, nothing compares in importance with coastal defence.",74
723,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,The honourable and learned member has not listened to the honourable member for Wentworth on this ques,74
724,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"I would listen to the honourable member for Wentworth more frequently if he did not talk so often. At all events, I shall Be very glad indeed to find that I am in accord with him on this matter. We have great difficulties, because we are paying for our post-offices and other buildings from revenue. I am very glad that we adopted that policy. I feel certain that whether the - Commonwealth borrows or not, it should never borrow until it has begun to float) loans for the conversion of the States debts. It wants to get its foot firmly established on a creditable foundation in the London market. This system of paying from revenue for post-offices and the like is a strong factor in the economy which has marked our Federal system hitherto. Some years ago, I went into calculations, and I found that, notwithstanding that the object of borrowing is to relieve the tax-payers, yet they have actually paid more in interest than they would if ttvsy had paid for all their works from revenue. I have verified the figures for Victoria in particular, but the same remark applies in a greater degree to the other States, because Victoria has borrowed less per head. It is an extraordinary thing that what was meant to be a relief to the tax-payers has not been so in the long run. In conclusion, I feel that we have good reason for hopefulness in regard to Australia. A country with an oversea trade of £95,000,000, a trade per head of £ 2 3 9s. od., is one which, although it has only 4,000,000 people, is not to be despised. We have great troubles and great difficulties to face; we have our problems to solve, but there is no doubt that Australia is a country which is as likely to make ptogress as is any country in the world. I feel convinced that if the Treasurer could - see his way at the next election to put before the people a well-framed constitutional amendment-no t a partial or piecemeal one, but one which would enable a candidate to . say to the electors, "" Look, if you pass this, you will have the problem of States debts solved ""-it would be ratified.",75
725,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL,"Lang) [10.25] - As the usual hour for adjourning on Tuesday has arrived, I would ask the Treasurer to consent to progress being reported. Progress reported. House adjourned at zo.26 p.m.",75
