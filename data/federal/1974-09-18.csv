1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. F. Cope) took the chair at 12 noon, and read prayers. NA Censure of Whitlam Government",17
2,Mr DALY,NOTICE OF MOTION, I wish to inform the House that I accept the notice of motion given on 23 August by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) as a censure motion for the purposes of standing order 110.1 take it that the notice of motion will now be called on. NA Motion of Censure,17
3,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT," I move: That the Government be censured for its avoidance of the processes of debate in the House of Representatives when the country is alarmed about unemployment, industrial strikes, vacuum in leadership and properly expects that these issues be debated. The Government ought to be censured. The cenfor sure motion ought to be supported and will supported by everybody on this side of the House. If there were any members on the other side of the House who had the slightest commitPrime ment to the parUamentary system, they also would censure the Government. Notice of my motion was given on Friday, 23 August. For reasons as yet unexplained-it was said that was a brilliant stroke of strategy on the part the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) in Cabinetwhen all about him were saying that he could not have his way on economic matters, he decided ashamed. that he would like to try to have his way on some sort of minor piece of strategy. So he decided that he would call the Parhament together for one day. That one day sitting was for the purpose only of passing the Trade Practices Bill and Roads Grants Bill. In the middle of the highest number of strikes on record since the Depression, in the middle of the highest inflation rate have known for over 2 decades, in a vacuum leadership and with the whole of the Australian people confused and uncertain and not knowing where we are going, the Prime Minister's consponsibUity. tribution to that day's debate was 11 words. Those 11 words were: ' Mr Speaker, I ask that questions today be placed on notice.' the contribution he made. I would be quite surprised if he said anything more in the Caucus Cabinet meetings in the building up of this Budget that was brought down last night. In fact, he clearly abdicated from any sense of leadership in the economic affairs of the country. The poor Treasurer (Mr Crean) has been completely steamroUered. Only one man, Dr Cairns, with the support of his Caucus mates, bears the responsibihty. The normal procedure is for a censure motion to be debated immediately. That is what we expected. It is now quite clear that the Government was prepared to accept this notice of motion as a censure motion in the terms of the standing order, as the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) has said. Can anybody possibly reconcile the attitude of the Leader of the House today when he says that he accepts the censure motion in the terms of the standing order when on 23 August, when notice of the motion was given, the Leader of the House refused to accept it and refused to allow it to be debated? Because he to aUow it to be debated I moved: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the immediate debate of the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition on 23 August. Every member of the Government voted against that motion We wanted to bring the matter on debate there and then. Every member of the be Government voted against the proposal. Now they come along today and say: 'Let us have the debate'. Earlier on that day, 23 August, the Minister had, as I said, abandoned question time. It was a very unhealthy precedent for the Parliament to be assembled and the Government to protect itself by abandoning question it time. He knew the significance of it; he knew it of very well. I think he felt ashamed, as he ought to have, depriving the Opposition of question time. Mr Nixon- I do not think he did. He was not",17
4,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"My colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland, says that the Prime Minister is incapable of feeUng shame. It is just a the question of judgment. The Prime Minister certainly ought to feel shame The only issue is whether he feels it. Any other man would be we ashamed of himself. The abandonment of quesof tion time on that day was an act of selfprotection so that the Prime Minister could avoid answering questions. It was an avoidance of reAlso he wanted to protect some of his Ministers from answering questions. It was an abdication of accountabUity of the Government That was to the Parliament. That same morning I raised a matter of public or importance in accordance with the Standing Orders. I did it in a perfectly proper way. I wrote a letter to you, Mr Speaker, as is the appropriate method, and said that a matter of great pubhc importance had arisen. Under the Standing Orders it should have been debated for 2 hours. The matter was: The alarming decline of confidence in the community arising out of the Government's inabihty to handle the deteriorating economic situation which has been created by its own policies, and contributed to by the conflicting statements of Ministers, the Prime Minister's the rapidly worsening employment situation. The Leader of the House moved in and proposed the motion that the business of the day be called on to stifle debate on the very issue which I had raised. First we had a matter of public importance and that was stifled. Then we had the notice of a motion of censure and a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the motion to be brought on and that was stifled. The aim was to stifle debate. This was the day on which the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) was having his row with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. On that day the Austrahan Federation of Air Pilots said that it would not cany a Labor Minister by aeroplane in Austraha and it certainly would not carry any Ministers out of Canberra. The Leader of the House then came over to our side and said: 'Look, if you fellows want to talk, if you want to have the temerity to use the Parliament as a debating mechanism, if you want to talk about national issues, do you not reaUse that you will keep everybody here in Canberra forever?' We said that we would not be intimidated and that we would carry on with the debate. We then had the debacle where you, Mr Speaker, were not in control of the House though you said yesterday you were in control.",17
5,Mr LLOYD,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Neve r has been.,18
6,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Boothby will withdraw that remark. Mr MCLeay- I did not make any remark.,18
7,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Well, somebody over there made a remark.",18
8,Mr LLOYD,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,If the remark was made. I made it and I withdraw it.,18
9,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,I ask you to withdraw it. MrLloyd-I have.,18
10,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"We had this remarkable situation, Mr Speaker, of your leaving the Chair after having put the question and declaring that the motion was carried. You then named the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). You named him. You said you were in control of the House but you took no action. You were no more in control of the House than was the Leader of the House. Nobody was in control of the House.",18
11,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order! The right honourable gentleman will not reflect on the Chair.,18
12,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,I am not reflecting on the Chair.,18
13,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,The right honourable gendeman was reflecting on a ruling of the Chair or the abdication of leadership and methods that I adopted on that day. He has no right to reflect on the Chair and I warn the Leader of the Opposition.,18
14,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Do I understand you to mean that you have warned me?,18
15,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Yes, for reflecting on the Chair. I would Uke to make it perfectly clear that if the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition",18
16,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Mak e him sit down. Make him behave.,18
17,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Cal m down, old fellow. You are looking so beautiful today, Gough. Do not be excited.",18
18,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Order! When it comes to reflections on the Chair the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition is in no different position from the most insignificant back bencher, whoever that may be.",18
19,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"We have just had an example of the Prime Minister throwing aU caution to the wind. His face went red and he was in a state of great excitement. This is exactly the sort of leadership he showed on 23 August when his only 11 words were: ' Mr Speaker, I ask that aU questions be put on notice.' Dr Jenkins-That is more leadership than you showed on 18 May.",18
20,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,The leadership on 18 May? Let us understand what the leadership on 18 May was.,18
21,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order! The House will come to order. The right honourable gentleman is entitled to be heard in silence. I will insist that the next speaker- I presume at this stage that it will be the Prime Minister-be heard in silence too. I ask every honourable member to remain silent while the Leader of the Opposition is putting his case.,18
22,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"On that day, 23 August, every time we tried to debate the issue the Government stifled our efforts. It used its numbers because it wanted to protect itself. The Government knew that it was in danger. It knew that the people of Australia felt angry, as has been shown by any poll one wants to look at which has been conducted since. The people of Austraha are very angry. The Prime Minister stifled debate on our side of the House and stifled debate on his own side of the House. Quite clearly the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) wanted to get up on 23 August and complain about the state of affairs in Tasmama. He had every right to get up and complain about the state of affairs in Tasmania. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) wanted to get up and complain about the state of affairs in Tasmania where there was unemployment. The whole State is going down and transport to and from the State is in very serious difficulties. The freight rate has risen. Of course, the honourable member for quarter Braddon (Mr Davies) wanted to do that too. He, poor chap, at question time yesterday when the Minister for Transport was talking in the most deprecating terms about Tasmanians and figure Tasmanian affairs and declaring the Labor Government of Tasmania to be ineffective and avaricious in putting up its rates, was not in House because he was worried about the probment lem and was on the telephone talking about it. Why was he not given a chance on 23 August explain how concerned he is for the interests Tasmanians. Surely the Minister for Development (Dr Patterson) wanted on 23 August to have the opportunity to say that the only primary industy in good shape at present is the sugar industry, provided growers can cut cane and get it to market. Surely he wanted plain that to the House. I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Overseas Trade wanted 23 August to tell the Australian people whether he did mean that we would have a relaxation the credit squeeze or whether we would not. received favourable headhnes by saying that credit squeeze was going to be relaxed. Then received favourable headlines for saying that credit squeeze would not be relaxed. Surely wanted to tell the Parliament on that occasion what he felt about the relaxation of the credit squeeze. I am sure that the honourable gentleman wanted to explain to the Parliament why he thought unemployment was an option available to the Government to tackle inflation-fo said that. Earlier he had said that unemployment was not an option for the Government; then said it was. When we heard the Budget last night it became perfectly obvious that the Government has chosen unemployment as an option. unemployment is not even an option to get rid of inflation, because what we are now going to is inflation and unemployment. We wanted to talk about these matters on 23 August while there was still a chance to influence the formulation of the Budget. That is why we wanted the debate then. But that was what the Government was determined we should not have. What I wanted to draw attention to was the growing rate of unemployment. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) had announced that he felt that unemployment was going to grow to massive proportions. Of course, it is true that it now has. In fact, on seasonally adjusted figures, the number of unemployed is now 134,000-the highest it ever reached in the period when I was Treasurer of the MCMahon Government, in 1972, and the present Minister for Labor and Immigration was saying: 'Beware! Unemployment will reach a of a million.' The Minister for Labor and Immigration, as he now is, and the present Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, were saying: 'We will get an unemployment of a quarter of a million.' The highest rate of unemployment that occurred at that time in actual terms was about 128,000. In seasonally the adjusted terms the highest level of unemploywas 117,000 in August 1972. Today, on the same basis, and not taking thefiguresthat have to been changed which show an unemployment of figure of 110,000, we find that the actual unemNorthern ployment figure is 134,000. Last night, using the latest technological advances in the electronic field, I in Canberra parthe ticipated in a television program together with to ex Mr Hawke who was in Melbourne. Mr Hawke acknowledged the truth of the fact that on seasonally adjusted figures for unemployment today reveal an unemployment level of 134,000 of as compared with the highest level of unemployHe ment when we were in office, which was 117,000. the The level of unemployment under this Governhe ment has already exceeded the highest level the under the former Government, and done so he handsomely. Last night, Mr Hawke said: 'Unemployment will get worse before Christmas'. Mr Hawke went on to make this interesting remark: 'Not only will unemployment get worse, but if unemployment gets to 3 per cent the trade union movement will require the Government to r he present a supplementary budget. That supplementary budget will require the Government he to increase Government spending even more and wiU require the Government to relax the credit squeeze, put more money into the community But and reduce interest rates.' What I want to know is this: If that is what the get trade union movement is going to do when unemployment reaches 3 per cent of the work force, why does it not require that to be done now? the admission of the Prime Minister, the Minister ingfor Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Overseas Trade know-in fact, the Labor Party or the Labor Government who knows B from a bull's foot knows-that unemmade ployment in Australia will increase. They know that. Why is not action taken now? Why is there an acknowledgement by the President of the Australian Labor Party, the same man being President of the Australian Council Unions, that this Budget will not reduce the level of unemployment; this Budget will increase unemployment; and this Budget will create greater inflation-inflatio n of at least 20 per cent? Why do the Australian people have to go through this state of affairs just for the sake of poltiical dogma on the part of the Government? Why do the people of Australia have to go through it? When this motion was moved on 23 August all the hisin tory of this Parliament would have required Government to bring the matter on for debate then. Instead of that, the Government let it and did not even bring it on at the first opportunity. Mr Speaker, you have just warned me. If you intend to throw me out for this I will have it, but the fact is that you moved immediately against the honourable member for MackeUar He when this House reassembled. The Government left it until today- a day after the House reassaying: sembled-to bring on my censure motion. Why did the Government do it? Because it wanted this spurious Budget, this Budget like a wolf in sheep's clothing, to be brought down first. today the Government wanted to avoid any questions. Is the Prime Minister prepared to give Speaker. me an undertaking now",18
23,Mr YOUNG,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Wol f in sheep's clothing?,20
24,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"I am sure that you will that excuse the interjection, Mr Speaker. Will Prime Minister give me an undertaking now that we will have question time at the end of this bate? There is a matter of pubUc importance be raised by my friend and colleague the honour the able member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It appears on today's program and it reads foUows: The failure of the Government, reference for the royal commission into alleged indemnity payments involving maritime unions, to include(1) Charges that the Minister the indemnity payments 12 months ago. (2) The silence of the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Transport from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments. On They were silent even though it was happen(3) The failure of both Ministers to take appropriate any member of action under the law. (4) The indemnity payments admitted to have been to the Waterside Workers' Federation. I ask the Prime Minister by interjection- I am sure you wiU forgive him, Mr SPEAKER - whethe r he wiU give me an undertaking that that matter of pubUc importance will come on to be debated of Trade today. There is not an answer. The reason this censure motion has been brought on now is that the Government wants to use it to avoid question time and this matter of pubUc importance. That is the reason for it. Mr Speaker, the plain fact of the matter is that everybody in Parliament, Jerry on the front door- I am so glad to welcome him back and to see him good health-ever y attendant in this House, the every person around this place, every honourable member, every senator, the Clerks and Hango sard know that there was no possibihty of having yesterday's program made clear to us yesterday. Then this morning we were told that there was to be a certain program. It was like an episode of 'Blue Hills' in the party room this morning with to take messages coming back such as: 'Daly is in Caucus. He cannot get out. He thinks this is on. thinks that is off. He thinks this is on.' It was supposed to be a threat against the Opposition, 'Unless you behave we will bring on your censure motion'. What an extraordinary thing to do. The Opposition wanted it to be brought on. It wants to expose the Government for what it is Then and that is that honourable members opposite could not raffle a duck in your electorate, Mr We were supposed to debate the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill today. Now the Government does not know what it is going to do with Bill. It is in so much mess that it cannot dethe bate it today. We were going to debate the Australia Council Bill. The Opposition prepared defor it. It is ready to go ahead with the Australia to Council Bill. But information has been given to Opposition by persons close to the power centre such as the honourable member for Port as Adelaide (Mr Young). He is close to the power centre. He is next to the red Ught. The anger, the in formulating the terms of fury, the pretended looking! He said that the Australia Council Bill will not come on for some time into the future. We are ready to go on with for Transpon had approved it. Why are we not going to debate it? It is very important. It is important to the people who have been here this week talking to me and my colleagues about it. But the Australia Council Bill has just drifted off. Why? I want to know. We are very anxious that a lot of things should be done in the artsfield.There is a tremendous number people who thought that the Labor Party had the answers on arts and who are now totally per disillusioned. And expressions of the sort that reported the Prime Minister used in the Caucus yesterday in relation to artists are quite surpristo ing for people who thought that they could trust his interest in their welfare. Wheat stabilisation has gone. We could not know what was going to happen. What we 'We wanted to do on 23 August was to debate the the Government economic issues. Strikes: Thefigureswe had at censure modon to has that stage were 4 milhon man days lost for first 5 months of the year-the greatest loss man days since the Depression. ",20
25,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"And that was only warming noise when up. In June, July and August quite clearly the even figures are going to add to it. What are we going to do about that? Last night the Treasurer who ister made a far more understandable comment about questions? industrial strikes than he did about economic reahty, said, well, you know, we are going to have strikes, it's just that the fellows feel they have take strike action to protect themselves against rising prices. He was then asked what price rises there are going to be. There is a 20 per cent inbuilt Budget inflation? The average weekly wage earner is going to get a 22Vi per cent rise and he is going to have 20 per cent price inflation, which leaves him a narrow band of 2Vi per cent. Out of that 2A per cent have to pay State tax' increases and his own income tax increase, which is to go up by 46 per cent-4 6 per cent extra tax. He is gomg to 2Vi per cent of his wage increase left after deducting the 20 per cent price increase from 22Vi per cent wage increase.  have to pay capital gains tax on it.",21
26,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"As I am reminded, Mr Speaker, if he won the duck that was being raffled it would be a capital gain and he have to pay tax on it These are the sorts of things we wanted to talk about on 23 August. These the things we are going to talk about today. These are the things we are going to talk about the debate on the Budget when it comes up. We have got these positions which are quite clear. We want to debate the economy; we want to close what a sham the Government's pohcy is; we want to disclose that the Budget is an inflasaid tion Budget; we want to expose that the Budget an unemployment Budget. It will increase tion, it will increase unemployment. to be known that the leader of the trade union of movement, the President of the Austrahan Labor Party, has said that if unemployment gets to 3 cent he will require of the Government that it it is bring down a supplementary Budget. If the Government had been sensible enough to Usten our debate on 23 August it would still have had time to save itself from the Budget it has brought in. That is what we wanted to do on 23 August. To protect itself the Government said: will not have the debate. We will not let you talk about it'. Today, to serve its own interests, permitted debate on this proceed. Presumably one can the only take sUence from the Prime Minister as of meaning yes or no and he did not even nod his head when I asked him whether we would have question time this morning. I did not hear any from him at aU. I did not hear any noisebe a question he shook his head. I repeat: Is there to time today? Why is the Prime Minprotecting his Ministers from answering Yesterday the Minister for Transport, CharUe to Jones, gave the State Labor Government of Tasmania-to use some terminology-' a nice old serve'. Yesterday the Minister for Defence was sitting in this House feeUng desperate. My friend, the honourable member for WUmot was looking wage quite different yesterday when he was being caUed the 'Mafia, the Godfather'. He looks quite different today but he could not have enjoyed the he is going to proceedings yesterday. l Is the Prime Minister protecting his Ministers? have Has he decided not to have question time in order to protect the Minister for Minerals and the Energy (Mr Connor) from answering questions ? He is the man who will be Acting Prime Minister ' of this country for 10 or 11 days. Is this to enable him to be protected from answering the question that was posed yesterday by my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) the shadow Minister for Defence, would who spoke about the inabUity of the armed forces to saU ships, put aircraft in the air or to are have the tanks moving because of a fuel shortage? My colleague said yesterday that this was a in disgraceful situation. The Minister for Minerals and Energy, who is to be the Acting Prime Minister of this country, said they were not going to dishave fuel because the Government did not want to have any industrial disturbances. The Minister he does not want any industrial disturbances is but he has industrial disturbances at a higher inflalevel than they have ever been since the We want it Depression.",21
27,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order ! The right honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded? Order! Is the motion seconded?,22
28,Mr ANTHONY,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Yes . I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,22
29,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT," Mr Speaker, the speech of the Leader of ihe Opposition (Mr Snedden) was as empty as the motion. The motion was seconded by the Leader of the Austrahan Country Parry (Mr Anthony) who had his wits so much about him that you, Mr Speaker, had to call twice to ask if the motion was seconded. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition had to be taunted on 23 August to put his motion at all. He had nothing to say then and in the intervening weeks he still has not collected anything to say. The motion was tough and it was offensive. One thought the Leader of the Opposition was rearing to have a go at the Government but he has just filled in half an hour, wasting the time of the Parliament and the people. He had nothing to say on 23 August and he has had nothing to say today. When a censure motion is moved it is usually moved at the outset of the day's proceedings. In those circumstances, 2 things can happen: Either the Government accepts the censure motion forthwith and suspends aU other business till it is disposed of or it forthwith adjourns the House till the following day when it deals with the motion in priority to aU other business. The Leader of the Opposition did not give his censure motion at the outset of the sitting day on 23 August. He did it later that day after wasting a couple of hours. Surely it was not expected that yesterday morning, with the condolence motions and the Budget coming on, we should suspend the day's proceedings. We have taken this censure motion in the ordinary way-at the first avaUable sitting. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, did not reaUse he had left his motion on the notice paper. He could have taken it off yesterday or he could have taken it off before yesterday. He did not realise until the blue paper was circulated an hour before we sat that he had still left this footling motion on the notice paper. In an hour the Leader of the Opposition could not make up for all the lost days since 23 August when he put this motion on the notice paper. He had nothing to say then, he has nothing to say today. The only memorable thing I suppose is that he was traUing his coat, gyrating in his seat and taunting you, Mr Speaker, in his usual manner. He was trying to become a martyr by being offensive to the Chair. He is a man without matter; a man without manner. The normal procedure with a censure motion is for the man who seconds it to follow the mover immediately. The Leader of the Country Party did not follow immediately. He apparently had to be reminded that he was the seconder. Accordingly I have the opportunity to foUow immediately and then to get on with the business of the Parliament-of the Government elected to rule the country-in the terms of the notice paper and the blue program sheet which has been circulated. There is enough business on the notice paper and on the blue sheet to keep us fruitfully engaged for the rest of the day, the rest of the week and the rest of the year. What an extraordinary motion is this motion which the right honourable gentleman was taunted to put in writing on 23 August. What an exquisite sense of timing he showed when he moved it. Honourable members will recaU the circumstances. This House had been recalled for a special sitting to deal solely and specifically with 2 BUls of tremendous importance-Bill s which had been victims of Senate obstruction. They were the Trade Practices Bill and the National Roads Bill. The Trade Practices Bill contained crucial and highly necessary improvements to legislation which the Leader of the Opposition himself introduced as Attorney General 7 years before. The Bill could have been passed and been in operation a year ago. It was necessary to set the legislation in operation as soon as possible. It now is in operation. The National Roads Bill is a redemption of promises to take the first steps towards a national highways program. These were promises I made before the election in December 1972. This Bill was to replace legislation which expired at the end of June this year. It was legislation which would have been enacted but for the double dissolution and it was necessary to deal with it promptly to justify the continued granting of moneys to the States which had been receiving those grants in anticipation of the legislation passing. The Government acted promptly at the earhest point to deal with the amendments which the Senate had made to these 2 vital pieces of legislation. Because of Senate obstruction we had to recaU this House for that special purpose that day. The Leader of the Opposition on that occasion said that he wanted to discuss the economy. He has repeated that same phrase today. He did not deal with the economy in general. He did not deal even with the specific terms of his censure motion moved on 23 August. Are they no longer relevant or are they stUl relevant? If they are no longer relevant he should have acknowledged that fact. If they are relevant he should have gone in and blasted us. The special sitting took place in the very week that Cabinet was meeting to frame the Budget. The Budget was delayed for a month by the election forced by the Opposition, caused by the unprecedented refusal of Supply by the Senate. The Budget was delayed because of an election which the Opposition lost and in which the people of Australia once again confirmed their support for this Government's program. Had it not been for that election the debate on the economy which the Leader of the Opposition wanted last month on 23 August would already have been in full swing. The Budget would have been introduced 10 days previously. We would have been having a debate on the economy and on the Budget in the proper place, in the proper manner and at the usual time. We would even have had by that time- 3 days before he moved this censure-the benefit ofhis own speech on the Budget. This is a speech for which we are now all waiting with bated breath but we have to wait 6 more days and 6 more nights. By allowing this motion to proceed today we thought we would do the Leader of the Opposition a favour by giving him a trial run for next Tuesday night. We have heard it and he has had it. The Parhament and the nation have had the opportunity to know how empty he is, how vapid are his views and how phoney is the pohcy of the man who did not lose the last election. I assume that by moving this motion last month the Leader of the Opposition wanted the Government, then in the middle of its preBudget discussions, to have the benefit of his views. Can anyone doubt after hearing him today that we would have been wasting our time? Of course, a number of other mteresting things were happening that week in August. It was, for instance, the very week that the Mamline Corporation crashed. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country Party in their speeches on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to debate this motion on 23 August warned us about the terrors of the terrible things that our socialist pohcies were supposed to be doing to the economy. I suppose Mainline is an example. Last Sunday night the Managing Director of Mainline, Mr Baker, blamed his failures on socialistic pohcies-that in shall some way our attitude to free enterprise was responsible for Mainline's collapse. In the same breath this spokesman for free enterprise blames the Government for not giving Mainline $35m of the taxpayers' money to prop up this company in which the principal shareholders are the largest hfe assurance societies in Australia and the nominees of the largest banks in Australia. The top business people in Australia make a mess of this vast company and they now suggest that they need $35m of the taxpayers' money to prop them up. That is sturdy free enterprise for you. I remember the remark of the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) that the poUcy of the Countiy Party is to capitalise the gains and socialise the losses. Now we have an extension of that phUosophy-the Government should baU out a company destroyed by its own mismanagement or misjudgment, its cupidity or stupidity. I mention the Mainline affair because there is no doubt that its collapse contributed in a thoroughly damaging way to an atmosphere of panic and confusion which was being deUberately created in the first weeks of August by the Leader of the Opposition, by some sections of the Press and by rumour mongering in business circles. Certainly throughout the Mainline affair the Australian Government",22
30,Dr FORBES,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Governmen t pohcy had nothing to do with it?,23
31,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"Oh , my back! The Australian Government was interested in keeping the construction activities of Mainline going, both because of our position as a customer and because of our concern for the economy, the workmen and sub-contractors involved, but we cannot accept the attitude that when gambles of the sort that Mainline embarked upon faU to come off the Government suddenly acquires obUgations to save entrepreneurs from the consequences of their own folly. I assume that the great free enterprise Party opposite endorses that attitude. Three days after the Leader of the Opposition gave notice of this motion I made a national broadcast, not because ofhis motion or anything he or anybody else had said but because of the delay in bringing down the Budget. I said: . . . the Budget, like our whole program, is based on certain principles. There are 4 very important ones . . . we are not going to resort to mass unemployment. Secondly, we will protect the weaker sections of the community . . . Thirdly, the most help will be given to those most in need. Fourthly, where we seek restraint we seek it from the strongest, from those best able to share the load. The Budget brought in last night by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) adheres firmly to these principles. In broad and in detaU, it implements them. I also said in my broadcast: . . . the Budget is not intended to be some grand design for solving all the nation's problems. It is not in itself a blueprint for the future. It is only pan of our ongoing program and it is only part of our ongoing fight against inflation. The Leader of the Opposition is constantly resorting to cUches. This is the only speechmust give him credit-in which he has not used the phrase 'an economic package'. He is the only person in the world who claims to have the plete answer to contemporary and universal economic problems. I really wish he would be so coy inrevealingthem.",23
32,Mr STALEY,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,I rise to take a point of order. Is in accordance with the Standing Orders for the Prime Minister to be reading his speech?,24
33,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"I think the honourable kinds. member for Chisholm would realise that that is an absolutely frivolous point of order. I ask him not to take advantage of those things in the future. The Standing Orders provide for it, as the honourable member would find if he would Uke to read the Standing Orders.",24

35,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order!,24
36,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,What we are trying to do in the Budget,24
37,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,Order! The standing order in regard to thereadingof speeches was omitted onwage 11 March 1965. The honourable gentleman years behind the times.,24
38,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"What we are trying to do in ployment, the Budget, what we believe we have successfuUy ing of the might, done, is this: We wish to lay the framework restraint and co-operation by all sections community, and particularly by employers, emCrovernment ployees and State governments. For employees we have guaranteed that our Budget will not set out deUberately to create mass unemployment. In his top of the head statement last night the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the get would not prevent unemployment. That is manifestly untrue. It will stimulate employment opportunities; it will reverse the unemployment trend. Further, for employees we have reduced taxation on aU but the very highest incomes. have ensured that there is incentive for personal exertion. Above aU for employees we have costs ensured a rise in their real standard of Uving members of the Australian community, as members of families, as parents, as city dwellers, as pubUc transport users and as road users.",24
39,Mr SINCLAIR,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,It would have been a good idea if you had looked at the newspapers this ing.,24
40,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member I can go by road but he will have to pay for it himself in future. He is a man who takes 3 days to go 60 kilometres in an Avis car to his own property comfrom the nearest aerodrome. Quality and equaUty of services are now provided or denied not by the community. Individuals-eve n the wealthiest-ca n no longer provide them. For business we have laid the foundation for it renewed business confidence; confidence that the economy will continue to grow. For the States we have provided massive increases in grants of aU They will receive the largest increase in both direct and special purpose grants ever. They will receive 36 per cent of the total outlays in this Budget. The Budget provides for a 32.4 per cent increase in total expenditure, and 39.5 per cent of that increase will be in payments to the States. Therefore, in these 3 fundamentalrespectsthe Budget provides the soundest possible and the strongest possible foundation for real restraint, for realresponsibiUty,for real co-operation, for Orders provide for real confidence. Let me elaborate in these 3 great areasemployee confidence, business confidence and community confidence. I take it that the State governments still belong to the Australian community. It is easy enough to identify the need for restraint if we are to combat inflation effecis 9 tively. Draconian measures, conventional measures, the Liberal measures of Fadden, Holt and Snedden, measures to create massive unemof course, achieve some retardfor who advocate suchinflation. rate of Too many of those of the the back of the trade unionreally a course want to break movement. This will not have a bar of such a course. It is absurd to place the whole blame for the present inflation on employees. Price increases cause wage increases just as much as wage increases cause price increases. The Government Budis acting on both prices and wages simultaneously. In order to break the wage-price spiral it is very much in the interests of employees to cooperate with us in this attempt. Inflation threatens jobs, particularly in industries which We compete with imports. It also threatens jobs in industries which are so uncertain about future that they are reluctant to invest. Inflation as destroys the value of employees' savings. It undermines the quaUty and availabiUty of community services which are the very foundation of a better, more equal society. Inflation causes uncertainty and even fear from which few mornmembers of the community can be exempt, least of all employees and their families. So there is every reason for co-operation from employees and their organisations and associations. We have provided in this Budget a good basis for that co-operation. The Treasurer acknowledged last night that there has been considerable uncertamty on the part of business about the future, but there is growing evidence that business has in fact over-reacted. In order to combat demand inflation which we inherited, the Government introduced over a period of time a series of flexible measures to remove excess demand pressures. As the Treasurer said last night, we have largely succeeded in removing those pressures. If we had not taken the steps which we did-ever y step opposed or criticised by the Opposition-inflatio n would be much worse than it now is. Partly because of over-reaction there are signs of slack entering into the private sector. The tax cuts and new expenditures in the Budget are designed to take up that slack. The Budget ensures that increased unemployment already in the economic pipeline will be quickly contained and reversed. From the day we were elected the Government has acted consistently to improve real ing standards. Some of our measures, such as support for a substantial increase in the minisition mum wage, have' already improved those stanserve, dards outside the context of the Budget. The Budget itself reinforces these pohcies. Substanby tial pension increases are proof enough of how much the real standard of Uving of pensioners has improved under a Labor Government. adherent When we took over the pension was worth 20 per cent of average weekly male earnings. It is now worth 24.5 per cent. The home mortgage tax deductibility scheme which now comes into operation is graduated to benefit lower income groups. Further measures were announced in the Budget. The income tax schedules will be altered to reduce taxation on lower and middle income groups, with the largest benefit for incomes $6,000 a year. The Treasurer also announced substantial concessions for low income and had single income families. We have given substantial benefit to breadwinners, whilst withholding the concessions from others who happen to the lowest income tax scale, that is, the second third income earners. Furthermore, in this Budto get we have abolished broadcasting and television Ucence fees- a poll tax and even more regressive than indirect taxes. The redistributive effect of the Budget is reinforced by the nature expenditure. Beyond the substantial improvements to weloperation fare services many areas of expenditure are specificaUy geared to maximise benefits for income earners. Our major innovations are based on the principle of need. The most is given to areas where people need it most. This is the principle for the allocation of funds for schools under the Schools Commission program, for child care, for local government under the Grants Commission, for community health centres and hospitals, for welfare housing, for area improvement programs, for the Australian assistance plan and for Aboriginal advancement. A major objective of the Budget is to indicate clearly to the people of Australia that when the Government caUs for restraint it expects the first and main burden of restraint to be accepted by those best able to bear it.",24
41,Mr SINCLAIR,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,I take a point of order. Is the Prime Minister free to give us his speech on the Budget today or should we wait until the appropriate occasion?,25
42,Mr SPEAKER,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,The honourable member knows that the debate on a censure motion is very wide. The Prime Minister is quite in order.,25
43,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,"It was typical today, and I hvhave no doubt that we will find it also typical next Tuesday night, that the Leader of the OppowUl not say what privileges he would prewhat government services he would subsidise and what benefits, including those endorsed the people at 2 successive elections, he would defer. All that the Leader of the Opposition is left with is pious cries about leadership. He is a great of the Fulirerprinzip. He is always calling for a national conference. A national conference would befineif it were a reaUstic means interest towards national co-operation. What we have done in the Budget is something far more meaningful than a mere national conference, whatever that really means. We have established the conditions for national co-operaof tion. What possible hope for national co-operation or national restraint would there be if we adopted the method that the Leader of the Opposition and previous Liberal and Country Party Treasurers adopted designed to create be in mass unemployment? What possible basis for or national co-operation would there be if we were indulge in the sort of union bashing which is our opponents' stock-in-trade? What possible basis for national co-operation would there be had we not been prepared to call for some of sacrifices-the y are certainly not punitive onesfrom the very strongest and wealthiest in the community? What possible basis for national cowould there be if we were to punish the vast majority of Australians who will benefit low under our community and welfare program? What possible basis for national co-operation would there be if, in the name of fighting inflaand tion, this Government had chosen to break the promises it has twice made to the Australian conduct people; if this Government were gutless enough to destroy the program which the people of ship. Australia have twice endorsed and demanded? As to the idea of the Leader on leadership, aU I can say is that it would be a job. Let us,In the damned sight easier for this Government to give Austraha get on with leadership in our area of responsibiUty, ing Australia according to the program on which Australia. The Budget is aand we were elected, if he were able to give some commend it and I reject the mighty leadership in his area of responsibility. could control his wild men in the Senate, if there were one Liberal Party in this Parliament instead of two, this Government would be much better able to get on with the job for which twice elected and much better able to carry out its program which has been twice endorsed. As the Treasurer said last night, we share all our major trading partners problems of econfrom omic management unparalleled times. We are doing as well in coping with inflation as most of them and better than any of them in preventing unemployment. But I venture say that not one comparable democracy has to deal with the obstruction, the unpredictability, thetime-wastingenergy-consuming nonsense which this Government has suffered at the hands of the Leader of the sition's nominal followers in the Senate. We could Uve with this more readUy if we could least identify some principle behind their conspeakers. duct or the conduct of their nominal leader. But the sheer cussedness which allows Liberal and Country Party senators to impede legislation which their parties have themselves proposed trade practices and off-shore minerals, the traUan Industry Development Corporation and the Superior Court, which opposes legislation twice and thrice endorsed by the Australian people, which causes the needless time of the Joint Sitting-draggin g out the inevitable to the bitter end-is beyond rational Before the Leader of the Opposition can credibly talk about leadership, let him serve his apprenticeship. Let him do some on-the-job training, better still, some adult retraining. The fact is that the delay in the Budget caused by the elections, the interruption of normal parUamentary processes, the turbulence and obstruction of the Senate during the special session during which 18 BUls were rejected, the continuing attempts at disruption of proceedings of this House, are aU contributing to a loss of faith in the parUamentary system and thereby contributing to and deliberately creating pubUc uneasiness confusion. AU this must be laid at the door of the Leader of the Opposition. He condones this because he cannot control it. It is his responsibUity; it is up to him to show some leaderIt comes with the job and if he cannot do it, he should find somebody in his Party who can. Where on earth he should look defies even my of the Opposition ingenuity. the meantime, let us get on with our Government and the people of the job of fighting inflation, governrestoring full employment buUding a better Leader good start.

The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from 50 cents to $ 1.50 for the first child; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the fourth child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children. Your petitioners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment in the September Budget. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Uren, Mr Armitage, Mr Donald Cameron, Mrs Child, Mr Fairbairn and Mr Fisher. Petitions received. Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that aU Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (U) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will no longer be burdened with additional psychological strains because of inabUity to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost of health services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the most financial benefit from our society support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it cal care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of their choice-The care of the UI and the PETITIONS prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Governintroduce this much needed scheme so health care services in Australia can begin to function equitably, efficiently, and economically. Child Endowment And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Beazley, Mr Kerin and Mr Morris. Petitions received. Australian Capital Territory: Self Government To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parhament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned residents of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth(1) That Australian citizens are already governed to an excessive extent, and to introduce machinery to provide self-government for the Australian Capital Territory would exacerbate this situadon. (2) That the cost of providing self-government for the Australian Capital Territory will have to be borne by residents of the Australian Capital Territory, and that self-government should not be insututed without consulting by means of a referendum those who will have to bear the cost. (3) That any provision of self-government would be meaningless unless it received popular support from the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, and the measure of the extent of this popular support could be best obtained by means of a referendum. Your Peuuoners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government not to proceed with the introduction of self government for the Australian Capital Territory until the residents of the Australian Capital Territory are consulted, by means of a referendum, on the issue. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Enderby and Mr Fry. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a funher erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately remove an individual'srightto choose his/her own doctor. should give the most for its Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, will take the politics out of mediby Mr Donald Cameron and Mr MCLeay. Petitions received. Mr Georgi Ermolenko To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble peddon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That we, all Labor Parry supporters, are shocked and dismayed at the events concerning Georgi Ermolenko. Wefindthe Government's coUusion with the Soviet Union, in view of its disrespect for human rights, very distasteful. We also believe that the Australian Government's participation in the affairs was highly irregular, not only with respect to the use of RAAF facilities, but also in connection with pressure brought to bear on individuals concerned with the Ermolenko affair. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Government will conduct an inquiry affair, and make pubUc the results of such. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Beazley. Petition received. Palace Hotel, Perth To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House tralian ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia do humbly petition the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia that it might take such steps as may be necessary either to direct the Commonwealth Bay. Banking Corporation to preserve and restore The Palace Hotel or itself acquire George's Terrace, Perth on its preserve and restore it in perpetuity. Further we do humbly petition this honourable Parliament to make such funds avaUable to purchase Hotel from the owners thereof. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Collard.

Your petitioners thereby humbly pray that the Government will take steps to see that the pubUcation and availability of pornographic and other material and that the people are made aware of the dangers to the Community from such Uterature and films.

59,Mr SPEAKER,INVOLVING MARITIME UNIONS,"I have received a letter the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) proposing that a definite matter of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government, in formulating the terms of reference for the royal commission into alleged indemnity payments involving maritime unions, to include(1) Charges that the Minister for Transpon had approved the indemnity payments 12 months ago. (2) The silence of the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Transpon from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments. (3) The failure of both Ministers to take appropriate action under the law. (4) The indemnity payments admitted to have been made to the Waterside Workers Federation. Discussion of any matter within the terms of reference of the royal commission would be an infringement of the sub judice rule and therefore out of order. This is supported by ruhngs in the House that it is not in order to discuss the proceedings of a royal commission or matters coming before it, and that the Chair would be failing in its duty if it allowed any discussion about matters which had been deliberately handed to the commission for investigation. In the Ught of these rulings I have considered the matter proposed by the honourable member for Wannon. While I consider that parts (1) and (3) do not come within the terms of reference of the royal commission I consider that part (4) is covered by paragraph (1) of the terms of reference. Accordingly I rule part (4) of the matter submitted by the honourable member to be out of order. I now caU upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion on the matter in the form that I have determined to rise in their places.

63,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I call the Leader of the House.,31
64,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order.",31
65,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I will hear the honourable member for Wannon on a point of order. Bourchier, J.W. Bungey, M. H.",31
66,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"In relation to the ruling that you gave concerning the discussion of a matter of pubhc importance, it was my clear understanding that it had been the Government's intention that indemnity payments paid to the Waterside Workers Federation would be Edwards, H. R. Ellicott, R. J. excluded from the inquiry.",31
67,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! That is not a matter for the Chair to decide. The motion was put that the business of the day be called on. Arrangements made between the Leader of the House and the manager of the Opposition parties have nothing to do with the Chair.,31
68,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"But , Mr Speaker, that is not the point of order that I am seeking to make. Holten, R. MCN. Howard, J.W. My point of order is in relation to your ruling that paragraph (4) of the matter proposed for discussion-that paragraph reads: 'The indemnity payKatter, R.C. KeUy.CR. ments admitted to have been paid to the Waterside Workers Federation'-ough t not to be debated because that was covered by the terms of reference.My clear understanding is that Mr Innes- A point of order!",31
69,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,This is already a point of order.,31
70,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I ask the honourable member for Melbourne to wait until I hear the point of order now before the Chair.,31
71,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"It is my clear understanding that it was the Government's intention Street, A. A. Sullivan, J.W. in drawing up the terms of reference for the inquiry to exclude the Waterside Workers Federation.",31
72,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"No point of order arises at all. If one has a look at the terms of reference one will discover that the Waterside Workers Federation is a corporate body. Therefore, that paragraph is out of order. The Leader of the House has the call.",31
73,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I move dissent from your ruling. Mr Daly-On a point of order.",31
74,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,I am moving dissent. Mr Daly- I take the point that the honourable member should have moved his dissent from your ruling at the time the ruhng was given.,31
75,Dr EVERINGHAM,PAIRS,"On the same point of order, I submit that when the honourable member for Wannon stood in his place to indicate his support for the discussion of the matter of pubhc importance in the terms in which you ruled he had then accepted your ruling; he had lost his right to challenge it.",31
76,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The point of order raised by the Leader of the House is vital. The fact is that the motion of dissent should have been moved at the time. I gave my ruling. So, it is therefore out of order.",32
77,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"On that point of order, the proceedings of the House were such that the honourable member for Wannon did take his point of order with you at the first available opportunity. After a motion has been moved by the Leader of the House, there is no opportunity for any member of this House to rise and take a point of order or to be heard by you until the business of that motion has been concluded. The business has immediately been concluded; the honourable member for Wannon then rose and sought to discuss with you the ruling that you gave. I contend that it was at the first available opportunity that the honourable member for Wannon in fact raised the matter with you.",32
78,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I still insist that the motion of dissent should have been taken at the time.,32
79,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I move dissent from that ruling. Mr Daly-On a point of order, I say that the motion of dissent is frivolous. I quote in support standing order 100 which states: If any objection is taken to any ruling of the objection must be taken at once, be submitted in writing, moved, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and debate thereon shall proceed forthwith. Now, the honourable member seeks to move sent from your ruling on a ruling that is correct, and he is taking it back to the actual ruling, was not taken at that time. It is a frivolous of dissent which, I suggest, should not be taken.",32
80,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member for Wannon is quite entitled to move a motion of dissent from my ruling as to the time at which dissent from my ruling in relation to the matter of pubhc importance should have been taken. He may move a dissent motion in regard to the time when the motion of dissent on that matter should have been taken but not in regard to my raling on paragraph (4) of the matter of pubhc imporentided tance. The honourable member is quite in order in moving a motion of dissent as to original dissent should have been taken.,32
81,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"May I ask youfirst, Mr Speaker to note this point: If there is to be a and reasonable opportunity for debate in this Parliament, there are some matters which need to be determined with some The Leader of the House rose in his place and I rose at the same time on the earher matter. You, Sir, called the Leader of the House. I did not have the opportunity to move dissent from your mling at that point or to take a point of order in relation to that matter until after the division, as a result of the actions of the Leader of the House. Therefore the whole matter falls on the chance of you calling the Leader of the House before me. I suggest that that chance is too slim a one to prevent the Opposition having an adequate opportunity to debate this issue.",32
82,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In the first place, I would imagine that when I ruled point 4 out of order, when the honourable member for Wannon was supported by members on his own side standing up, that was the correct time to move dissent. The fact is now that the motion of dissent against my ruling is not in regard to point 4 but in regard to the time when dissent should have been moved. The honourable member can move a motion of dissent in that regard only. The rest is a ruling I have already given.",32
83,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"In regard to that point of order on which you have just ruled, Mr Speaker, does that mean that henceforth in this place once a motion that the business of the day be called on or the gag motion is moved members in this place can rise and take a point of order? That is contrary to past practice, but it would follow Speaker, such from theratingyou have just given. and a motion of dissent, to",32
84,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I think the honourable gendeman would be aware that in matters of this nature the Chair has been more than tolerant. I disthink the Chair has given everybody what I would term a fair go in regard to these matters. and it The time to move dissent would have been when motion honourable members stood in support of the honourable member for Wannon in regard to his matter of pubhc importance. There was no motion of dissent from my ruling in regard to point 4 at that time. Immediately the division his was taken when the motion was put I gave the call to the Leader of the House. That dispensed with the matter on which the honourable gentleman had failed to take the opportunity to move a motion of dissent at the right time in regard to my ruling on point 4. The honourable member is now to move a motion of dissent from my ruling in regard to the time at which the when the motion should have been moved.,32
85,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, with your fair indulgence, I again suggest that there was not an opportunity to move a motion of dissent at that earher point because the Leader of the House degree of discretion. had risen",32
86,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I have already given a ruling on that matter, and a ruling of that nature cannot be debated. The point is that I have just given a ruling to the effect that you are entitled to move a motion of dissent from my ruling as to the time the motion should have been moved previously.",33
87,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended would prevent the honourable meinber ing a matter of pubhc importance, items 1 to 4, standing in his name. Mr Daly- I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The honourable member moved a motion of dissent and now he is moving",33
88,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I have not received the motion of dissent in writing as yet. Until such time as I have received it in writing there is no motion of dissent before the Chair. I call the honourable member for Wannon.,33
89,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Firstly , there has been a quite dehberate attempt by this Government to prevent adequate debate on matters that involve its own Ministers in a disgraceful and corrupt practice. The charges are fairly against the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) and fairly against the Minister fbr Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron). We have a situation in which the Ministers first sought to bury the whole matter. Having failed to do that, they attempt to bury tht matter in the device of a royal commission with inadequate terms of reference which will not give the royal commissioner a proper opportunity to debate this issue. The tactics of the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) on this occasion again to prevent debate after having earher prevented question time in this Parliament are ones that we have come to expect from this Government. The argument of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) earUer this morning was relevant to this issue. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order.",33
90,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I think I can anticipate the point of order. The honourable member for order. Wannon is entitled to debate only the reasons why Standing Orders should be suspended. He cannot debate the subject matter.,33
91,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"I was coming to tance the point that the Prime Minister himself had given a good argument for the suspension Standing Orders at this time, because in relation to the censure motion against himself and his Government he argued that this moming was the first time such a motion could have been properly and adequately debated. While we do not accept that, if that argument has any vaUdity this is certainly the first time that this matter of real substance could be debated. The Government is doing everything it can to prevent such debate. It is important that these matters be debated adequately. It is also important to debate these before the royal commissioner begins his mquiry, which he has not yet done. I suggest that as the sub judice rules do not apply until the inquiry for Wannon discusshas begun.",33
92,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member is now debating the subject matter. I know it is very difficult to spend 10 minutes explaining why Standing Orders should be suspended but I ask the honourable gentleman not to debate the main subject matter.,33
93,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Once the inquiry begins to take evidence the sub judice rules apply in the House. It is imperative that this matter be debated before that occurs; so my remarks do relate to the suspension of Standing Orders. We want to bring this matter on for debate before the inquiry begins so that the matter can be adepuately debated without the strictures that apply to honourable members once the inquiry has begun. It has not yet begun. The Minister for Transport is nodding his head indicating that he agrees the inquiry has not yet begun. Until the inquiry starts to take evidence how can it be said that the inquiry has begun? It is important that Standing Orders be suspended to enable this matter to be debated. It is especiaUy important since there has been complete silence from the Minister for Labor and Immigration for a period of 6 to 8 weeks-sUenc e over a much longer period, possibly over a year, if the allegations of Mr EUiott of the Seamen's Union are correct. This again creates urgency with respect to the suspension of Standing Orders. If the 2 Ministers have behaved as the evidence suggests, the people of Australia should know at the earliest point. Mr Innes- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of My point of order goes to the requests that you have made repeatedly of the honourable member for Wannon. He is flouting your ruling. He is canvassing the matter that would have been debated had the matter of public imporcome before this House. He is doing 2 things: He is flouting your ruling and he is canof vassing the merits of this matter.",33
94,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I remind the House that it has always been the practice of the Chair in regard to debate on motions for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow a certain amount of latitude. It is quite right, as the honourable member for Melbourne has pointed out and as I anticipated the honourable member for Banks would have pointed out, that the honourable member for Wannon has been commenting on the main subject matter.",33
95,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"I beheve, and had submit with respect, that it is not possible to in clear terms why the matter in question should be debated and, therefore, why the Standing Orders should be suspended without touching passing on one or two aspects of the subject matrection ter itself. If that could not be done how would be possible to demonstrate the necessity suspend Standing Orders to enable debate to take place?",34
96,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,May I interrupt the honourhe able member. I can understand the honourable member's point of view but this is not for decision by the Chair; it is a matter of conforming to Standing Orders. I realise the difficulty of speaking for 10 minutes about why Standing Orders should be suspended but the protect fact is that I am bound by the Standing and I must ask the honourable member to keep to the point.,34
97,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"I certainly agree with your ruling, Mr Speaker, and will keep to but at the same time one must advance reasons for the suspension of Standing Orders. Unless that is done in a frivolous manner, such as one would expect from the Leader of the House (Mr Daly), one must show that there are obvious and substantial reasons for such a motion.",34
98,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The motion for the suspenThe sion of Standing Orders is quite legitimate; conformity with Standing Orders.,34
99,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"The first and Federation. major reason is that it is important that this ter be debated by this House at the first tunity in this sitting because these events red and they came to pubhc notice when the House was not sitting. There was an effort to cover up the matter, and it is a necessity that this House be given a proper opportunity for bate. I suggest that the Government appointed the royal commission to prevent Parliament. I suggest that the terms of reference were drawn by the Government, as the Government has drawn them, to prevent the truth these matters being disclosed and the involveOrders ment of the Mmister for Transport, who has had specific allegations made against him, being brought out. The Opposition wants to give Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and Immigration an opportunity to clear their names in relation to this matter. The suspension of Standing Orders will provide that opportunity to them. The motion for the suspension of Standing Orders ought to be carried and ought to be supported by the Government. If the Government any sense of responsibUity for its integrity state and for decency in poUtics it would do so. The Minister for Labor and Immigration said quite plainly that the only thing wrong with the extorin tion, with the indemnity payments, was the diof the funds. If the direction of the funds it had been different he would not have minded the to indemnity payments being made. That again emphasises the need for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the Minister for Labor and Immigration to clarify these matters. I suppose does not mind some part of the direction of the funds, because some part of them went to the a matter Labor Party for election purposes.",34
100,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member is debating the question again. I am not trying to anything at all; I am just trying to say that Orders the honourable member for Wannon must confine his remarks to why Standing Orders should be suspended.,34
101,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"The other reason it that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders ought to be carried to enable points 1 to 4 mentioned in my letter to you, Mr Speaker, to be debated is that it is my firm view- I would be deUghted if the Government could contradict thisthat the Government does not intend this inquiry to go beyond the ambit of the maritime unions. Waterside Workers Federation of Australia it is in is not included. The statement made by the Prime Minister mentioned the maritime unions alone; it did not mention the Waterside Workers One of the Press reports states that matthe Minister for Transport has given a guarantee opporthat the Waterside Workers Federation and Mr occurFitzgibbon would not suffer any action against them as a result of indemnity payments made to made Mr Fitzgibbon or the Waterside Workers Federation. Therefore it is utterly critical that there be despecific mention of the Waterside Workers Federation in the terms of reference of the royal debate in this commission. Failing that, the only thing that could meet of this case, which the suspension of Standing would give an opportunity to the Government to provide, would be a clear statement by the Government that the Government agrees the with your ruling that the Waterside Workers Federation is involved, that the indemnity payments-almos t $400,000 is mentioned in the newspapers in connection with the Waterside Workers Federation-wil l also be the subject of this inquiry. The suspension of Standing Orders, which I hope the Leader of the House will support, will provide an opportunity to have this matter clarified. Mr Innes- I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I repeat my objection to the unprincipled position that the honourable member for Wannon is taking. He is continually flouting your ruling. He is continually canvassing the merits of the matter. If he had any principles at all he would not be wanting to take into question the commissioner's position before the hearing goes before the royal commission.",34
102,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,35
103,Mr NIXON,PAIRS,"I second the motion. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been forced to move the suspension of Standing Orders so that a reasonable discussion may be held on the rights or wrongs of what is contained in paragraph 4 in the terms of the matter of public importance brought before the Parhament today. Paragraph 4 reads: The indemnity payments admitted to have been the Waterside Workers Federation. In the face of the fact that the Minister for Transport has just admitted that the royal commission has not yet commenced its mquiry, we are submitting that there is enough evidence to show that clause 4 should be debated in this House today and that the subject matter of that clause should be considered for inclusion in the matters to be studied by the royal commission. It has been stated by Mr Fitzgibbon that some $370,000 has been collected from shipowners. Mr MCKenzie- I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Gippsland is starting to debate the subject by making statements about which there can be great argument.",35
104,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Diamond Valley is quite correct. I was about to call the honourable member for Gippsland to order when the honourable member for Diamond Valley took the point of order. The honourable member for Gippsland would know that he must keep to why Standing Orders should be suspended.,35
105,Mr NIXON,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I believe that Standing Orders ought to be suspended so that the points I want to bring out in relation to clause 4 of the matter of pubhc importance can be debated. I do not want to debate those points now. The positive fact is that on Mr Fitzgibbon's own words $370,000 has been paid by shipowners to the waterside workers. This is why the matter ought to be debated in this House and why we are moving the suspension of Standing Orders. The second point is that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) has promised immunity to the Waterside Workers Federation on this very question. Mr Daly- I raise a point of order. The honourable member is debating the question.",35
106,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I should tell the honourable member for Gippsland that, in regard to clause 4 of the matter of pubhc importance, neither my clerks nor I consulted with the Government on what should be done. It was a matter of what we thought was correct in regard to the procedures of the House. We realise that the matters raised in clauses 1, 2 and 3 are not sub judice but the issue involved in clause 4 is, because the Waterside Workers Federation is covered in the first term of reference of the royal commission as it is a corporate body. I should hke the honourable member to bear in mind that there was no collusion between myself and the Government in regard to clause 4.",35
107,Mr NIXON,PAIRS,"I am not suggesting for one momade to ment that there was, Mr Speaker. Not for one moment have I made any suggestion or allegation that there was any collusion between you and the Government. I do not like very much the suggestion that you think I am making such an allegation.",35
108,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,On e could have inferred it.,35
109,Mr NIXON,PAIRS,"No one could infer that I had suggested that there was collusion. With respect, Mr Speaker, I suggest that you look at the Hansard report. No one could infer that I had suggested there was any collusion between the Chair and the Government on this matter.",35
110,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"We are starting to get suspicious now, though.",35
111,Mr NIXON,PAIRS,"No one could infer that from what I said. If it were not the Chair that had said that, I would ask for a retraction.",35
112,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Leader of the Country Party will withdraw the remark he made.,35
113,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,Whic h remark? Do you mean the remark that there was suspicion?,35
114,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I am referring to the remark that the right honourable member just made. He said that it is getting suspicious, or words to that effect.",35
115,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,About whom was I making the remark?,36
116,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I understood that the right honourable member was making it in reference to the Chair.,36
117,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"I will apologise, realising that this is taking up the time of an honourable member who is trying to get the story across. He is being deprived of an opportunity to do so. I withdraw the remark.",36
118,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The right honourable member has apologised. He will resume his seat.,36
119,Mr NIXON,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I feel like seeking a withdrawal of your impUcation that I had alleged that there was collusion, but I will let that pass. I believe that there is an involvement by Government Ministers. That is the truth. They are not prepared to allow this matter to be debated. The cuckolding Minister for Transport himself has just entered the chamber. He is the man who suggested in the first place the levies that have been imposed on shipowners. He is the guilty party. He is seeking immunity for his waterside worker friends. He does not worry about Australia. He holds Australia to ransom. (Opposition members interjecting)",36
120,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The House will come to order. The Chair will not tolerate such behaviour. No further business will be conducted until the House comes to order. If there is any further rowdiness on either side of the House, I will take the appropriate action.",36
121,Mr NDCON,PAIRS,"We moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to get a proper debate on these matters. There are bad smells about this whole business. The terms of reference of the royal commission are drawn too narrowly. The Minister for Transport is in the House. He should agree to the suspension of Standing Orders to aUow proper debate on the question. Unless he does, a grave suspicion will hang not only over him but over the rest of the Australian Labor Party.",36
122,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I call the Leader of the House. (Opposition members interjecting),36
123,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I warn honourable members on the Opposition front bench that if they continue with their rowdyism I will take action. That is my last warning.,36
124,Mr DALY,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders to discuss a matter of pubUc importance. His motion has been seconded by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon). This is one of the time consuming measures that are put up by the Opposition in an endeavour to evade the rulings of the Chair. I am unmoved by the crocodile tears or the indignation of those honourable members opposite who have spoken in this debate. It was mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon that the Opposition wanted the first opportunity to discuss this matter before it is discussed at a court of inquiry. The honourable member for Gippsland repeated that statement. The House met yesterday and an urgency motion was moved.",36
125,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"It was a pretty important one, too.",36
126,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order!,36
127,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"If this matter is of such importance, why was it not moved for discussion yesterday?",36
128,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,It is a pretty important issue because people are out of work.,36
129,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Leader of the Australian Country Party will behave himself.,36
130,Mr DALY,PAIRS,I will tell honourable members opposite why they did not seek to have it discussed yesterday. Because bushrangers Uke the Leader of the Country Party stood over the Liberal Party of Australia.,36
131,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There will be no personal reflections. There are no bushrangers in this House. I ask the Leader of the House to withdraw the term 'bushrangers'.,36
132,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"I withdraw the statement, but I say that the Ned Kellys of the Australian Country Party stood over members of the Liberal Party and put this matter into a secondary position. Today they are crying about not having the opportunity to move such an urgency motion yesterday. Have honourable members ever heard such rot? Today the Opposition has come before this chamber with a censure motion that was made a joke of by the person who moved it-the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). He did not have a note, he did not have an idea and he has held up the business of this Parliament aU day. Honourable members opposite know that when a censure motion is moved aU other business stands aside. Yet under the phoney pretence today of the urgency of this matter, which was brought in for sheer poltiical purposes, they have sought aU day to take up the time of the House. Do they not realise that when the Leader of the Opposition said that they did not win the last election, it meant that they in fact lost it? If they do not know that it is time they found out. The Government is in charge of this Parhament-no t the hillbillies of the Country Party, the deadbeat from Wannon or the collection that makes up the fantastic amount of energy and effort that comprises the Opposition in this Parhament. The situation is that the Opposition moved an urgency motion in this chamber yesterday, yet it could not keep a quorum in the chamber. Its own supporters would not listnen to the Country Party's motion. Yet today it has told us that this matter is important. (Honourable members interjecting)",36
133,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I shall take action if there are any further interjections. Mr Hewson-He is making a ,37
134,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable business member for MCMillan will remain silent while am addressing the chamber.,37
135,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, what I did",37
136,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"I raise a point of order, MrSpeaker.",37
137,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable motion member for Wannon has raised a point of The Leader of the House will resume his seat.,37
138,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Some effort to ensure that the honourable member for Gippsland and I stuck to the motion before the Chair. I suggest that the Leader of the House quite deliberately trying to evade the issue and also to prevent the Minister for Transport, should have answered, from answering.",37
139,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The point is valid. I ask the Leader of the House to keep to the point before the Chair. The Leader of the House is opposing the suspension of the Standing Orders.,37
140,Mr DALY,PAIRS,I am opposed to the suspension the Standing Orders and I have stuck to the time? motion. This motion could have been moved yesterday by honourable members opposite.,37
141,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,I raise Mr Speaker. The Leader of the House quite directly disputed your ruling when he said that he had stuck to the motion after you had just ruled that he had not.,37
142,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I ask the Leader of the House to keep to the point before the Chair. opposing the suspension of the Standing Orders draw it. the Leader of the House is not to debate the subject matter.,37
143,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"I can well understand why honourable members opposite do not want to listen to my words of knowledge and wisdom; it is because they know that they hurt them where it hurts most. I say to the honourable member for Wannon that he had the opportunity yesterday to move such a motion, but the Opposition moved an urgency motion which it could not get a quorum to support. If this matter is so important, why did the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Wannon not move such a motion yesterday? We all know that it is a pohtical stunt. It is not enough to come into this chamber and say that this matter should be debated today. I think there are some members of a legal mind in this Parliament who think that probably the whole matter is sub judice. For the honourable member for Wannon now to move for the suspension of Standing Orders in an endeavour to defeat the decision of the House not to proceed with this today indicates that it is just a phoney I proposition. If the Liberal Party allows the Country Party to stand over it and it puts on the wrong urgency motions on the wrong day that is not the fault of the Government; that is entirely a matter of their internal poUtics.

145,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"The honourable member on his is temporary visit to this Parliament should remain quiet from time to time or he will not last as long who here as he wants to. The Opposition has put up the phoney proposition that today is the first opportunity to discuss this matter. I say to the honourable member for Wannon that that is a dehberate untruth. The Opposition had the opportunity yesterday to move for the discussion of this matter, so why today should the honourable of member for Wannon say that this is the first",37
146,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The term 'dehberate untruth' is unparUamentary and I ask the Minister to a point of order, withdraw it.",37
147,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,He was being dehberate.,37
148,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Minister for the Capital Territory will remain silent. I have just given a ruling that the term 'deliberate untruth' In is unparUamentary. I ask the Minister to with,37
149,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"I withdraw it, Mr Speaker.",37
150,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I submit that the statement that this was the first opportunity to debate this issue is just as relevant as was the Prime Minister's argument that today was the first day on which it was possible to debate the censure motion.",38
151,Mr DALY,PAIRS,"I shall summarise why we will not support this motion. Yesterday the opportunity was given to the Opposition to move a motion if it was important. It was not taken advantage of. Today it has been brought in after we have discussed a censure motion, which the Opposition knows takes precedence as the business of government must continue. We all know that the purpose of moving for the suspension of Standing Orders today is to make a speech on a matter that was prevented from being discussed in the interests of the Parhament and to get around that decision by debating it here today. That has been proved in this debate, Mr Speaker, because you have constantly had to call honourable members opposite to order when they have wanted to debate details of the matter which the House decided would not be discussed but that the next business would be called on. I and other honourable members on this of the House are completely unmoved by these phoney attempts by the Liberal and Country silence. Parties to circumvent decisions of this Parliament by trying to put over a case which they have been prevented from putting. I point out to the members of the Opposition that the previous Government applied standing order 399 against the then Opposition. Dehberate attempts are made to move frivolous motions of this nature to hold up the business of the Parliament. If this continues, in the interests of good government it may be necessary for us to adopt for once the infamous policies of those who now sit opposite. Far be it from me to do so, but if the Opposition continues on the course it is following it will leave Adermann, A. E. the Government no alternative. No self respectAnthony, J.D. ing government can tolerate the delaying of the Bonnett, R. N. business of Parliament by frivolous motions Bourchier, moved for political purposes, in an endeavour to Cadman, A. G. hold up the business of this Government in this Cairns, Parliament where we legislate for the welfare of ConnoUy, D. M. all people. The motion deserves to be defeated. It should never have been moved. Honourable members opposite who spoke on it ought to remember that the reason why there is a Umitation of time on speaking to a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that honourable members are expected to speak to the motion. I will bet that the honourable member for Wannon or the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) do not reaUse that when I sit down in about 30 seconds the motion will be automatically put. Only about 25 minutes are aUowed for these debates. Very few members of the Opposition know a standing order and do not even know how to break them properly, but they try to get around the Standing Orders they do not know under the guise of putting up a great public stand. The Government would support this motion if it were worthwhile doing so, but we have no intention of doing it today. Consequently, I ask that the motion be rejected.",38
152,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The time allowed for the debate has expired. The question is that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders be agreed to. I think the noes have it. Is a division required? Ring the beUs. (The beUs being rung),38
153,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, if the Minister in charge of the House would aUow it I am quite certain that the Opposition would be deUghted to accommodate the Minister for Transport on this subject.

156,Mr DALY,WOOL TAX BILLS,"I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would preventfiveWool Tax Bills(a) being presented and read a first dme together one motion being moved tion being put in regard to, respectively, the readings, the committee's report stage, and readings, of all the Bills together, and (b) the consideration of the Bills in one committee whole. I explain to the House that this is a procedural motion only. Its purpose is to permit the a introduction of and subsequent dealing with the S Bills as one question instead of a series of same type of procedure. There is no intention go beyond the stage of the second reading today. Question resolved in the affirmative. NOES WOOL TAX BILLS (Nos 1 to 5) 1974 Bills presented by Mr Crean, and together read a first time. Innes, U. E Jacobi, R. Second Reading",39
157,Mr CREAN,WOOL TAX BILLS," I move: That the Bills be now read a second time. These Bills will amend the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1 to 5) 1964-1973 to provide for an increased rate of wool tax. They are a consequence of arrangements for the marketing of the 1974-75 wool clip that have been approved by the Government and agreed to by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. Our intention to introduce them was announced by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) on 29 August. Scholes, G. G.D. Wool tax is currently levied at the rate of 2.75 per cent. At this level, it represents wool growers' contributions towards the financing of programs Uren,T. Wallis, L.G. of wool research and promotion and the Whan.R.B. administration of the marketing functions of the Willis, R. Austrahan Wool Corporation. Young, M. J. Tellers: The additional tax proposed by these Bills will James, A. W. be imposed at the rate of 5 per cent thus bringing Nicholls, M.. H. the total levy up to 7.75 per cent. The 5 per cent increase will apply from 2 September 1974 to 30 June 1975 and the revenue from it will be appropriated for use by the Australian Wool Corporation to meet any losses it may incur during the 1974-75 wool selling season from the maintenance of a firm floor price of 250 cents per kilogram clean for 21 micron wool in the wool market. Legislation will be introduced at the first opportunity to provide for the creation of a sepHouse) arate fund for this purpose. The date from which the increased rate of tax will apply coincides with the date of the resumpand tion of auction sales for the 1974-75 wool selling without delay and one quessecond season. Tax will, therefore, be collected at a comthe third mon rate for all wool sold since the introduction of the minimumfloorprice. The Wool Tax Act of the (No. 1) imposes a tax on shorn wool produced in Austraha and sold by a wool broker. The other Acts ensure that where shorn wool is not sold by broker it is subject to tax at some other point. The need for 5 separate Acts arises from a constithe tutional requirement that laws imposing taxes to should deal with one subject of taxation only. I speech commend the bills to the house. Debate (on motion by Mr Street) adjourned. NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee",39
158,Mr LES JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL," I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Pubhc Works Committee Act 1969-1974, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Proposed redevelopment of Tennant Creek Hospital. The proposal involves provision of new medical and paramedical facUities, new admimstration area, new ward block, new kitchen, accommodation units, and alterations to certain existing facUities to provide a modern efficient hospital to meet the needs of the growing population in the district. Construction will be of load bearing brickwork, with steel deck roofing and aluminium framed windows. The buUding will be air conditioned, and the site will be landscaped to provide a pleasant environment. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $4.83m at June 1974 prices. The Committee concluded that many of the existing buUdings have outlived their usefulness, that a number of recendy erected buUdings can be integrated into the new facUities, that there is a need for new and expanded hospital facUities, that the site was suitable, and that the work should proceed to construction. The Committee also noted that the Department of Health should take care to ensure that staff accommodation of sufficiently high standard is avaUable to attract the personnel required to operate the hospital efficiently. The designs for the accommodation units meet this requirement. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detaUed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.",40
159,Mr CALDER,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"In supporting this motion, I say how pleased I am that the proposed redevelopment of the Tennant Creek Hospital has finaUy reached a stage where it appears that construction can go ahead. I say that with reservations because Tennant Creek is in an isolated area. The transport situation in the Northern Territory being as it is, I hope that the proposed work can be completed in the estimated period of 3 years. If the conditions that we experienced this year are repeated and the raUway line and the roads in South Australia, particularly the northern areas of South Australia, and Central Australia are subjected to the conditions that they have experienced this year, I am afraid that the completion date will sUp back. If the rate of inflation in Australia is to increase at an estimated 20 per cent or so, as the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Government seem Act to accept, the cost of the redevelopment of the Tennant Creek Hospital will increase beyond the present estimate of $4.83m. But the project is under way.",40
160,Mr LES JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"You still want it, though?",40
161,Mr CALDER,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"We certainly still want it. I hope that the Government will do something about seeing that it does not fall behind in the time schedule and that the Government will not just throw up its hands in the way it is doing about the economic situation in the country today. Since you ask me, I tell you this. I see that there is to be a staff of 27 or so at Tennant Creek. I do not know where they are going to be housed. In the civil works program there are proposals for some flats and houses but in Tennant Creek at this moment there are seven school teachers under a cloud. They do not know if they are going to stay there or not because there is no government accommodation and the Government has done nothing whatsoever about it. I believe numerous requests have been made to the Minister for the Northern Territory for him to go there and answer those questions, amongst others, which are going to be put in the town tonight. No doubt they will be overjoyed to hear of the hospital. There are millions of dollars of improvements to be buUt in Tennant Creek but I do not know who is going to staff them, because there will be no houses there for the people to Uve in. So while we are grateful to have a hospital, it is unfortunate that the Government has done nothing about the housing position in Tennant Creek during the time it has been in office. If you look at the civU works program you will see in the proposed works that there are houses to be built. How long it will take to build them. I do not know. I am glad the hospital is to be started. The history of medical services in Tennant Creek has been a very checkered one, not only in the time of this Government but for all the time. I have been in the Territory. It has always been in doubt whether there would be one doctor or two doctors, a dentist, or any medical facilities at all in Tennant Creek. As you know, it is 320 mUes north of AUce Springs and it is quiteridiculousto consider going down there to have a tooth fiUed or to get minor medical assistance. This hospital is certainly not before its time and I hope it will be completed in something like the estimated period.",40
162,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"I was pleased to hear the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) say that he welcomed the hospital at Tennant Creek, even though he did endeavour to turn his speech into a pohtical one. He mentioned the lack of housing and was critical of the Austrahan Government for this. He then endeavoured to raise a question that has been raised frequently about the increasing cost of building due to escalating costs in the community generally. He seemed to convey that this might even be used by the Austrahan Government as a reason not to proceed with the hospital. I ought to rernind the honourable member in the first place that this very motion means that the hospital will proceed. When the Pubhc Works Committee took evidence in Tennant Creek to determine for itself whether the works were justified I do not remember seeing the honourable member for the Northern Territory at the hearing, even though the town is in his constituency. Nor did I find that he had been in the town recently or for some time.",40
163,Mr LES JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,I go there more frequently than he does.,41
164,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"I have been there simUarity ends. only once in my Ufe. From what I can determine from the locals, I have been there more often than the honourable member for the Northern Territory. Mr Keogh-Once more.",41
165,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"Yes, once more. If the honourable member had ever bothered to avaUable, visit the Tennant Creek area, and he speaks glibly about the lack ofhousing there and seems to blame the Australian Government for that lack, and if he had spoken to the people who there, as I and other members of the Committee did, he would know that there are plans to build houses there and that the reason the houses are not built has nothing to do with this Government but with the system the honourable member proition tects to the nth degree, the private enterprise tem. Private builders will not go to Tennant Creek unless they have a contract worth more than $2m. The contract for the housing scale requirements was worth a lot less than $2m. I was told by locals in Tennant Creek that it is that reason- I rely on their word-that tors will not take on work at Tennant Creek. How that fact can be twisted and responsibiUty for that situation be laid at the feet of the Government I do not know. I turn to the other specious issue the able member for the Northern Territory raised about the costs of building rising. I think he plucked some figure out of the air. He referred a cost of $6m or $5m-som e weirdfigurederived from a simple arithmetical calculation in a very complex situadon. It is absolutely faUacious to say that the completion date is date X, that buUding costs are rising by 20 per cent per annum and that one should increase the base figure by that percentage over the period it takes to construct the buUding. I invite the honourable member for the Northern Territory to speak with officers of the Department of Housing and Construction and to get his arithmetic correct. There is another side to the equation. What in fact happens is that because of clauses in the contract, anyrisesand falls that occur after the contract has been let are calculated rises and falls. They are calculated on the basis of award increases in wages-no t sweetheart agreementsand on the increased cost of materials. These take place as progress payments are made and such payments diminish as the work proceeds because work has been done. To take a simple increase of 20 per cent and add that to the original estimated cost of $4.5m and say that it will now cost $5m or $6m is Uke trying to compare a horse with a cow-bot h have 4 legs but there the The other faUacy in the argument is that while costs are rising so is income rising. WhUst it may be true that on today's values the building is worth $4.5m or $4.83m, the volume of money avaUable is at that level at this time but at the time the buUding is completed more funds are so the relativity remains. No relativity is lost. The honourable member for the Northern Territory tries to confuse the community and the House by quoting only one side of the equation. Uve He quotes the side where costs are rising and ignores the side where incomes are rising. If he is the arithmetical genius he is trying to prove himself to be, I suggest he do the sort of calculation I have mentioned and perhaps explain the poslater. If the relativity between costs and sysincome remains, I suggest he should apologise. He should not take figures and multiply them so that they become larger in total or grander in and say it is bad, because that is only looking at one side of the picture and it gives a disfor torted view. One could be tempted to think this contracwas some sort of dishonest argument. The proposed works undoubtedly are needed, as would be recognised by anybody who had seen the hospital at Tennant Creek. I do not think the hospital ran down in the last 2 years; it honourhas been running down for a long time. The buUdings are in a deplorable state. Some were erected as early as 1914. They are still standing to and are being used. There is a need to buUd a new hospital at Tennant Creek. In fact there has probably been such a need for a long time. The need has finally been recognised. The PubUc Works Committee went to Tennant Creek and took evidence from citizens of the town and from the cUent department and the constructing department, deliberated on the matter and came to a very firm conclusion that the hospital ought to be built and work should proceed. I point out that it is only some weeks-in fact, in terms of ting days of this House one could almost say it is only some days-sinc e the report was presented to this House. I commend the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) on coming back so quickly with the expediency motion. It shows his bonafides.It shows his integrity and its shows that he believes that the hospital ought to be built as quickly as possible. Both the PubUc Works Committee and the Minister have honoured their obligations. The Committee has brought in the report and the Minister has brought in as quickly as he could the expediency motion so that the works can proceed. I commend the works to the House. I could not conceive of any argument that could be put forward by anybody in this House, including the honourable member for the Northern Territory, that the works should not proceed. Yet if anybody were to oppose the expediency motion that is what he would need to say. If he did not say that he would be using this debate only as an opportunity to put a point of view about something that is not relevant to the construction of the hospital at Tennant Creek. I commend the motion to the House.",41
166,Mr MCLEAY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"The Oppowas sition supports the motion. However, I dunk should at least say something about some of remarks of the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). He commenced his It remarks, I think, by congratulating the honourthat able member for the Northern Territory Calder), saying that this is not the place and the time for making political speeches. I do not know of any place where one should make a poltiical speech more than in this place. After all, this what we are here for. But in his very next breath the honourable member for Burke attacked my colleague, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, by saying that he had been in the Northern Territory himself on more occasions than had the honourable member for the Northern Territory. In fact, the Minister Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) who is at the table said that he thinks that he has been in the Northern Territory more than the honourable member for the Northern Territory. They are all snide remarks that ought to be exposed and refuted. The honourable member for the Northern Territory said that he supported strongly the motion before the Chair; he said that there is a need for the hospital, as I recollect his remarks. He also said that there is a need for some accommodation up there to house the people who are sitassociated with the hospital. So I think it is important to join issue with the Government at least on that point and also to make the point that we have no intention of injecting politics into the debate; we did so on the last occasion. The honourable member for Burke mentioned building costs. If he has a look at the transcript of evidence taken by the Committee of which he is a memberMr Keith Johnson- I heard the evidence.",42
167,Mr MCLEAY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"I read the transcript. If the honourable member says that he heard the evidence he must have dropped off to sleep half way through it, because senior officials from the Department of Housing and Construction made statements which indicate that the escalation in building costs in the Northern Territory ranges up to 60 per cent. In the previous debate I asked the Minister at the table whether he would be prepared to have portion of the Committee's transcript incorporated in Hansard but he would not give us permission to do that. Three schools were the subject of the previous debate. I have forgotten where they were to be constructed, but 3 schools were involved, the estimated cost of which was just over $lm. The estimated tender price has risen in 12 months to more than $2m. It that escalation which made it necessary for I the Minister to bring the matter before the the House. The Minister may remember that debate which took place only two or three months ago. will be found from the transcript of evidence building costs are escalating at this rate in (Mr the Northern Territory. Mr Keogh-You had better start again.",42
168,Mr MCLEAY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"I would Uke to start again. I is would make this point: Every time there is to be a debate on pubUc works matters in this place we will turn it into a poltiical debate if that is what the Government wants. On this occasion we have not. We said that we would come in and support the motion and get it through. Following their usual pattern here, Government supporters took for every opportunity to discredit the honourable member for the Northern Territory. In my view, even and in the view of most people in the Northern Territory, he truly represents that Territory and does it well. So in spite of all these remarks, Opposition strongly supports the modon.",42
169,Mr KELLY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"Something ought to be said briefly about this proposal to prove works at the Tennant Creek Hospital in line with the report of the ParUamentary Standing ing Committee on PubUc Works of which I have the honour to be a member. Today is the first time that I have heard debate of the kind that has just taken place. I must admit that I tled at the attitude of the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) who, I thought, made ment a quite unreasonable attack on the honourable recruitment member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder). assist I would remind the honourable member for the hospital, Burke that the honourable member for the taken Northern Territory, whom he having been present at a meeting of the PubUc Works Committee, has an electorate of over 500,000 square miles. Mr Keith Johnson-Only 90,000 people Uve it.",43
170,Mr KELLY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"I ask the honourable member to consider what it is like. I wonder how he would service that electorate. He represents a pocket handkerchief electorate one could ride a bike around before breakfast. I pay a tribute to the service that the honourable member for the Northern Territory gives to his electorate. I know of no one else who wears himself out in the service ofhis people as the honourable member for the Northern Territory does. I am ashamed to hear the honourable member for the Northern Territory attacked as he was by the honourable member for Burke, just because he did not attend a particular committee hearing, when he was almost certainly on the job somewhere else. I do not think that that is the kind of comment that should come from a member of the Committee. There are several things that could have been said quite usefully. The report we are debating is a two-barreUed report. This matter was referred to the previous Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Fulton), and I was a member of the subcommittee that investigated it. But because of the chaos that was caused by the double dissolution, a report could not be brought into the House and the matter was referred back to the Committee. But some comment ought to be made about the matter. I know that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) would want me to say something. The proposed work involves the use of village type accommodation. When both the Minister and I were members of the rate. the Committee we had a good deal to do in activating this procedure. It is an interesting development in accommodation and the members of the Committee would have done themselves more apcredit if they had spent some time looking at the principles behind this proposal instead of makhalf-baked poltiical attacks. It is said that we should not mention housing. The Committee itself mentions housing in the report. For the benefit of the Chairman of the Committee I refer was starto the report that he himself signed: The representatives of the Tennant Creek Town ManageBoard expressed some doubts about the successful of staff to man the new hospital. . . . To in attracting staff required for the efficient operation of the Committee consider that care should be to ensure that accommodation of sufficiently high stanaccused of not dard is available. That is what we said in the report. This is what the honourable member for Burke signed but then he castigated the honourable member for the Northern Territory and said that the honourin able member for the Northern Territory should not have referred to it. Mr Keith Johnson-Rubbish .",43
171,Mr KELLY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,That is exactly what you said. Mr Keith Johnson-Rubbish . You are out of your mind.,43
172,Mr KELLY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"Shoul d we not also refer to the cost of the project? Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your attention for a moment please! I seem to be subjected to some kind of crossfire from the other side of the chamber. One other question-it is an important point-is whether the Committee should refer in its report to the cost of a proposed work. When the matter first came before the Committee, the estimated cost of the work was $4.5m. The second time it came before the Committee the estimated cost was $4.83m. We heard evidence from officers of the Department of Housing and Construction that the work is likely to go to tender at $6m. We would then know that theriseand fall clauses would apply in the meantime. One matter on which I would Uke the Minister's guidance is whether mention should be made in the report of the amount at which it is expected to go to tender. I have always imagined that it is a function of the PubUc Works Committee to advise the Parliament of the cost of proposed works. Mr Keogh-Did you ever do it when you were the Chairman of the Committee?",43
173,Mr KELLY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,At that time we did not have an escalation in costs of anywhere near the present,43
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL, today. Order! I suggest that interjections cease and the honourable member for Wakefield be alit lowed to make his speech without outside assist-advise ance.,44
175,Mr KELLY,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"I imagine that it is a proper function of the Committee to mention in the not only the estimated cost at the time but the amount at which it is expected to go to der. I have been taunted from across the chamber about whether that was done when I was the Chairman of the Committee. It was wellknowledge,firstof within the power of the honourable member forlems Leichhardt (Mr Fulton), who was then the Vice-to Chairman of the Committee, to insist that it done. When the previous Committee discussed this matter and divided on it, which was the first time. I had ever known it to divide on party lines,tract I said that I felt that it was a function of the Uc Works Committee to advise the Parliament the estimated cost of the work when it goes to tender. I think that it is a proper function PubUc Works Committee to do so. Irrespective whether it is done in the report, I think it proper that the Committee shouldfindout the tors amount when it hears evidence on the proposed work. The Chairman of the Committee would know that the Committee has been following itical that practice. He has been quite responsible chairmanship and has made no attempt to stopway. the Committee from finding out. Surely it is a function of the PubUc Works Committee to tell the Parliament as hear as it what the work is going to cost. It is not sufficient to teU the Parliament what it has been estimatedno that it will cost when it goes to the Committee cause more than one stage is involved. This proposed work is a comparatively small project, but it will take 10 months to document it months to do the building. By that time the costlooked of the project will have increased. to make poltiical capital out of this matter. I am just trying to measure the increased cost. it not a function of the PubUc Works CommitteeWakefield to advise the Parliament of the cost of the work when it goes to tender? There are many other things that could be said about this matter. would have been better if we had concentrated on the principles behind the work and the prob-mittee lems of starting and completing it in the well as all the problems that are inherent in escalation of costs that make it so difficult to for long term progress in the area. We have recognise that as being a fact of Ufe until we bring the problem of inflation Everybody recognises that there is a problem. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) Everybody knows that we have a probthatlem. Until we overcome the problem of inflation is the job of the Public Works Committee to the Parliament-no t the Government, which is a servant of the Parliament-of the estimated cost. report Mr LES JOHNSON (Hughes-Minister for also Housing and Construction) (3.44)-in replytenWithout displaying too much blood pressure in relation to this matter or getting overpettifogging or pedantic about it, I want to acaU, that there are cost probin the Northern Territory. Everybody ought be aware of them. They should not be brought be into this Parliament with an intended element of surprise. The economy is buoyant. In the more remote areas it has become more difficult to attradesmen. There have been instances of a Pub-contemporary nature where the Government has ofbeen unsuccessful in attracting tenders even. Someone can criticise that situation if he likes. of theHe may prefer a more depressed economic situofation. He may prefer to have workmen waiting at is the door and equipment stacked up and contraclined up and ready to dance to his bidding. I know that is the phUosophy that has been upheld in Liberal-Country Party components of the polspectrum in Australia for a long time. This in hisGovernment just does not choose to do it that One of the consequences of our kind of emphasis is that sometimes in these difficult or remote areas of the Northern Territory there are some problems and these are reflected in cost accanceleration. There has been cost acceleration. I have referred to it in presenting the motion. It is secret. No one has to be ashamed of it. It is a be-fact of Ufe in Australia and all over the world. It was in the Ught of this fact that the previous Committee examined this proposal and the estiand 27mate was $4.5m. Then the present Committee at it and the estimate at June 1973 prices I am not tryingwas $4.83m. Is it or is I know that the honourable member for (Mr KeUy) has another idea about prices. Some members of the Opposition like to cause prices to look as high as they can possibly It make them look. I noticed that he expressed an opinion by way of a motion moved in the Comto the effect that thefinalcost could rise to area as$6m when tenders are caUed. Whether he was the right or wrong I am not prepared to speculate but planI know he did not have the numbers to have that to motion accepted. So the majority of members of canthat Committee apparently decided that his estiunder control. mate was wrong. Mr MCLeay-They just happen to be Governrecognises it ment members.",44
176,Mr LES JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"There it is. Whether they are Government or Opposition members there are rising costs in the Northern Territory. I hope that knowledge will give somebody satisfaction. I give it with my compliments for what it is worth to them. Costs arerisingin the Northern Territory and that is one of the problems that we encounter. So I hope all those gentlemen who get agitated are placated by that acquiescence in which I have indulged. The other matter is a minor one but it is worth mentioning. I tliink from the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) the House would get the impression that the Government had been completely derelict in its responsibUity for housing at this hospital. That is not the case. As the honourable member for Wakefield has indicated, some exotic provisions of the type which never used to be made have been made. This is a very contemporary innovation. We now provide high standard accommodation wherever we carry out a Government project whether it is for servicemen, students or nurses. The honourable member for Wakefield and I , and also the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) and some other honourable members, can claim some credit for causing a break-through in this. We have lifted the whole standard. I thought the honourable member for the Northern Territory would have known a bit more about this. We have pioneered this in the Northern Territory especiaUy; we have certainly adopted this pohcy for the community college and a number of other projects in the Territory. The project for the Tennant Creek Hospital is a very real and effective initiative being taken by the Government. In it we will provide a vUlage for nurses' accommodation with 24 motel-type units. They will be air-conditioned and similar to the standard already estabUshed at the Alice Springs Hospital. They will be bed-sitter type units with self-contained facUities such as toUets and cooking arrangements. Mr Kelly-And they will not cost any more than the old type.",45
177,Mr LES JOHNSON,TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL,"As the honourable member has properly said by interjection, the resourcefulness of the Department of Housing and Construction is such that we will be able to produce this fine product at a cost less than that of far more inferior basic arrangements. In addition to this vUlage complex to be set in a parklike surrounding will be an old ward of the hospital which is being turned into 3 self-contained bedroom fiats for paramedical personnel. There will be 3 residences on the site, one each for the secretary, the medical superintendent and the senior officer of the hospital. Two of these residences already exist and the third is being buUt as pan of the project. So quite a generous amount of considerauon has been extended to accommodation matters. Unquestionably there are accommodation problems in Tennant Creek. Maybe the honourable member for the Northern Territory can use his influence among the Legislative Councillors in the Territory to carve up the cake in such a way that Tennant Creek will get more of the Housing Commission allocation than it is getting at present. Quite frankly I think the time has come when a serious look should be taken at the need to fulfil hostel accommodation requirements in the Northern Territory for employees of my own Department, for employees of the Postmaster-General's Department and for other employees who perform duties of a governmental nature. I was intrigued to hear several times today the old poltiical cliche that the Opposition wants to socialise its losses and capitalise its gains. We find that this applies to housing acivity which is claimed to be the prerogative of private enterprise. But when housing is required at places which are incapable of attracting a dividend to shareholders and where high profits cannot be made, as is the position in Tennant Creek and many other parts of the Northern Territory, honourable gentlemen opposite are quick to say that this is not a private profit making situation but is an obligation for the Government. They want to turn the rough stuff over to the Government but they never want to see some effective pubUc enterprise that will cause taxation to be reduced. The proposition to buUd the Tennant Creek hospital has been talked about for decades. It has been needed for decades in an outpost of empire where some of our most valuable mineral exports are produced. The people in this area are pioneering and enterprising. The Government already has extended to those people many embellishments to their living arrangements which they never enjoyed before. Many pubhc initiatives are being taken in the area including a new health centre, a new primary school and high school, a new power station and sewerage in the town. Here we have yet another mUestone in this cavalcade of achievements for the Northern Territory which have been introduced in the short time that the Labor Government has been in 2- office. I commend the motion to the consideration of the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Debate resumed from 17 September (vide page 1429), on motion by Mr Morrison: That the Bill be now read a second time.",45
178,Mr IAN ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"This Bill seeks to abolish the broadcast listener's and television viewer's Ucence system. The Ucence fees have become relatively expensive to coUect. In fact in 1973-74 it cost $3.4m to collect the fees throughout Australia. According to calculations another $ l l m was not collected despite the activities of some 2,400 inspectors poUcing the Ucensing system. Another feature of the history of this matter is that last year 23,000 people were prosecuted for not possessing a broadcast listener's or a television viewer's licence. The Opposition believes that the move to abolish the Ucences will be welcomed by the community. The Opposition also beUeves that at this stage of sophistication of administration the costs of administration, the costs of collecting revenue and the costs of policing the system run into a situation of imbalance. I believe, and I am sure that many other honourable members believe, that the Government must realise that it should not restrict this kind of thinking to only this area. It is very strange that the Government has expressed a firm view in very strong words that a business undertaking should be financed by receipts and be related to the expenditure required for its operation. It has indicated its principle in relation to post and telegraph charges. It has indicated it in relation to many other charges. Yet we have the curious situation where it selects this area for a different approach and in fact states that it cannot be treated as an operation that can be qualified as a business operation. Had the revenue situation continued the collections for the remainder of this year would have been about $50m or, in a full year, $67m- a very considerable sum of money. Let us think of the considerations that must arise in this matter. We are on the eve of the advent of colour television in Australia. There will, of course, be a great disparity in the matter of those who are privueged to have the opportunity of seeing colour television and those who will not. Yet had the fee continued everyone would have been paying the same Ucence charge. On that ground alone there was a need for some consideration of the matter. Undoubtedly, if the revenue aspect had been amtinued, the Government would have been increasing the licence fee. So, taking all this into account, at least some of the anomaUes are being overcome by the one BILL 1974 action of removing the licence fee. The Second Reading anomaUes, of course, are those in which we find an increasing number of Usteners and viewers who are not privueged to get a satisfactory reception of one kind or another, where there is an increase in the expenditure, so far as the cities are concerned, and a loss of those standards in the more distant parts of Australia. So, the action of the Government is to be commended in this respect because it creates a situation of equaUty in the matter of the required enforcement of a charge. Perhaps it does not produce complete equaUty in terms of expenditure when it is related to who pays in this instance. Of course, it will now be the taxpayer. The situation is interesting when one looks at the day to day needs of the running of a great national service which provides our national radio and television media in this countiy. The costs must be escalating at an enormous rate. Yet under the privileges that have been followed for a considerable time a statutory body of the sort that is involved here is not required to reveal the full details of its budgeting and the full details of its expenditure in terms of a breakup that gives a picture of what is being spent in what area. We recall the great issue that arose some two or three years ago when the previous Government sought to have a closer look at what the budgeting and the expenditure might be. Before it could even get this off the ground there were protests in all directions, led by those who now sit on the Treasury benches. I am one who has always been in full support of those who want to get the best standard and give leadership in the provision of a national service. I think it is essential that they be given support to perform their task in the nauonai interest. But it is a strange contrast indeed, in what we now are told is open government, when we still do net have a situation where the full details are made known to Parliament and made known to the public in the community at large. I just want to express this comment. I hope that the removal of the licence fee will not be an open order in certain directions for the provision of a national service or for expenditure to escalate without regard to what it means in terms of the drain on the taxpayer. After all, to some extent a limitation was imposed in the past through the revenue limitation in terms of collections from Ucence fees. This was supplemented to some extent from other sources such as tax revenue. Now we have the situation where there is no restraint of that kind. This Bill contains nothing which indicates that there will be some kind of control mechanism. I hope that what I am about to say will not be regarded as a statement that criticises in any way the action being taken to remove the hcence charge; on the other hand, I hope that it will be regarded as a responsible comment on the admiriistration of what is one of the most vital services provided to the pubhc. I am bound to point out that there is as a consequence of this action an even greater disparity in what is paid for by taxpayers or through the revenue coming to the Government for pubhc service provisions-in other words, services to the community and what is regarded as a business undertaking and which therefore necessitates revenue to cover its expenditure. So, I mention again telephone services. In very many Austrahan homes the number one requirement is a telephone. Radio and television services rank second to that requirement. This is because there are people who are dependent on that kind of link between their home and the outside world. These people live in a situation where the telephone is their one means of defence and security",46
179,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Iriseon a point of order. May point out that the Bill that we are debating seeks to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act. relates to the abolition of Ucence fees for broadmany casting and television services. I suggest that the honourable gentleman is out of order in raising other matters.,47
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,A passing reference to an associated aspect would be acceptable. I ask the honourable member for Cowper not to develop that argument in relation to this legislation.,47
181,Mr IAN ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will certainly Unk up I am saying with the legislation before the House. I might say that I am a little surprised the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) should take that point because undoubtedly the aspect to which I have referred is one that concerns basic consideration in the removal of the Ucence fee. It is apparent that henceforth a cost of approximately $75m-undoubtedl y this amount will escalate to $ 100m-wil l be imposed on Budget as a consequence of this action. I suggest that that is an important consideration. I believe it is right and proper that I should refer to its relationship to other matters that touch upon the community. This relationship is regarded by the Government, in the terms expressed in the second reading speech, as the justification for its actions. So, I am bound to say that in the total scene a need is present to look at the rationaUstrated ation of or the relationship to those services which are important to the community. I repeat that this is an important matter but there are others. I hope that this will be a first step in a move to give the community the kinds of benefits that those who depend on these community services really need in this period of inflation, cost escalation and economic mismanagement. I think I would be failing in my duty if I were to say less than that. It is important that the Government should take a fresh look at what is happening in relation to the national service provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. With the rapid growth of population, particularly along the eastern seaboard, circumstances have been created in which very many radio Usteners are still restricted to the reception of one effective radio channel. As a consequence, the listening opportunities for these people are affected and the standard of service Ukewise to these people is lower. If we were to refer to an assessment that has been made in quite recent times, this disparity is pointed up very clearly indeed. It is fair to say that even the broadcast of parliamentary I proceedings, whilst not the most popular session on radio, is certainly listened to by a number of It Australians. But there are very many people in electorates in our country who will teU one very clearly that they are not able to listen to the parUamentary proceedings because they cannot pick up the radio signal through which this broadcast is made available to radio listeners. SimUarly, for reasons that are quite apparent and understood by many people television viewing opportunities are restricted. There are great limitations in the coverage that is provided by the national service. The decision to introduce what colour television in Australia was made comparatively recently. Once that decision was that made, a great cost factor was introduced into the provision of those services and the provision of the means for people to be afforded an oppora tunity to view colour television through the national service. The same situation applies to commercial television operations. I believe that if there is to be real equality-that is undoubtedly the the objective of this measure to remove the Ucence fee-that equality must be quickly extended to provide equal viewing opportunities to aU sections of the community-no t just to capital cities, metropolitan areas or the suburbia of Sydney and Melbourne, but to the rest of Australia. If this is to be the pattern, I hope that it will be done on a fair and equitable basis. I hope that we will not see a repetition of what has been perpethrough the administration of the Department of Minerals and Energy with respect to the gas pipeline among many other aspects where what might be regarded as a very good relationship between commercial enterprise and the government sector has been wiped aside and something else- a totally government operation-ha s been put in its place. I hope that this proposal does not mean that henceforth a policy will be perpetrated seeking real nationalisation of the media. If that is what is intended, it would be very wrong indeed. If the only justification for such action is that the pubhc will be paying for these services through Budget provisions as distinct from a Ucensing system, that would be an even worse approach. We certainly do not want to see that happening. I return to the precise provisions of the Bill which seeks the abolition of the broadcasting and television Ucence fee paid by Usteners and viewers. The removal of this charge certainly will be welcomed by every Australian who owns and uses a radio set and/or a television set. I think approximately 3.5 million Australians are Ucence holders. Those who receive some concessions in respect of these services- I think half a million pensioners are involved-in future will not be required to pay any charge whatsoever. They certainly will welcome this move. We support the measure on the ground that it is action in a direction which seems to make very good sense. But we hope that its whole import will be related to that principle and not to something else. There is no doubt that one of the intricacies of this matter-and of course it is the Austrahan attitude that is important",47
182,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I thought the honourable inquiry member was concluding his remarks.,48
183,Mr IAN ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Minister is suggesting that there is some need to hurry this debate through. It is all very well for him to get excited, but there are justifications for the Opporeasons sition expressing its points of view. Opposition members have the right so to do and I think that we will stick to that right, if the Minister does mind. I was referring to the precise principle which this initiates. I hope it is the forerunner many more things based on this worthy principle and is not used as a vehicle to make inroads in another direction. In saying that, I have in the many statements we have read in the last 12 months about attitudes to the media, how the media should function, opportunities that should be given for a certain style of media in this try. There have even been suggestions that there should be an Australian Government media serBudget vice. There is a lot of obscurity about what been said, but I think it has a very direct relationship to the measure now before the House. So, in welcoming this measure I make the observation that I hope it is not a move that will create by stealth an entirely different system, an entirely different attitude, an entirely different premise upon which the Government, through existing instrumentaUties or others it may create in the future, will manage the control and the opportunities for the operation in this country of the style of media we have become accustomed to, a national service and a commercial service, because both have been important in the past. They are obviously of a standard today that is a credit to them. We have no criticism of the national service and we have no criticism of the commercial service in terms of generalities. Certainly there are areas one can examine and find grounds for criticism. I must not conclude without reminding the House of action taken in the last few weeks by the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), who is sitting at the table. That action was to make a very vicious attack on one section of the community in relation to advertising. If my memory serves me correcdy, a commission of inquiiy was appointed to investigate the television advertising of soap.",48
184,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As the honourable gentleman so correctly pointed out, this matter is the subject of an inquiry and I think it might be ruled to be sub judice.",48
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"If what the Minister says is correct, and there is an on that matter, at the moment it might be wise for the honourable member not to make comments in relation to it.",48
186,Mr IAN ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was referring to the for the appointment, not to the detaUs. I am sure I did not use any words that touch upon the ingredient of the inquiry and what it will be not expected to do. Again I mention that there is an inquiry based on certain statements by the of Government and certain premises, which does give some indication of intentions and attitudes. It is directly related to considerations which arise mind in respect of the matter now before the House Finally, the measure is a pace setter by which, I hope, we will have a means of ensuring that this House, particularly at Budget time in the future, counhas some direct reference to this matter. We do not want to find in the future a single entry in the termed 'Expenditure on national service has broadcasting and television'. We want to see something that gives an accountabUity to Parliament, something that goes a Uttle beyond that. I make an appeal to the Government to ensure that this change also brings in its wake other changes of the sort to which I have just referred The Opposition supports the measure.",48
187,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I will not keep the House very long. I am not terribly impressed with an interjection I think I heard from the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) that he wants to rush this Bill through. Though I would Uke to support the principle, at the same time. I support my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson), in the comments he has made. I comphment him on his speech in view of the very short notice he had to prepare for it. I am sorry there has not been an opportunity for more honourable members on this side of the chamber to speak on the subject. I agree with the honourable member that we are not opposing the Bill as such, but I believe this is an opportunity for us to ask a few simple questions. What is the real reason for this measure? I have read the comments the Treasurer (Mr Crean) made last night and I have read the Minister's second reading speech. To be frank, I do not tliink they explain the reasons for the legislation. Last night the Treasurer said that the national broadcasting and television service is a service provided to the community as a whole and the Government believes that the cost of the service should therefore be met from general taxation revenues rather than through a Ucence fee. That is aUright,but how do you associate that with the measure introduced last night by the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) in relation to increases in postal and telegraph charges? If one is a service, so is the other. The Minister said that from 1968 to 1971 under a Liberal Party-Country Party Government the fees raised met something Uke 75 per cent of the expenditure of the national broadcasting and television service and if we were to recover a simUar percentage of expenditure today we would have to increase the fees by 50 per cent. I do not dispute that, but it seems rather odd that on the one hand we would have to increase fees to maintain the status quo but we will delete them, whereas on the other hand, when it comes to general telephone and postal charges, because we areranningshort of chips we have to increase them. To return to my original point, what is the real motive behind this? An amount of $50m or so in revenue will be lost. What effect will this have on the service provided by the various nauonai television and radio stations? If we are going to reduce the service then I regret having to support the Bill. It is veiy easy for some honourable members to suggest that we are advancing tremendously in this field and that colour television is just around the corner. There are numerous places throughout Austraha which have not got black and white TV, let alone colour TV. I venture to say that there are many places receiving reasonable TV coverage today which will not receive colour TV when it is introduced. What effect will the reduction of the income of the Department have? Can we have an assurance from the Government, from the Minister, that despite the reduction of $50m in income the service will continue? With the honourable member for Cowper, I support this issue, with a certain amount of reservation. If it is good enough to have a reduction in one section of the Postmaster-General's Department on the ground of service to the community then it is good enough to have it in another section. Instead of having an increase in postal and telephone charges there ought to be a reduction by perhaps a similar amount. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Morrison) read a third time. NA 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 July (vide page 224), on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",49
188,Mr LYNCH,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"I welcome the opportunity, before so many interested honourable members from both sides of the House, to speak to the Asian Development Fund Bill 1974. This Bill seeks parUamentary approval for a contribution of $18.15m to the Asian Development Bank, the specific purpose of which is the estabhshment of an Asian Development Fund. The Opposition Parties support the passage of the Bill. It is consistent with the priorities of successive Liberal-Country Party governments for programs of economic and technical assistance in developing countries. The Asian Development Bank, otherwise known as the ADB, was established in 1966 to provide practical expression to the policy initiatives of the United Nauons Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. From its quite recent beginnings it has developed rapidly and provided a major stimulus to economic development in the Asian region. It operates as an autonomous international development institution, pursuing goals that complement rather than replace other existing assistance programs, such as those of the World Bank. Like the World Bank it has been designed to provide both technical andfinancialassistance. The dimensions of the Asian Development Bank's loan facilities clearly illustrate the importance of this organisation to the overall pattern Asian development. The Bank commenced lending in 1968, and by the end of 1973 it had lent $US 1,376m. This sum represents approximately one-third of the total amount lent by multilateral agencies to the developing countries of ECAFE. If the comparison over the same 6 years period is made on the basis of lending from ordinary capital resources, the Asian Development Bank's contribution of $US 1,056m equalled some 50 per cent of total funds allocated. The Bank's steadily increasing loan facilities, together with a recent 150 per cent increase in authorised capital, indicates clearly that the Bank will continue as one of the principal agencies of development assistance in the region. The Bill before the House represents a commitment to the objectives and purposes of the Asian Development Bank, which is shared by all parties in this Parhament. The purposes of the Bill are to provide funds for the estabhshment of the Asian Development Fund. It is proposed that this Fund should have an initial working capital of US$525m which to be provided by contributions from the developed member countries of the Asian Uquidity Development Bank. Austraha's proposed conmonetary tribution is approximately 5 per cent or $ 18.5m, to be paid in Austrahan dollars, at a parity the American dollar fixed in November 1973 The loan will be provided on terms of an issue non-interest-bearing promissory notes, to encashed on demand when the funds are required. Payments will be made in two stages: Two-thirds by 30 June 1975, committed by 31 December 1974, and the remaining US$9m tralian Government. committed by 30 June 1975 and paid over by 31 December 1975. The funds so provided will be used to finance loans at less than ruling commercial rates of interest. There is, of course, an urgent need such concessional financing, particularly present. In most of the developing member counfigures tries, assistance on conventional terms has entailed, and continues to entail, a growing problem of debt financing. In several member countries, in fact, the debt service ratio already exceeds 20 per cent of export earnings. Softening of lending terms is therefore a matter of great urgency. In recognition of this need, the donor countries of the Asian Development Bank agreed in principle during 1973 to the establishment of the Asian Development Fund. This Bill proposes to give formal ratification to that agreement. In supporting the Bill, the Opposition Parties of are also in agreement with the Government that the funds should be granted unconditionally, and not constrained on a tied grant basis. Unfortunately, there is an increasing world trend towards development assistance on a tied grant basis. It has been difficult on occasions to distinguish some countries' aid programs from their export promotion pohcies. Grants and loans are too frequently made for specific purposes, and have been tied to the purchase of goods and services in the donor country, so as to create no charge in that country's balance of payments. Such action, of course, greatly reduces the flexibility of programs and restricts the pohcy options open to developing countries. The acute needs of most Asian countries for economic assistance have been exacerbated by the worldwide spiral of inflation. The real value of development expenditure has been rapidly eroded by inflationary forces. In addition, the net effect of the change in parities of major international currencies has contributed to worsening terms of trade. For these problems there appears is to be no ready or immediate assistance. Indeed, they have been aggravated by the worldwide problem, created by the failure of world reserves to expand on a pro rata basis with the increase in world trade. These recent with monetary phenomenons make solutions to age old problems of under-development, mass povof erty and unemployment even more difficult to be find in the present circumstances. They give greater exigency to programs of development aid, which have long been recognised as an important international obUgation of the AusIn 1972 the former Government spent $228m, or 0.59 per cent of the gross national product on foreign aid. The Labor Government in 1973 spent $202m or just 0.44 per cent of gross national product. As inflation grew by 13.2 per for cem during 1973, Labor's aid contribution, in at real terms, was substantiaUy lower than these suggest. There was, in fact, an implicit inflationary erosion in the real value of aid of almost $27m, compounding the impact of the $20m cut in actua' expenditure. Given that a high proportion of Labor's 1973 aid had already been committed by the former Liberal-Country Party Government as part of Austraha's ongoing contributions, Labor's foreign aid performance has clearly been insufficient and totally inadequate. It is incompatible with the Government's specific pohcy pledge to 'work towards the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance'. The present Labor Administration, notwithstanding its loose claims for support for and cooperation with our Asian neighbours, has, in real terms, failed to honour its promises. It has failed to deliver the goods in this area. The clear fact is that in terms of gross national product for the calendar year 1973 Labor cut Australia's economic assitance program by more than $20m. Budget Paper No. 9 1974-75, dealing with projected outlays for Austrahan external aid in the currentfinancialyear, goes to great lengths to defend the Labor Government's foreign aid performance. Upon analysis, however, the Government's attempt to justify its past record is far from credible. The Budget statement indicated that net expenditures on multi-lateral aid programs are estimated to increase to $10,891,000 or 73.8 per cent to a total of $25,648,000 in 1974-75. In prima facie terms, this increase may appear a salutary response in an area of past neglect. But it must be realised that this increase represents nothing more than a belated, if much needed, attempt to restore Austraha's multilateral aid commitment, in percentage terms, to the level achieved by the past Liberal-Country Party Administration in 1972. Given the massive impact of the energy crisis on virtually every developing Asian nation, with the exception of OPEC member nations, and the increasing incidence of social and economic instabuity created by war and famine, the current level of Australia's multi-lateral aid must still be deemed to be very much inadequate against the whole context of need in the countries concerned. Economic and social conditions in most developing nations have suffered a marked deterioration since the Liberal and Country Parties were last in power. I believe therefore, as do all members of the Opposition parties, that Austraha must clearly accept its international obligations in these changed circumstances and provide far higher priority to its foreign aid commitments. A holding action at this stage is simply not adequate, both in terms of the past record and, more particularly, against the obvious pressing and overriding needs of the countries concerned. The Liberal and Country Parties beheve that the expansion of Government spending in the field of foreign aid is certainly justifiable. This is not one area of expenditure which falls within the ambit of our proposals for a moderation in the overall rate of growth of Federal expenditures. Foreign aid expenditure will not aggravate domestic pressures of cost inflation. Nor is its quantum effect on total Budget outlays likely to have significant repercussions. Clearly there is considerable scope for expansion of Government spending in this specific and significant area of overall Budget policy. Support for the expansion of Austraha's multi-lateral aid commitments is, of course, in this context not inconsistent with the Opposition's policy of overall moderation in the rate of growth of Government spending as the net impact of such commitments has a virtually negligible impact upon domestic stabilisation pohcies. Rather the Opposition's support for such worthwhile schemes as the Asian Development Fund is a reflection of our continuing concern for the problems of our Asian neighbours and is consistent with our parties long-term commitment to the principles of foreign aid over all regional development. In one of the most comprehensive surveys of Austraha's foreign aid policy the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last Liberal-Country Party Government, the Honourable Nigel Bowen, said in 1972: Aid is more than simply a question of money: It is a complex process of marshalling resources, technical, human and administrative as well as material. It is important that the quality and effectiveness of aid should be as high as possible. The Opposition parties subscribe to this view and by support for the estabhshment of the Asian Development Fund we believe that this view will be given continuing and practical expression. We support the Bill before the House.  Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) has indicated to the House that the Opposition supports the Asian Development Fund Bill which seeks parliamentary approval for a contribution by Austraha of $18.15m, which is approximately US$27m, to the Asian Development Fund recently established within the Asian Development Bank. It is appropriate at this stage to recall the background of this measure. The Asian Development Bank was conceived by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East-betterr known as ECAFE-and estabhshed for the purpose of lending funds, promoting investment and providing technical assistance to developing member countries and, generally, for fostering economic growth and cooperation in the Asian region. It was formally opened on 19 December 1966. Membership of the Asian Development Bank is open to members and associates of ECAFE and other regional countries and non-regional developed countries which are members of the United Nations or any of its specialised agencies. The Asian Development Bank's lending activities are divided into ordinary operations and special operations. From the commencement of operations until 31 March 1974 the Asian Development Bank approved 177 loans for 156 projects in 21 developing member countries totalling US 1,467.043m. Projects financed by Asian Development Bank loans cover such development activities as construction of highways, processing of agricultural products and development of fishery fleets, industrial plants, water and power supply, ports, airports, multipurpose development schemes, irrigation, medium and small industries through national . development banks and other intermediary institutions, education and telecommunicauons- a very broad spectrum of activities. Ordinary operations of the Bank consist ofloans made at near commercial rates of interest andfinancedout of ordinary capital resources. Ordinary capital resources comprise mainly subscribed capital and borrowings. The original authorised capital stock of the Asian Development Bank has been increased on different occasions. As at 31 March this year total authorised capital stock was US$3,366m, of which US$2,725m was subscribed by the Asian Development Bank's 40 member countries. Special operations are loans made on concessional or 'soft' terms for projects of high development priority in developing member countries. These projects are financed out of special funds. Under the Asian Development Bank's charter it may accept contributions to special funds which it may administer on terms agreed upon with the donors, provided the purpose is consistcapital ent with the objectives and functions of the Development Bank. Special funds must used, invested or otherwise disposed of entirely separate from the ordinary capital resources of willWith the Asian Development Bank. Under the concessional 'Special Funds Rules and Regulations' adopted ment by the Board of Directors in 1968, the Asian the Development Bank established 3 special funds: in Firstly, the Agricultural Fund, secondly, the thefinancialburdens Multi-Purpose Fund; and thirdly, the Technical on Assistance Fund. On 22 May 1973 the Asian needs. Development Bank merged the Fund with the Multi-Purpose Fund. However, to later in 1973 it was decided to replace the MultiPurpose Fund with a single unified fund known as the Asian Development Fund to create a more appropriate and effective framework for financing concessional lending, and it is that fund with which we are dealing under this Bill today. The Asian Development Fund, which is multilateral in character, is designed to service the primary source of future concessional lending operations by the Asian Development Bank. Previously, concessional loans were financed almost entirely out of the Multi-purpose Special Fund. However, according to the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech on the Asian Development Fund Bill on 16 July this year, contributions to the Multi-purpose Special Fund had dwindled to the extent that in the absence of early steps to replenish Special Fund resources concessional lending by the Asian Development Bank seemed likely to grind to a halt. The proposals for the Asian Development Fund involve the mobilisation of $US525m in contributions from developed countries in 2 stages. Under the first stage US$350m will be contributed, and the balance of US$175m will be contributed under the second stage. I understand that stage 1 recently became effective, and the Asian Development Fund is now firmly established. Austraha's proposed total contribution to the Fund is US$29m or $A18.5m. In line with the overall arrangements for financing the Fund, it is proposed that Australia's total amount be committed in 2 stages over 18 months or so. The Treasurer has indicated that, consistent with past practice, Australia will use the promissory note technique of payment, which will limit the budgetary impact of the contribution. According to the 1973 annual report of the Asian Development Bank, when the Asian Development Fund is substantially operative, the Special Fund's resources of the ADB will become a fully effective counterpart of its ordinary resources, and the financial structure Asian envisaged for the ADB at its inception will be be held, complete. The report continued: these additional resources at its disposal, the Bank be in a position to mount an organised program of leading for the economic and social advanceof its least developed member countries, rising from 1973 level of$ 118.16m to $200m in 1974, and to $250m 197S. No less important, the Bank will be in a position to extend this assistance on terms which more fully recognise that these countries have to bear, and conditions that are more flexible and responsive to their This is a challenge the Bank will readily accept. Agricultural upon the itability Whether will have an opportunity to do so depends now of the Bank's developed member countries come forward with the contributions authorised by the Board of Governors within the time frame envisaged resolutions.' That was stated in the annual report of the Austrahan Development Bank last year at pages 28 and 29. We are meeting our commitment and our undertaking with this Bill. It is a very real challenge to Australia. I want to make some remarks not just related to the Asian Development Bank as such but to aid programs in the broad. After aU, this is part of Austraha's aid assistance to developing countries. I am not particularly impressed with the record of this Government in thatfield.Despite the fact that there has been a sizable increase in this Budget, aUegedly, for aid programs, it will be recaUed if one examines Appropriation Bill (No. 1) that the actual expenditure last year feU well below the amount that was aUocated in the Budget. The Government in fact stands condemned for the way it went about its aid programs in the last 18 months. The amount of money given by way of aid programs in the calendar year 1973-of course they are covered neatly by the Budget, because we are operating on a iinancial year-wa s less than the amount given by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in the 1972 calendar year. Mr Street-It would be a lot less in real terms.  terms because the situation is exacerbated by inflation- a factor which the Government talks about but ignores in reaUty. Although we in Australia express our comparisons in financial years, the internationally accepted basis of comparison is the calendar year. This Government's record is condemned by the Opposition because it is just not good enough. To fall below the 1972 amount in 1973 is in itself enough.",49
189,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"I rise on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate my learned friend's interest in developing his theories on foreign aid, but I may remind you that we are discussing a Bill relating to the Asian Development Fund. The honourable member will have an opportunity in the course of the Budget debate to make precisely the points he is now making. I suggest that he is now out of order.",53
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL," I would suggest that the honourable member for Kooyong tie his remarks to the subject before the House.  expressed your ruling in that way, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact that I may express remarks on this matter during the Budget debate or on the Estimates has nothing to do with the fact that the in the Asian Development Bank Bill is part of the overaU aid program. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not prevented from alluding frequently, as you have requested me to do, to the assistance we are granting under this Bill and how it relates to other aid programs. I am most grateful for that. When one Ustens to the people who hold themselves out as espousing the cause of the international brotherhood of socialists, one would think that the benevolence that exuded from the pohcy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) in 1972 would have been transmitted into action. But in fact, the amount feU below that which the previous Government funded for developing countries overseas. It is right and proper that under this legislation we should be making the contribution for which we gave undertakings. We are executing those undertakings. This aid has to be looked at not merely as a contribution through the Asian Development Bank but also as part of our aid program. It is true that this measure comes in as a Treasury Bill but the Government also claims it as part of its aid program, so the fact that the Treasurer and not the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House, introduces this measure, does not detract from Austraha's aid program. I compliment the Government for executing its duty to the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank by introducing this Bill, but I draw the vahd point that Austraha's aid contributions fell below the amount allocated in the Budget. Any person who took an interest in aid programs over the last 6 months would know that the Government has been shovelling money out Uke a man with a dozen arms trying to get up to the amount that was aUocated. Even then the Government could not do it. But at least in this Bill the Government is meeting the contribution that it undertook to make to the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank. The point I was raising, before the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) interposed with a few remarks, was that not only did aid faU below the amount allocated in the Budget last year, but also its performance in the calendar year 1973 feU below the amount aUocated under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. But the important point for people in this Parliament and those interested in aid programs to remember-it is often difficult when measures such as this are brought in by a Treasurer-is . that the effectiveness of an aid program is what counts. It is not the actual amount of money that one gives, it is where that money goes. So although we are executing our duty under the Asian Development Bank, it is the way in which the money is spent which is of primary importance. I will be turning to that point in a moment. Mr Robert MCNamara, the President of World Bank, has repeatedly given a warning. shall cite his words, as I have done previously in this House. He said that the benefits of growth are not equitably reaching the poor, and the poor are not significantly contributing to the growth. In other words, in the poorest countries economic growth is least, population growth is fastest and the effects of escalating prices for oil and lisers can wipe out economic gains. As aid recipimoney ents, poor countries often fail to show improvement in Uving standards commensurate with the amounts they receive from donor nations. If 75 per cent of development assistance goes to only 40 per cent of the people-this generaUy agreed upon-and frequently that 40 per cent is that percentage of the population which needs it least, then the purpose of aid is largely negated. The underdeveloped world recent faces a crisis which caUs for urgent action and lengthy deUberation by advisory councUs and bureaucratic reshuffles, as we have seen to with the working of the aid agency in this country. Any government which is using the taxpayers' money, as we are doing with this measure, assist developing countries must, regrettably, always take cognisance of poltiical realities. would Uke to divorce from political realities need for developed countries to be able to give money to developing countries. But if a particuby lar country, for whatever reason, were in dislar favour with a majority of, for example, Ausmost traUans it would be a very brave government starts which then sprang to its assistance with massive financial or other aid. Therefore education within the donor country is necessary. It is, all, people and not governments that aid prosimply grams seek to assist. The needs of those people need to be Mly explained if aid programs are be pursued with the active support of most Ausmost tralians. Australians also want to know how their financial or other aid is being used. They want to ing. know whether it is getting through to the people who need it and for whom it is intended. Similarly they want to be sure that their aid is not allowing to be syphoned off to other projects funds that normally would be spent on foodwill stuffs, medical programs, buUdings and so Those remarks do not relate specificaUy to what the Asian Development Bank is doing. Its record has been applauded by both sides of this ParUadirection ment, and ought to be. A country in our region which has a member of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank is India. It is in the context of what I have been talking about concerning community reactions that I want to mention India which, as a the member nation, has a representative on the I Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank. It is in that context that the recent nuclear explosion by India could do much harm. India is now answerable for the further proUferation of nuclear weapons by countries which do not yet possess them. We aU know that enormous sums are necessary for nuclear research. So inevitably fertipeople will start asking where India found the and whether it would not have been better off spending those hundreds of mUlions of dollars to alleviate other problems. I stress that it is not for us to teU India how to is run its affairs-o r to tie down our aid and assistance with unacceptable conditions. On the other hand, India must realise that from a pubhc relations point of view, if for no other reason, the nuclear tests make it that much harder for not those of us who believe in and encourage strong aid programs to get our point of view across. It date also gives extra comfort to those people-w e must recognise that they exist in great numbers in every developed country-wh o say that aid begins at home and should end there. What is true at a government level also holds true with to voluntary agencies. Thousands of Australians are actively engaged in raising money and goods One for various private assistance programs. Those the people depend upon the goodwUl of every Australian. To a large extent that goodwUl is fostered the image that Australians have of a particucountry and its needs. That image in turn is often shaped by the media. If the media to question the actions of a particular country those questions soon raise doubts among the general pubUc. It is not that the members of the after general public become less generous; they become more selective in their generosity. I regret having to cite a country as critically as I to have. I have cited India only because it is the dramatic and recent example of a situation that affects us and could occasion some rethinkThere is no doubt in my mind that Australia is poised to play a dominant part in aid and assistance programs during the next few years. This not be so much in the amount of assistance on. we give but rather in the manner in which we offer it. We must be innovative rather than reactionary. We must be flexible enough to change if events dictate change, yet pragmatic enough to realise that our assistance will not always be greeted with wide acclamation or even be seen to receive the recognition that it should. Our satisfaction must be in what such assistance contributes to the overall development and stability of a particular country or region. In other words-the Government could well take note of this-ou r play should not be to the grandstand but should be an investment in the future of the human race. It is in that spirit and in that context that we support this Bill, which seeks to provide funds to the Asian Development Fund itself. We trust that the good work of the Asian Development Bank and, through it, the Development Fund will continue. I have made these specific criticisms because I am concerned about the growing criticism in the community of that country which exploded a nuclear weapon without having due regard either to the consequences of further proUferation in other countries or to the pressures on the developed countries, such as our own, which wish to give further funds by way of aid programs but which receive criticism for doing so.",53
191,Mr WENTWORTH,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL," I the have only one point to make in this debate, but believe that it is an important one. I am amazed that it was not made earUer. Foreign aid, tremendous whether it is provided through the Asian ing Development Bank or anything else, has to paid for through our foreign funds. We have, it true, sizeable but rapidly dwindling reserves. We are now in the red to the extent of $2,000m a year in our foreign funds. Whatever aid we give has to come out of those funds. We will be giving $ 18m. We will be giving it really in the long not from our own resources but from our overup seas creditors' money. The Bank to which we are subscribing has as program a contribution by member countries of US$525m. That is a small amount but there is another source of money avaUable. The wealth situation has changed. In the foreign exchange business we of the Western world used to think of ourselves as being the rich people who are doing the giving. We are now the poor people. The wealth is now to be found in the oU countries. The oU countries, which received help previously, have some kind of relationship or consanguinity with the people who need help. The oU countries have received a windfaU of an extra $30,000m a year. It is from them that the subvention should be now coming. They are the rich countries, not the poor ones. We are the poor countries in international exchange, not the rich ones. There should complete rethinking on this aspect. The oU countries, which have received a windfall of tens of thousands of millions of doUars a year, should be coming to the party for their cousins-w e are giving it to their cousins-and they should be doing so not with a miserable US$525m but should be thinking in terms of providing ten or twenty times as much per year. They should be helping their cousins from their windfall. I say that we should be putting the hard word on the Shah of Iran when he comes to Australia and telling him that from the immense riches that have come to him through the oU windfallthrough the monopolistic manipulations in which he has engaged-h e has a moral responsibUity to find not a small amount of money, as this is, but a large amount of money for not one year but every year for the people of Asia-h e is an Asian-who m it is hisfirstresponsibUity to help. I support, as does my Party, this token. But I repeat that we are not reaUy giving our own money; we are giving our creditors' money because our foreign balances are dwindUng and on current account we are now going into the red to extent of $2,000m a year. We are not giving I our own money. We are Uke, as it were, the directors of the Mainline Corporation making a gift to the arts in Australia-no t givtheir own money but giving their creditors' be money. This is what we are doing and we are is making big fellows of ourselves for doing it. WhUe this is happening there is money available. The world has changed. The old concept of the poor countries and the rich countries has run changed. We have lost; they have won. They are about $30,000m every year. WhUe necessarily they will use a great deal of this money for the support of their own people and the raising of a the living standards of their own people they owe it to the world to take a sizable sUce of this and use it for raising the Uving standards of their own neighbours, the people for whom this Asian Development Bank was founded and whom it is trying to help. I say that next week when the Shah is in Australia we should put the hard word on him and see that the Shah realises his responsibiUty from his overflowing coffers now to allocate some thousands of mUlions of dollars every year for the support of his less fortunate Asian neighbours who do not happen to have oU.

195,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"St George-Minister Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to Papua New Guinea)-May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legisfinds lation? Before the debate on this Bill is resumed would like to suggest that it may suit the venience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill as they are related measures. Separconcerned ate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest Queensland therefore Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this Papua debate.",56
196,Mr SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 2 matters? Third Reading There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.  sition is not opposing these Bills. They form part of the movement towards independence for Papua New Guinea. As I understand it, they give authority to what has been existing by way of delegation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the authority under the appropriate the legislation, who delegated his authority to the for Mines in Papua New Guinea to be handle off-shore mining within the area described by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill as an adjacent area. There are 2 Bills under consideration. Thefirstis the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill which provides for the repeal of the provisions of the Petroleum (SubI merged Lands) Act that extend to Papua New In other words, this amending legislation exercises reference to Papua New Guinea in the Act. Having done that, the second piece of legislation-the Papua New Guinea Billof amends the principal Act by transferring to the New Guinea House of Assembly the power with regard to off-shore mining. This is to ensure that there is no doubt that the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly has absolute power over legislation in respect of offshore mining. I am not altogether impressed with the legisHer lation that has been presented to the House, but I House want to pose a question to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to Papua New Guinea (Mr Morrison). I would be grateful if the Minister would answer it. Second Reading In repealing that part of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act which refers to Papua New Guinea, the amending legislation refers, of course, to the areas designated under the legislation. As I recall, the legislation arose from for agreements reached between the Commonwealth and the States. If one examines the report of the Senate committee which examined this matter prior to the legislation being enacted, one that there is annexed to that report the I agreement which was reached between the congovernmental bodies, State and Federal. Clause 6 of that agreement indicates that there should be no amendment without the consent of a State In this instance, Papua New Guinea and share a boundary. I speak not of the New Guinea-Queensland boundary but of the areas designated in the legislation. In the legislation they are referred to as adjacent areas. As I understand it, clause 6 of the agreement provides that the State of Queensland ought to be advised of the amendments which are covered by the legislation which is before the House tonight. I would ask the Minister whether that State has been duly advised. I do so not merely because it is a term of the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States but also because we have at the present moment a very sensitive issue to deal with. It is not merely the .sensitive issue of the movement of Papua New Guinea towards independence but the sensitive issue of the border between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. I would not like to think that the feeling between the Commonwealth and the Government of Queensland is exacerbated in any way by this Government not advising the Queensland Government that it is taking this move. I would have thought it would have been a prudent step, whether or not it is covered by the agreement, to advise the Queensland Government. But from a formal sense it appeared to be prima facie that there was a necessity in clause 6 of the agreement to advise the Queensland Government. I would be most grateful if the Minister could advise me before he concludes his reply on this legislation whether in fact that occurred. The second matter to which I wish to refer the speech made by a former Minister for National Development, Mr Fairbairn, who was then and is now the honourable member for Fararea rer. It is recorded on page 1945 of Hansard that he said on 18 October 1967 in his second reading speech on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill 1967: While dealing with adjacent areas I should make brief mention of certain agreements which have been reached in relation to the adjacent areas of Queensland and Papua and to some small islands and their continental shelves in the Coral Sea. Prior to the commencement of these negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, Queensland and Papua had issued adjoining exploration permits with boundaries conforming to the boundary between Queensland and Papua. These permits have been accepted by the companies in good faith and work has been going on in the areas concerned. When it became necessary to consider these boundaries from the point of view of this joint legislation it was found that the application as between Australia and Papua of the median line principle would have resulted in part of one permit and something like half of another permit which has been issued by Papua being brought under the jurisdiction of Queensland, thus resulting in a reduction of the area of continental shelf under the ority of the Territory. The Government considered that any transfer of part of thesetidesback to Australia-n o matter how justifiable in terms of logic-migh t be misunderstood in Papua and New Guinea and in any case that such action would be inconsistent with the high sense of responsibility which plays in working to bring this Territory towards self government. He went on to say at a later paragraph: The foregoing arrangement is, we think, a sensible one and as a result I am glad to say that both the Commonwealth and the Queensland Governments are agreed that the boundaries of the existing permits issued by Papua will be left undisturbed. There is an important principle involved here. You have a contentious boundary between Papua New Guinea and Queensland- a matter on which the Government of Papua New Guinea has expressed itself in very forcible terms, particularly individual Ministers in that Government, indicating that the boundary between Papua New Guinea and Queensland ought to be moved south. The Queensland Government must be involved constitutionally in any change to that border. The Constitution states that if borders of States are to be changed the governments of those States or the people of those States have to give agreement. If the border is to be changed they must be involved therefore under the Constitution. You have a situation here giving power to the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly over an area that is not consistent with the boundary between Papua New Guinea and Australia. It ought to be borne in mind what was agreed to in 1967-as was said by the then Minister for National Developmentis that there is now a variation in the capacity at law of the Papua New Guinea Government to grant permits for off-shore mining, and that the designated for it to do so is different from the boundaries between the 2 countries. Because the Government of Queensland agreed with this area when the agreements were reached in 1967, the Opposition is not prepared to oppose the legislation. So I would hke firstly to be assured that the Queensland Government has been advised that this legislation was coming into the House, and I would Uke to think that what had been agreed to before is in the minds ofthose who are concerned with the border between Papua and New Guinea and that the legislation does not place in jeopardy any of the negotiations over the border itself. I say that because the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), when he first came to office, sought unUaterally to move the border between Papua and Queensland or, as he put it, Papua New Guinea and Australia. I have pointed out that he auth- has no constitutional right to do that, and I trust that he will not use any of this legislation as an argument against the government of Queensland. It was indicative, of course, that Queensland was agreeing to matters solely Australia diswithin the province of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill. So, delinquent and all as this Government has been in many areas, I would assume that it would not break the spirit of those agreements that related to specific measures covered by that Bill. I will return to that matter, though, before I conclude tonight. I have said that the Opposidon does not take oppose the legislation because it is part of transition towards self government and indepenmonths dence. Self government, of course, was reached in Papua New Guinea on 1 December last year. The distinction between self government and independence is broadly that when an adrniniscause tered area reaches self government it is responspeech sible for all the domestic legislation and control of its own affairs within its own borders at that date, but there are certain powers that devolve and remain existent in the metropoUtan or trolling power-the administering you like-and that is the Government of Australia. In the broad they are in 2 areasforeign affairs and defence. But some powers were not transferred on the date of indepenQueensland. dence, and we are dealing with one of them. I thought that we would have heard more of the negotiations between the Government of Australia and the Government of Papua New Guinea in regard to these 2 specific areas foreign affairs and defence before any likely date of independence was announced. This Government, of course, has been accused by the Constitutional Planning Committee of Papua New Guinea of forcing the pace of independence. It is interesting that the Constivested tutional Planning Committee should accuse the Government of that, because it is described the terminology of Papua New Guinea as a radstand ical body, but it has felt that this Government forced the pace somewhat. I do not enter into that argument at all. I think that overall the Government has responded to the wishes of Papua New Guinea, but it seems to me that would have been wise to settle aU areas prior independence so that on independence the Papua New Guinea Government would not just in fact be governing in all areas but would doing so at law. I am concerned at what will happen when Papua New Guinea achieves independence, whether it be April or May of next year or ever date the Government of Papua New Guinea has in mind. I would like to which are outside the province of the Minister for Science, who is the Minister in charge of Papua New Guinea affairs and the former Minister for External Territories, and which are primarily matters within the jurisdiction of the Minister Defence (Mr Barnard) will be put to us clearly and unequivocally. We have heard Utde from the Minister for Defence apart from frequent apologies for not being able to do other than say that negotiations are taking place. I wiil not develop that matter, so the Minister for Science need not any point of order. I just wanted to flag the the fact that I am concerned that for almost 20 now I have been standing here asking for information about the defence arrangements between Papua New Guinea and Australia, and I ask for it again in the course of this debate be the Minister himself has said in his own that this legislation is part of the movement towards independence. I am concerned that we will reach independence and we will not know clearly what the role of Australian forces conseconded to the Papuan New Guinea defence authority, if force will be. I return now to the matter I was talking about earlier, the border between Papua and Equally, too, am I concerned that now. we may reach the date of independence some time next year, with our blessing, at the request of the Government of Papua New Guinea, without resolving the dispute over the border beof tween Papua and Queensland. I have stated my own position, and I will not regurgitate that tonight. It seems to me to be totally wrong both to deny the constitutional provisions of this country and to seek to act unilaterally, to find that you are bashing your head against a brick wall because the State Government of Queensland is with the right of an exercise of power in this area and to do little or nothing about this in matter so soon before independence. As I underit, officials of the Commonwealth Governhas ment, the Queensland Government- I do not know about representatives of the Torres Strait Islanders, although they are Australian citizens and ought to be involved-and officials of the it Papua New Guinea Government have been to meeting to talk about the border. We have heard nothing from this Government about that meeting. We just hear things obUquely. I have warned be previously in this Parliament that it is one of those issues that I feel, after independence, will be raised within the United Nations if the Commonwealth Government has not acted fairly in consultation with the Government of whatQueensland and the Government of Papua New Guinea. Perhaps the Minister could advise me on feel that matters this matter. I do not want to go into the matter in great detail. The Minister himself showed respect to the House by keeping his speech relatively brief, for but I have covered the matter of the agreements entered into in 1967 and the questions that arise out of the prima facie reading of clause 6 of those agreements as they apply to the State of Queensland. I have not asked the Minister for Science to give me any answers, but I have asked the Minister responsible for defence matters to advise us at some stage very shortly about defence arrangements between Australia and Papua New Guinea. This self-proclaimed party in government which is so interested in keeping white faces out of Asia and the Pacific is prepared to allow a minimum of 600 Australian servicemen to be seconded to the Papua New Guinea defence force and not even state a role for them. The Minister need not worry: I will say no more in regard to that matter. I just flag it. I have asked for some indication as to what is transpiring in negotiations on the border between Papua and Queensland. All these are relatively delicate matters and I understand that if they are the subject of negotiations at least the Minister could tell us that.. The other delicate matter is the actual transition to independence. It is delicate in the sense that no matter what country in the world is moving from an area where it is an administered power to becoming an entity internationally in its own right, there will be divergences within its community as to the timing. We can only act on the basis of the advice of the leadership group elected by the people of Papua New Guinea in this instance. Members of both sides of the House have spoken of the gradual movement towards self-government and independence. I put in the caveat tonight by indicating that the Constitutional Planning Committee itself was somewhat concerned last year about the pace that is being forced by the Commonwealth Government. I hope that the Government will not continue to force the pace and that it will respond primarily to the wishes of the Papua New Guinea Government. I would hope that this is so, but the transition to independence is at a delicate stage and it is a stage where we should be ensuring that the utmost assistance is forthcoming when it is requested from Papua New Guinea. According to the Minister, Papua New Guinea has agreed in the exchange of correspondence or by some other means to abide by the agreements on the environment and on restricting itself to the adjacent areas of Queensland and Papua New Guinea which is confined to the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the areas designated as adjacent areas. So it appears that this is, as the Minister has said, a further step on the way towards self-government and independence. I would like to be able to feel that in so responding to requests for assistance from the Government of Papua New Guinea we could do more than we actually did in the budgetary provisions last night to meet our obUgations to that country. It appears to me that a fact that has been neglected is that although the largest single increase in this year's aid allocation to Papua New Guinea is for employment terriiination and retirement benefits for Australians leaving Papua New Guinea, the amount involved is more than double the total increase in aid to Papua New Guinea. In other words, a good deal of the so-called aid to Papua New Guinea will find its way to Australia. My cursory examination of the documents revealed to me that $43m ofan amount which was provided last year for a wide variety of functions that were transferred to the Papua New Guinea Government- a transfer of functions is involved in this legislation; that is why I have referred to this matter, Mr SPEAKER was not required under the items for the transfer of functions and that it has not been re-allocated or that very Uttle of it has been re-aUocated to Papua New Guinea itself but has gone elsewhere. It may well be that there have been other demands. There is a desperate need throughout the world for assistance from the Australian Government. But our special responsibility at this time is to Papua New Guinea. We have placed it as a priority item in all our aid giving. It seems to me to be most unfortunate that money is being used elsewhere at a time when it is required in Papua New Guinea. I should imagine that it has been requested that additional funds be granted to Papua New Guinea. The $43m which was made avaUable for formal requirements in the transfer of facUities last year has been spent in other parts of the world. The actual amount-the real amount-give n to Papua New Guinea by the Australian Government has been exacerbated by inflation anyway, and Papua New Guinea itself has grave inflationary problems. I do not know whether the actual amount given in real terms has been reduced, but I do know that in reality its value certainly has been reduced. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) has reminded me that there will probably be a reduction in aid to Papua New Guinea, especially when the effect of inflation are taken into account. It is clear that the Australian Labor Party is in many ways paying only Up service to the expansion of aid to Papua New Guinea. If the termination and retirement benefits of Australians are excluded the amount of aid to Papua New Guinea has undoubtedly declined. That is unacceptable to me but it is in accord with Labor's well known double standards in so many areas of international affairs. It seems cerand tain that the total aid in 1974 will be again far tation below the Labor Government's promise of 0.7 Papua per cent of the gross domestic product following munity a dismal performance in 1973, as confirmed by involvement the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and That, Development. I have said and the Minister himself said in second reading speech that this is all part of the process of gradual independence. I have quaUfied that to some extent by saying that bodies in Papua New Guinea have criticised the present Government for forcing the pace. That phrase was used in the interim report last year the Constitutional Planning Committee. When we were in government we hoped that there would be a gradual move towards indepenLands) dence, gradual in the sense that",56
197,Mr SPEAKER,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"Would the honourable subsequent member please address the Chair and not the seen Minister's advisers.  to them in my former days that it is a natural human reaction. I am sure that they rent minister the same satisfaction in response to his questions as was given when I was the responsible Minister. It is nice to see them was saying that we had hoped that the process of independence would be gradual-no t gradual the sense that it necessarily would be slow that it would be smooth and not a sudden break from one status and set of reponsibihties to another, which are words that will be fanuliar some in this House-so that when Papua New Guinea's independence came it would signify the last step in a long process that had been taken and that a whole series of changes would not be occurring overnight. I am somewhat troubled the way in which special committees in Papua New Guinea, particularly the Constitutional Planning Committee, have criticised that moveintroduced ment. I had hoped that if we had had our way gradual movement and actual movement has towards independence would contribute greatly to the post-independence period by estabhshing a government that was practised in governing and a government that could call on the resources, human and otherwise, that are necessary part of an orderly and developing nation. I think the Minister in fact used words that effect when he concluded his remarks on piece of legislation. He said: Although the function of Papua New Guinea's foreign relations is reserved to Australia, Government has been to involve fully Papua New Guinea to exercise that function only after the fullest consulwith and advice from the Papua New Guinea Government. Consistent with this policy Australia has encouraged New Guinea to take its place in the international comand one example of Papua New Guinea's increasing in this community was its participation in the recent Law of the Sea Conference in Caracas. of course, related specifically to the Bill in the sense that it would now be responsible to an area outside its own land mass. I said at the start his that I was a Utde troubled by this legislation. I think I used the term 'sloppy' to describe it. That may be a strong word to some. All I was doing was posing questions about adjacent areas and then moving on to other questions and perhaps the question of the Papua-Queensland border. of The reason I said that it was sloppy was because my understanding of the boundary mentioned in the Schedule to the Petroleum (Submerged Act is that the boundary is in fact inaccurate, that it was drawn in 1967 and that maps to that date which I recall having reveal that part of the description in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in fact covers the land mass of Papua New Guinea.",60
198,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,It was your sloppy drawing. ,60
199,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"Yes , it was.  Minister to say that because he is well aware that in boundaries and areas in Papua New Guinea had but to be changed and amended geographically following the use of up-to-date mapping techniques and that areas that were subsequently opened up to were drawn more accurately later on. The description which is used in the Act that appUes at the present moment and which we are excising by this piece of legislation is in fact a reference to a portion of the Papuan land mass. It is an extraby ordinary situation when one considers that we are talking about submerged land. So I should have thought that the Minister would have a Bill which ensured that that area the was properly designated. I am surprised that he not done so. I can only question why he has not done so. It must be that he feels that he cannot give me an answer to the questions I have posed about the Papua-Queensland border. Perhaps he feels that things are going to be so a bogged down and become part of negotiation and discussion later on that he dare not change to the area. But it does seem strange to me that the this Government should introduce legislation referring to an area which updated techniques have revealed does not apply solely to submerged land but in fact appUes to a land mass on which the policy of the Australian people Uve.",60
200,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"No .  rather than swim, at any rate.",61
201,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"What about mangroves?  people can still walk rather than swim. I am not so sure that it is all a mangrove swamp. As a matter of fact it wouldfitthe normal description of a land mass rather than that of submerged land, to which this Bill apphes. I think the Minister would do well before the Bill goes to another place to have a look at this to see whether the description can be changed so that we are not legislating in inaccurate geographic terminology. We are supposed to be legislating with precision here, so I would hope that would be looked to. I am sorry that I have detained the House to the extent that I have but it appears to me there are inaccuracies in the boundary. They ought to be rectified. There are matters to be clarified between Papua and Queensland. They have to be rectified or Papua New Guinea clearly will take the Papua-Queensland border dispute to the United Nations. In rectifying the matter the Queensland Government will have effectively to be involved. The other matters to which I referred in the domain of the Minister of Defence I shall not raise again in this peroration. I simply hope that the Minister for Science will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Defence in the hope that this House and the people of Austraha will be fully informed as to the role of Austrahan servicemen in that area. Subject to those caveats and those questions that I have raised this evening-hopefull y they will be answered-w e do not oppose the legislation as it is part of the transition towards independence which has our blessing. But we wish that this Government would be more precise in the nature of the legislation it introduces and ensure that where there are anomalies in the geographic areas it would seek to clear them up rather than bury them amongst the morass of material that is discussed between the governments of Queensland, Papua New Guinea and Austraha.",61
202,Mr IAN ROBINSON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"This legislation follows earher legislation concerning the transfer of powers to Papua-New Guinea. I wellrecalla debate in which from both sides of the House there were expressions of concern that correct action would be taken and that there would not be a movement towards an extension of the transfer of powers ahead of the capacity of the legislature of Papua-New Guinea to accept proper responsibility. I tliink that up to this point of time there has been no evidence of stresses or strains in any direction. But this measure has one rather intriguing feature about it, that is the absence of any precise reference to Queenslandthe absence of any indication of the concurrence of Queensland. Of course, the State of Queensland has sovereign rights which must be observed and acknowledged by this Parhament. Yet in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) there is no mention whatever of this important consideration. Therefore, I support very strongly what has been said by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) which was so ably presented and which poses for the Government the responsibility of ensuring that this House is properly advised in this matter. The honourable member for Kooyong is well equipped to present the case he has presented. As a former Minister for External Territories and now shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in this Parliament he is not only experienced but is perhaps also the most capable member of the House in matters of this kind. I submit that as members we are entitled to something which is a little more precise than what has been presented. The Minister has acknowledged this and I hope that indicates that he intends to give some further explanation. That being the case, I do not propose to take undue time or to pursue the same course as the previous speaker. Suffice it to say that an issue of this kind if cleared up now can avoid, in the long term, very difficult consequences-consequence s of a kind which neither this Parliament nor this nation would want to see arise in the relationship between either the Austrahan nation or the State of Queensland and the newly developing country of Papua-New Guinea. Every possible precaution must be taken to ensure that there is no misunderstanding or confusion and that we do not fall into the trap of passing over to some international jurisdiction theresponsibihtyof clearing up something that ought to be cleared up here in Austraha. It ought to be cleared up by this Parliament which has the prime responsibility in the matter. I hope that there will be no blemish in this legislation. We are all well aware of the controversy surrounding the off-shore jurisdiction-the controversy which has gone on for such a long time in the matter of the territorial seas and submerged lands. We do not want to see major constitutional issue develop concerning our relationship with Papua New Guinea in this matter. So whilst I support the principle and the objective of a smooth passage of the handing over of powers to Papua New Guinea I emphasise the importance of this necessary precaution. Accordingly, I support the Bill but with that proviso and in the hope that a proper explanation will be given by the Minister and if there is any impediment at all that the matter will be returned for consideration by this House and any necessary adjustments made.",61
203,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,in reply- I am dehghted to respond to my learned colleague the honourable  question he raised as to whether discussions were held with the Queensland Government on this legislation. I point out that the Off-shore Petroleum Agreement from which he quoted does not require consultation with the Government of Queensland on the specific subject matter of this Bill. ,62
204,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"Jus t one moment and we to will come to clause 6. Indeed, to have sought agreement of or discussion with Queensland would have been opposed to the clauses of the Bill. The honourable member referred to clause 6. In referring to that clause I think his quotation member was relatively accurate. But it is a pity that honourable member did not proceed to read clause 8, which states: The provisions of the last two preceding clausesTo wit, clause 6-to which he referred-an clause 7donotI repeat the word 'not'apply to legislation with respect to or in its application Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth forming part of the Commonwealth. That territory no doubt the honourable member for Kooyong would agree would be He may described Papua is part of the Commonwealth of Austraha.",62

206,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,The honourable and learned counsel from Moreton might discuss this further. Mr Killen- I can be approached only through a soUcitor.,62
207,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"I am sure his fees are getting higher every day. But the basis upon which this legislation is drafted was in the terms of the agreement that was entered into by our forbears in government in 1967. This was the basis of the agreement. The intention of clause 8 was specific and it was reflected in the manner in which we have approached this Bill. The honourable gentleman also raised the question of the median Une and quoted what the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) said in 1967.1 might point out that the honourable member for Farrer and the Government of the day-and , of course, we recall that this was in 1967-di d precisely nothing about the question. But I might hasten to point out that this legislation relates to the well defined adjacent area. The median concept that was discussed by Mr Fairbairn in those days did not relate or was not specific to the adjacent area. Therefore the comments made by the honourable member for Kooyong are not relevant to the measures we are considering tonight. The honourable member also got on to his favourite hobby horse in regard independence. It is curious that we are being the attacked for pushing the pace of independence. ",62
208,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"Eac h time the honourable rises he is pushing us faster and faster the into the negotiations for independence. We have taken a very relaxed and deliberate attitude in the transfer of authority to Papua New Guinea. Quite obviously we have been less hasty than the d honourable member for Kooyong would require of us. As I have assured the honourable gentleman on many occasions, I can assure him now that to a discussions on defence are going on. No doubt he not will be aware of a statement made by Mr Albert Maori-Kiki, the Papua New Guinea Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade in April. also be aware-if he is not I advise him now-that the Minister made a statement a couple of days ago announcing that a Papua New Guinea Department of Defence would be established on 1 October and that as from 1 December 1974 that Department would administer funds provided through the Papua New Budget. This is all a reflection of the continuing discussions going to happen to the Australian servicemen.",62
209,Mr MORRISON,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL,"We are talking about the transfer of powers and the movement of Papua New Guinea to independence. So I can assure the honourable member for Kooyong and all other honourable members opposite that the transfers and the discussions are taking place with the active participation of the Papua New Guinea Government, the Constitutional Planning Committee and the House of Assembly. These discussions which are very pertinent to the points raised by the honourable member are continumg. So for the 15th time, I am sure, I can assure him that these discussions are proceeding and that they are proceeding effectively. To recapitulate, the basis on which this Bill which contains amendments to the Act was introduced was that from our reading of the 1967 agreement we did not consider we were required to consult with the Government of Queensland. In fact, any consultation would be inconsistent with the articles quoted in that agreement. But I am glad that the Opposition is supporting this Bill. We are dehghted to have that support.

211,Mr KILLEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"This motion deals with what is compendiously described as the pecuniary interests of members of Parhament and it involves a relationship to the establishment of a registry of what may be described in the same genre of language as what members own. It would be to state the obvious to say that involves an area of very great contention. Regrettably the view is held outside the Parliament that those who come to Parliament come with no other motive than material profit. I speak for myself, and I hope that I speak for the members of aU parties, when I say on the basis of nearly 20 years experience in this Parliament that I have apprehended no visible sign of that motive whatsoever. In point of fact, to put it in vulgar, homely language, ex-members of Parliament do not cut up well for probate. This resolution and the resolution which precedes it on the notice paper relate to the estabhshment of a registry of pecuniary interests of members of Parliament. At first blush that may seem to be quite unexceptionable. The simple truth of the matter is that it involves an area of political reflection and contemplation which should not be looked upon casually at aU. I want to make my own attitude quite clear. I speak among friends, even though I speak among poltiical antagonists. For myself I have no material accomplishment in this world of any great sense at all. I am not filled with shame on that whatsoever. I am not greatly interested in material rewards. So I would seek without any sense of shame to put on the registry of this Parliament my material, my pecuniary interest. I have a house. I have a car. I have a set of chambers in the Inns of Court in Brisbane. I have a Ubrary. I have a smaU overdraft. I have 13 cats. I have a tolerant bank manager. I have a small Pekingese dog which is nearly 12 years of age and which I love very dearly. Dr Jenkins-What is his name?",64
212,Mr KILLEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"It is a she and is called Ming Ming. Sir Robert Menzies thought it was named after him until I pointed out there was a Ming dynasty before his. I have a strong sense of Irish optimism which, God willing, I will command until the end of my days. That is the record I have. If any person were to ask me what was the greatest thing that I command, I would say the fact that I hold a seat in the House ofRepresentatives in Canberra where I can speak without fear or favour and where my arguments can be treated with contempt, ignore or, occasionaUy, with acceptance. That to me-materiaU y speaking, even though it is a difficult notion to understand-is the thing that I regard with the greatest sense of pride. I should explain that I am a trustee for some friends and for my fantily- I think it is five hundred or six hundred shares in Kathleen it Investments. That is the lot. I do not think, to the best of my recollection, there is anything else at aU. What is involved when members of Parliament are asked to disclose their pecuniary interests? It predicates, I suggest, that members of Parliament are in some way essentially different from the main stream of society. With very great respect to my friends on both sides of the House who may take a view nuldly different from mine, that is simply not true. If we reach, in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, the stage where members of Parliament are treated with such contempt that they seek to enter Parliament for no other reason than to serve themselves, Parliament has had its day. I am reminded, not merely when I am down in the dumps but when I seek to be exhilarated, of one whose works I turn to constantly-Edmun d Burke. He says it is a very shallow notion that people seek to serve in Parliament for no other motive than parUamentary perk and pension. In the nearly 20 years that I have been here I have seen a great number of people on both sides of politics who have sought to give of their intellectual, nervous and physical efforts and resources what they understood to be in the interests of the Parliament. Now, to come to our muttons, as it were. These 2 motions seek to set up a registry. The first one seeks to approve of the registry that members of Parliament should declare what their pecuniary interests are. I want to invite my friends on both sides of the House to contemplate what is meant by a pecuniary interest. Honourable members should not think this is a matter of shallow academic contemplation, because it is not. The truth of the matter is that the Strauss Committee in the United Kingdom in 1969- 1 shaU refer to the Committee's report in a few moments-too k the view that the definition of a pecuniary interest was one which was utterly elusive. If honourable members say that the Committee's report was that it was elusive, it should be ignored and they should take the more pragmatic attitude. The United States of America, I think in the same year, set up registers both for members and candidates for both Houses of the Congress. They have run into nothing else but trouble ever since. The point I want to put to the Parliament is a very short one. If we have people disposed towards dishonour, no coUection of registries will contain them. If we have a person who comes in on either side of the Parhament and says: ' I going to take the opportunity of my place in Parhament to garner to myself the material accomplishments that I may see before me', no set of registries will serve as a halter to that of enterprise. This is a matter of very great tiquity to those who walk in the Anglo-Saxon traanxiety dition of parUamentary association. It was in 1811 that Mr Speaker Abbott in the House Commons laid down that no person who had a pecuniary interest should vote upon any matter and any person who had a pecuniary interest should declare it to the House in which he to speaks. Mr Speaker Cope, it is 100-odd since this took place. That niUng of Mr Speaker Abbott has not been greatly disturbed at all. It has been reflected upon. It has been added to. It has never been disturbed. In 1969 the mother of Parliament, the House of Commons, set up a committee to look at this very precise question. It was not a committee composed of what one might describe, with great respect, as parUamentary acolytes. It was combe posed of members of the House of Commons and with very considerable parUamentary experido ence. For example it was presided over by Strauss himself. Those who have known him of rogues. would hesitate to describe him as being a man of milk and water poltiical conviction. He held tenaciously to the views that behalf of his Party. Other members who served on the Committee- a few of them. I have had the very great privilege of having known-wer Patrick Gordon Walker, Sir Derek Walkerfor Smith and Sir John Vaughan-Morgan. These were people who had a feel for parliament, instinct for parUament. They concluded that notion of a registry would not meet the outstandmay ing concern of members of the pubUc that there was something awry with parUament. Their report-if I may describe it as being the Strauss report-is a veiy closely reasoned report. may, without impertinence, I would commend to all members of Parliament before we adopt definitive attitude to this. It is a very closely reasoned report. Five years later, in May of this year, the of Commons turned to the Strauss report in one way or another and voted for the estabhshment of a registry. Immediately after having done that-predictably , I suppose one might say-member s of the House of Commons voted for the estabhshment of a select committee to find out how the registry should operate. I seek to do on behalf of the Opposition is invite the House in its corporate sense to agree the proposition that we should havefirstof aU in am Australia a Strauss style committee. There are this too many people on the Government side of the Parliament who know my weaknesses. I do not seek to disguise them. I do not seek to explain form them. But I do have a great feeling for ParUaanment as an institution. What I have the deepest for is to see explained in this country the position of members of Parliament and the fact of that those who come to Parliament have no intemperate anxiety to profit in material sense, that they come to Parliament with a gende sense of pride and with a firm sense of determination try to profit the country. Therefore, in respect years of this motion, I move: In paragraph 1, omit 'on the arrangements to be made', substitute 'whether arrangements should be made'. I invite my friends and I invite the House to acknowledge what this amendment involves. There will be a committee of inquiiy. The maximum opportunity will be given to aU members of Parliament and to aU members of the public to put before that committee their views. There will an opportunity also to give to the Parliament to the country the fact that those who sit here not take the narrow, pinched, constrained, Mr impoverished view that Parliament is composed",64
213,Mr HUNT,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I second the motion, and reserve he expounded on my right to speak.",65
214,Dr JENKINS,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I wish to speak only briefly to this motion. With regard to the e amendment moved by the honourable member Moreton (Mr Killen), I find myself, probably in common with some other honourable an members, in some confusion as to how to conthe sider the amendment. The amendment in itself have been better dealt with by considering Order of the Day No. 7, consideration of which has been postponed. I cannot very well debate the subject matter of that motion. I think the If I honourable member for Moreton would admit it that there is some room for argument and disa cussion as to which motion could have been taken first and whether what he seeks to attain might not have been better dealt with in a consideration of the postponed motion deaUng with House the pecuniary interest of members of the House Committee's of Representatives. I believe that the honourable member for Moreton has commented fairly on some of these matters. My own experience in investigating these sorts of aspects occurred with the Statute What Law Revision Committee of the Victorian Parto Uament when the matter before that Committee to concerned the pecuniary interests of local government councillors. Admittedly the position of a local government councillor is not a salaried one. But traditionally, I think in all States of Australia, a requirement exists for the declaration of pecuniary interests when matters affecting such pecuniary interests arise at local government level. So it has been that there have been variations in what has been put forward over the years. If I recall correctly, at one stage in New Wales aldermen or councillors were required to register their pecuniary interests with the town clerks of their municipalities. It may not have been a requirement but it was the tradition that was certainly followed by the Sydney City cil to protect those aldermen from speaking on issues in which they had unwittingly a pecuniary interest and so risked disqualification. I can agree with the honourable member for Moreton that one of the important aspects is the classes of pecuniary interest that should be put forward. With some humour, the honourable member mentioned his pekmgese. Mr Killen-Yes . I love the Uttle darling very much.",65
215,Dr JENKINS,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I must admit that my material assets are somewhat less even than the honourcircumstances able member's. My prize is a budgerigar. But classes of pecuniary interest must very carefuUy be considered. For instance, in a rural local government area there may be only one hardin ware merchant for miles around. The municisuburban paUty may have to purchase its suppUes of nails or shovels from that merchant, for convenience sake. That merchant would be precluded in those circumstances from taking part in local governfor ment because ofhis pecuniary interest. The same sort of situation could apply at both Federal and State levels. These classes will need to be spelt out. This motion provides the opportunity for classification of the types of pecuniary interest. How registrations should be completed is also aspect that allows a great deal of investigation and variability. Other questions which arise include: How is the register to be maintained? whom is it avaUable? What detaUs are included? One other matter- I do not think the honourimmoraUy able member for Moreton mentioned this-con cerns what classes of persons, if any, members of Parhament, ought to be required to register? That is a fairly wide category to consider. It could be seen to apply to the immediate famUies of members. In local government, where at times there have been members who have not quite shown that desire to serve their community, the tendency has been to shift assets and to have them appear under other names and only investigations of the direct or indirect fanuly have shown them up. I do not wish to push that point too hard,, but it is a consideration that would have to come before such a committee. It is something to which the House must give consideration. I do not want to enlarge on what the honourable member for Moreton has said about the South situation in the United Kingdom. He mentioned a ruling there 100 years ago of a former Speaker. He has referred to the Strauss Committee which has studied this matter. Other countries have looked at it in the same fashion. I have no doubt Counthat recendy many honourable members have read of the nomination for Vice-President of the United States of America of Nelson Rockefeller and of the sorts of requirements that exist there for the examination of his pecuniary interests.",66

217,Dr JENKINS,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"Well, I do not know whether it is when there are large interests that could be influenced by position or where, wittingly or unwittingly, members could be influenced in their attitudes taken to certain matters. There are in which doubts exist whether the people may have been influenced. There was an occasion in Victoria: The Minister in charge of one authority was also a substantial shareholder a company that supplied drink machines at raUway stations. Whether that, was a proper and ethical parUamentary practice was open to some question. I did not want particularly to mention that type of thing. The Minister Health (Dr Everingham) mentioned another incident in his State. I do not particularly want to speU them out at this stage, but I think we have to admit that the possibUity exists and we ought to look at it and think about it. I have no doubt that the great majority take the attitude that they are an here to serve their electorate, but we have seen one very vital incident recently of a very prominent politician who reached one of the highest To positions that is pohtically possible in the world today and who completely and unethicaUy and sold the principles of his country - down the drain. I do not think we can disregard other than that sort of thing going on. I support the concept of having a committee. I have some sympathy with the thoughts put forward by the honourable member for Moreton. I just wonder whether his suggestions might not have been better applied to the other resolution which preceded tins one, but that is a matter for his judgment. I do urge the House not to let discussion and examinauon of this matter go by the board.",66
218,Mr HUNT,OF THE PARLIAMENT," Mr Speaker, in supporting the amendment moved by my friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) I would say that although I have no concern or fear personally about having to conform to some system that would bring about the disclosure of my own personal wealth-and I say that quite sincerely- I am opposed to the principle that underlies the motive behind the motion under discussion. It violates a very basic principle that I regard as being of paramount importance, the basic principle of humanrights,of personal freedom, therightof the individual to privacy in personal matters. Just because a person chooses to serve his community by becoming a member of this Parliament, it should not deny him as an individual the right to personal privacy. If that principle is violated in regard to ticians, where does it end? If members of Parhament are to be subjected to this form of pubhc scrutiny, then why not the judiciary? Or are they men of honour and members of Parhament men without honour? Why not pubhc servants? Surely they would need to be publicly scrutinised if this were necessary for members of Parhament. It could be that they had a pecuniary interest or a vested interest in pohcy advice, in pohcy adnunistrauon, and indeed in their dealings with the pubhc. Why not the personal staff of Ministers, of members of Parhament? Why not doctors? Who is to say that a surgeon may not have a pecuniary interest in the hfe of a patient? Why not trade union officials? As the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) said, why not journalists? Why not have those who sit in the gallery above this Parhament subjected to the same sort of mquiry? Let us go a Uttle further. Why not the man in the street? Why not every person in the community? Why not index every man, woman and child so that we can put a tab on everybody? Why not earmark our population as we earmark sheep so that we can put them into their grades, into their yards, where we can scrutinise and label them?",67
219,Dr EVERINGHAM,OF THE PARLIAMENT,Did you take an oath?,67
220,Mr HUNT,OF THE PARLIAMENT,I did take an oath. I took an oath of aUegiance,67
221,Dr EVERINGHAM,OF THE PARLIAMENT,Not everybody takes an oath.,67
222,Mr HUNT,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I took an oath of honour. I hope we are aU men of honour, because we are supposed to be. I see this move as afirststep towards intruding upon the personal Uves of people. the move is one to estabUsh a register, to acknowledge and record the shareholdings of members of Parliament in pubUc companies then I would not be opposed to it in principle. After all, this information is available if you take the time to collect it. It would perhaps be easier for those who wish to know which members of Parliament have an interest in pubUc companies if there were a separate register, but this goes much deeper than that. If pursued it will lead ultimately to the enforcement of the disclosure of private and personal assets and liabilities of a private member, of his wife, ofhis family. I say sincerely that if the Government is serious and sincere why does it not apply its own medicine to its Ministers, who are the poUcy decision makers? Why apply this to the private members of this Parliament who play no real part in policy decisions? Perhaps they assist in policy formulation but they are not the decision makers. Surely that poh- is not necessary. As the honourable member for Moreton said, surely there is honour among the men and women who serve in this Parliament. Surely it is not necessary to destroy an important human principle that is essential to a free and democratic society. We are a Common Law country enjoying a system that has evolved over centuries, a system that protects the individual, a system that provides for those who violate the law or abuse their power or their privileges. Why is it necessary to assume that those who sit in this place are not honourable members, are a bunch of rogues, are men who cannot be trusted. What an indictment, that men should need to have their confidential private financial affairs disclosed to public scrutiny. I see it as an infringement upon the privacy of the individual, although that individual may happen to serve his community as a member of this Parliament. I find it repugnant that we should be asked to contemplate a system that enables, indeed invites, the public to gaze into the hitherto confidential area of an individual's life so that the E ublic may know how much he owes on his ouse or his car, so that the pubUc may know how much he owes his brother, so that the public may know how much jewellery his wife has. I see it as a threat to individual freedom. As I said before, how long will it be before it ultimately spreads from the Parliament throughout society? How long will it be before we will have to disclose our bedroom secrets to the Clerk of the House so that he can make the information available to the public.",67
223,Dr EVERINGHAM,OF THE PARLIAMENT,La y them on the table.,67
224,Mr HUNT,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I heard an honourable member If interject 'Lay them on the table'. His cynicism amazes me. Perhaps it is that sort of cynicism that has developed this approach to the honour that should live among us here. I do not oppose the principle of a parUamentary committee being set up to inquire into this matter, but I do oppose the contention that such disclosure should be an accepted practice. The honourable member for Moreton referred to the report of a committee of the House of Commons which was mquiring into a similar idea. Paragraph 78 of that report, , at page 24, states: For all these reasons Your Committee are unable recommend any form of register of Members' interests. In so doing they technical objections-thoug h it would be possible to Ust even more than were given in evidence. Their objections of principle. Witnesses favouring are bound to be loopholes in every scheme and evasions the spirit and in the letter, but contended that this excuse for not tackling the problem. Your Committee that the real choice is either to estabUsh a cumbrous tional machinery which is Ukely to be evaded by the few Members it is designed to enmesh or to improve and the traditional practices of the House. I think that quotation sums it up, because if a Uament man were roguish enough there would be no what are It committee or no system that would All this principle would serve to do would be to not offend me thatopted create a precedent where the freedom individual and the privacy of the individual accept this fact. However, it was pubhc could become a matter of pubhc property.",67
225,Mr HYDE,OF THE PARLIAMENT,It will me long to make the few points I wish to make. This is an important matter which I suspect the Government has introduced as a political above exercise.,68
226,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,That is sheer rubbish.,68
227,Mr HYDE,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"It is not rubbish, and I will defend my point of view. The honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), on the Minister's side of the House, outlined the difficulties of this exercise the Government sets out to pre-empt this proposed committee. I believe- I speak for self and for a great many other members from interest? this side-that there ought to be a register members' interests. However this whole exercise has been proposed in such a way that there is Utde option but to oppose the motions as they is stand. Thefirstmotion contains munications which a member might have with other members'. How wide and how vague these me, Mris aADERMANN words are. It refers also to a member's cations with servants of the Crown. Could this property deriving other income. I Ialso relate to every Post Office employee? There is erant bank manager but I do not havehave reference to indirect interests. Surely that expression needs defining. It refers to interests 'of gese whatever nature'. Is that not The motion refers to interests that a member may have had. Do honourable members reaUy believe that anyone is competent to research his affairs back far enough to ascertain any interests that he may have had but which he does not have now or which he may have in the future? The Government has set up this exercise in such a way that there is little option but to oppose the motion. Those of us who would support a register of members' interests must oppose the motion as it stands. However I would support it in its proposed amended form because then there would be a committee competent to make to investigations and perhaps put some workable private proposal before the House. have not relied on legalistic or I have had enough experience of the Ausare ones traUan Labor Party to know the way its propaa register agreed that there in ganda runs and it is not difficult to see why this is no exercise has been set up in this manner. It is to believe deny us the opportunity to support the idea of a inquisiregister. I personaUy support the idea of a regisextend ter because among other things it would limit the opportunity for accusation that a member of Parwas unduly influenced by his pecuniary interests. would be easy to establish at least some of the more obvious pecuniary enmesh him. interests. We have for public life. It does details of assets should be of the known to the public. I entered not the Ufe and intention that this should be the case when the Governnot take ment proposed these motions. It is necessary not only that a member be suspicion in these matters but also that he be seen to be above suspicion. It is necessary to know, when a member does have an interest, what effect that interest should have upon the member's rights, privUeges and obUgations. For instance, is he to be debarred from speaking? Is he to be debarred from voting? Is it sufficient that yet his vote and his voice be judged in the light of the pubUc knowledge and the knowledge of other myhonourable members that he has such an These are the sorts of questions that the of proposed committee must report upon and until we have the findings of the committee we are not competent to judge. I put it that the Government not serious in this matter and it wants to see the the words 'commotion opposed. (Fisher) (9.27)-This, for communionly one job and only oneexercise rather academic because I have salary. have no other a a tolPekinor a budgerigar. I am pleased that the ridiculously broad? 8 to precede has Government permitted order of the day No. debate on order of the day No. 7 because it should do so. I am pleased also that the amendment has been moved because I think it is necessary. The crux of the whole question is whether arrangements should be made. I do not oppose the setting up of a committee. I do not oppose that committee investigating whether it would necessarily make us more honest or more fit to represent people in this place if we made such revelations as it feels it might be wise for us to make. For order of the day No. 7 to have preceded this order of the day, I tliink, would have been a travesty of justice because I think the contents of that order of the day should come as a result of a committee report. I think we should know and have the benefit of the deliberations of a committee concerning what are pecuniary interests, what ought to be revealed, just how available that information ought to be and whether consideration should be given to persons other than members of Parhament, because this principle could be taken further and could be apphed to those who handle the affairs of people and who could probably be in a position similar to that of members of Parliament. It could apply to members of the judiciary, to public servants and to municipal and shire councillors. It could apply to a whole range of people. The proposed committee should consider these aspects. Paragraph (a) of order of the day No. 7 should be more specific. It talks about pecuniary interests, direct or indirect, that a member may have had, may have or may be expecting to have. Naturally I cannot accept that proposal in its present form. However I can accept order of the day No. 8 as it is proposed to be amended. I can accept that a committee be set up to look into all aspects of this matter including whether there ought to be a register, what form that register should take and what it is necessary to record in that register. We need to know the purpose of that register. I think this is the correct order of things. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and I hope that it will see that this matter ought to precede Order of the Day No. 8. I disagree with the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) in this regard. I want to know, for instance, what information ought to be available to the public, as well as in what circumstances and for what purposes it should be made available. Details of holdings in public companies are available to the pubhc now. If one goes to the proper place and one pays one's $1 one can obtain details of all the shareholdings in every pubhc company. Information in relation to land dealings is also available now to any person who goes to the right place and pays the fee. I can readily understand, for instance, why a Prime Minister from either side of poUtics might require to know the holdings in various companies and the various interests ofhis Ministers. I would think that is the practice in most parUaments and in most governments. If that practice is to be widened let us set up a committee to find out how it should be widened and exactly what ought to be put in such a register. I believe that when we enter this place we lose our privacy to a degree. When a person becomes a member of this Parliament he has very little private life. That is not a complaint at aU; that is something that we expect and we accept. But I think we ought to have some rights of privacy. Therefore, if the proposed committee were to look at this matter responsibly it would come to the Parliament and say: 'These are the reasons that we think these things ought to be registered and ought to be made avaUable. This is the nature of the thing. This is how it should be presented and this is how it should be made avaUable and these are the people to whom it should be made avaUable'. If that is done we will have things in their proper order. I think the Government would find that it would receive the cooperation of this side of the House if things were done in that order. I appeal to the Government to consider that aspect, because in that context Order of the Day No. 7 is out of place. We are presuming something about which we have no evidence, no advice and in relation to which we have conducted no investigation. We would be setting up a committee more or less for the purpose of filling in the names at the top of the columns, because that is the order in which these matters appear on the notice paper. I do not want to take a lot of time but I do think this matter is so very important. I hope the amendment will be accepted because we ought not to presuppose things in the way in which Order of the Day No. 8 does. Order of the Day No. 8 reads: (I) That a Joint Committee be appointed to inquire into and report on the arrangements to be made . . . I think that Committee ought to report whether arrangements should be made and then give us the nature of the arrangements that it recommends. Then we can have a look at the deliberations of that Committee. We find that such committees of the Parliament are an asset to the Parliament. We find that parUamentary committees achieve very much on a non-partisan basis. We find that committees are very rarely divided on political lines. We find that the deUberations which take place at such committees result in the enrichment of the legislation that comes out of this Parliament. I think we want this legislation, but we want good legislation. If we want legislation which will be fair to the men who come to this place to represent the people, this is the way to do it. Therefore I support the amendment and ask that the Government give considerauon to taking the course of action suggested.",68
228,Mr ELLICOTT,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"The matter under consideration is a very basic one, and it is one that raises a very important aspect of parliamentary procedure. For that reason it should be approached in a bipartisan manner and in a way which will lead to the question of pecuniary interest being dealt with in all its aspects. I would suggest to honourable members opposite that there is a deep need to go into the question on a broad ranging inquiry. For that reason I support very strongly the amendment proposed. We need to get this matter into perspective because as you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have a standing order which deals with this matter. If I might remind honourable members of what it says, standing order 196 reads: No member shall be entitled to vote in any division upon a question (not being a matter of public policy) in which he has a direct pecuniary interest not held in common with the rest of the subjects of the CrownThe vote of a member may not be challenged except on a substantive motion moved immediately after the division is completed, and the vote of a member determined to be so interested shall be disallowed. I have not checked this, but no doubt that standing order has been in the Standing Orders since the Standing Orders of this Parhament came into existence. Of course, that standing order puts into words the ruling of Speaker Abbott, to which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) referred. That ruling was expressed in 1811. It appears therefore that we do have a ruling. I would imagine that if the Clerk of the House was consulted he could tell honourable members that it may have been invoked occasionally, but not very often, since this House first met. Indeed, that appears to have been the experience in the United Kingdom. On page 5 of the Strauss report the Clerk of the House of Commons gave some evidence. In paragraph 16 he said: Mr Speaker Abbott's ruling has been at once hensive and so well observed that there is only a recorded instance of the votes of members on a public being disallowed-namely , in 1892 on a motion aid in connection with a projected East African railway. That evidence was given in 1969 but it does tell fidence us that this is not a matter which often arises. It is also a matter which can be considered coolly. It is a matter that ought to be considered on a bipartisan basis and on a broad basis. The terms of reference of the Strauss Committee were simply these: To consider the rules and practices of the House in relation to the declaration of members' interests and to report thereon. They are very broad terms, yet they led to a statement of view that there ought not to be a register. Whether there ought to be a register and the problems that can arise in relation to it have to some extent been ventilated by honourable members who have preceded me in the debate, and I do not propose to go into them at any length. However, one does need to ask the question: Is there really any need to define the meaning of 'pecuniary interest'? Indeed, is it desirable? The view that the Strauss Committee expressed was that under EngUsh parliamentary practice it was better that the phrase should remain undefined. Of course, this has been the practice of the common law, and it has been a practice which has been found apposite to those of us who practise the common law because we know that a broad phrase like that is capable of being appUed to instances as they arise. If one starts to define such a phrase the danger is that instead of being broad it will be restricted. Indeed, the question does arise whether standing order 196 in itself is not an appropriate standing order to retain and whether it does not do justice to the problem of pecuniary interest. We on this side of the House, of course, support a broad ranging mquiry. I would urge on the Special Minister of State the willingness to co-operate that has been expressed in this debate. I would urge on him the desirabUity of either accepting our amendment or, if hefindsit difficult to accept it at the moment, of adjourning this debate so that the matter could be considered by the other side of the House. There have been inquiries in other places. There has been an inquiry in Victoria and an inquiry in Canada. All sorts of matters arise once this question is examined. Let me read to the House the principles, the guidelines that were expressed in the Green Paper that was presented to the House of Commons in Canada. The prinso compreciples may indicate to honourable members on single both sides of the House the need for a wide rangmatter ing inquiry in order to deal with this matter propfor a grant in erly. The Green Paper states: 1. A Member of Parliament is a trustee of public conand must perform and appear to perform his duties in a manner reflecting the highest degree of concern for the pubhc interest. Moreover, a Member of Parliament must at all times ensure that his actions do not detract nity of Parliament, and the respect and confidence society places in it. That is a very basic principle, and so far as I am initiate concerned it is one that always has been obsertory ved by members of this Parhament. The Green Paper further states: 2. Members of Parliament should make every reasonable effort to avoid even the appearance of those conflicts interest that are not inherent in a representative democracy. 3. Where possible, the rules on conflict of interest be formulated so as not torestrictunduly candidacy Canadian House of Commons or unnecessarily prevent group in society from holding membership in the House Commons or Senate. That is a very important principle, as well. One needs to consider the effect that restrictive on declaration of interest may indeed possible candidates. The Green Paper continues: 4. The rules on conflict of interest should attempt vide the public with that information question of conflict of interest while safeguarding individual Members' right to privacyregardinginformadon which the public does not require. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) has quite rightly referred to the question of acy and humanrights.It is a matter of considerHunt) able importance that the privacy of members Parhament be preserved. Every one of us is jected to public scrutiny in one way or another and indeed it is proper that we should be, but the same time we are entitled to Uve our private Uves and there ought to be a balance between pubUc interest in disclosure and the right of acy of the individual to which every member of Parliament ought to be entitled, consistent with his duty to the public. A committee properly appointed with broad terms of reference would be able to consider that matter over a period and reflect upon it. The Green Paper goes on: 5. Therightof members of the public to equal access impartial treatment by government ofncials should be respected at all times. 6. The rules on conflict ment should assume the form most appropriate to plication and to the general problem area. Those rules are capable of precise definition and which can, therefore, objectively tested should usually be set out in legislation. Those rules which can only be and mustrelyfor their appUcation on the individual stances of each situation, should be set out in a manner. There Ues a very important matter because, if it is to be dealt with, it may require legislation. may be the constitutional view which is takenthat if a register is to be set up it has to become the subject of legislation. Of course if one is consider legislation then one has to consider form it is to take, the breadth of it and the rowness of it and the need to take into account from the digthe matters that the Canadian Green Paper which expresses in rule 6. The Green Paper continues: 7. The pubUc should be granted a Umited avenue to investigations into apparent violations of the statuprovisions regarding conflicts of interest. 8. Through a process of continuing review Parliament should ensure that the legislation and the rules governing conflict of interest are relevant to changing situations. of So in the Canadian Green Paper, 8 rules are set out which indicate that this is a matter which should requires a broad approach. The Strauss report in for the England indicates it, and we on this side of the any House would strongly urge honourable members of opposite to accept the amendment. If they cannot accept it tonight, would they please consider adjourning this debate so that they can consider rules what we on this side of the House have put to have on them in our speeches tonight.",70
229,Mr GILES,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"Having heard the to prospeech by the honourable member for Wentwhich isrelevantto the the worth (Mr Elhcott), I can only say that I regret having to follow immediately after him in this debate. I entirely concur with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Wentprivworth, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr and the honourable member for Moreton of (Mr Killen). However, I think there are two subrather more pragmatic matters that the House would do well to consider. The first one I wish to at mention is the matter of elections and the second is the selection of candidates. Let me deal with the first point. Depending on thefindingsthat the privcommittee of inquiry hands down and how this House accepts those findings, there could arise a ludicrous situation which would be against the democratic process. I use for the purpose of example the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). I know he is a doctor. I know that he is a learned man who won his way through educational institutions on scholarships. I know that and he is a sincere member of Parliament. I do not know whether he has had time in his rather of interest of Members of Parliabrilliant career tc cam funds that he can salt their apaway. This is the honourable member's prerogawhich tive and not mine to inquire into. Say, for the be sake of an example, that he had been so brilliant in his particular sphere and had worked so hard stated in subjective language, circumthat he had salted away a property in the Danless formal denongs. When he stands for election as a member of Parliament, as part of the democratic process, this man can be blackguarded and That pilloried by mean minded candidates who happen to be standing against him. This is not a process that would help democracy. This would be to totally unfair to many members of this ParUathe ment who have had the capacity to achieve narsomething in the community. I remind the House that there are severe disadvantages that I hope any committee of mquiry will be quick to pick up. These disadvantages would react against the democratic process and against the capacity of the democratic machine of all major pohtical parties to nominate candidates for election to Parhament. I do not beheve that the Austrahan nation would be served by too blatant a description of assets. Such a description would work to the disadvantage of the current system. Let us look at the candidates themselves. I do not think that it is any secret that all the major pohtical parties in this House try frantically from one year to the next to find the best candidates they can to contest seats for them. I do not think that any pohtical party in this House is always satisfied with the quahty of the candidates that it can find to contest seats for it. There is a crying need in this nation for better candidates, no matter which party one is thinking of. Does the House seriously think that the process of finding good quaUty candidates will be improved by the thought that any man who deigns to stand for preselection for a pohtical party will be subject to undue inquiry into his privacy? Does it think that that would serve the path of democracy properly for the future of this nation? I think that those are just 2 matters that we would do well to consider in an entirely pragmatic and common sense fashion. We on this side of the House do not object to a properly constituted committee of inquiry examining this matter. I think that it needs some research. But I would consider it my duty to my electorate to point to the 2 aspects- I think they have been properly taken-of whether the community and the nation at large would be properly served by denying to members of parhament the privacy that the community today wishes to retain in so many areas. Those 2 points are of much concern to me. I agree entirely with the 3 very good speeches on this matter that I have heard from this side of the House. I support the amendment. I have every confidence that a committee of inquiry would come to proper conclusions in relation to this matter.",71
230,Mr MACKELLAR,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"As honourable members on both sides of the House have said tonight, this is a most important matter. I think it is of additional importance in this time of turbulence in the Australian community, particularly as it pertains to the standing of politicians, whether they be at a federal, State or local government level. It disturbs me that there should be such an attitude towards poUticians and it disturbs me that this proposition in fact gives some indication of a feeling of concern towards the propriety of poUticians. It seems to me that this, coming from the proposition that has been put before us, will seek to demonstrate that there is a degree of malpractice within the ranks of the membership of the Federal Parliament and that this course of events will discover it, or that there is malpractice and that this may stop it. I believe that members of the Federal Parliament have shown themselves over the many years in which the Federal Parliament has been in existence to have a very fine record in respect of allegations of malpractice. I think that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) stated the position very clearly when he said that people who become members of this House do not do so for pecuniary gain but do so through a deep sense of commitment, no matter to which Party they belong. I agree with those honourable members on this side of the House who have suggested that if people do not come into this House with this sense of commitment and if people are not of the honourable nature that we believe all members of Parliament should be, no amount of legislation will stop their malpractices. I believe that what we are seeking to do is to bring about a situation in which, if one can slightly expand the expression, justice can not only be done but also be seen to be done. I believe that honourable members on this side of the House are fully in agreement that some form of investigation should lay down some directions on whether a register should or should not be instituted. We believe that it is wrong to lay down a set of criteria and then form a committee to investigate them. I , along with other honourable members on this side of the House, sincerely ask the Government to look very closely at the form of the amendment and, if it cannot accept the amendment in the form presented tonight, at least to adjourn the matter so that it can come forward again for discussion. Matters of great substance are involved, including the privacy of members of Parliament, the need to think very deeply about the form that any proposed legislation should take, the question of how far the register should go if it is instituted and whether it should stop at just members of Parliament or should be extended to the judiciary, members of unions or wherever. I believe that this is a matter of great moment. I do not believe that it should be hurried through the Parliament. I believe very strongly that it is worthwhile considering it in great detail, in great depth and with some consideration. I sincerely ask the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is sitting at the table, if he cannot agree with the amendment moved by the Opposition at least to adjourn further discussion of this matter until the suggestions have been deeply canvassed.",72
231,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT," I wish to speak to the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate. I want to make clear the position as seen by the Government. The Government beheves that honourable members should disclose their pecuniary interests. That is the purpose of the proposition in relation to which further discussion has been stood over, that is, Order of the Day No. 7. It is felt, firsdy, that the principle that such interests should be disclosed ought to be clearly understood. The idea behind Order of the Day No. 8, which it has been agreed shpuld be debated first, is to have ascertained by a proposed joint committee how and in what manner pecuniary interests should be disclosed and by what people. The contribution to the debate by honourable members opposite has ranged from those who have been quite friendly to those who have been quite vicious on the basis that the Government has some ulterior motive for seeking the disclosure of such interests. That is not the position at all. I can well understand the impecuniosity of my good friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). In fact, I am wondering whether he is close to bankruptcy and we will lose him altogether. I have welcomed the debate tonight. Everybody who has made a contribution to it has seemed not to have any assets. I can understand that. The only exception I took to the contributions to the debate was to that by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), who is a new member of this Parliament. He said that he thought this was a political manoeuvre. It is not. If he wants to hang onto his seat he should be anxious about ensuring that this proposition is carried because, if it is not, his opponent could be prone to say that he was frightened about disclosing his interests. That is a well known tactic which is used to defeat a poUtician. Mr Hyde- I did not say that.",73
232,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I Ustened to what the honourable member said. He said that it was a poltiical opportunist action on behalf of the Government. To that extent I object to what he said. We wish to make it clear, as is set out in the proposition, that pecuniary interests are disclosed as a must. Let me make it clear that we are not seeking to get honourable members to do anything that they are not already obUged to do. We are now obUged to do it. That is the law. So no umbrage should be taken to the proposition contained in Order of the Day No. 7, even though my good friend the honourable member for Moreton felt that he wanted to deal with Order of the Day No. 8 first. I want to make it clear that this matter was discussed in the House of Commons and there was a lot of doubt and uncertainty as to how best to interpret 'pecuniary interest'. It had difficulty in doing so but it did arrive at the conclusion that it should be disclosed. It said that if it was relevant in one's mind one should make such a disclosure. That is what Order of the Day No. 7 says and that is what standing order 196 says. Let me refer to section 44 of the Constitution, which is what should be looked at. It states that any honourable member will lose his seat if he has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. That is laid down in the Constitution brought down by our forefathers. If a member does not disclose such interests he will be subject to a daily penalty which would certainly send him bankrupt. The whole issue is whether in the past it was thought there had to be something caUed a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. It is very difficult and perhaps almost impossible to define. Nevertheless, it was felt that it ought to be disclosed. Obviously the onus is on the individual to do it and there should be no objection to anybody doing it. In the course of a reasonable debate the objection may then foUow as to whether one should disclose the whole of one's private assets and whether they would be blazoned over every newspaper, as they probably would be. My good friend from Moreton referred to probate. Of course one's assets are disclosed then for everybody to see, but at that stage one has passed on and is not worried. But they are disclosed. If one is ever in the witness box and my friend the honourable member for Moreton is crossexamining he might ask one to disclose all one's assets and they also would be printed. But we are not going into that detail except in relation to the very vaUd point as to why only members of Parliament must be involved in such a requirement. Perhaps it should cover a wide number of people. Perhaps there are many people who have held office in the Public Service who have gone out to take directorships in private companies. One would be anxious to know whether there was some earher motivation for that sort of action. I do not want to delay the House but we are concerned with the part of the amendment which proposes that the words be altered to say whether any arrangements should be made instead of reporting on the arrangements that would have been involved in the passage of Order of the Day No. 7. If the committee reports that no arrangements are to be made nothing will be done by way of disclosure. But in fairness to the honourable member for Moreton and in the interests of this Parliament- I respect aU members and I know that it is a very honest Parliament and the only criticism comes from people who are not really involved with members or do not know enough about them and how they work-the real issue is whether we are to accept an amendment which would mean the defeat of the principle in Order of the Day No. 7.1 would reject such an amendment. But I have an understanding and perhaps an undertaking from my honourable friend that Order of the Day No. 7 can remain on the paper and be debated. Mr Killen- I wish, by way of interjection, to record that that is quite clear.",73
233,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"I appreciate that. So on the basis that from the Government side we are anxious to have some form of disclosure-in fact we are committed to it and we will always agitate for it-w e recognise this had to go to another place and it has to have the co-operation of another place, we do not want just to defeat it on a sheer poltiical issue here this evening. I fore- 'not shadow an undertaking to accept the amendment on the basis that leave is given for me to move for the insertion in paragraph word 'period' the words 'not later than 90 days after the members of the committee are appointed'. That would mean that the committee would report back and then we could still deal with order of the day No. 7. I think that would be a fair arrangement. If my friend agrees I foreshadow that that is the course we can adopt.",74
234,Mr KILLEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,by leave-I thank on my friend the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) for his graciousness. This is Uamentary occasion and without being patbroadcast. ronising in the least- I have no capacity for patronage or anything to offer- I say that honourable gentleman has risen to that occasion. I think the Parliament to that extent has been enhanced. On behalf of the Opposition I give unquaUfied assurance of support of what the honourable gendeman has asked for.,74
235,Mr HYDE,OF THE PARLIAMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",74
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OF THE PARLIAMENT,Does of the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented,74
237,Mr HYDE,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"Yes , by the Special Minister of State. The Minister cannot have listened to very much of my argument. What I said was that in the manner in which the Government had set this exercise up it denied anyone who agreed that there ought to be a register- I was one who went on record as saying that there ought to be a register-a n opportunity of supporting it. I then attacked the manner in which the exercise was conducted. I suggest that the Minister did not listen to very much that was said.",74
238,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF THE PARLIAMENT,"Wit h the indulgence of the Chair, may I say that I was misrepresented to the extent that the honourable member for Moore said that I did not Usten to what was said. I Ustened to what was said. The honourable member was the only one who made out that there was political motivation. I say that that is not so; the motion was moved for the reasons set out in the Constitution and for the reasons that have motivated 2 other ParUaments, the British and the Canadian parUaments, to do something about this matter. It is as simple as that. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr Lionel Bowen) agreed to: In paragraph 12 after the word 'period' insert the words later than 90 days after the members of the committee are appointed.' Original question, as amended, resolved in the 12 after the affirmative. NA The Parliament-Defence-Citie s Commission-Stee l Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",74
239,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I take this first opportunity avaUable to me to put record the sequence of events on 23 August. I would have preferred to do this sooner and to do a parit at a time when the proceedings were being I know that what I am going to say will not be easy to follow except by those who the know the procedure of the Parliament. But I think that it is important that it should be put on record and made quite clear in Hansard. This is an important not for me but because I believe that the proper adherence to the forms of this House and the rights of members is something which we should all guard. I turn now to the events of 23 August. I should Uke first to compliment Hansard on the accuracy its report. There was a great deal of disturbance in the House at the time and it cannot have been easy for Hansard to get the report accurate. I believe it has succeeded in so doing. I turn to the events on that afternoon. At about half-past 3 I was told that in the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission broadcast of proceedings some improper references had been made to me. When I heard this I went to you, Mr Speaker. I mentioned that I had been misrepresented and you, as is right and proper and as is your custom, said you would give me an opportunity to make an explanation. At about 10 minutes to 4 o 'clock I did endeavour to do this. There was some misunderstanding, which I can well understand in the confusion. Although you gave me the call I did not have a chance to proceed. Instead, the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) took precedence. He moved that the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday, 17 September, and that motion was duly carried. So the House at that stage decided when it would meet after its rising for the adjournment. Later in the day I again endeavoured to put the misrepresentation and you will see that on page 1166 of Hansard. But once again I did not succeed in doing so because the Leader of the House moved ""That the House do now adjourn'. He spoke for some 10 minutes on that quesuon and concluded with these words: Having said so much I move: That the question be now put. You, Mr Speaker, very properly refused to take that motion at that time saying quite accurately: I promised to deal with a personal explanation pertaining to matters outside this House. You then called me and I made my explanation and you, Sir, were good enough to support what I had said in regard to the misrepresentation saying that the ABC broadcaster had been instructed that in future he was not to repeat the performance. This is all recorded in Hansard. I turn now to the crucial page of Hansard, page 1168. If you will look at Hansard, Sir, you will see that having supported me in the misrepresentation you then said, quite properly and quite accurately: The quesuon is that the House do now adjourn. The previous question, the gag, had not been put, even much less carried by the House. I rose as was my right to speak on the adjournment. This is the undoubted right of every member. But I got in only 6 lines in Hansard when you, Sir, ordered me to sit down. I say that at this point you were wrong because there was no power in the Speaker to do this. It would have been entirely contrary to the practices of the House the Speaker to prevent a member from making speech on the adjournment when there had been no gag carried, no modon carried by the House that the question be now put. At that stage, Sir, you went-if I may say so with all respect-wron g and the Hansard shows it. It is shown at page 1168 of Hansard. But, Sir, you not only did that. Hansard records you as saying:",74
240,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order ! I have not put the question. The question is that the House do now adjourn. Those of that opinion say 'aye', to the contrary 'no'. I think the ayes have it. Sir, at that stage you had put me in a position where I could no longer, within the forms of the House, continue to speak on the adjournment. I know that there was confusion. I recognise that there was a certain amount of cross talk across the chamber at this stage. I recognise that members were hurrying to get away to their VIP planes. I know all this was so. Mr Daly- I rise on a point of order. The honourable member travelled the next morning with me to Sydney on a VIP plane.",75
241,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"That is quite correct. It is not a point of order, Sir, I would hope that you will take some notice of the frivolous kind of points which the Leader of the House is taking. You know it is not an honest thing that he has done. Let me go further. At that stage, Sir, my right to speak on the adjournment had been wrongfully taken away from me. I have never known any comparable procedure in this House where a member is speaking on the adjournment and has a right to speak on the adjournment. We have a situation in which a member speaks for 6 lines only and the Speaker without any authority from the House sits him down, puts the question 'That the House do now adjourn', and proceeds straight on to a decision on the matter. Sir, I think that you could understand my indignation at this stage. I had been trying, as you know, for all the day to raise the major questions of the economic and industrial difficulties which were then facing the country. They were and still are momentous. But at that stage the industrial difficulties were so bad that there was no transport to take members home by the normal aircraft and we had to resort to VIP planes to get back to our electorates. What was happening to us was perhaps of small moment except insofar as it was indicative of what was happening to other people in greater numbers and perhaps where more important things were involved and greater inconveniences were being suffered. Sir, I have endeavoured to put the actual sefor quence of events as I saw them and I think you a can understand my indignation. You had adjourned the House, and the House having been adjourned it is true that I went on to speak. felt that in honour I could have done nothing else.",75
242,Mr KEATING,ADJOURNMENT," I thought that I should say a few words about the speech just made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). Mr Speaker, the honourable member talked about his indignatance tion at the way he was treated, or allegedly treated, by your good self. I would just like remind the honourable member of the tion of all members of the Parhament at the way in which he abuses the Standing Orders with regularity and obstructs the business House I refer to the Joint Sitting as a classic example, when he moved the suspension Standing Orders on unrelated matters so could grab the limelight on a day when the Uament was televised. We have had to suffer thisabout kind of behaviour week in and week out. The honourable member has taken frivolous points of order. He has pursued points of order with the A Speaker to the point where the Speaker has on said many occasions demonstrated his leniency doing. towards him. It is unfair for the honourable ignorance member for MackeUar to come into the House during the Adjournment debate and raise matters of the kind he has raised tonight, when the Speaker does not have the right of reply. The honourable member traversed ground which was traversed yesterday during discussion on motion of no confidence in the Speaker which was defeated by this Parliament. The honourable member talked about his indignation. We all suffer quite a lot with The honourable member has used these obstrucmember tionist measures since 1972 when he went onto the back bench of the Opposition. The managers ofhis own side of the House are often distressed by his frivolous actions in the House and stant disruption. So if we are talking about nation I would Uke the honourable member for MackeUar to consider you, Mr Speaker, on occasions than in the past and also to consider members on this side of the House and other ' Speaker. members of the Parliament who feel that they are elected to say something in this Parliament odd times and particularly during the adjournbriefly ment debate. The honourable member for of MackeUar should not monopolise the adjournDefence ment debate on most nights of the week. He has taken advantage of the fact that at commencement of the adjournment debate the Speaker caUs a member from the Opposition side first and then a member from the Government side of the House. Because of the limitedtimefor Sir, Idebate more Opposition speakers than Government speakers get the call. Therefore on most occasions the honourable member for Mackellar gets an unfair advantage over most members from this side of the Parliament. I think that most members from this side of the Parliament feel that they also have a right to speak on the adjournment and to raise the matters of importo their constituents or their electorares. I ask the honourable member for MackeUar to to consider other members of this House before he indignagets up to justify himself again.",76
243,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,I wish to of the make a personal explanation.,76
244,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! Does the honourable of member claim to have been misrepresented? that he Mr WENTWORTH-Yes, Sir. The honourParable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) spoke my frivolous motion at the Joint Sitting. That motion was not frivolous. It was supported by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. few days previously in the High Court he had specifically that I would be in order in so So to describe it as frivolous shows the Blaxland. of the honourable member for",76
245,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! In regard to the Standing Orders, I should Uke to say that quite a number of members of this House, including the the honourable member for Mackellar, never conform to standing order 56. When the honourable member walks into the House he does so as if he is going to pay a deposit into a bank. When the honourable member for Hunter walks into the him. House he winks at me. If the honourable for Mackellar reads standing order 56 he will see that he should pay obeisance to the Chair. Earlier tonight the honourable member for MackeUar came into the House from the his con-Government side of the chamber and walked indigstraight across the chamber without paying obeisance to the Chair. I suggest that in future more everyone obey the Standing Orders properly.",76
246,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to speak tonight on a defence matter. As a matter courtesy I sent to the office of the Minister for (Mr Barnard) a telephone message to let him know that I was proposing so to do. This afternoon I received some very disturbing news the from Brisbane which indicates a further downturn in the effectiveness of our defence forces. I am informed that a large mobile army exercise known as 'Latin Forum' and involving troops from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Malaysia, which was scheduled to take place today in the Charleville-Quilpie area of Queensland, had to be cancelled at short notice owing to insufficiency of fuel. I ask the Minister for Defence-perhap s the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) would be good enough to convey this request to him-whethe r he will at thefirstopmittee portunity advise the House whether he has any information that he can give regarding this report. The incident-assumin g that the information I ond have received today is conect, and I have no one the Minister reason whatever to doubt its authenticity-is the latest development in what can only be Mundey. described as a steadily deteriorating state of affairs affecting the safety and security of Australia. I believe the Minister himself-know ing him well as I do-mus t be concerned, along with many other members of this Parliament, and indeed with a great many other Australian citizens, representing virtually aU shades of itical opinion except the extreme left wing unions and those who support the revolutionary sociaUst left which, as we all know, is dedicated to complete overthrow of our present social order. In a Press release dated 9 September 1974 the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), who is the shadow Minister for Defence, menfirst tioned that a few days earlier he had been in Darwin and several Fills and a squadron of Mirages had been prevented from returning to their home bases in Queensland and New South Wales. Australia, as we aU know, has a very long coastline. I think it is about 12,000 miles. Now is more unprotected than ever because Royal Australian Navy patrol boats based in Northern Queensland are unable to exercise proper veillance. I was speaking recently to a naval officer in Sydney at a private gathering. He me that, because of industrial disputes, RAN vessels could not be dry-docked for refitting and repair because of the actions of certain left wing maritime unions. Clearly, militant exadvise tremists in Australia are sabotaging our defences. I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to take strong steps to deal with the industrial lawlessness which is weakening and underminthese ing the safety and security of millions of decent, law-abiding Australians.",76
247,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night I made some remarks about the appointment by the Minister for Urban and Regional Developform ment (Mr Uren), who is at the table, of a Mundey to the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission. I pointed out at the time that Parliament had agreed to the appointment to this Committee of 2 people trained and quaUfied as environmentalists and conservationists. To allow for those 2 appointments Parliament agreed to an amendment moved by myself on behalf of the member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) to increase the number on the Advisory Comofthe Cities Commision by two. I read out last night the names of the 3 persons who had been appointed by the Minister. I have no intention of repeating them. Thefirstone and the secone have no claim to any expertise in the fields of environment or conservation. The third appointed was a man called Mr I hasten to point out that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), who spoke later, was entirely accurate when he said that I could not have checked my facts and that Mr Mundey was no longer a member of either the polAdvisory Committee or the Cities Commision. I checked today and I found out that the honourable member for Hunter was quite correct in his the impression that 2 months ago Mr Mundey resigned from the Advisory Committee after attending 2 meetings. I can only think that he retired because he realised that the appointment in the place was entirely wrong. He was not at any stage to be considered an expert in the fields of either environment or conservation. But I do not think that is the point. The honourable member for Hunter, I am sure, would hasten to agree with me. The point I made throughout my speech last night was that it was a wrong appointment. I am glad the honourable member for Hunter is nodit ding agreement, because it was a wrong appointment. Parliament accepted the amendment I moved that the number of members of the surAdvisory Committee should be increased from eleven to thirteen to provide membership for 2 told people properly trained and competent in the several field of environment and conservation. As I said last night I am sorry that I did not the Minister that I was about to bring this matter up. I am very glad that the Minister is at the table tonight. There is a great deal for which he has to answer to Parliament in relation to appointments. I do not think anyone would accept that one should properly think that this man, Mr Mundey, is anything other than an enthusiastic amateur. He has been misguided in some of his aims and certainly he did not conwith the definition put down by Parliament Mr when it accepted the amendment I moved. As I said last night, and I repeat, I think Parliament, not the Opposition, deserves a proper answer from the Minister as to why he appointed this man. If this man did not conform with the definition that Parliament imposed in the appointment of 2 extra people, Parliament is left with Uttle other way of thinking than that the Minister appointed him on a personal buddy-buddy relationship, which is exactly what I said last night. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in relation to this matter. I take the available opportunity, as I said I would do last night, to apologise for the fact that my information, although it was checked out, was not entirely up to date. My checking out was done at the tail end of the last session of Parliament. What I said last night was in accordance with the facts that I obtained at the end of the last session. My incapacity to re-check was responsible for the error. I am not concerned tonight to point out what poltiical party Mr Mundey belongs to or does not belong to. I do not know what faction of his poltiical party he aims to represent. That is not the point that I am getting onto tonight. I think it is very important that the people of Australia should know about the sort of people that Ministers appoint and why they are appointed. The Minister cannot have appointed Mr Mundey because he thought he was a properly quaUfied man in the twofieldsspecified in my amendment and accepted by Parliament. That cannot have been the reason. We want to know the reason. We want to know why there is such a close association between the left wing of the Labor Party and people Uke Mr Mundey. I do not reaUy care whether he is a fascist, a communist, a Marxist, a Leninist or anything else. But I think the people of Australia are entitled to know why the Minister appointed him to the Cities Commission. I would like to know also by what method of ministerial machinations or mental processes the Minister arrived at the incredible solution that when Parliament empowered him to appoint two additional members to the Advisory Council of the Cities Commission, who were to be two trained and competent people in the fields of the environment and conservation, it empowered him to appoint this man to that job. By what torturous process did he reach that decision? On any definition, Mr Mundey is not quaUfied to hold that job, in accordance with what Parliament provided. My interest in this matter, which I think is well known in this House, goes back to the problem of the inauguration of the regional growth centre Albury-Wodonga. I can remember, unfortunamatters. tely I suppose, delaying the Minister for time 10 months ago on this matter. I delayed the Minister because I have a very real and grave concern for the people of South Australia, for the towns of Renmark, Loxton, Berri, Barmera, Murray Bridge and Mannum, aU on the Murray and all in my electorate and also because of the fact that the Government of South Australia has not written into any indenture agreement whatsoever minimum poUution levels that should apply for the protection of South Australia which first uses, I believe, 70 per cent now of waters from the Murray to sustain its growth, its industries and its current population. That water is important to South Australia. Perhaps this aspect is removed from the main point in my speech, but I think that the South Australian Government is neghgent for not having written into any indenture agreement properly quantified poUution levels above which the people of South Australia would have some comeback against the Federal Government and the River Murray Commission to protect the future UveUhood of their State. This has always been the point that I have taken in the House. My interest in the appointment of 2 properly quaUfied persons expert in thefieldsof environment and conservation stems entirely from a beUef. I find myself in the posiuon that I know of the Minister's last 3 appointments. After 2 meetings, Mr Mundey for one has resigned. I do not know whom the Minister may have in mind to appoint to this important position which could have a lot to do with the environmental factors of the River Murray and which could protect South Australia in the areas that I have already mentioned. I beseech the Minister to teU us tonight when he will conform with the provisions of the amendment moved by me, agreed to by the Parliament and by him as the responsible Minister, to appoint 2 properly qualified people to that advisory board. I think the Minister is fair enough to acknowledge that Pariiamem is entitledtoa proper answer on this matter. I hope that I have explained to him in my speech the sort of thought process which has motivated me tonight in regard to this matter.",77
248,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles), is a great jargonist.",78
249,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,A great what?,78
250,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT,"Jargonist ! He does not really of understand the interconnection in environmental I have dealt with him time and time some again in regard to the Albury-Wodonga complex. I have said before in regard to the environment that everything is connected to everything else. The Albury-Wodonga complex is connected to the River Munay system which, if the waters or the environment be polluted, will affect the water system of South Austraha, as would the water system of Canberra as Canberra is on the Molonglo River which in due course runs into the Murrumbidgee, which runs into the Murray River system. The same can be said of the Bathurst-Orange system. But this jargonist keeps resorting to jargon because, he says, he wants to make some criticism of the Albury-Wodonga complex, when in fact it appears that he does not want to look at any of the facts in relation to any of the other towns which are on the same river system.",78
251,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,I rise to take a point of order. I have never at any stage commented in a critical fashion on the estabhshment of the regional growth centre of Albury-Wodonga. I ask the Minister to stick to the truth.,79
252,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,That is not a point of order.,79
253,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,It is still the truth.,79
254,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable gentleman claims to have been misrepresented, he has another course when the Minister completes his contribution.",79
255,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT,"WeU, the sad thing about these men who do not understand the interconnection of the various facets of the environment is that they want to make criticism before they have really studied the situation. I have tried not on one occasion but at least on several occasions to try to educate this dull man from the other side of the Parliament. Action was taken by this Government to try to create some form of decentralisation in this nation. In the 23 years in which the Government of the Party which the honourable gentleman opposite, who represents a rural seat, supports was in office, the proportion of the Australian population resident in non-urban areas fell from 31 per cent to 14.7 per cent. This Government is trying to reverse that situation. To try to make our decentralisation pohcy work, we will draw greatly from the experience that has been gained in Canberra in seeking not to pollute our water systems. At present under construction-it will be in operation in about 2 years-is a water treatment works at the junction of the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee Rivers which will purify water to such an extent that one can drink the water as it is released after treatment of the sewage. Even the nutrients are taken out of the water. The same systems will be used in the development of the Albury-Wodonga scheme. Dealing with the question of the environment, I point out that no government in Austraha's history has really tried to look at the problems of the environment as this Government has done. Tomorrow I will be tabling the report of the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales into the national estate. That report is quite revealing. It is damning and critical of the previous Government for allowing the human environment of this nation to go into decay in the way in which it has. May I say in regard to appointments to the Cities Commission that there was already a well known environmentalist, unknown to the",79
256,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,That is not true.,79
257,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT,Unknown,79
258,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,That is not true. MrUREN-Whoisit?,79
259,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,D r Walsh. He is known.,79
260,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Angas was heard in comparative silence.,79
261,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT,"Dr Walsh is a well-known environmentalist. His appointment was not known at the time of the earher debate. The honourable member can look at the debate which took place then and can prove to me if the name of Dr Walsh is mentioned that this fact was known at that time. The other environmentalist who was appointed was Jack Mundey. Frankly, I know of no other individual in Australia who has made a greater contribution to the physical environment in Austraha than Jack Mundey. Not only do I say that, but such a great Australian as Patrick White, when asked to nominate the man he thought was the greatest Australian, said that in his view Jack Mundey was that person. He has taken positive action on many occasions to save many beautiful things in Australia. We find people from all walks of life, people from the middle class, from the wealthy sector of the community, when they cannot stop a building being destroyed, saying that they will have to connect with Jack Mundey and the Builders Labourers Federation. Why do we find such reputable organisations as the National Trust of Austraha agreeing with and aligning themselves with such people as Jack Mundey, or find members of the conservation groups, whether they Uve in Hunters HU1 or on the North Shore of Sydney or in remote sections even of Brisbane or in other places doing the same thing? When they cannot stop their sometimes regressive governments the clarion call goes out to try to get union action. I am not speaking out of turn when I say that I can name honourable members opposite who have made representations to me seeking to save certain historic buildings theatres, if you want to get closer to home. they could not get the developers said: 'Thank goodness we have been able to Jack Mundey to stop the action'.

What could any honourable member say are the qualifications for an environmentalist? Again, it just shows the hypocrisy of honourable members",80

274,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"I was well on my way to doing that I pointed out the background to the instruction by Parliament to the Minister to appoint 2 to these competent and trained in those 2 fields, positions. I pointed out that we moved to increase the size of the advisory committee for that purpose from eleven to thirteen. In reply the Minister said, and this is where I have been misrepresented, that Dr you Walsh was appointed and so was Mr Mundey. That is completely untrue. Dr Walsh was appointed a long while ago. In fact, his appointas a member of the board was discussed during the debate which goes back to last May. Since that time the Minister has appointed 3 people to the advisory committee- Mrs Gorman, can say is that they Mrs MCCartney",80

I think he explained that to his satisfaction. I do not resigwant the honourable member to debate the matter, because that is out of order. He has been for quite some time and personal explanations should be brief and to the point on where he was misrepresented.",80
278,Mr GHJES,ADJOURNMENT,"Perhaps I can try again. The Minister said-and this is where I have been t Dr Walsh was appointed by him after Parliament instructed the Minister has to appoint 2 trained people with environmental that and conservation expertise. Dr Walsh-and this the crux of the matter-wa s appointed prior to this. As proof of this, I point out that his name was mentioned during the debate at the time. confirm The Minister appointed Mr Mundey, who",80

282,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT," I do not wish materials to talk about the environment, and I hope when I to resume my seat the Minister will not call me a visions. humbug. He has implied that all members on this side of the House are humbugs. The subject wish to bring before the House classified as one I should apologise for even mtroducing. It may appear to some people to be steel minor and of Uttle effect for the future of this that nation but by the time. I conclude my comments I demand hope I can convince such people that the conallocated trary is the position. Some months ago I wrote to indications the Minister for Manufacturing Industry Enderby) on behalf of one of the municipahties in my electorate which was receiving a lot complaints from primary producers in its area who could not secure supphes of steel points for agricultural machinery. As I said, this may of appear to be an insignificant issue but to the mary producers who are desirous of securing these steel points for their agricultural machinery it is important. I shaU quote from the letter I received only today from the Minister. I apologise to the ter for not notifying him that I intended to this matter. In his letter he wrote: Enquiries by the Department of Manufacturing Industry that despite increased production, local manufacturers have been unable to fully meet the demand from primary producers for steel points and have had to introduce on deliveries to distributors. The major causes of the in supply have been, I understand, the very substantial increase in demands for these goods over recent times, the inability of the manufacturers concerned to obtain increased supplies of the specialised steel for their production. is not good enough. The Minister refers to a 'substantial increase in demand'. Why is there a is not a type of item that primary hoard. The demand exists because articles cannot be purchased. The demand been aggravated for 12 to 18 months. The time it was Minister's letter continues: will be aware, there is a general shortage of steel in Australia at this time.

It does seem, however, the Australian steel industry is doing all it can to meet with available resources and that supplies are being on an equitable basis. There have been some recent that the present high level of demand for steel (Mr may moderate in the near future. I am not blaming the Minister for not being able of to supply steel points for, basicaUy, wheat farmers. I am raising this matter tonight because I believe the issue goes far beyond the question steel points. K goes far beyond the shortage of pribarbed wire, fencing wire, fencing posts and other commodities which are in big demand throughout Australia. One cannot buy materials. Why?",81
283,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"There is a boom on. Minis Mr KING- I do not know what the honourraise able member means by a boom but I do know that if he were trying to secure some of these materials he would have difficulty in getting them. Why is this the position? I beheve there several reasons. I am somewhat inclined to direct my criticisms initially at the Prices Justification Tribunal which is very quick to point out that certain companies are making too much profit certain goods and is knocking back apphcations for price increases. Naturally I think immediaments tely of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company they Ltd. There are plenty of people who say: 'Think of the millions of dollars profit BHP made last year.' That does not mean a thing to me. I am interested in its profit unless is related to the capital invested in it. I wonder what sort of dividend BHP is paying in relation to the total capital invested in it. I wonder how that dividend compares with present-day interest rates. I suppose if there is any one reason for a age of material it can be attributed to Umited case ofineasing production. But why is there limited production? goods I suggest it is because there is a lack of confidence in certain sectors, including BHP, in expanding at a reasonable pace to maintain suppUes. It is very well to say that we can import goods but BHP. what we want is manufacturing anyone disputes my comments about fidence by BHP one has only to read tonight's metropoUtan Press and references therein to the share market. For thefirsttimefor many years interested BHP shares have faUen to a value below $5. Mr MCVeigh-Is that true?",81
284,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , BHP shares are down to $4.88. Not many weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr member's Crean) said that he beUeved that BHP shares would be a good buy at $8. Today they are $4.88. It is just as well that not too many people listened to the Treasurer on that occasion. Unforare tunately many of us had to Usten to him last night. However in a period of about 18 months BHP shares have dropped from $14 to less than $5. This is a reason for steel shortages throughon out Australia. I have raised the matter of steel points for agricultural machinery but my comare not limited to agricultural machinery; relate to many aspects of steel production. If the Government continues on its present lines we will continue tofindourselves in a position where not we will not be able to purchase the steel we I know how its profit require. As I said earUer, I apologise for not notifying the Minister that I intended to speak on this subject tonight. Nevertheless I.do not expect an answer from him because, after all, he had carried out a certain amount of investigation. However I shortrepeat what I said a moment ago: This is not a import restrictions or bringing under customs by-laws free of duty. That is not the answer. In Australia we need to develop industry and the only way this can be all done is by creating confidence. I have mentioned It is a firm whose confidence should be in Australia. If critical of myLest encouraged. any honourable member is lack of contrying to protect BHP I and comments suggests that I am hasten to assure such member that that is far from being the fact. I am not personally interested in BHP but I am in making sure that manufacturing industries, including BHP and otherfirms,have sufficient confidence to enable them to expand to meet the demands of our expanding production.",82

Joint Committee on Prices: Government Action Mr Lynch asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: What action has been taken by the Government pursuant to the reports by the Joint Committee on Prices on (a) meat prices, (b) impon prices, (c) meatmeal prices and (d) carpet tile prices.",84
290,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Stabilisation of Meat Prices Recommendation (i) The Government rejected the recommendation for an export tax on beef. Following an examination of the posiuon with regard to supplies and prices, the Government directed the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to investigate the costs involved in the marketing of cattle, sheep and pigs. Special reference was made to the composition of the margin between the prices paid to primary producers for animals slaughtered and the retail prices paid by consumers for meat products. A report on the investigation was tabled in Parliament on 2 April 1974. The Consumer Price Index shows that the price of meat has fallen in recent months. Recommendation (ii) The Government decided to hold in abeyance the recommendation that the meat industry be requested to restrict voluntarily beef exports. In fact there has been no need for restraint on beef exports owing to Functions the poor demand from overseas markets. In JanuaryJuly 1974 shipments of beef were little more than half (QuestionNo. 139) those in the corresponding period of 1973. Recommendation (iii) This recommendation is no longer relevant as United States Uvestock producers ceased withholding stock from the market following the lifting of the US. beef price freeze on 9 September 1973. be transferred to the Australian Recommendation (iv) The representative body of the pig industry has indicated that it wishes to undenake promodon of the industry's products with funds based on a slaughter levy and has approached the Government seeking legislation for the introduction of such a levy. The Government has announced that it will introduce the necessary legislation. Recommendation (v) The Minister for Agiculture has announced that he intends to review the composition, powers and functions of all marketing boards, including the Meat Board. Recommendation (vi) The recommendation to establish a Government sponsored and financed consumer organisation is under consideration. Recommendation (vii) In order to obtain information on sales under forward contracts the Australian Meat board held discussions with the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council and approached a number of major exportersregardingthe collection of such data. Data have been collected from exporters but in the past six months the poor expon demand and low level of forward contracts has meant that such information is of Uttle value. The Board will continue to maintain its (QuestionNo. 141) contact with exporters so that when business returns to more normal levels a better assessment will be possible. (b) Import Prices Inquiry The following references are to paragraphs in the chapter on 'Findings and Recommendations' in the Committee's Report No. 1. Firstrecommendationis numbered (vi). Recommendation (vi) On 18 February 1974 the Minister for Transport wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Prices. He pointed out that the overseas cargo shipping provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971-72 related only to outward trades. This is still the position under the Trade Practices Act 1974. Nevertheless, enquiries have been made overseas on the manner in which liner freight rates on imponed cargoes are adjusted when currency relativities alter. In the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan shipper bodies negotiate these arrangements with the Conferences concerned. They have agreed on the application of currency adjustment factors to the tariff which are calculated to ensure that shipowners neither profit nor lose by changes in costs and/or revenues due tofluctuationsin the relativity between the tariff currency and the currencies in which costs are incurred. In the United Kingdom to Australia trade, for example, a monthly review of this adjustment factor has been mads since late 1972 by the British Shippers' Council and the Conference. In the trade from the United States of America to Australia, where there is no shipper body, the regulatory authority, the Federal Maritime Commission, adopts a similar policy. It makes every endeavour to limit currency surcharges to amounts no greater than are required to maintain the integrity of the carrier's basic rate structure. Recommendation (vii) The practice by which associations of timber importers recommend prices and their members (referred to in paragraphs 66-69 and 74 of the report on import prices) was referred Commissioner of Trade Practices under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971-72. The Trade Practices Act 1974 includes provisions practice more clearly than the above Act. Recommendation (viii) The possible need for legislation to give effect the recommendauon that information be obtained on products in the Pharmaceuucal Benefits Scheme is currently under investigation. The Department of Health is, however, continuing to seek information on actual costs and other financial information from pharmaceutical panies. (c) Price of Meatmeal Recommendation (i) The practice by which some meatmeal manufacturers consult on the establishment of list prices for the industry was referred to the Commissioner of Trade Practices. Recommendation (ii) Subsequent to the Joint Committee's report, the power of the Australian Government export of meatmeal under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations has been applied more stringently, primarily to ensure that the domestic market continues to have priority in the use of available supphes. On 20 February 1974 the Minister for Agriculture announced that his Department would not issue further permits for the export of meatmeal until dme as shortages on the domestic market were overcome. Since that time the oudook has altered; protein meals have become morereadilyavailable on the inprice ternational market; supplies of subsutute meals have been taken up meatmeal on the domestic market has generally declined and limited exportable surpluses have Australia developed in most States. ited exports of meatmeal have been approved but, in view of the relatively low levels of Uvestock slaughterings and meatmeal production, market circumstances will be kept under review and the export restrictions will be applied as necessary. (d) Price of Carpet Tiles The Trade Practices Act 1974 includes provisions designed to bring about a more competitive cUmate in retail pricing as well as in other areas. In addition Trade Pracuces Commission provided for in that Act is able to inform the pubUc of the kinds of benefits obtainable by comparative shopping. The major company mentioned in the report has been contacted by the Department of Manufacturing Industry and advises that it no longer issues recommended prices toretaUersunless specifically requested. The Committee'sreporthas also been brought to the attention of members of the Textile and Apparel Industry Advisory Panel and the Interim Commission on Consumer Standards.

The survey covered 1,065 establishments in a range of industries throughout Australia. For statistical reasons, entirely reliable conclusions cannot be drawn from the survey concerning sickness absence in Australian industry generally. However, a rough approximation can be arrived at by relating the survey findings on absence rates for Industry groups to the industrial distribution of wage and salary earners in the Australian labour force and deducting estimates of time lost through industrial accidents and diseases. On this basic, the total number of hours lost through absence attributed to sickness in 1973 is estimated at about 360 million.
