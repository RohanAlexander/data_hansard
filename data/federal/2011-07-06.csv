2,Ms MACKLIN,COMMITTEES,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (09:02): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill contains a range of measures relating to income support and veterans' affairs payments, and disability advocacy services. It includes two budget 2011-12 measures, and one budget 2009-10 measure. Disability support pension-impairment tables The disability support pension is an essential element of Australia's safety net but it is vital that it supports the people who need it-those Australians who, through disability, are unable to work to fully support themselves. It is essential that the level of someone's impairment is assessed using the most up-todate medical information. The current impairment tables used in disability support pension assessments were last comprehensively reviewed in 1993 and are no longer consistent with contemporary medical and rehabilitation practices. Over the years this has led to anomalies and inconsistencies which have distorted the assessment process. For example, when hearing impairment is assessed, a person with a hearing aid is not required to wear it but someone who is having their sight impairment assessed must wear their glasses. BILLS In the 2009-10 budget the government committed to updating the impairment tables. This is an important element of the government's reforms to the disability support pension to make it simpler, fairer and sustainable for those who need it. An advisory committee of medical, allied health and rehabilitation experts, disability advocates, mental health advocates and relevant government agencies was established in 2010 to provide advice on updating the impairment tables. Following a rigorous process, the advisory committee has provided a final report and draft revised tables to the government. The bill removes the current outdated impairment tables from 1 January 2012, and enables new impairment tables to be introduced through a legislative instrument. The draft legislative instrument that contains the revised tables, based on the advisory committee's report, will be released shortly for public comment. Putting the impairment tables in a legislative instrument allows them to be updated regularly in response to developments in medical or rehabilitation practice. These revised tables have been developed following extensive consultation, and ongoing consultation will occur as they are implemented. Disability advocacy services The bill also introduces a stronger quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to make sure that people with disabilities receive the best possible advocacy support. The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997, and the need for improved quality assurance for disability advocacy services has been highlighted in a number of reviews. The bill introduces mechanisms independent from government to assess the compliance of disability advocacy services against disability advocacy standards. Development of a robust, quality assured disability advocacy sector will help meet the objectives of the National Disability Strategy, and will also help meet Australia's obligations under that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The third-party certification quality assurance system this bill introduces has been successfully in place for disability employment services since 2002. It involves people with disability at all levels in the system, including as members of audit teams. The new quality assurance system has been successfully trialled and independently evaluated in consultation with the disability advocacy services sector. The evaluation recommended formal implementation. Changes to income support payments This bill also makes a number of changes to the social security law, and veterans' affairs legislation, in relation to bereavement allowance and special benefit, and the income and assets tests. The bill gives effect to a budget 2011-12 measure to enable parenting payment recipients to access bereavement allowance following the death of a partner. Historically, there was no financial advantage in transferring between these payment types. However, the introduction of the government's Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package in September 2009 saw a substantial increase to the rate of some pensions, including bereavement allowance. Allowing a parenting payment recipient to transfer to bereavement allowance for a 14-week period, on the death of their partner, will provide additional financial assistance during a difficult time. The bill also gives effect to another budget 2011-12 measure, to more closely align the rules for accessing special benefit for provisional partner visa holders with the rules for other newly arrived migrants. From 1 January 2012, a class of visa holders determined by legislative instrument will be required to wait two years to be eligible for special benefit. This rule will not apply if the visa holder is able to demonstrate that there has been a substantial change in their circumstances after their arrival in Australia and they are in hardship. Under current policy, provisional partner visa holders are able to access special benefit from when they are granted the visa and are in Australia if they can demonstrate they are suffering from 'financial hardship'. This is not consistent with other newly arrived migrants subject to the newly arrived residence waiting period, who need to demonstrate both 'financial hardship' and 'change in circumstance outside of their control' in order to access special benefit. Under these changes from 1 January 2012, provisional partner visa holders will need to demonstrate they have experienced a 'substantial change of circumstances beyond their control' in addition to financial hardship in order to access special benefit. These changes reflect the community's expectation that new migrants to Australia should be able to support themselves, or be supported by their families and partners unless they are impacted by circumstances outside of their control. The new arrangements continue, however, to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable migrants on provisional partner visas, for example where there is domestic violence, death of a partner or an injury or accident after their arrival in Australia. The bill also makes changes to the social security law and veterans' entitlements legislation to enhance the integrity of certain asset-test exempt income streams. These amendments strengthen the existing rules that require lifetime and life expectancy income streams to provide an annual actuarial certificate, in order to gain the benefit of concessional treatment under the social security law. Currently, in order for holders of lifetime and life expectancy income streams to benefit from concessional treatment under the social security assets test and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, it is required that an actuary certifies that there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream for its full term. Currently, some social security customers, after submitting an actuarial certificate that fails to meet the high probability test, later seek to replace this initial certificate with a more favourable certificate that meets the high probability test, a number of times within a financial year. This bill clarifies that customers can only give the secretary (or the Repatriation Commission) one actuarial certificate for each financial year to show that the fund has sufficient resources to pay an income stream for its term. In the event that a person submits more than one certificate for a particular financial year, only the first certificate given will have effect, not any of the subsequent certificates. The amendments in this bill also address inconsistencies in the treatment of these income streams that have arisen over time. Finally, the bill also makes amendments to the social security law to clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of the termination of his or her employment are 'redundancy payments' for the purposes of social security law. This ensures that, in calculating income maintenance periods under the act, people who receive these payments are treated the same as people who receive other types of redundancy payments. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Crean. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (09:13): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. This bill forms a crucial part of the Commonwealth's commitment to nationally harmonised work health and safety laws. These are landmark reforms which have been long in the making. Nationally harmonised work health and safety laws were first raised by the Whitlam government in 1974. In the intervening years, the harmonisation of work health and safety has experienced many false starts despite having strong support from both unions and business. Indeed the coalition had 11 long years to deliver on this important reform and failed to do so. While its genesis is decades old, the arguments in favour of harmonisation to this date remain compelling. Having different OHS systems creates a regulatory burden on businesses, increases red tape and means that workers are at risk poorer safety standards than their counterparts in other states. In 21st century Australia, workers and businesses deserve better. In July 2008, the Commonwealth, states and territories came together to sign a historic Council of Australian Governments agreement to put harmonised work health and safety laws in place by 1 January 2012. This Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety set in place a framework for working cooperatively towards the common goal of harmonised laws. In so doing, governments set aside politics in favour of a national framework which reduces red tape and ensures that all workers have the same protections, regardless of where they live and work. Over the past three years, the government has worked in partnership with the states and territories, business groups and the ACTU to achieve a new legislative framework. This new framework will replace nine separate occupational health and safety acts and over 400 pieces of occupational health and safety regulation which currently cause unnecessary confusion, complexity and higher costs for many businesses. This duplication and fragmentation of work health and safety legislation has also stood in the way of better safety outcomes. Clearly, the health and safety of workers is a matter of national significance. Around 290 Australians are killed at work each year. Many more die as a result of work related disease and each year around 135,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost of work related injury and illness to our economy has been estimated at nearly six per cent of our gross domestic product. of The cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends is inestimable. Not only are workers' lives and health at stake because of the current state of Australia's occupational health and safety laws; so too is the greater efficiency of our economy. The Work Health and Safety Bill before you today reflects the provisions of the Model Work Health and Safety Act agreed by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council in December 2009. This model act has been subject to an extensive consultation process involving considerable stakeholder input and scrutiny. In April 2008, the Commonwealth established an independent panel to conduct the National Review into Model Occupational Health and Safety Laws. This review panel examined work health and safety laws in each state and territory and the Commonwealth and conducted extensive consultation in each jurisdiction. The review panel participated in over 80 meetings, consulting with more than 260 individuals representing over 100 organisations, including regulators, unions, employer organisations, industry representatives, legal professionals, academics and health and safety professionals. The review panel also received 243 written submissions, providing a rich source of ideas and information to form the basis for reform proposals. The national review was completed in January 2009, resulting in two comprehensive reports being submitted to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. These reports made recommendations on the optimal structure and content for the model act. Workplace relations ministers responded to the review panel's 232 recommendations in May 2009. Decisions made by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council formed the basis for the model act, which was then drafted by Safe Work Australia. An exposure draft of the model act was released for public comment for six weeks in September 2009. The 480 submissions received during this time informed many of the amendments to this draft. The model act as endorsed by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council in December 2009 reflected the outcome of this extensive consultation process. In endorsing the model act, ministers acknowledged that each jurisdiction will face changes in current occupational health and safety arrangements in order to achieve the goal of uniform occupational health and safety laws. At the same time, ministers agreed that the model laws comprise a balanced and interrelated package of measures that will lead to enhanced safety protections for all Australian workers and greater certainty and protections for all workplace parties. The harmonisation of work health and safety laws is also one of COAG's top 10 priority reforms under the 2008 National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy. Each party under the national partnership acknowledged a mutual interest towards achieving a coordinated national approach to work health and safety laws. The implementation of harmonised work health and safety laws is assessed annually by the COAG Reform Council. Under the national partnership the Commonwealth will provide reward payments to states and territories following the COAG Reform Council's advice on the achievement of key milestones set out in the implementation plan. The positive outcome expected from the national partnership will be a reduction in the costs of regulation, contributing to enhanced productivity and workforce mobility across the country. The work towards a nationally harmonised system of legislation, regulations and codes of practice will ensure that the 40,000 businesses operating across jurisdictions will face less regulatory duplication associated with compliance through multiple systems across jurisdictions. The national system will harmonise work health and safety laws so that they are consistently enforced by regulators, facilitating a stronger partnership with business to minimise the risks of workplace injuries and deaths. Under the intergovernmental agreement governing the work health and safety harmonisation process, jurisdictions expressly agreed to develop a national compliance and enforcement policy to ensure a consistent regulatory approach across all jurisdictions. The Work Health and Safety Bill that I am introducing today will apply to businesses and undertakings conducted by the Commonwealth, public authorities and nonCommonwealth licensees. An exposure draft of the Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Bill was released for comment from interested stakeholders on the Commonwealth specific provisions, from 26 May to 17 June this year. Feedback was received from a range of stakeholders including Commonwealth agencies, public authorities, non-Commonwealth licensees, unions, employer groups and legal professionals. Despite some differences in detail, occupational health and safety laws in all Australian jurisdictions are based on the internationally recognised Robens model of a broad principles based approach, an approach to occupational health and safety regulations which create general duties applicable to all workplaces. The principles which underpin the Work Health Safety Bill reflect the Robens model, and so echo the basis of the current Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991. Like the current Commonwealth act, the bill provides that workers others are to be given the highest level of protection from hazards and risks as is reasonably practicable. The bill seeks to secure the health and safety of workers and workplaces through the elimination or minimisation of risks, and effective representation, consultation, cooperation and issue resolution, provision of advice, information, education and training, and effective and appropriate compliance and enforcement measures, among other matters. Of course, some changes have had to be made by all jurisdictions-including the Commonwealth-to their current work health and safety acts to come to an agreed model act. I will now outline some of the more significant features of the bill which will be new to the Commonwealth jurisdiction. In line with the model act, the bill does not rely on 'employer' duties but assigns the primary duty of care on the 'Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking', qualified by what is reasonably practicable. The Work Health and Safety Bill will also provide for a modernised and wider coverage of contemporary work relationships that are broader than the traditional employer/employee relationship. There is the expanded definition of worker-contractors, employees of contractors, sub-contractors, labour hire workers, apprentices, volunteers as well as employees all come under this definition. The Work Health and Safety Bill places a positive duty on officers to exercise due diligence to ensure compliance by the organisation. This bill also places a duty on designers of plant, substances and structure consistent with the principle that duties of care should and be imposed on those that who are materially involved in or materially affect the performance of work. Similar to current provisions in the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Work Health Safety Bill provides fair for the election of health and safety representatives who will represent workers in work groups on work health and safety matters. Health and safety representatives will also continue to have powers to issue provisional improvement notices and direct that work cease where there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of a member of a work group. To simplify arrangements, the bill provides that in bigger organisations, work groups are now allowed multiple health and safety representatives. Under the model bill, workers will now have the statutory right to cease unsafe work in certain circumstances. This is a new statutory right for the Commonwealth and provides that workers are entitled to cease work if they have reasonable concerns that to carry out the work would expose them to serious risk to their health and safety, emanating from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard. The bill also contains new and tougher provisions outlining significant penalties for those who fail to meet their obligations for work health and safety. There are three categories of penalties based on the degree of culpability, risk and harm. Category 1 offences involving proven recklessness attract a maximum fine of $3 million for bodies corporate and for individuals the maximum fine of $600,000 or a maximum of five years imprisonment or both. Category 2 offences involve breaches of health and safety duties which expose another person to a risk of death or serious injury or illness, and attract a maximum fine of $1.5 million for bodies corporate or $300,000 for individuals. Category 3 offences apply for any breach of a health and safety duty with a maximum fine of $500,000 for bodies corporate and $100,000 for individuals. To ensure greater accountability and responsibility for safety outcomes, the Commonwealth will no longer be immune from criminal liability for offences under legislation. This is an improvement on the current act which limits Commonwealth liability to civil remedies only. The range of enforcement mechanisms will also be wider under the new laws. New options include infringement notices, remedial orders, adverse publicity orders, training orders and orders for restoration. Other significant changes brought about by this bill include enhanced protections from discrimination, victimisation and coercion over work health and safety matters which go beyond what is currently available through anti-discrimination and other laws. Importantly there will be protection against discrimination for people in the workplace who exercise or perform powers, functions or rights under the bill. There will be an entry permit scheme that allows authorised permit holders to inquire into suspected contraventions of work health and safety laws and to consult and advise workers about work health and safety matters. In addition to changes in Commonwealth work health safety laws to align them with the model bill, there are also provisions in the Work Health and Safety Bill specific to our unique jurisdiction. I would stress that in keeping with the Commonwealth's commitment under the COAG intergovernmental agreement, the Commonwealth specific provisions are expressly permitted under the jurisdictional notes provided in the model act. The bill will apply to businesses or undertakings conducted by the Commonwealth, a public authority and, for a transitional period, a non-Commonwealth licensee. Importantly, the bill seeks to ensure the same coverage of Commonwealth workers as this are currently covered under the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act. This means that in the Commonwealth jurisdiction the definition of worker will be extended to include persons who are currently deemed to be employees of the Commonwealth such as:  members of the Australian Defence Force; and  a holder of a Commonwealth statutory office. The bill also establishes Comcare as the single regulator for work health and safety in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Comcare will operate under the oversight of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This is a change from the current situation where occupational health and safety regulation is the joint responsibility of Comcare and the commission. The commission will continue to have an important role in oversighting the activities of Comcare, which will have responsibility for day-today regulatory functions. It will continue to have advisory and consultative functions, including advising the minister on the administration of the act and making recommendations to the minister on the most effective means of giving effect to the objects of the act. The commission will also be a forum for consultation between Comcare and persons conducting a business or undertaking, workers and the bodies that represent them. In terms of the commencement of this legislation, all jurisdictions have committed to implement the model bill by 1 January 2012. These laws will be supported by model regulations and codes of practice that are expected to be finalised at the national level later this year. The process to develop national regulations is again a collaborative one being achieved in partnership with the jurisdictions and employee and employer bodies. The provisions in the Work Health and Safety Bill complement legislation being enacted across all other Australian states and territories and will lead to enhanced work health and safety protections for Australian workers and greater certainty for businesses. The legislation will contribute to long term sustainable employment opportunities for all Australians, underpinned by strong uniform work health and safety laws. I do not need to tell you, Mr Speaker, that the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 is a win-win for both workers and employers in the Commonwealth. More broadly, the benefits from new harmonised work health and safety laws will increase profitability and productivity for businesses at the same time as better protecting the lives and health of Australians. It is estimated that harmonising work health and safety laws will save multistate businesses $179 million per annum. Support for this legislation is support for a balanced and nationally harmonised framework to secure health and safety for all Australian workers and Australian businesses into the future. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Work Health and Safety (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Crean.

4,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (09:34): I know that my colleagues were fascinated by that important piece of legislation. I have another piece to introduce that will just as well entertain and inform them. I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Work Health and Safety (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011. This bill contains transitional and consequential provisions in relation to the Work Health and Safety Bill, and it will form part of a system of nationally harmonised work health and safety laws. The bill will repeal the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991, which will be replaced with the Work Health and Safety Bill. It also makes provision for the transition to the new laws. It will deal with matters where action of some kind may have commenced under the Occupational Health and Safety Act before it was repealed and where contraventions have occurred prior to the commencement of the new laws. In addition the bill makes consequential amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991 that arise from the Work Health and Safety Bill. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Kate Ellis. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (09:36): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. During the height of concerns confronting the international education sector in 2009 the Prime Minister, in her then role as Minister for Education, asked the Hon. Bruce Baird AM to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and its associated legislation that had originally been planned for 2012. A number of amendments to the ESOS Act were introduced to strengthen registration requirements and require re-registration of all providers by the end of 2010. This interim step was necessary to reinforce the integrity and quality of Australia's international education sector. When those amendments were passed in February 2010 an undertaking was given to come back with further amendments following finalisation of the Baird review. The government released the final report of the Baird review on 9 March 2010 and indicated a staged approach in responding to its recommendations. The first phase of legislative changes, passed in March of this year, had a dual focus on risk management and more effective enforcement. Those amendments also introduced changes to the Ombudsman Act 1976 to extend the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to include students of private registered providers. Consistent with this staged approach, the government's response to the remaining recommendations will be considered in a second phase of legislation to be introduced in the coming months. The ESOS Act protects Australia's reputation for delivering quality education services. It does this by establishing a regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services and through this protects the interests of overseas students through the establishment of minimum standards and providing tuition and financial assurance. The ESOS Act also complements Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information which is relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. Unprecedented growth in recent years has led to education becoming one of Australia's largest export industries, generating in the order of $19 billion annually and supporting around 125,000 jobs across Australia. In 2000 the number of international student enrolments in Australia was 188,000, which grew to 619,000 in 2010. Consequently, the growth in the student population has led to significant growth in the number of education providers offering services to international students with over 1,100 providers ranging from large universities and TAFEs, public and private schools, to small private VET and English language providers. Since its commencement in 2000, the ESOS Act has been amended several times to keep pace with this changing industry and is widely recognised as one of the best legislative frameworks for international education in the world. The Commonwealth recovers the costs of administering the ESOS Act through compulsory registration fees. These are charged to all providers wishing to be registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS, which allows them to offer courses to overseas students. The purpose of the bills I am introducing today is to make amendments to the ESOS (Registration Charges) Act in response to recommendations from the Baird review that regulators adopt a risk assessment and management approach to the registration and ongoing monitoring of education providers delivering courses to international students, including the costs to apply at registration and through the period of registration. The bill creates a new fee structure focused on risk to replace the current charging structure for the compulsory annual registration charge payable by CRICOS registered providers. The new annual registration charge is comprised of a $1,300 base fee, a charge of $10 per student enrolment per year together with a $100 charge for each course registered on CRICOS. It also includes provision for a flat fee of $1,000 in circumstances where a provider has in the past 12 months had action taken against them for non-compliance under section 83 of the ESOS Act. Flexibility is afforded for providers that routinely offer courses of less than 13 weeks duration with the introduction of a new provision for each student enrolled in such a course at any time during the year to count as a quarter of an enrolment. This represents a reduction from the current half an enrolment charge for a course of less than 26 weeks, and addresses issues raised in relation to the existing length of enrolment calculation by providers offering courses of a shorter duration to large numbers of students. The rebased annual registration charge is designed to cover the administrative costs of the registration process and reflect the number of courses offered by each provider, as well as the overseas student cohort, in order to more accurately recoup the costs relative to the size of any supervision, compliance or enforcement activity necessary to ensure that only reputable providers are permitted to operate. The bill also introduces an entry to market charge payable for the first three years of registration which will replace the current initial registration charge. A charge of $7,500 will be payable at the time the provider first becomes registered on CRICOS, followed by $5,000 payable at the end of the first anniversary of registration and a further $2,500 at the end of the second anniversary period. The entry to market charge is designed to recoup the additional costs associated with new applications for registration and the additional supervision required by providers with a shorter history of registration. Evidence suggests that these providers present a greater risk to the sector, so the new entry to market charge will enable better targeting of compliance efforts and shift the regulatory burden to those providers with the greatest risk to quality, the student experience and the reputation of the sector as a whole. Importantly, these bills provide a regulation-making power to allow the registration charges to be varied for different classes of providers on the basis of their risk profile. Under this proposal providers deemed to present a significantly lower risk to the market may pay a lesser amount or be exempt from the requirement to pay components of the registration charges. It is expected that any providers qualifying for a variation will be subject to rigorous additional quality control processes. Overall, the financial impact on providers of a rebased annual registration charge is expected to significantly reduce from its current level. The rebasing of the charge result in registration charges paid by the sector reducing from $15 million in 2011 to less than $7 million in 2012. As there an overall reduction of approximately $8 million in the amount collected from the sector as a whole, the majority of existing CRICOS registered providers will experience considerable relief in relation to this charge. Providers representing a greater risk to the market, such as those with a history non-compliance and new entrants, may pay more under the new arrangements. Protection and enhancement of Australia's reputation for providing reliable and highquality education is crucial for both providers and their international students, who rely on the strength of an Australian qualification as they further their careers, both here and overseas. These bills continue the government's support for the industry and its place in the economy through a strengthened regulatory framework for Australia's education and training export industry. This follows directly from the Baird review recommendation and will ensure the long-term integrity and viability of this key export industry. The government looks forward to bringing forth the final phase of our response to the Baird review recommendations later this year. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned.

Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 First Reading Bill, explanatory memorandum and draft Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011 presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
5,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am proud to be introducing the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill. This is a world-first initiative, designed remove the last vestige of glamour from tobacco products. The bill will require that tobacco products be sold in plain, drab darkbrown packets. The Gillard government is absolutely committed to reducing death and disease brought about by smoking. We want to help protect Australians. That is why we are prepared to lead the world on tackling smoking. Once enacted, these plain packaging laws will be the world's toughest laws on tobacco promotion. We are taking this action because tobacco is not like any other legal product. When used as intended, it is lethal. Despite Australia's success in reducing smoking rates over recent decades, tobacco remains one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease among Australians, killing over 15,000 Australians each and every year. It is therefore incumbent on us to do all we can to stamp it out. Take the story of Luke Elliot from Western Australia, who features in one of our most recent antismoking TV campaigns. Luke's story is about his father Neil. Neil was a pack-a-day smoker who developed lung cancer as a result. Neil was very sick from his cancer, but determined to live to see the birth of his first grandson, James. But sadly, Neil passed away one month before James was born. Luke's story is heart breaking. But sadder still is that Luke's story is only one of 15,000 such stories that play out in families and communities around Australia every year, because that is how many people still die each and every year in Australia from smoking related diseases. That is 15,000 people who do not get to see their son or daughter married, or their first grandchild born. That is 15,000 reasons to act, because by not acting, we are killing people. If we to did not do all we could to tackle a known killer, we would be ashamed of ourselves. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that nearly six million people die from tobacco related illness each year, most of them in lowand middle-income countries. About three million Australians continue to smoke every day. That is why in April 2010 the government announced a comprehensive Anti Smoking Action package aimed at delivering on our commitments to reduce the smoking rate to 10 per cent by 2018 and to have the rate of smoking among Indigenous Australians over time. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill is part of this important package. Other elements of the package include:  the 25 per cent tobacco excise increase introduced on 29 April 2010-this has seen tobacco clearances fall by 8.8 per cent over the last 11 months;  additional funding for Quitline;  record investments in antismoking social marketing campaigns-more than $87 million, including tough new advertisements linking smokers' cough with lung cancer and the first ever national Indigenous antismoking advertisement;  legislation to prohibit the advertising of tobacco products on the internet-which we hope will pass the Senate this week; and  since February this year, we have provided subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, to provide that all important support for people trying to quit-with nearly 100,000 scripts issued so far. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill is the latest step in the government's fight to reduce the toll on families from smoking related illness and death. There is very clear research that supports this approach. The peer reviewed research shows that plain packaging will:  reduce the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products to consumers, particularly young people;  increase the noticeability and effectiveness of mandated health warnings; and  reduce the ability of the tobacco product to mislead consumers about the harms of smoking. Plain packaging will remove one of the last remaining forms of tobacco advertising in Australia. It will restrict tobacco industry logos, brand imagery, colours and promotional text. The packaging will be mandated to appear in a standard, drab dark-brown colour, which has been chosen based on research for the lowest appeal to smokers. The only thing to distinguish one brand from another will be the brand and variant name in a standard colour, standard position and standard font size and style. The bill will make it an offence to sell, supply, purchase, package or manufacture tobacco products for retail sale in Australia in anything other than in accord with the plain packaging requirements set out in the bill and regulations. The maximum penalty for committing a fault-based criminal offence-that is, for persons who intentionally or recklessly break the rules-for an individual will be 2,000 penalty units (currently $220,000), and for a body corporate, 10,000 penalty units (currently $1.1 million). The maximum penalty amount for a strict-liability criminal offence committed by an individual is 60 penalty units ($6,600) and by a body corporate 300 penalty units ($33,000). The offences will not apply to people who purchase cigarettes for their personal use. An update to the current graphic health warnings to increase the coverage on the front of the pack from the current 30 per cent to 75 per cent, along with updated imagery and warnings, will accompany the introduction of plain packaging so that, rather than being a marketing tool, the pack will only serve as a stark reminder of the devastating health effects of smoking. We know packaging is a very powerful marketing tool for tobacco companiesparticularly for recruiting new smokers to their deadly products. There is ample research to support this approach. But the evidence in support of it is not only in the 24-and counting-peer-reviewed journal articles; compelling evidence that packaging is a powerful marketing tool for promoting tobacco smoking can also be found in big tobacco's reaction to this very initiative itself. Big tobacco are fighting so vigorously against this legislation for one very simple reason-because they know, as we do, that it will work. Tobacco companies are fighting to protect their profits; but we are fighting to protect lives. I am delighted that some of the public health experts and officials who have fought so hard over many decades to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco products are in the public gallery watching the introduction of this historic legislation into the parliament today. Can I particularly say that it gives me great pleasure that the parliament has been able to accommodate Mike Daube on his 63rd birthday. I hope that this is a good birthday present for him. Some of these experts sat on the national Preventative Health Taskforce-just one of the national health bodies who have joined the World Health Organisation in recommending plain packaging of tobacco as a means of reducing smoking rates. The Preventative Health Taskforce was commissioned by the Australian government in 2008. Its report, released in September 2009, concluded that 'there can be no justification for allowing any form of promotion for this uniquely dangerous and addictive product'-including on the packaging. In line with the international evidence, the taskforce said plain packaging would:  increase the impact of health warning messages;  reduce the ability of tobacco companies to mislead consumers into believing that some cigarettes are less harmful than others;  make cigarettes look less attractive, and  reduce the appeal and desirability of smoking generally. But it is not just our national taskforce which believes this. Plain packaging has been discussed in various international forums over the past 25 years. Our legislation will give effect to commitments under the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which recommends that plain packaging be considered as part of comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising and as a way of ensuring that consumers are not misled about the dangers of smoking. Australia is the first signatory to the framework and the first country in the world to commit to implementing these recommendations on plain packaging-cementing our reputation as a world leader in tobacco control. As well as being based on ample evidence and careful advice of the experts, this bill is the result of wide-ranging consultation:  the Preventative Health Taskforce undertook detailed consultations on tobacco control reforms in the preparation of their report;  since the government announced its intention to introduce plain packaging, the Department of Health and Ageing has undertaken targeted consultations with organisations representing large and small retailers, with cigarette and cigar importers and with the major tobacco manufacturers; and  the government held a 60 day public consultation period on an exposure draft of this bill. Consultation on the exposure draft of the bill showed overwhelming support for the measures we are proposing, from public health groups both within Australia and internationally. In addition, we have listened to concerns raised with our proposals during these consultations-and legitimate concerns have now been taken up in the final bill. For example, to assist in identification of illicit tobacco products, manufacturers will be permitted to include certain design features that do not run counter to the public health objectives of the measure. The brand name will be permitted on the top, front and bottom of cigarette packs to assist retailers in handling tobacco products. All product manufactured in Australia will need to comply with plain packaging as of 20 May 2012. This will allow retailers plenty of time to restock and ensure that they have disposed of non-compliant product before 1 July 2012. To assist small-scale importers and small business with compliance, imported tobacco products will be able to be repackaged after importation into Australia. Of course, despite the sound evidence on which these measures are based and wideranging consultation prior to the bill's introduction, our plain packaging plans have met with fierce opposition from big tobacco companies. Since April 2010, big tobacco has been doing everything in their power to fight the government politically and legally on this issue-and we know they will stop at virtually nothing. They were quick to establish a group to front their activities-the Alliance of Australian Retailers. The alliance ran a multimillion dollar advertising campaign against the government during the last federal election campaign. Now the industry has ramped up its campaign, including through invoking the 'nanny state'. The campaign is the latest in a decades long fight against what is good for its consumers and what is good for the community. They have claimed plain packaging 'won't work'-but if it won't work, why are they pouring millions of dollars and throwing all their corporate might into opposing it? Since April 2010, the Department of Health and Ageing has had to handle over 40 freedom of information requests generated by two of the global big tobacco giants. Let us be clear, the intention of these requests is to disrupt the department's business and resources. The most recent advertising campaign aims to scare the public into believing that plain packaging will cost taxpayers and the government billions of dollars in legal action, that it will increase the availability of illegal tobacco in the community, and will increase the number of cigarettes sold to children. One video available on the internet claims a link between plain packaging, murder, heroin, prostitution and the Russian mafia! These claims are becoming increasingly hysterical and increasingly desperate. Because not only do they know that plain packaging will work; big tobacco also know that if we are successful in implementing these measures in Australia, other countries will follow. I conclude by saying again that the Gillard government are absolutely determined to do all we can to tackle the harm caused by smoking. The Gillard government is proud to be leading the world in the fight against tobacco by introducing the world's toughest tobacco promotion laws. We want to ensure that in the future, people like Luke Elliot's dad, Neil, never start smoking in the first place, and as a result, live to see their first grandchild born. It is with great pride that I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
6,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I also introduce a consequential amendment bill, the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill includes restrictions on the use of trademarks on tobacco products and the retail packaging of those products. This bill amends the Trade Marks Act to allow regulations to be made in relation to the operation of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. The objective of any such regulations would be to ensure that the practical operation of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 does not prevent businesses from registering new trademarks, or from protecting registered trademarks against infringement. This bill is being introduced to amend the Trade Marks Act 1995 so that, if necessary in the future, the government can quickly remedy any unintended interaction between the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Act that cannot be dealt with under the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. Senator Carr, who is responsible for the Trade Marks Act, has indicated his strong support for the intent of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill and also supports the amendments to the Trade Marks Act that will result from this consequential amendments bill passing. He and I share the view that the health, economic and social costs to Australia of tobacco use justify the amendments to the Trade Marks Act. I commend this consequential bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCClelland. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",34
7,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The Legislative Instruments Act provides general rules for the making, registration and sunsetting (that is, automatic ceasing) of legislative instruments. The purpose of the sunsetting process is to ensure that legislative instruments are kept up to date and only remain in force for so long as they are needed. Purpose of the bill The main purpose of this bill is to refine the way in which the sunsetting provisions apply to legislative instruments which commence retrospectively. The current rule is that instruments sunset 10 years after they commence. This ensures that legislative instruments are reviewed regularly and, where they are no longer required, cease to have effect after that 10year period. This rule also applies to retrospectively commencing instruments. This means that these instruments can sunset less than 10 years after they are made or, in some cases, even before they are made where they need to operate more than 10 years in the past. This amendment to the act would provide for a new rule for retrospectively commencing legislative instruments. This new rule would use the date of registration rather than commencement as the relevant starting point for the 10-year period. This change would allow for instruments to be made with retrospective commencement, but would allow them 10 years of prospective operation before they sunset. This gives rule makers additional flexibility in making these instruments, without removing the requirement that the instrument be reviewed every 10 years. The bill does not alter any other rules in the Legislative Instruments Act about when instruments may commence retrospectivity. Conclusion This minor amendment to the act refines the operation of the sunsetting provisions to allow them to operate more effectively in relation to retrospectively commencing instruments. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (10:06): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011, representing the first tranche of legislation implementing the government's improvements to Australia's anti-dumping system. The package of improvements announced by the Gillard government on 22 June 2011 are the most important changes to Australia's anti-dumping regime in more than a decade. These changes will improve the way we administer global anti-dumping rules in Australia, and better align our laws and practices with other countries. These changes overall will improve the anti-dumping system's effectiveness and they are vital because, even though our economy is strong, some local industries are vulnerable to dumping. The government's package of improvements to the anti-dumping system will help keep our economy strong and provide greater certainty and support for our local industries, workers, families and communities against unfair dumping practices. The package of improvements announced by the government on 22 June includes the government's response to the Productivity Commission's report into Australia's anti-dumping system. These changes also respond to issues identified by Senator Xenophon, in a private member's bill introduced into the Senate in March, and also take account of important issues that have been raised by stakeholders in relation to the operation of Australia's anti-dumping system. The improvements that I am introducing today capture the four key themes which have been at the heart of the government's detailed examination of how the existing anti-dumping system can be improved. First, these changes improve the timeliness of the anti-dumping system through the imposition of a time limit on ministerial decision making. Second, we will improve decision making by clarifying that all appropriate and relevant factors which may indicate material injury to an Australian industry are specifically listed as factors to which the minister may have regard. Third, these changes aim to provide greater comparability of Australia's anti-dumping system with those of other jurisdictions, and further implement the relevant World Trade Organisation agreements which provide the basis for internationally agreed anti-dumping rules. Fourth, these changes will clarify that parties with a clear interest in anti-dumping matters are expressly given an opportunity to participate in anti-dumping investigations. These amendments were developed after consultation with industry, and subsequently drafted in consultation with the Attorney General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in order to ensure that they are consistent with Australia's international legal obligations. Time frame for ministerial decision making. In relation to the improved timeliness of the system, these amendments provide that the minister will exercise decision-making powers within 30 days of receiving a report or recommendation on which to make a decision. Unlike all other decisions and processes the anti-dumping system there are currently no legislative time constraints governing the minister's decision. The responsible minister has a large range of decision-making functions in the anti-dumping system and may make decisions following:  an investigation to determine whether anti-dumping or countervailing measures should be imposed,  a continuation inquiry to determine whether anti-dumping or countervailing measures should continue beyond the specified expiry date,  a review of measures to determine whether measures should be varied to reflect contemporary market conditions, or revoked where they are no longer justified, or  a review (appeal) to the review officer of an earlier ministerial decision, including where relevant, where a reinvestigation has been performed by Customs and Border Protection. The amendments provide that, subject to extenuating circumstances, the minister will make a decision within 30 days of receiving the relevant report and/or recommendations. There are clear benefits in imposing a time limit on ministerial decision making, providing greater certainty for parties, and ultimately reducing the overall time frame to conclude an investigation. Maintaining Australia's comparatively brief investigative time frames is important because anti-dumping investigations affect the commercial operations of a range of stakeholders. Consideration of injury factors In relation to improved decision making, these amendments provide that, in determining whether material injury to an Australian industry has been or is being in caused or is threatened, the minister may consider any impacts on jobs and any impact on investment in the domestic industry producing like goods to the goods which are the subject of the investigation. The Customs Act currently contains a list of relevant economic factors which the minister may have regard to when determining material injury. However, certain injury factors could be more adequately considered when assessing whether dumping or subsidisation has caused material injury. The impact on jobs and investment in an industry are two such factors. The amendments provide that the minister can consider any impact on jobs in the domestic industry producing like goods, not just the effects currently specified. As well as the wage rate and the number of workers employed, the minister would be able to consider all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment, including the number of hours worked and the incidence of part-time employment. The amendments also provide that the minister can examine any impact on investment in the industry, to again ensure that a broad examination of the factors affecting investment is permitted. Expanding the list of actionable subsidies In relation to ensuring that Australia's anti-dumping system is in step with comparable administrations, these amendments ensure that Australian industry can apply for countervailing duties on the full range of actionable subsidies provided by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. These WTO agreements specify the types of government subsidies that can be actioned by another country. Australian legislation has not reflected the fact that some subsidies were excluded on a temporary basis. As a result, Australian companies cannot currently seek remedies in relation to these subsidies. These amendments update the Customs Act to reflect all countervailable subsidies under the WTO including certain assistance:  for research activities conducted by firms or by higher education and research establishments  for disadvantaged regions pursuant to a general framework of regional development  to enable firms to adapt to new environmental requirements, and for a variety of government programs that provide services or benefits to agriculture. These amendments ensure that Australian companies can take action against subsidies of this nature where such subsidies cause material injury. Australian companies will therefore be operating on a level playing field compared to manufacturers and producers in other jurisdictions, as they are no longer disadvantaged by restrictions associated with out-of-date legislation. Expanding the definition of 'interested party' In relation to accessibility, these amendments ensure that all relevant parties are expressly recognised as having rights to participate in anti-dumping and countervailing investigations as an 'interested party'. An 'interested party' to an investigation is currently defined in section 269T of the Customs Act to comprise, in broad terms, domestic manufacturers and producers, importers, exporters, trade organisations and foreign governments. Submissions to government suggest that in the present system some stakeholder groups, who should be engaged, are not properly engaged in anti-dumping investigations. The amendments clarify that industry associations, trade unions and downstream industry (whether or not they are an importer) who have a direct interest in a particular matter can be treated as interested parties. The amendments further confirm that these parties can participate in an investigation. This change will not affect the present standing requirements for determining who can bring an application for anti-dumping or countervailing measures. Rather, the amendments make it clear who has a right to participate in investigations once an application is initiated. These amendments will facilitate the provision of relevant information to Customs and Border Protection during the investigation phase and ensure that reports and recommendations made to the minister take account of the views and interests of this broader range of stakeholders. Concluding remarks The government is committed to ensuring that we have an effective, accessible anti-dumping system that complies with WTO obligations. The first tranche of changes set out in this bill directly respond to concerns expressed by stakeholders about the accessibility and timeliness of the anti-dumping system. These amendments will further strengthen the anti-dumping system by improving decision making in relation to how material injury to an Australian industry is assessed. It will also improve accessibility by ensuring that interested parties with a stake in an anti-dumping matter will have the opportunity to participate and be heard in anti-dumping investigations. The government believes that better support can be provided to our local industries and workforce with a streamlined, rigorous and better resourced anti-dumping system. The government's package of improvements, of which this bill is the first tranche, will provide more certainty for local manufacturers and primary producers resulting in more confidence to invest in the future. Indeed, the rules against unfair dumping practices will be more effectively applied. This bill will result in better access to anti-dumping system; improved timeliness; improved quality of decision making; and greater consistency with other countries, in line with WTO guidelines. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (10:16): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Crime has significant social and economic costs that undermine our safety, security and prosperity. Our increasingly global world is presenting new opportunities for criminal groups to expand their illicit enterprises beyond traditional state borders, and escape justice. This means that a high level of international cooperation is crucial to effectively combat crime. Australia's current extradition and mutual assistance legislation was developed over 20 years ago. There was no internet in 1988 and mobile phones were a new commodity. International travel has become much more common, and the international financial system more accessible. These developments have meant that our laws no longer meet the needs of Australia's international law enforcement activities as effectively as they used to. A comprehensive review of Australia's international crime cooperation laws was therefore timely. In 2006, discussion papers the were released for public consultation that proposed fundamental reforms to Australia's international crime cooperation laws and procedures, including in the areas of extradition and mutual assistance. The concept of this bill evolved out of that review and drafts of the bill were released for public consultation in 2009, and again in January this year. Over 40 submissions were received and the government has carefully considered the views raised in both consultation processes in developing the final version of this bill. Essentially, the bill has two key objectives: to streamline and modernise the process for extradition, and to ensure Australian authorities can offer a comprehensive range of assistance to our international criminal justice partners. Streamlining extradition Faster and simpler surrender procedures will ensure that accused persons avoid unnecessary delays and this will also assist Australia to fulfil its international to secure the return of alleged offenders to face justice, promptly and efficiently. Waiver of extradition The process for extraditing a person can be cumbersome and take several months to finalise, even if a person has consented to their extradition. The bill will allow a person who consents to being extradited to waive the extradition process subject to certain safeguards. The bill will allow a person, once arrested, to immediately elect to remove himself or herself from the extradition process and be surrendered to the foreign country. As not all stages of the extradition process would be required to be completed, the extradition process will be significantly streamlined where a person elects to waive extradition. Although this will mean that not all stages of the extradition process will need to be completed, the safeguards built into the extradition regime will still apply. Firstly, a magistrate must be satisfied that the person understands the consequences of waiving extradition. Secondly, despite a person waiving the right to be subject to the extradition process, the minister would not be able to surrender the person if the person would be in danger of torture or subject to the death penalty. Streamlining the early stages of extradition The bill will also streamline the early stages of the extradition process. Currently, dual criminality and 'extradition objections' are factors which must be considered by the relevant minister when deciding whether to accept an extradition request. Both of these factors are then also considered by the magistrate when deciding if the person is eligible for surrender, and extradition objections are again considered by the minister when deciding whether or not to order a obligation person's extradition. The bill will remove the requirement for the relevant minister to consider these factors at the initial stage of accepting the request. However, both factors will continue to be considered by a magistrate when conducting extradition proceedings, and extradition objections will continue to be considered by the minister when deciding whether to surrender a person. Ensuring criminals do not escape justice The bill will also ensure that persons who have committed crimes do not escape justice simply because the person is not able to be extradited. Prosecution in lieu of extradition Currently, a person can only be prosecuted in Australia in lieu of extradition where extradition has been refused on the basis that the person is an Australian citizen. This bill will enable a person to be prosecuted in any circumstances where Australia has refused extradition. This will ensure that refusal to extradite does not mean that a person escapes justice. Improving safeguards in extradition The bill will improve safeguards for persons subject to the extradition process. Extending the availability of bail Currently, a person may be granted bail during the early stages of the extradition process. However, once a magistrate decides a person is eligible for surrender, he or she must be committed to prison. The bill will extend the availability of bail to persons have consented to extradition or been determined eligible for surrender by a magistrate. This will ensure that where special circumstances justifying bail exist, the person will not be kept in prison at the later stages of the extradition process. Strengthening torture protections The bill will also strengthen protections where there are torture concerns in the requesting country, by ensuring the wording in the Extradition Act is consistent with the United Nations Convention against Torture. This will ensure that terminology used in our domestic regime mirrors our international obligations. Discrimination on the basis of sex or sexual orientation Further, the bill will include for refusing extradition where the person may be punished, or discriminated against, upon surrender on the basis of his or her sex or sexual orientation. These additional grounds complement the general discretion to refuse to extradite a person which allows the minister to take into account all relevant considerations and representations as to personal circumstances such as a person's gender identity, and related health and humanitarian considerations. This will demonstrate Australia's firm position against this type of discrimination. Mutual assistance amendments The second key purpose of the bill is to make a range of amendments to improve the operation of Australia's mutual assistance regime. Strengthening safeguards The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 already contains grounds on which the relevant minister may or must refuse a mutual assistance request from a foreign country. The bill will make a range who of amendments to strengthen and improve the operation of the grounds for refusal. Firstly, the bill will expand the operation of these grounds of refusal to make clear that they apply at the investigation stage as well as at the prosecution stage, and also to proceeds of crime related requests. Secondly, the bill will expand the discrimination ground of refusal to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Thirdly, the bill will extend the death penalty ground of refusal to circumstances in which a person has been arrested or detained on suspicion of committing a death penalty offence. This will ensure the mandatory ground of refusal for death penalty offences applies regardless of whether formal charges a new ground have been laid. Finally, the bill will insert an express mandatory ground for refusal where there are substantial grounds to believe the provision of the assistance would result in a person being subjected to torture. These changes complement the general discretion to refuse to provide assistance which allows the minister to take into account all relevant considerations. As these grounds for refusal apply to any request for assistance from a foreign country, these amendments will ensure Australia is only providing assistance in appropriate circumstances. Increasing the range of law enforcement tools available to assist other countries Amendments will be made to the Crimes Act 1914, the mutual assistance act, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to increase the range of law enforcement tools available to assist foreign countries with their investigations and prosecutions. Lawfully accessed material Currently, telecommunications interception product and covertly accessed stored communications material, obtained originally in an Australian investigation, can only act. be provided to a foreign country through costly and time consuming proceedings. The bill will streamline this process and include a range of safeguards to ensure information is only provided to foreign countries in appropriate circumstances. Firstly, the minister's approval will be required before any telecommunications interception product or covertly accessed stored communications material is able to be provided to a foreign country. The safeguards under the mutual assistance act would apply in assessing whether to provide that material. Secondly, covertly accessed stored communications material and telecommunications interception product will only be provided to a foreign country in circumstances where the relevant foreign offence carries a penalty mirroring our domestic offence. Finally, as part of the government's commitment to openness and transparency, the Minister for Justice will be required to report annually on the provision of this type of information to foreign countries. Surveillance devices The bill will also enable surveillance device warrants to be obtained for foreign law enforcement purposes. Currently, this power is limited to the investigation of domestic offences. Once again, there are a range of safeguards in place to ensure these powers are only used where appropriate. Firstly, ministerial approval will be required before a surveillance device warrant is able to be sought for foreign purposes. In deciding whether or not to give that approval, the minister would consider the mandatory and discretionary grounds of refusal contained in the mutual assistance Secondly, a warrant will only be able to be obtained if the relevant foreign offence meets the threshold for when a surveillance device warrant is able to be issued for domestic offences. Finally, agencies will be required to report on the use of surveillance devices for foreign law enforcement purposes. Forensic procedures Forensic procedures (for example, obtaining fingerprints and DNA samples) can provide compelling evidence which may confirm or exclude a person as a suspect in the commission of an offence. These procedures are used in criminal investigations throughout Australia. The bill will enable the forensic procedures provisions in the Crimes Act to be used for the purpose of assisting with foreign law enforcement. The bill will enable forensic procedures to be carried out on suspects and volunteers, including children and incapable persons in certain circumstances, for foreign purposes. These procedures would be carried out in the same circumstances and in the same manner as for the investigation of domestic offences. The amendments also put in place a range of safeguards. Importantly, a person will first be asked if they consent to the procedure being carried out. If they do not consent, approval from the minister and an order of a magistrate will be necessary before the procedure can be carried out. A magistrate will only be able to authorise the carrying out of a forensic procedure after taking into account a range of circumstances, including whether the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances. Further, despite any order by the magistrate for the carrying out of a forensic procedure, in circumstances where a child or an incapable person objects to, or resists the carrying out of the procedure, it will not be able to be carried out. Proceeds of Crime This bill will also make a range of amendments to part VI of the mutual assistance act to improve the operation of the proceeds of crime provisions in relation to non-conviction based proceeds of crime orders. Obtaining a criminal conviction can be a lengthy process so these types of orders, which can be made regardless of whether a person has been convicted of an offence, are effective tools for preventing dispersal of assets. Currently, Australia can only register such orders from certain countries listed in regulations. The bill will enable Australia to register a non-conviction based proceeds of crime order made in any country or seek a temporary non-conviction based restraining order on behalf of any country. The bill will also streamline the process by which the relevant minister can authorise the use of the proceeds of crime investigative tools in the mutual assistance act. This will ensure Australia is able to respond efficiently and effectively to requests for assistance from other countries. Conclusion The measures in this bill will modernise Australia's international crime cooperation laws, facilitate cooperation with international partners and reduce delays in current processes. The changes will also ensure that accused persons are afforded fair treatment by strengthening legislative protections and safeguarding human rights. These updated laws will ensure Australian law enforcement agencies are able to work effectively and efficiently with their international counterparts to combat crime across the world. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Dr Kelly. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:31): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011 and its two companion bills will provide a mechanism for the horse industry to meet its obligations under the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, and respond to future emergency disease outbreaks affecting the industry. Governments and industry beneficiaries have a shared interest in ensuring that an emergency animal disease is brought under control as quickly as possible. The Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement is a world-first cost-sharing arrangement that enables Australia to respond quickly and efficiently to emergency animal disease outbreaks. It sets out the roles, responsibilities and cost-sharing arrangements for its signatories. Current signatories to the agreement are the Commonwealth, all state and territory governments, Animal Health Australia and 11 livestock industries. Being able to respond quickly minimises the potential impact of an emergency animal disease outbreak on Australia's agricultural production, valuable exports, the environment and public health. Livestock industries also receive considerable benefits from a response to an emergency disease in terms of trade and market access, and through minimisation of livestock and production cost losses. If an emergency animal disease outbreak occurs and it is agreed that a national response is required, the Commonwealth will initially meet a signatory industry's costsharing obligations on the basis that the industry will repay the Commonwealth within a reasonable time period. Most livestock industries have statutory levies in place to enable them to fund their share of costs of national emergency responses. An emergency animal disease response levy is usually set to zero and when an emergency animal disease incident occurs. Some industries have chosen to set a positive operative levy to provide the industry with a fund to respond quickly on its cost-sharing requirements, or to invest funds to increase their biosecurity. The Australian Horse Industry Council, Equestrian Australia, Harness Racing Australia and the Australian Racing Board signed the agreement on behalf of the horse industry in March 2011. To enable it to meet its obligations under the agreement, the horse industry submitted a levy proposal to the Commonwealth. The proposal requested that zero rated levies be imposed on manufactured horse feed and worm treatments for horses on the horse industry. In developing the proposal, the horse industry undertook extensive consultation, and a range of levy options were discussed at the national, state and local levels of the horse-owning community. The horse industry decided that the simultaneous application of levies on worm treatments and manufactured horse feed would provide the most equitable coverage of the horse industry. This bill and its companion bills provide the framework for these levies to be imposed, and are an important step in enabling the horse industry to manage future emergency animal disease outbreaks. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Horse Disease Response Levy Collection Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum only activated presented by Dr Kelly. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:35): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Horse Disease Response Levy Collection Bill 2011 is a companion bill to the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011. This bill will provide authority for the Australian government to collect and administer the horse disease response levies. A separate bill is necessary as the Australian Constitution requires that provisions dealing with the collection and administration of a levy must be in legislation separate from that which imposes the levy itself. This bill also includes provision for periodic review of the levy mechanisms. It requires the minister to ensure that the mechanisms are reviewed every five years, unless the levies are active at the time the review is due. If this occurs, the minister has the option to postpone the review until the levies are set back to zero. The minister will seek advice from affected parties before determining whether the review should be postponed. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Dr Kelly. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:37): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 is a companion bill to the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011. This bill will make amendments to the Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Act 1996. These amendments will allow for the Australian Animal Health Council, also known as Animal Health Australia, to hold and manage funds raised by the levies on behalf of the horse industry. It will also authorise Animal Health Australia to meet its own costs in managing the funds. This arrangement will be similar to arrangements that other livestock industries have in place to fund their liabilities under the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned.

I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Inventory) Bill 2011 which amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act established a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals used in Australia to aid in the protection of human health and safety and the environment, to provide for registration of certain persons proposing to introduce industrial chemicals and to enable making of national standards for cosmetics manufactured or imported into Australia. The National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme-NICNASadministers this act. The activities of NICNAS therefore underpin essential advice to other government agencies which collectively make up Australia's regulatory system for industrial chemicals The bill presents amendments that continue to deliver on the government's commitment to decreasing regulatory burden and efficiently using resources while maintaining health and environmental safety. The bill does this by implementing important parts of NICNAS's continuing reform program-namely, the completion of the reforms to the cosmetic therapeutic interface and making technical, but no less important changes, to enhance the administration and efficiency of the scheme's assessment processes. The bill underpins completion of the cosmetic regulatory reforms largely implemented through the amendment of the act in 2007 as part of the Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals reform initiative. In 2007, in order to facilitate the transfer of regulatory responsibility for certain lowrisk products at the therapeutic cosmetic interface from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to NICNAS, changes to the act resulted in the introduction of the NICNAS Cosmetics Standard. The standard enabled NICNAS to regulate certain cosmetics by prescribing minimum standards for these products in Australia and imposed penalties for non-compliance. However, a mechanism to transfer the chemicals in these cosmetic products from the TGA onto the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances had not been developed at that time. In the absence of the transfer mechanism, some introducers of the chemicals have to meet the requirements of the new chemicals framework with the associated notification and assessment costs or reporting obligations. The proposed bill will make the necessary changes to the act to address this regulatory gap in the protection of public health and enable proper regulation of chemicals in these cosmetics products through entry of the chemicals on the national inventory. This regulatory mechanism used to transfer chemicals in cosmetics, which have been transferred from the TGA to NICNAS, can also be used for other chemicals. This means that chemicals in products previously regulated by other Commonwealth agencies can be smoothly transferred to NICNAS. The power to place chemicals that have been transferred to NICNAS onto the Australian chemical registry will be open and transparent. As some chemicals to be transferred to NICNAS may not have been assessed by other Commonwealth agency, the transfer procedure will allow public submissions on a proposal to include or not include a transferred chemical on the inventory. The director's decision to include or not include a transferred chemical on the inventory is also reviewable by the AAT. In cases where transferred chemicals have been assessed and controls have been implemented by the other agency, the controls will be able to be maintained, ensuring that legal obligations to comply with pre-existing controls are preserved. For example, the cosmetic reforms in 2007 included the transfer of regulatory responsibility for secondary sunscreen products which are applied to the skin, for example, moisturisers containing a sunscreening chemical. Currently, NICNAS assesses the UV filter chemicals in these products by requesting, on a case-by-case basis, the additional data required for sunscreens under the TGA. The bill addresses the more efficient collection of this data by creating a new section in the schedule of data requirements to include those requirements that are specific to UV filters. The intent of this amendment to the schedule is to formalise current arrangements and maintain a consistent approach to the assessment of these chemicals across regulatory schemes. The bill also makes technical amendments to the schedule to the act to improve clarity and consistency to other data requirements for new chemical assessments. These proposed technical amendments will not place any significant additional requirements on the industrial chemicals industry. One technical amendment removes the current requirement for NICNAS to publish summary assessment reports. The need to publish summary reports was originally included in the act at the time when NICNAS assessment reports were only available in hard copy and had to be purchased. As a result, a summary report was made available free of charge. With the advent of the internet, the NICNAS assessment reports are now freely available on the NICNAS website, rendering the publication of summary reports obsolete. However, to facilitate public access to these reports, NICNAS will publish a short notice outlining the key content of new assessment reports in the Chemical Gazette, with a link to those reports. These amendments have been developed in response to industry and community concerns and in close consultation with industry, government and the community. The proposed amendments enable NICNAS to properly regulate chemicals used in cosmetics-and in other chemicals transferred from other Commonwealth regulatory schemes-and to improve current data requirements and administrative processes to provide a more efficient process and make more information available to stakeholders. The bill does this while, of course, maintaining existing levels of worker safety, public health and environmental standards. These amendments therefore represent an important step in improving the operation of Australia's framework for regulating chemicals and reflect the government's commitment to ensure the most efficient regulatory system is in place for industrial chemicals, including those in cosmetics. Debate adjourned. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",44
9,Mr SHORTEN,COMMITTEES,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:45): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 introduces amendments which will transfer responsibility for the general administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive Medicare. This bill provides for a change in administrative responsibility for this function. Current policy in respect of the early release of superannuation will not change. Early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds The purpose of superannuation is to provide benefits for members on retirement after reaching their preservation age, or for their dependants in the event of the member's death. However, a member's preserved superannuation benefits may be released before preservation age in some strictly limited circumstances, including on compassionate grounds. Compassionate grounds are defined in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations and the Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations, and cover expenses in respect of medical treatment, medical transport, modifications necessary for the family home or motor vehicle due to severe disability, palliative care and funeral expensMedicare es. Funds may also be released on compassionate grounds to prevent the foreclosure of a mortgage or exercise of a power of sale over the member's principal place of residence. The regulator may also approve the release of benefits where the regulator determines that the release would be consistent with one of the specified compassionate grounds. As I have already noted, this bill does not change the criteria for early release. Administration of the function When a person is seeking to access their preserved superannuation benefits on compassionate grounds, they can apply to the regulator for a determination that an amount of their benefits can be released. The final decision on whether a release is permitted rests with the trustees of the person's fund, subject to the governing rules of that fund. APRA is the regulator for all APRA regulated superannuation funds, and is therefore responsible for the administration of early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds for these funds. The Commissioner of Taxation is the regulator in respect of self-managed superannuation funds. Administration of the function involves the operation of a call centre and assessing and ruling on each application for release. This function does not fit well with APRA's legislative role as the prudential regulator the Australian financial services industry. The government considers that this function would be administered more cost effectively by an agency which deals with other elements of income support and has an efficient customer support infrastructure. The government has determined that Australia is the agency best placed to take on the function. Medicare Australia was chosen as it can develop the function as a companion activity to the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House and it has use of existing technology and experience in electronic business transactions which provides significant potential to streamline the program. Transfer Medicare Australia is currently undertaking the general administration of early release on compassionate grounds under delegation from APRA. Administration was outsourced by APRA through a service agreement between APRA and Medicare Australia. As a consequence, Medicare Australia has gained a comprehensive understanding of the function ahead of the formal legislative transfer. This bill represents the second stage in the transfer process. It will give effect to the formal transfer of the function from APRA to Medicare Australia. Part 1 of schedule 1 to the bill will amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 to provide that the Chief Executive Medicare is the regulator for the purposes of the general administration of making determinations in respect to the release of superannuation benefits on compassionate grounds. Part 2 of schedule 1 will amend the of Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 to allow the function to continue to be funded by superannuation industry levies. Conclusion The transfer of responsibility for this function is a machinery of government change, with no financial impact and no compliance cost to business. Medicare Australia is better suited to administer this function, and after it becomes formally responsible for administration of early release on compassionate grounds, there may be scope to considerably streamline the function. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",46
10,Mr SHORTEN,COMMITTEES,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:51): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to address uncertainties that have arisen regarding the application of crude oil excise to condensate production. Condensate is a light crude oil extracted from natural gas. In the 2008-09 budget, the government announced its decision to remove the long standing crude oil excise exemption that had applied to condensate production, with effect from midnight (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory), 13 May 2008. The intention of that measure was to increase the return to the Australian community for allowing private interests to extract nonrenewable energy resources located in the North West Shelf project and onshore Australia and was estimated to raise $2.5 billion in revenue over the three years to 2011-12. The measures included in this bill, together with those in the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011, clarify uncertainties that have arisen following the removal of the exemption. These uncertainties relate to two elements integral to the operation of the crude oil excise regime, namely, the prescription of condensate production areas-which define the areas over which the excise is applied-and the determination of the volume weighted average of realised prices, or the VOLWARE price, which are the prices used to calculate excise liability. In November 2008, the Commissioner of Taxation prescribed the Rankin Trend as a condensate production area through by-law, with effect from 13 May 2008. The Rankin Trend is located within the North West Shelf project area and encompasses a number of spatially related reservoirs. It was prescribed as a single condensate production area on the basis that the Rankin Trend reservoirs form a single field. Doubts have subsequently been raised regarding the validity of the Rankin Trend by-law. These doubts relate to the area that the Rankin Trend encompasses, with claims it is of an uncertain size and could be interpreted as being significantly larger than the area intended when it was prescribed. The Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to address any uncertainty regarding the area encompassed by the Rankin Trend. It does this by introducing a statutory definition of the Rankin Trend within the act as being the area including those reservoirs previously identified as forming a single field. The amendments will also allow for additional reservoirs which commence production to be added to the Rankin Trend condensate production area by regulation in circumstances where the resource minister is satisfied they form part of the Rankin Trend field, and after considering what effect, if any, this may have on the efficient exploitation of the resource. These amendments serve only to clarify and confirm the current application of the crude oil excise to condensate production, consistent with the original policy intent, and have no revenue impact. The measure will take effect from midnight (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory), 13 May 2008, consistent with the original 2008-09 budget measure. Full details of the measures in this bill contained in the combined explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned.

11,Mr SHORTEN,COMMITTEES,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:55): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to address uncertainties that have arisen regarding the determination of volume weighted average realised prices, or VOLWARE prices, which are the prices used to calculate excise liability. Under the crude oil excise regime, a VOLWARE price is required to be determined for each month by the minister, or a person authorised by the minister, within a specific time. A written notice setting out the terms of these price determinations must also be provided to the relevant producer or producers, although no time period for doing so is specified. It has been suggested that written notice setting out the terms of a price determination is not provided to producers then the determination itself is invalid. The Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill amends the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to clarify that a failure to provide written notice of a VOLWARE price determination does not affect the validity of the determination. The amendments also extend the ability of producers to seek a review of VOLWARE price determinations by allowing them to are seek a review within 28 days of receiving a written notice. These amendments serve only to clarify the existing operation of the law and have no revenue impact. The measures will take effect from midnight (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory), 13 May 2008, consistent with the original 2008-09 budget measure. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the combined explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Martin Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (10:57): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Under the oversight of the Council of Australian Governments, Australia has made significant progress over the last decade towards an efficient and effective national if a energy market, in particular in the development of uniform national energy laws for electricity and gas. This bill I am introducing today is part of the current Council of Australian Governments' reform program under which noneconomic regulation of the distribution and retail of gas and electricity will also be subject to the national energy institutions regulatory arrangements. The Australian Energy Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 sees the Commonwealth take an important role in implementing the cooperative legislative regime for regulating retailers and distributors who sell and supply electricity and gas to retail customers. It is the final major component of the national energy market reform program agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in response to their 2002 Energy Market Review, Towards a truly national and efficient energy market, and set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement. The South Australian parliament passed the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Bill 2010 (SA) on 9 March 2011. That bill received royal assent on 17 March 2011. The National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA) includes as its schedule the National Energy Retail Law, which provides for rules and regulations to be made under that law, called the National Energy Retail Rules and the National Energy Retail Regulations. The National Energy Retail Law set out in the schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), and the rules and regulations to be made under it, are supported by amendments to the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law included in the Statutes Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Act 2011 (SA). The South Australian minister will also make rules which amend the National Electricity Rules and the National Gas Rules on two related matters. The first set of amendments are national rules which enable retail customers and property developers to seek new (or significant modifications to existing) connections to electricity and gas and distribution networks. The second set of amendments are new rules to set out the Market rights and obligations between distributors and retailers which are necessary to support the retail supply of energy to customers and include a credit support regime. Together, the National Energy Retail Law set out in the schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), the rules and regulations made under it and the consequential amendments to the national electricity and national gas regimes are known as the National Energy Customer Framework (the customer framework). The customer framework will be applied in all jurisdictions which are part of the National Electricity Market, namely South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Queensland as well as the Commonwealth, by application acts. The Ministerial Council on Energy has agreed that jurisdictions will aim for a target uniform commencement date for the customer framework of 1 July 2012, noting that transitional legislative arrangements will be required to appropriately manage the transition process. This bill will amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 (Cth) to apply the National Energy Retail Law set out in the schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), and the rules and regulations made under it, as a law of the Commonwealth in Australia's offshore area (essentially, the area from three nautical miles offshore to the edge of the continental shelf). This bill will therefore make the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 (Cth) the Commonwealth's 'application act' for the new national energy retail regime. The National Energy Retail Law will be under the jurisdiction of the Australian Energy Regulator as regulator and enforcement body and the Australian Energy Market Commission as rule maker. Its primary aims are to streamline regulatory requirements, increase efficiency through regulatory harmonisation and maintain best practice consumer protection. As a result, the National Energy Retail Law is expected to facilitate an increase in retail competition reducing regulatory complexity and lowering barriers to entry, as well as by encouraging consumers to participate in this competitive market by providing strong and equitable consumer protections across participating jurisdictions. Other key benefits of the National Energy Retail Law include an increase in efficiency and competition obtained through having national regulatory arrangements, a comprehensive suite of robust energy specific consumer protections, and the establishment of a national retailerof-last-resort framework. The National Energy Retail Law incorporates an objective which mirrors the objectives in the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law. The national energy retail objective is 'to promote efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, energy services for the long term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of energy'. The alignment between the objectives of the laws governing the various sectors of the energy markets is an important foundation for the regime. Currently each jurisdictional regime has a different regulator that makes decisions and determinations for that jurisdiction. Under the new National Energy Retail Law, the regulation of all energy retail businesses will be undertaken by a single national regulator, the Australian Energy Regulator-a Commonwealth body. This bill provides for the extension of the Australian Energy Regulator's powers to regulate the retail energy market. The National Energy Retail Law therefore brings the whole energy supply chain-wholesale markets, transmission networks, distribution networks and now retail markets-under national regulation with the Australian Energy Regulator by overseeing a robust compliance and enforcement regime across all participating jurisdictions. This crucial reform will lead to a more efficient and consistent regulatory decision-making process. Under the National Energy Retail Law, the Australian Energy Regulator will exercise a range of regulatory functions and powers. These functions include administering a targeted compliance monitoring and enforcement regime. The enforcement regime in the National Energy Retail Law reflects and enhances the current enforcement regimes in the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law to create a harmonised enforcement regime across the national legislative frameworks. The National Energy Retail Law will give the Australian Energy Regulator a range of new functions and powers, suitable for the regulation of the energy retail regime. These include the power to accept enforceable undertakings from energy market participants for the first time. The national regulator will also have certain new approval functions and undertake performance monitoring and reporting functions specifically targeted to the retail energy market. The proposed amendments to Commonwealth legislation provided for in this bill will ensure that the Commonwealth bodies that are conferred with functions, powers and duties under the National Energy Retail Law (the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal) are able to perform those functions and duties and exercise those powers from the commencement date. Our role in this parliament is to facilitate this. To this end, this bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) to explicitly allow the National Energy Retail Law, when applied as a law of a state or territory, to confer functions and powers, and impose duties on these two Commonwealth bodies. This includes, in relation to the Australian Energy Regulator, functions, powers or duties conferred or imposed under 'local energy instruments'. These are subordinate instruments made under a state or territory law that applies the National Energy Retail Law, the National Electricity Law or the National Gas Law in its own jurisdiction. The bill will also provide that decisions and instruments made by the Australian Energy Regulator for the purposes of the National Energy Retail Law before it commences, such as guidelines made in accordance with the retail consultation procedure set out in the National Energy Retail Rules, will be valid and effective from the commencement of the National Energy Retail Law in this jurisdiction. The amendment acts of other jurisdictions will contain similar provisions. It is important to provide the Australian Energy Regulator with this legislative support, so that it can undertake essential activities necessary for the commencement of the new regulatory regime. The involvement of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal is therefore an essential part of this cooperative scheme, and I move: the Commonwealth must take the lead by legislating to provide for these functions and powers to be exercised. The South Australian parliament, and indeed parliaments in all participating jurisdictions, must see that the Commonwealth is committed to this cooperative scheme. The amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 contained in this bill will ensure that decisions made by Commonwealth bodies, such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal, under the National Energy Retail Law, when applied as state or territory law are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court. In summary, the amendments I am introducing today represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national energy retail regime under a national energy regulator. This cooperative scheme will ensure that Australia enjoys strong energy customer protections and the benefits of competitive and efficient energy retail markets-both electricity and gas-whilst minimising the regulatory burden on industry. This bill has the full support of my state and territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. NA Selection Committee Membership",49

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON: by leaveThat Mr Hayes be discharged from the Selection Committee and that, in his place, Mr Husic be appointed a member of the committee. Question agreed to. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",52
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011, the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011, the Offshore Resources Legislation Amendment (Personal Property Securities) Bill 2011 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No 2) Bill 2011.",53
14,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES," Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill and cognate bills were the subject of an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, which gave the House and the public an opportunity to scrutinise these important changes to the offshore regulations. I congratulate the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Selection Committee. I see that the Standing Committee on Procedure has put out a small report on the amount of legislation that is now going through that committee and being referred to our House committees. I think that is a good process and it certainly improves our legislation, and I congratulate the minister for doing that. The main purpose of the bills is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and associated acts to implement reforms associated with the BILLS establishment of a national offshore regulator in Commonwealth waters. The bills address the regulatory framework for petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities and do not impinge on the activities themselves. The four main objectives of the reforms in the bills are, firstly, to provide an integrated approach to the regulation of safety, structural integrity and environmental management. I think that point itself is an important one, bringing together the need for regulation of human safety and the safety of what we do offshore, the structural integrity of the wells themselves and of the work out there and environmental management. It is important that we deal with those issues. We can deal with these issues and have proper and good environmental management around the work we do. The processes we get into of constantly trying to stop or lock things up and not use some of our resources I think are very foolish and we need to think of The things in a broader way. If we have environmental management done in a proper manner, independently, we can do this in a very modern way. We need to think much broader than we have in the past. I also think it gives us an opportunity of providing within this industry and within the regulating industry some very skilled people. The second point is to ensure that this regulation is independent and appropriately skilled and resourced, as I said, to separate the resource development function from regulation and retain resource development within government; and to reduce the regulatory inconsistency and duplication that is inherent in the existing regulatory regime. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011, the national regulator bill, will amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It will establish two regulatory bodies to administer and regulate petroleum and greenhouse gas storage operations in Commonwealth waters in the Australian offshore area. The new bodies will replace the designated authorities-the state and Northern Territory ministers who, through their departments, have performed functions and exercised powers conferred directly on them by the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and its predecessor act, Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006 to reference the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, NOPTA, which will be established through the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Act 2011. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 to reference NOPTA, and the purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No.2) Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to impose new cost-recovery levies on holders of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titles. The levies will recover the costs of NOPTA in undertaking its regulatory functions in relation to titles administration and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, in undertaking its regulatory functions in relation to environmental management. The purpose of the Offshore Resources Legislation Amendment (Personal Property Securities) Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 to exclude application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009. The Productivity Commission delivered its 'Review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector' in April 2009 and identified significant unnecessary regulatory burdens on the sector. Its principal recommendation to the reduce those burdens was the establishment of a national offshore regulator. The reason these bills came about can be traced back to April 2007, to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association's strategic leaders report, Platform for prosperity. This report identified more efficient national petroleum regulation as a policy priority. The APPEA called for the Productivity Commission to carry out a review of the onshore and offshore regulatory framework in order to assist implementation of a more efficient and nationally consistent petroleum regulatory regime. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, identified the upstream petroleum sector as one area where overlapping and inconsistent regulation threatens to impede economic activity and agreed that the Productivity Commission should undertake a review, which occurred, and the report of the review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector was released in April 2009. This identified significant unnecessary regulatory burdens on the sector. Its principal recommendation to reduce those burdens was the establishment of a national offshore regulator. The Productivity Commission also identified significant potential national income gains, in the order of billions of dollars each year, from the implementation of its recommended reforms. The Commonwealth government sought to develop an all-of-government response to the Productivity Commission report through the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources, the MCMPR, and established a working group of officials involving all jurisdictions to develop the responses. By the end of 2009, the MCMPR had agreed 25 responses to the Productivity Commission recommendations but deferred its consideration of the recommendations for a national offshore regulator pending the outcomes of the Montara Commission of Inquiry The Montara incident in 2009 highlighted problems arising from regulatory gaps between regulation of safety separate from regulation of integrity, environment and dayto-day operations. The Commonwealth's draft response included the reform model that is now in the current amendment bills. Stakeholders were provided three months to comment on the draft response. On 18 February 2011, the MCMPR met to consider the Commonwealth's proposed establishment of a national offshore regulator and set up a working group from all jurisdictions, and the bills were developed from their findings. The starting point for these bills is the essential reforms identified by the Productivity Commission report and the report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry. The House standing committee agrees with the government that failing to address the findings of these reports is not option. We also believe that these bills do fulfil the objectives laid down by those reports. The bills are actually reforming regulatory processes, tidying up the present arrangement between regulatory bodies for the new era we are now in for the regulation of offshore petroleum. They are making the regulatory environment more efficient and effective and are moving towards world's best practice. An essential part of this is cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory in the transition to the national regulator. The committee is heartened by the evidence of cooperation between Western Australia and the Commonwealth in the formulation of a memorandum of understanding to guide government and industry along the new regulatory path. The success of that process is essential to the future of the industry. Both governments have a responsibility to make it work, to make it operate. There are great opportunities for our nation in having this regulator in place. These bills endorse the formation of NOPTA and NOPSEMA to replace the current regulatory regime. We endorse the retention of the joint authorities but with NOPTA as the principal source of technical advice. We fully endorse the independence of NOPSEMA and do not believe that its activities should be compromised by mandatory consultation with outside bodies. The independence of the regulator of safety, structural integrity and environmental management should be ensured. I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy, the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, for his assistance in bringing these issues to the attention of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on an Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. As I have said, it is heartening to see that more and more legislation is coming before House committees for consideration. I am sure that we end up with much better bills as a result of that consideration. I commend the bills to the House. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:23): Obviously I will make some closing comments on each of the offshore petroleum bills before the House and then I will deal with each of them in terms of potential amendments. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage and Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act to ensure Australia's offshore regulatory regime is robust by reducing unnecessary burden on industry without compromising safety, the environment or resource management. The bill expands the functions of the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority, which becomes the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. This bill also significantly streamlines the administration of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titles by establishing the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator. These amendments go beyond just delivering the Australian government's response to the Productivity Commission's recommendation for the establishment of a national offshore petroleum regulator for Commonwealth waters. Integrating the views gathered from extensive stakeholder consultation over the last 15 months and recognising the outcomes of the Montara Commission of Inquiry report, the Australian government is delivering on its commitment to restoring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry. These amendments will help ensure that our regulatory regime and operating standards are the best and safest the world. These reforms will replace the current inefficient system of seven designated authorities with a national integrated regulatory system, ensuring consistency, efficiency and transparency in Commonwealth waters. Retaining the joint authorities for the Commonwealth minister and the relevant state and territory ministers guarantees that each jurisdiction continues to have a role in decision making on key petroleum titles in Commonwealth waters that could be adjacent to a state or the Northern Territory. The offshore oil and gas industry is vital to sustaining our country's economic prosperity and security. These reforms streamline Australia's regulatory system, bolstering the nation's position as a world leader in offshore oil and gas regulation. The reforms in this bill, together with other complementary bills, will help deliver on the Australian government's commitment to ensuring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of offshore petroleum and reinforce our competitive advantage as a preferred location for investment. I thank all members for their constructive contribution to what is a complex debate. I will deal with a range of issues raised by members and turn first to the contribution of the member for Groom, the former minister for resources, who had responsibility for this very complex industry. During the course of his contribution he expressed disappointment that the government was proceeding with the bill in the absence of a concluded agreement with the Western Australian government concerning collocation of federal and Western Australian offshore petroleum regulators. In reply, I can simply say the Commonwealth has negotiated in good faith with the state of Western Australia on this proposal. On behalf of the Commonwealth I have in signed a memorandum of understanding detailing the proposed arrangements, which I stand by, agreed by officials from within the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, my department and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority. I give my commitment to continue to discuss the matter with the Western Australian minister in the hope that he comes to recognise that the legislative regime for the offshore industry proposed by these bills not only is in the best interests of Australia as a whole but is very much in the interests of Western Australia. It is the government's very firm belief that by locating the headquarters and most operations of NOPSEMA and NOPTA in Perth we are reinforcing the importance of Perth in the world's oil and gas industry. It is also the government's ambition that, because these two regulators will be well resourced and so be able to attract quality staff in what is a high-paying industry, they will be recognised as among the best regulators for this industry in the world, further reinforcing Western Australia's importance in this global industry. In many ways this industry represents a wonderful career opportunity for young Australians. I must say that negotiation cannot be open ended, and it is critical, given the experience of Montara, that the Commonwealth ensures that it is able to properly regulate oil exploration and production for those waters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction as the Commonwealth. The changes we are proposing are not a question of states' rights being denied but rather of the Commonwealth finally accepting its proper responsibilities in relation to waters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction. Delegating those responsibilities to third parties is longer a tenable position for the Commonwealth of Australia. The member for Swan made reference to the Western Australian government not collecting North West Shelf revenues. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, chaired by the member for Lyons, recommended that this function be retained by the state of Western Australia. The Commonwealth accepts the committee's recommendation and I will be moving appropriate amendments to reflect that. The members for Forrest and Swan both incorrectly stated that under these bills the Commonwealth will not have to notify the state of the award of title in Commonwealth waters offshore of Western Australia. In fact the bill does not change current arrangements in this regard. As is presently the case, titles will be awarded by the joint authority of which the state minister is a member. The Western Australian minister will be aware of titles in Commonwealth waters offshore of Western Australia because he or she will participate in their granting. This point illustrates the extent to which I have gone to accommodate Western Australian concerns, and not just in relation to this issue, without compromising the essential aim of improving our national offshore regulatory regime. The honourable member for Forrest was quite right in asserting that this legislation would have the greatest impact on Western Australia, but she was incorrect to imply that this would be a negative impact. I suggest it will be quite the opposite, and not just for the reasons I have already outlined. It is Western Australia that will benefit the most from the increased community confidence that will flow from the improved regulation of Australia's offshore oil and gas industry that this bill will bring about. It goes to our no notion of the social licence to operate in a very important economic area: the further development of our petroleum industry. Without these reforms it will be difficult to see how this industry will achieve its full potential with full public confidence. It is this legislation that secures the industry's long-term future by ensuring that the community's high expectation of environmental and other standards are properly met. It is about ensuring that we meet them in a way in which Australians, wherever they live, can have full confidence, and that is why industry supports these reforms. It sees them as essential to its commercial future and regards them as essential for its social licence to operate in Australian waters. It is this essential point that Western Australians seem to keep missing: all Australians, not just those who live in the West, have the same interest in ensuring that there are no more Montaras and that this industry is regulated in accordance with the world's best practice. That objective is shared by all members of this House, and appropriately so, and I thank them for their support for that objective. In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the members of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry for their report on this legislation. I advise the House that it is the government's intention to accept the committee's recommendations. I also take this opportunity to thank members of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which recommended improvements to the bill that the government will also adopt. I repeat my thanks to honourable members for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bills the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

In doing so, I indicate that the government's amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 respond to a concern raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The standing committee noted that a provision in is the national regulator bill provides the ability for the responsible Commonwealth minister to incorporate into directional material a standard as in force or existing from time to time. The standing committee noted that this ability raises the prospect of changes being made to the law in the absence of parliamentary scrutiny and can create uncertainty in the law, as those obliged to obey the law may have inadequate access to its terms. The proposed amendments remove is this concern and do not adversely impact on the integrity of the other reforms in the package of bills to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator. I commend amendments (1) to (3), as circulated, to the House. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON: by leave I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:37): This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006 (the Registration Fees Act). The amendments are consequential to the amendments in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 (National Regulator Bill). The National Regulator Bill establishes a National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (NOPTA) to administer titles and to advise the joint authorities on key petroleum title decisions. NOPTA will replace the seven designated authorities as the titles administrator for Commonwealth waters. This bill will replace references to the designated authority in the Registration Fees Act with references to the Titles Administrator. The National Regulator Bill makes provision for the registration fees collected under this act to be retained to recover the costs of establishing NOPTA and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management (NOPSEMA). Following the recovery of these establishment costs, expected in 2013, the 1.5 per cent registration fee will be scrapped and replaced with a cost recovery fee which reflects the actual cost of administration with the required expertise. This will create significant savings for the industry. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON: by leave I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:39): The Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 makes consequential amendments to the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006. The amendments reflect the government's streamlining of offshore oil and gas regulation by replacing the seven designated authorities with the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. However, the government amendments to this bill have maintained the Western Australian government's role in the administration of offshore petroleum royalties in the North West Shelf area. To reflect these changes, this bill replaces the functions of the designated authority in the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 with the responsible state Authority minister. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:41): I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. I ask leave of the House to move government amendments (1) to (17), as circulated, together. Leave granted.

(16) Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (line 3), omit ""Titles Administrator"", substitute Minister"". (17) Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 5), at the end of the Schedule, add: 6 Application of amendments-exemptions from royalty (1) The amendments of section 10 of the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 made by this Schedule, in so far as the amendments relate to a use of petroleum, apply to a use that occurs after the commencement of this item. (2) The amendments of section 10 of the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 made by this Schedule, in so far as the amendments relate to the flaring or venting of petroleum, apply to flaring or venting that occurs after the commencement of this item. (3) The amendments of section 10 of the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 made by this Schedule, in so far as the amendments relate to the return of petroleum to a natural reservoir, apply to a return that occurs after the commencement of this item. In moving these amendments, the Australian government is responding to a recommendation of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. The committee has recommended replacing the functions of the designated authority in the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 with the responsible state minister. This amendment was sought by the Western Australian government to continue its role in the administration of offshore petroleum royalties from the North West Shelf project area. I note that offshore petroleum royalties only apply to the North ""State West Shelf project area off Western Australia. In accordance with revenue sharing arrangements in the offshore legislation, the Western Australian government receives approximately two-thirds of the revenue collected. The government amendments propose to continue the Western Australian government's direct role in the administration of offshore petroleum royal""State ties from Commonwealth waters. These waters currently raise significant revenue, estimated to be around $900 million for Western Australia and $450 million for the Commonwealth in 2010-11. The government amendments will enable the continued use of specialist royalty expertise in the Western Australian department. This amendment does not adversely impact on the integrity of the other reforms and the package of bills to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator. I commend the amendments to the House. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON: by leave I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Offshore Resources Legislation Amendment (Personal Property Securities) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:44): This bill excludes application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994. Under registration requirements in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, the regulator has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a petroleum title, and the responsible Commonwealth minister has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a greenhouse gas title. This ability to refuse approval and registration of an interest underpins the purpose of the registration requirement, to enable the Australian government to ensure the suitability of the entities that potentially are able to exercise control over the exploitation of Australia's offshore petroleum resources. Further to this, state and Northern Territory governments have advised the Commonwealth that they are electing to opt out of or exclude the operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 for their onshore mining schemes. Therefore, excluding application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 is important to ensure national consistency for the mining industry by minimising the regulatory burden and costs to the industry and its investors in complying with different registration requirements, to prevent skewing investment. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON: by leave I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:46): This is the fifth and final bill of a complex legislative instrument. Australian taxpayers should not have to bear the cost of regulating the offshore oil and gas activities. This bill will enable the recovery of the cost of regulation from industry, while minimising the regulatory burden on the industry. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to allow two types of cost recovery levies: an annual titles administration levy for an eligible title in force, for each year of the term of the title, to recover the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (NOPTA) costs; and an environment plan levy to recover the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) costs. In line with the Australian government's policy, NOPSEMA and NOPTA are to be funded on a full cost recovery basis with levies raised from the offshore petroleum industry. These fees will be reviewed regularly to ensure the fees reflect the cost of regulating the petroleum industry. The initial fees to recover the establishment and expansion costs for NOPTA and NOPSEMA have already undergone a cost recovery impact statement process. A further cost recovery impact statement will be undertaken in the second half of 2011 covering NOPTA's and NOPSEMA's operating costs after 1 January 2012. These new levies will, on balance, be less than the fees levied under the current designated authority system and will reflect the true cost of offshore regulation. These reforms reduce the unnecessary compliance burden on industry of compliance and ensure the development of our offshore resources for the benefit of all Australians. I also say, in seeking to bring this debate to conclusion, I appreciate the contribution to this debate by a range of members in the House and, importantly, the constructive engagement I have had with the opposition over an extended period in seeking to get to this point. The petroleum industry is very important to Australia's economic future. Gas is also regarded as a clean fuel in a transition to a lower emission economy; hence, the constructive development of this industry is essential to Australia's economic and environmental future. We therefore must work collectively together to maintain our social licence to operate in this industry. The experiences of the last 18 months to two years, both in the US with Macondo in the Gulf and in Australia with Montara, have sent a serious message to each and every one of us that we have to work to improve our performance when it comes to best practice in terms of the regulatory regime applicable in this industry. It is the intent of all members of the House to achieve that objective, and I am very lucky to have the support of the House with respect to that very objective. As is always the case with respect to the reports that I have had to consider and the preparation of the legislative instruments, I, and previously the member for Groom, as minister, rely on a very good Public Service team to do all the necessary hard work. I say to the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, particularly the team responsible which is with us in the House today, thank you for a job well done. It is a huge effort, and the Australian community will be the beneficiary of your detailed commitment to consultation in the preparation of the bills which will soon come to conclusion in consideration of the House. I also say that I will continue to work with the Western Australian government to try and reach a conclusion on what I think is an objective being pursued both by Minister Moore, in Western Australia, and me, in the Commonwealth, with the support of the member for Groom, the shadow minister, to ensure not only that, at the end of this debate, there is agreement but that we are all satisfied we have best practice when it comes to the regulation of the petroleum industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (11:50): by leave-I rise briefly to associate myself with the comments that the Minister for Resources and Energy has just made and to reinforce a few of those comments. Firstly, as to the terms of the social licence of the oil and gas industry to operate in Australia, that is a key issue in terms of this industry going forward. As the minister said, it has a critical, if not crucial, role to play in a low-emissions economy, but it has to do that within the community expectations and the environmental constraints that are placed on the industry and it has to do it in such a way that the industry has the absolute confidence of the community. Secondly, I would like to join the minister in thanking the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism for their role in this legislation. As the minister suggested, it is very complex legislation and there is a set of quite complex amendments to go with it. It has been crucially important, as has been emphasised by those on both sides of the House, that we get this legislation right. It underpins the legislative framework which will ensure the safety of not only those who work in this industry but also, and just as importantly, the environment which hosts this industry. I thank the department, which is, from my personal experience as a minister, the best department in Australia, and I say that without reservation. Finally, I thank the minister for the time that he has spent in negotiating with Minister Moore in Western Australia and I thank him for his commitment going forward that those negotiations will continue with the goal of reaching a conclusion. It is important that parties in this debate do each have the opportunity to express their views. It has been very much a hallmark, starting with the inquiry after the Montara disaster, that all stakeholders in this debate have been able to participate, so I welcome the commitment of the minister going forward.",53
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," It is a bit odd to let the member for Groom speak after the minister has summed up. He was on indulgence and given the nature of the debate and all the rest of itand my confusion with what is going on-I am going to thank everyone for their assistance at this time. I have located my children! Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:53): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Madam Deputy Speaker, I compliment you on your handling of this complex debate. In no way did we ever get the impression that you were confused about the nature of the bills before the chair. Ms Burke: I am just pleased I was not actually speaking on them! Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",65
16,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. Whilst all this is a relatively dry bill-just updating some definitions within the framework of the free trade agreement that we have with our very good partner New Zealand-I think it is a reasonable time for us to think about the success of that free trade agreement. It was Australia's first free trade agreement. It was negotiated in the early 1980s and implemented in 1983, at a time when free trade was probably less fashionable than it is now. You will obviously still hear arguments for and against free trade now and those arguments have been ongoing literally for centuries within the political sphere. But this agreement has done a lot to advance the economic interests of Australia and the economic interests of our partner New Zealand. Although this is a relatively dry bill, it is important for us as a parliament to reflect on the success of that free trade agreement and about how it was a precursor for future free trade agreements that we negotiated with other partners. I always like to refer back to Adam Smith when we look at economic issues. Although he wrote many centuries ago, his insights into the way an economy works are still relevant today. On trade, he said: It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. ... If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. Essentially he was talking about the economic law of comparative advantagethough he would not have called it this at the time-which was developed slightly later by another British economist. But the words that Adam Smith wrote in his classic book The Wealth of Nations are still very relevant to us today, and a great reminder about how important free trade is and about how politicians constantly get people arguing with us about why free trade is not that important. The way those arguments are put to us varies greatly. In the old days, there were mercantile arguments between free traders and protectionists, about why it was in the national interest not to trade freely with other countries. Now these arguments come to us in different ways. They come to us in possibly more sophisticated ways. They come to us in ways in relation to industry policy or in the guise of fair trade, which is a term which I do not think is necessarily very well understood. I see the member for Brand at the table. I am sure his father-in-law would have agreed with what I am saying. If the Labor Party still had men of that calibre, I suspect they would not be having the political problems they are having today.",65
17,Mr Gray,COMMITTEES,I have never mentioned my father-in-law.,66
18,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES,"I am happy to acknowledge that interjection, so it is on the record and can be raised at the minister's next family Christmas! This bill really just updates some definitions and some other nomenclature issues within the closer economic relationship framework that we have with our brothers in New Zealand. Whilst this bill is rather technical in nature, it is timely that the parliament discusses it in the wake of the visit and the historic address to this parliament by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Rt Hon. John Key. Australia's economic relationship with New Zealand is one of the most diverse and comprehensive we have with any country. Australia is New Zealand's largest export market. Prime Minister Key made that point when he addressed the parliament. More than half of direct foreign investment in New Zealand, around $50 billion, comes from Australia. Last year, Australian exports to New Zealand totalled just over $8 billion, which is actually not far from the $9 billion that we exported to the United States. That gives you some idea about the vital importance of the economic relationship that we share with New Zealand. There is no doubt that Australia and New Zealand share a unique relationship nurtured by a number of factors: geographic proximity, obviously; shared histories as members of the British Commonwealth; a shared culture; and a shared ANZAC tradition. This relationship has led to arrangements that enable citizens of Australia and New Zealand to migrate freely between the two countries. Over recent decades, the most significant trans-Tasman movements have been of New Zealanders moving to Australia, with the movements generally reflecting the economic conditions and opportunities within our two countries. There are presently over half a million New Zealanders living in Australia. Our two countries also have very close military ties going back to the First World War where soldiers of both countries were formed into the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps. Together Australia and New Zealand saw their first major military action at the Battle of Gallipoli. Today our military ties continue with a combined effort in the maintenance of peace and stability in East Timor. The combined force in East Timor, which is entitled the International Stabilisation Force, has developed over time and presently consists of approximately 460 personnel with the Australian Defence Force contributing 390 of those and the New Zealand Defence Force contributing 70. Our two countries' forces are complementary in equipment and in culture. We work well together in East Timor and also in other battlefields and other conflicts around the world. We have a tremendous history together. The bond between our defence forces remains incredibly strong with a high degree of common purpose. This common purpose also forms the cornerstone of our trade and economic relationships in the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 1983 and is, as I have mentioned, one of Australia's most important economic treaties. The agreement is comprehensive and wide ranging and provides New Zealand and Australia with liberal access to each others goods, services and investment markets. As noted on the DFAT website, the objectives of the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement are to strengthen the broad relationship between Australia and New Zealand, to develop closer economic relations between member states through a mutually beneficial expansion of free trade between New Zealand and Australia, to eliminate barriers to trade between Australia and New Zealand in a gradual and progressive manner under an agreed timetable and within minimum disruption, and to develop trade between Australia and New Zealand under conditions of fair competition. The agreement reaffirms the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand. On 1 January 2007 the agreement rules of origin provision underwent significant change to allow both the change in tariff classification method and the regional value content method to be used to establish whether goods are New Zealand-originating goods. As part of the 2007 amendments to the agreement both parties also agreed to perform a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect. This review, which was commenced in late 2008 and completed in March of last year, resulted in amendments to the text of article 3, rules of origin, and related product specific rules in annex G to the agreement. The modifications to the agreement will lessen the administrative burden on business and will assist the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. That obviously came to pass as this agreement is approaching its 30th anniversary and over time the definitions that are used within international free trade agreements change, and this bill reflects those more modern terminologies. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to implement amendments to the rules of origin requirements under the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement and amend definitions within the act. These requirements are outlined in article 3 and annex G of the agreement. The amendments to the Customs Act implements the amendments to article 3 of the agreement. Amendments to the Customs (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Regulations 2006 will implement the amendment at annex G of the agreement. As has been noted in this bill's explanatory memorandum, the bill will amend division 1E of part VIII of the Customs Act to insert a new definition of 'aquaculture', to amend the definition of 'manufacture', to amend the definition of 'produce', to amend the provisions dealing with wholly obtained goods, to amend the provisions dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture, to insert a new section to provide that goods are not New Zealand originating goods merely because of the certain operations, and make consequential amendments to the verification powers in division 4D of part VI of the Customs Act. The practical effects of this bill are relatively limited; it is not bill. It is, as I said at the outset, a timely reminder to this parliament about the importance of the trade agreement we have with New Zealand. This is a pretty unique agreement in the world. It is underpinned by free movement of people between two countries. There are very few pairs of nations around the world that have such a close economic relationship as Australia and New Zealand. In fact, there are very few nations around the world that have such close political and defence ties. Indeed, New Zealand is actually mentioned as one of the possible constituent parts of the Commonwealth of Australia in our Constitution; my home state of Western Australia is not. This just shows you the way that history has developed between our two countries and about how important it is to both countries. I acknowledge the fact that former Prime Minister John Howard and former Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer were pivotal during their years in office in advancing economic and cultural relationships with New Zealand. On this side of the House, as indeed on the other side of the House, the relationship is valued and we value our partnership with our brother country, New Zealand. It is a partnership that has just been highlighted again by the visit of the New Zealand Prime Minister and his historic address to this parliament. The opposition supports the passage of this bill and we support the strengthening of our economic, political and cultural ties with our fellow brother country, New Zealand. Debate adjourned.

19,Mr SHORTEN,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed.,68
20,Ms BRODTMANN,COMMITTEES," It is with great pleasure that I rise just weeks after this parliament was addressed by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Prime Minister Key, to speak in favour of the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. The ties that bind Australia and New Zealand go back to the very origins of our two great nations. We are the closest neighbours and the very best of friends and allies, apart from on the rugby field. We share the ANZAC heritage and conflicts both in our mutual past and through to today with our mutual commitment to eliminating terrorism in Afghanistan and bringing stability to that nation. However, our ties go beyond conflict. We share a mutual culture and many Australians have fallen so in love with New Zealand that they have made it their permanent home or at least a regular tourist destination. Who has not heard it said that there are more New Zealanders living in Bondi than in Auckland? Even Prime Minister Key, who was here a few weeks ago, himself admitted that he has also lived in Australia. I think he was down in Bondi but he was in Sydney. My sister is married to a New Zealander. They have a debate going on amongst themselves. They have two children born in Chile. I think the eldest girl is going to Australian and the younger boy is going to be a New Zealander, so they will have these different nationalities, which is very interesting. The ties are very thick and close. It is because of this closeness that we have all been so deeply affected by the earthquakes in Christchurch where there is a need to demolish some 10,000 houses, where the elderly have been moved to other parts of the country and where schools are doubling up on students just to make sure that their education continues. We have heard that Christchurch's CBD has been shattered and may never recover and that so much has been destroyed and there is so much uncertainty that they are not sure whether to rebuild. I know that the spirit is very strong there and that they are keen to rebuild, but they have a big job ahead of them. I know that all the Australians are out gunning for them to succeed in that mission. We have heard that 181 people have lost their lives and that the cost to the New Zealand economy will be huge. It is estimated that there will be a loss to the GDP of some $15 billion. This is a hit to their economy of such epic proportions it will take time to recover. This recovery will very much involve Australia. We have already provided rescue and emergency teams, but we will also provide our assistance in economic terms as well. To this end I was very interested to hear Prime Minister Key talk about exactly how much economic investment flows between Australia and New Zealand. We would all be aware that he said some $50 billion of investment in New Zealand is from Australia. I was also interested to hear that exports to New Zealand total some $8 billion. Given our focus on China and Asia generally and the large investments made be an there, we at times can tend to forget the importance of New Zealand for the prosperity of our export trade. While the New Zealand trade may be small, the proximity of New Zealand, our shared culture and our trade agreements make it in many ways a more enticing offering for many businesses. Perhaps it is for this reason that Prime Minister Key noted that so many small and medium Australian businesses cut their teeth in the international market by first exporting and investing in New Zealand. This bill has been made possible by the close trade relationships that have developed between New Zealand and Australia over time. A cornerstone of this closeness in recent history could be said to be the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, signed in 1983, and known widely as the CER, a free trade agreement that is widely acknowledged as a model of the standards to which such agreements should aspire but which many, if not most, fail to achieve. This agreement is Australia's longest standing bilateral free trade agreement. It provides both Australia and New Zealand with liberal access to goods, services and investment markets. Many Australian jobs and businesses are underpinned by this agreement. The legislation before us today seeks to amend the provision of this agreement and its subsequent act to alter the rules of origin provisions. Rules of origin are those provisions-be they legislative, regulatory, administrative rulings-that are used to determine the country of origin of a good or service or investment. They are of importance in world trade, especially in a world that is characterised by the ever-growing globalisation of production. These matters may appear technical or details of little interest, but the functioning a bilateral trade agreement depends crucially on getting these details right. It is another reminder of the more workaday details that lie behind the big picture items that grab the headlines. It reminds us that the hard work of reform takes place on many levels and involves unglamorous hard work and careful attention to detail, very often performed by public servants in my own electorate who I know are here today to see their bill hopefully come to fruition. I am sure plenty of hours and midnight oil has been spent on this. I congratulate them on their work. There have been lots of public servants involved and lots of people committed to making a difference. The current rules of origin for the free trade agreement entered into force on 1 January 2007. When negotiating these rules it was agreed by both Australia and New Zealand that there would be a review conducted after three years of the rules taking effect. This review began in 2008 by both Australian and New Zealand officials and was completed early last year. The review resulted in agreement to make amendments to the text of article 3, rules of origin, and the related product specific rules in annex G that deal with the definitions of particular industries and processes. These are the changes we make today. Specifically this bill inserts new definitions for aquaculture and amends the definitions for manufacture and produce. It also amends the provision dealing with wholly obtained goods and the provision dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture. In addition, it inserts a new section to provide that goods are not treated as having originated in New Zealand merely because of certain operations being performed. The government consulted Australian industry throughout the process of review. In of addition, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties conducted three public hearings on the treaty changes before recommending that Australia take binding treaty action. The changes to the trade agreement will reduce the administrative burden on business and will facilitate the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia, which is very important. The amendments to article 3 will enter into force on the date when the Australian and New Zealand governments notify each other by an exchange of diplomatic notes that they have completed their respective domestic processes to bring the amendments into force. The CER agreement is the standard by which bilateral free trade agreements are judged. For almost 30 years, it has played a significant part in the prosperity of Australia's export trade and our economy. The provisions before us today are good for the Australian economy, are good for the New Zealand economy and are an important part of the ongoing achievements of the government in support of the economic well-being of all Australians. These provisions are also good for the economic well-being of New Zealanders, the economic well-being of people who need employment and Australian exports. I therefore commend this bill to the House. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (12:16): I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901, a very, very old act. It is more than 100 years old. This act has been part of the laws of this nation since Federation, so today we are amending one of the original acts of parliament. The bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to implement amendments to the rules of origin requirements under the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, which is a very important trade agreement between our two nations. The Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement came into effect on 1 January 1983 and it is fundamental to the Australia-New Zealand trade and economic relationship. According to the explanatory memorandum: The Agreement is a comprehensive and wideranging agreement that provides New Zealand and Australia with liberal access to each other's goods, services and investments markets. It is the umbrella for close collaboration across quarantine-which I want to touch on before I conclude-customs, transport, regulatory and product standards and business law issues. The agreement reaffirms the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand. On 1 January 2007 the agreement's rules of origin provision underwent considerable change to permit both the change in tariff classification method and the regional value content method to be used to establish whether goods are of New Zealand origin. As part of the 2007 amendments to the agreement, both parties also agreed to perform a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect. This review, which commenced in late 2008 and was completed in March 2010, resulted in amendments to the text of article 3, rules of origin, and the related product specific rules in annex G to the agreement. The modification to the agreement will lessen the administrative burden on business and will assist in the eligibility of duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. Although the coalition does not consider this bill to be controversial, it still has significant effects on many agricultural industries within the electorate of Maranoa. I particularly want to make sure that we capitalise on our competitive edge as a nation. They may be our cousins across the Tasman, but charity begins at home. Wool production, for instance, is the second most common enterprise on Australian farms. In the eastern states most wool is grown west of the Great Dividing Range and the total wool produced in Australia amounts to some 370,610 tonnes, with Queensland contributing over 10,000 tonnes of wool annually. Australia is the world's dominant producer and exporter of wool, accounting for some 67 per cent of the world's wool exports from major producing countries. Australian wool growers have recently enjoyed an increase in demand and also, related to that, an increase in price for their product, which I can assure you is long overdue. That is due to a lower supply and much higher demand coming out of China. The late autumn wool market defied the trend of cautious international buying by jumping some 56 per cent over the past year at a time when the Australian dollar surged 20 per cent. So it is even more remarkable that we have seen this price increase and increased interest from the international sector sustained against the backdrop of a higher Australian dollar. I want to touch on the wool industry because Australia and New Zealand are significant producers of wool and there have been some tariff issues in the past. I think have disadvantaged ourselves a little bit to the advantage of New Zealand when it came to some of the made-up products, particularly suit products, and have given New Zealand an edge over Australia when it came to using Australian made fabrics to produce suiting and other apparel. The wool industry is important to both our nations. In the international arena, we have worked cooperatively in the past but now, through Australian Wool Innovation, we are again seeing a cooperation which had perhaps been lost for many years. And it is important we include New Zealand as part of that cooperation. It was last year that His Royal Highness Prince Charles launched an initiative aimed at increasing demand for British wool and wool from the Commonwealth, obviously including New Zealand. The wool project will see diverse groups from across the wool sector, including textile designers and the carpet and fashion industries, work together to improve public awareness of the benefits of this very sustainable product. Prince Charles has long been concerned about the low prices farmers have been receiving for their wool, so last year his Royal Highness brought the wool industry together, including New Zealand producers, fabric makers, carpet industries and textile designers, to see how they could work together globally to put wool onto a more sustainable economic footing. I was very pleased to see the Governor General involved in this wool initiative, which includes not only Australian wool but New Zealand wool, through the Australian Wool Innovation launch at Admiralty House in Sydney earlier this year. This initiative will see a world wool day later this year-in the first week of October, I think. I hope that this parliament takes up that opportunitywe although we are sitting not that week but the following one-to participate in world wool day because wool is one of the great products of the world. It is sustainable and it is also a product that was very much instrumental in the early development and economic growth of this wonderful nation, Australia. So I am looking forward to seeing how these amendments enable us to work with the New Zealand wool industry. I am of course interested in cooperation with many other New Zealand industries, but I am particularly interested to see how this will play out with our cousins in the wool industry, whether in textiles, apparel, nonapparel or design. I will be interested to see how we can-not only here in the Australian and New Zealand wool industry, from the producing and processing sectors right through, but also globallypush our advantages and the uniqueness of our wool fibres into other markets. I wanted to link the issue of wool into this bill because I think it is important that we work together in this industry. In the past, we worked together through what was called the International Wool Secretariat, but now we have Prince Charles's wool initiative pushing wool, through the Commonwealth countries, around the world. I think his initiative has certainly given things a great impetus. Recently, in New York, London and Europe, I saw the effect of this wool initiative. I saw how wool is being increasingly seen by consumers as a sustainable product. I think the initiative is going to continue to help our wool producers-as well as New Zealand wool producers-and that part of the wool industry which is beyond the farm gate. It will help us to promote wool from Australia and New Zealand and to promote our competitive advantages, particularly in processing. It help us to promote that we are able to produce not just the raw product but the manufactured product and to export these products into other countries. As I foreshadowed, I turn now to quarantine. It is important that we have this free trade between our two countries, but quarantine becomes a significant issue. The issue I refer to here is the proposal to import apples from New Zealand into Australia, although I know that a final decision is not due until next month. The only apple industry in Queensland is in my electorate of Maranoa, down on the Granite Belt in Stanthorpe. If the decision under this agreement is to allow New Zealand apples into Australia, it will be the first time in years we have seen apples imported from New Zealand into Australia. The restriction which has always kept New Zealand apples out of Australia has been a quarantine restriction. That is because New Zealand has a disease in apples called fire blight while Australia does not. If, through a breakdown in quarantine, we saw apples with fire blight brought into Australia and then saw fire blight accidentally ending up in our apple and pear orchards, we would decimate our industry. There are only two ways you can control a fire blight outbreak. One way is with very heavy herbicide use. The only other way is to destroy the tree totally-in other words, cut it down. I know that the apple growers of my electorate, and pear growers across Australia, are very concerned about the protocol under this quarantine agreement. Unless something changes and New Zealand apples are not allowed to come in as a result of the decision to be made in August, the protocol means that New Zealand apple orchardists will themselves be clearing their apples for export into our markets here in Australia. The apple growers in my electorate of will Maranoa, in the Granite Belt, and pear growers across Australia are very concerned at the protocol that is in place. We believe that this is terribly important, notwithstanding this free trade agreement, and that the risk remains too great. To orchardists in the apple and pear history, fire blight would be what foot-and-mouth disease is to the beef industry. We should take it just as seriously as we take foot-in-mouth, because one of the great advantages we have, and one of the great pleasures we enjoy in this country, is the fact we have clean, green food. It is one of the things we seem to take for granted. I think consumers across Australia are so lucky to have this clean, green, high-quality food at an affordable price. If we were to 90 find under this free trade agreement that New Zealand apples were allowed into Australia and there was an accidental-and it would be accidental-outbreak of fire blight in our apple and pear industry, it would be directly related to the protocols, which I believe are too lax and run an unnecessary risk. I say to the Prime Minister and to the government: think again about allowing apples from New Zealand into Australia. The risk is too great. Fire blight would decimate our industry and the many family farmers who produce these wonderful products for us. They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away. I say, 'Let's make sure we keep New Zealand apples with fire blight away.' Other than that, I support this bill. But, in the next month or so, we have to make sure that we continue our campaign to ensure that the government has listened to the industry and that it understands the risk of accidental entry, under quarantine rules as they are proposed, of apples from New Zealand into Australia. This could lead, as I said, to the decimation of our industry. Once again: an apple a day will keep the doctor away. Let us make sure that we keep New Zealand apples away while ever there is a threat of fire blight being brought into Australia.",68
21,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. This bill contains amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to implement changes to article 3 of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. The Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, otherwise known as ANZCERTA, is Australia's longest standing bilateral free trade agreement, having been in force since 1983. One aspect of ANZCERTA is the rules of origin, often referred to by its acronym ROO. In negotiating the current rules of origin, which came into force on 1 January 2007, it was agreed that a review should take place within three years of the rules taking effect. Australian and New Zealand officials commenced the review in late 2008 and completed it in March 2010. The amendments in the bill address some imperfections identified in that review. The amendments will result in a range of practical changes. For example, the changes made to ANZCERTA will reduce the administrative burden on business and will facilitate the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. It is expected that these benefits would be passed onto consumers. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in ANZCERTA and the free trade agreements that Australia has with other countries. The ANZCERTA amendments were tabled in parliament in June last year, and I understand that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties inquired into those amendments. Public hearings were conducted in November 2010 as well as a further two hearings in February 2011. On 11 May 2011, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that Australia take binding treaty action. The government also consulted widely with the Australian industry throughout the process. Specifically, the bill will amend division 1E of part VIII of the Customs Act to (a) insert a new definition of 'aquaculture', (b) amend the definition of 'manufacture', (c) amend the definition of 'produce', (d) amend the provisions dealing with 'wholly obtained goods', (e) amend the provisions dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture, (f) insert a new section to provide that goods are not New Zealandoriginating goods merely because of certain operations and (g) make consequential amendments to the verification powers in division 4D of part VI of the Customs Act. These amendments make sensible changes to definitions under the Customs Act, and I support them. They also highlight issues of concern that have arisen in recent years as a result of trade agreements between Australia and other countries, particularly with New Zealand. There is growing concern amongst Australian primary producers that Australian primary production is being increasingly placed at risk because of imported products which can either originate in a country of concern or come into Australia via a country like New Zealand, which Australia would generally feel secure in trading with. A current example is the concern of the Australian potato growers that the importation of New Zealand potatoes could place at risk the Australian potato-growing industry because of the zebra chip disease that has been detected in New Zealand grown potatoes. The zebra chip disease was first detected in Central America in the 1990s. It then made its way to New Zealand, where it was first detected in 2008. If the Australian potato industry were infected with the zebra chip disease, the livelihoods of over 2,000 Australian potato-growing families would be placed at risk because there is currently no known effective control procedure for this disease. I have to date presented petitions to this House signed by around 648 growers who are concerned about this matter. Their concern relates to the fact that they understand that there is a push to have potatoes imported from New Zealand. The member for Maranoa touched on another matter that I also wish to speak on, and that is the issue of apple growers in this country and their concerns about the importation of apples from New Zealand. In particular, they are concerned that the disease fire blight has been detected in New Zealand apples and, not surprisingly, they do not want to risk that disease being brought into Australia. Australia lost its appeal World Trade Organisation on this matter. I must say that I commend the minister for having appealed it in the first place. But, unfortunately, we lost the appeal. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, has now ordered that an import risk analysis be carried out prior to any approval of apple imports into Australia from New Zealand. In South Australia we also have an important apple industry-particularly in the Adelaide Hills, which adjoins my electorate of Makin. I know that the apple growers there are concerned about the importation of New Zealand apples into this country. I have spoken with them on several occasions and in fact was able to organise a meeting between them and the previous agriculture minister, Tony Burke, to discuss their concerns. They have argued quite strongly that if we are going to allow in apples from New Zealand then at the very least we need to ensure we have the necessary safeguards in place and that those safeguards are well policed. They too are very concerned about the disease fire blight coming into this country, and I understand that one of the very reasons Australia is able to export much of its fruit and vegetable produce is that it is seen as a country that is relatively free of many of the diseases that other countries unfortunately have. If we were to in any way infect our own products, that would no longer be the case and I have no doubt that it would affect the export of Australian produce to overseas countries. In that respect, I understand that over the past year Australia has imported vegetables worth $555 million which is in fact $306 million more than the export value of Australian vegetables over the same period. So we have already reached a situation where we are importing more vegetables than we are exporting. Australian growers, to the faced with the increased value of the Australian dollar and generally higher production overheads, are already at a disadvantage when competing with overseas growers. The one advantage that they have, and which they value, is the quality of the produce grown here. Jeopardising that quality by importing products from countries where disease has been detected is a risk that they simply do not need. Even with Australia's strict biosecurity system, prevention of disease entering Australia can never be 100 per cent guaranteed. It is of additional concern that product originally exported to New Zealand by another country may find its way into Australia. Not all countries grow produce in accordance with Australian and New Zealand standards, particularly with respect to the type of chemicals used in production. They may in fact use chemicals that have been banned in Australia. The sooner we have clear country of origin labelling in place in Australia, the sooner Australian consumers will be able to make an informed choice about the products they purchase. Australia has a very close working relationship with New Zealand. We share food standard regulations under the Food Standards Australia New Zealand process. Both countries, however, enter into their own trade agreements with other countries, which in turn may create a pathway for non-New Zealand product which Australia has concerns with entering Australia. We clearly need to be vigilant in our customs and, in particular, biosecurity processes. The Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement attempts to define the nature of the trade between the two countries and in turn provide certainty for producers and exporters. The amendments in this bill make clearer definitions in the agreement. I commend the bill to the House.",74
22,Ms MARINO,COMMITTEES," New Zealand is our close neighbour, earnest rival and great friend. The rivalry we have in cricket, rugby and netball is legendary and it is mostly friendly and conducted in a manner befitting such noble sports. But it is not just in sport that Australia has close ties with our transTasman neighbour. About half a million New Zealanders live in Australia and 65,000 Australians live in New Zealand. Twentythree per cent, or $7.2 billion worth, of New Zealand exports end up in Australia. In return, 18 per cent of New Zealand imports originate here. On top of that, there is $6 billion worth of two-way trade in services. The population of New Zealand is around 4.4 million, or around one-fifth of Australia's, which of course means that Australia's market is a much larger and more encouraging market for New Zealand. We both have similar histories of reliance on agriculture and, even though Australia has moved further away from this agricultural economic dominance, both nations are key exporters of agricultural products, including food. In this agricultural trade our two nations could be described as natural rivals, producing many similar products. So how do we differentiate our product in Australia, not just compared to New Zealand product but compared to product from around the world? More importantly at this point, how do we ensure that New Zealand produce is exactly that and not rebadged imports? The Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill before the House purports to set out the rules for determining whether goods are New Zealand-originating goods and therefore eligible for a preferential rate of customs duty under the Customs Tariff Act 1995. However, in the vague laws of international trade such rules always seem open to interpretation and, in spite of the intent in this bill, indeed this seems to be the case in this bill. There is no greater acknowledgement of the lack of equity and vagaries in trade policy than the failure of the world to deliver, particularly in agriculture, through the DOHA Round of world trade talks. We really do need to ensure that this bill and any others actually enhance real trade in an open, honest and transparent manner. The Australian community needs to be assured that goods from other countries are not entering Australia branded as a product of New Zealand thanks to a brief stopover, but the bill really does not guarantee that. Subdivision G of the act: … sets out when goods are New Zealand originating goods because their last process of manufacture is performed in New Zealand. It is repealed on 1 January 2012. The bill inserts after subdivision G an extra statement, subdivision GA, which: … provides that goods are not New Zealand originating goods under this Division merely because of certain operations. It goes further, in identifying that goods are not New Zealand-originating goods under this division merely because of the following operations: (a) operations to preserve goods in good condition for the purposes of transport or storage; (b) disassembly of goods; (c) affixing of marks, labels or other similar distinguishing signs on goods or their packaging; (d) packaging, changes to packaging, the breaking up or assembly of packages or presenting goods for transport or sale; (e) quality control inspections; (f) any combination of operations referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e). This suggests that goods that have been repackaged in New Zealand cannot simply be badged as a product of New Zealand and sent at reduced duty to Australia, but it does not really address partially manufactured or processed products made from foreign ingredients. The bill seeks to omit the statement: Subdivision B provides that goods are New Zealand originating goods if they are wholly obtained in New Zealand or in New Zealand and Australia. In turn it inserts: Subdivision B provides that goods are New Zealand originating goods if they are wholly obtained or produced in New Zealand or in New Zealand and Australia. The government and the minister need to explain the exact impact of that change. I note that when the minister introduced this bill to the parliament on 16 June he explained the process by which these changes were developed but did not explain what outcomes would come about as a result of the amendments. That is something that we as parliamentarians and growers in Australia need to be aware of. The minister's speech of about four full paragraphs did not contain that sort of detail. The minister said in that speech that changes: … will reduce the administrative burden on businesses, facilitate the eligibility for duty free entry of goods into both markets, and provide greater consistency between the ANZCERTA Rules of Origin and those of other trade agreements negotiated by Australia. But I ask the minister to explain how the proposed changes will prevent foreign goods entering Australia through New Zealand in that so-called 'grey marketplace'. I know that much has been said about this grey marketplace and there is quite a bit of information out there about what has gone on. I saw a Today Tonight feature in which they investigated and tracked raw products to factories where they were processed, repackaged and exported. These products were branded with, as they said in this article, the trusty 'made in New Zealand' label. It stated that in the last year-this was 2010-officially 45 per cent was coming from New Zealand, 16 per cent from China and 12 per cent from Canada. China has more than doubled the amount of food it is sending into Australia, but that does not include food it is sending which is processed in New Zealand and then gets sent here. We hear constantly about Australian growers being unable to compete, and it comes as a result of some of this. I need to know from the minister whether the entry of such goods will be made easier or more difficult with the proposed changes and why. We need explanations that will work in practical terms and we need to know whether any proposed reduction in administration will result in a reduction in accountability. We cannot afford to lower our standards. The other issue relating to this is food labelling. I have raised the accuracy of food labelling in this place on numerous occasions. Products coming through New Zealand to Australia must be adequately and properly labelled. As we hear frequently in this place, the quality of Australian products should not be put at risk. There is no doubt that the clean, diseasefree status of Australian food and produce is absolutely paramount. That is why so many Australians are outraged at the continual undermining of our biosecurity. The government is not acting on this. The 2009 budget slashed $35.8 million from quarantine and biosecurity and we have seen $58 million slashed from the customs budget. Fewer cargo consignments are inspected and fewer vessels boarded on arrival. In 2011 another $32 million was cut from the operation of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, reducing the capacity of the department to deliver services to Australian agriculture. The latest example, which we heard today in this chamber, is the recommendation by Biosecurity Australia to abandon adequate protocols to prevent the incursion of serious diseases like fire blight with the importation of New Zealand apples. This comes on the back of the Prime Minister visiting the New Zealand parliament and making an announcement that we would accept their apples. This was said without the completion of an import risk analysis. So Biosecurity Australia, in my view, has had to try to cut its cloth to fit the Prime Minister's statement. But this is an abandonment of the quarantine principles that have made Australia amongst the cleanest producers of high-quality food in the world. We know that the Beale quarantine and biosecurity review, commissioned by Labor, called for many millions more to be spent on AQIS and quarantine to provide real protection for our border. But the government has failed to act and has actually stripped funding. In relation to the apple imports, 75 per cent of Western Australia's apples and pears are produced in my electorate. So the potential for harm to those growers and to our industry in Western Australia is significant. We know that the biosecurity measures and protocols that we expect, and that are part of what we do on farm in Australia, will be less than those required in the United States. That is what will be applied to the importation of apples from New Zealand. We know that our growers are very concerned about the potential for fire blight, european canker and leaf-curling midge. It only takes that little piece of trash to come in with those apples. When we look at what is being asked of inspectors in New Zealanders, it could come down to as few as one apple in a million being inspected, and those apples could come from a diversity of properties. We know that fire blight in New Zealand is not a declarable or reportable disease. So how are we going to know which orchards are affected and whether any of those apples will be coming into Australia? We know that the disease can manifest itself in the calyx, so the inspections are particularly important to maintaining our biosecurity. Unfortunately, when you go to New Zealand and see how the industry runs you see that Australia's biosecurity will be in the hands of a backpacker having a great day, every day, picking and packing apples in New Zealand to be sent to Australia. I do not think that is an appropriate place for our biosecurity to rest. I think this is a very serious issue for us in Australia. The other question that I would ask is: who is going to pay the compensation to a grower who has to get rid of their crop and pull out their trees to deal with fire blight? Who is going to be responsible for that when that comes as a result of fire blight introduced through the importation of New Zealand apples? You can understand the concerns of industry on this issue. We have enjoyed some of the most rigorous biosecurity standards, but unfortunately we are now seeing that Biosecurity Australia is being asked-or instructed, I would thinkto provide an import risk analysis that reflects the statement the Prime Minister made in the New Zealand parliament. That is simply not good enough. Australia produces some of the best quality food in the world",76
23,Mr Broadbent,COMMITTEES,The best!,79
24,Ms MARINO,COMMITTEES,"and we do tend to take it for granted-the member for MCMillan would agree with this-that we can go and buy some of the best quality food in the world in our country. We seem to think that it will be there forever, but it will not be if our biosecurity is put at risk as it is being at risk now. We take it for granted when we go to buy our fruit and vegetables at the local fruit and vegetable market, or wherever we go, that they are going to be of the quality and standard that we expect and demand and enjoy. I have great faith in our growers, but I am very concerned about the organic growers, because they cannot use streptomycin. How does an organic grower deal with fire blight in that instance? This has the potential to do a lot of harm and it also affects a whole range of other genera. We know that well. It could well affect the cotoneaster group. There are a whole lot of ornamental pear trees as well, in a whole lot of gardens right around this nation, that could be affected by this. So this is not a simple issue. Certainly Biosecurity Australia should be applying the utmost rigour to this and not be trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. The debate on this bill covers quite a bit of ground, but it hits on the importance of biosecurity and the types of products coming to Australia, where they emanate from, how they are grown, how they are produced and whether they meet the standards that we in Australia comply with and that give us the opportunity be the producers of some of the best food in the world. This is very important in consideration of this bill, and I put those concerns on the table.",79
25,Mr MCCORMACK,COMMITTEES," On 16 February this year the Prime Minister addressed the New Zealand parliament and, in an act of treachery to Australian applegrowing families, agreed to give carte blanche to allow New Zealand apples into our country. This was, in every sense, a betrayal of the worse kind-an Australian Prime Minister being disloyal to Australian people. Never mind the utterings that this rollover-and that is what it is-complies put with the World Trade Organisation or anything else offered as some sort of feeble excuse. It is incomprehensible that our Prime Minister, as unpopular as she is in this country, would go across the Tasman to try to win a few friends over there in this way. It was an executive decision to do this because in December last year the Australian and New Zealand governments agreed that a review of the situation would be completed on 17 August 2011, still many weeks from now. Despite this, our Prime Minister jumped the gun by several months and, in doing so-in wrongly doing so-opened the floodgates to New Zealand apples, placing our own apple industry in harm's way, risking fire blight and a flooded market. She did the same with live cattle exports, making an executive decision to ban the whole live trade to Indonesia, despite there being abattoirs which comply with Australian killing standards. It makes you wonder what the Prime Minister has against regional Australia. On 1 June Apple and Pear Australia Ltd, APAL, which has been fighting the good fight against this Labor government's ineptitude and this Prime Minister's arrogance, released a summary of a Centre for International Economics report commissioned by Horticulture Australia Ltd. The very first paragraph of the summary spells out the trouble we now face: The Australian apple industry is likely to endure significant structural changes resulting from the introduction of apple imports, starting January 2011, with wholesale prices expected to be about 20 per cent lower and farm income about 30 per cent lower. Imported apples will be sold in Australia as a result of changes made by Biosecurity Australia to quarantine restrictions. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joe Ludwig, attended the announcement of the report, which was made by APAL chairman Darral Ashton, of Batlow, a town in my Riverina electorate which faces a bleak outlook thanks to our Prime Minister's sell-out. I met Mr Ashton and an APAL delegation about 20 minutes ago in my office. They are very worried about Labor's attitude towards agriculture, and they have every reason to be concerned. I hope the minister listened on 1 June. Moreover, I hope he takes some action to do something to help save what has been and could and should continue to be a great Australian industry, a great Australian tradition. I hope that, unlike with the cattle trade, Senator Ludwig does not cave into orders from above, from a Prime Minister who puts everything into the delay basket, hoping that it gets lost in the 24-hour media cycle on which her government runs, hoping the next latte-sipping, union-grovelling, leftie focus group moves on to some other issue to appease the city dwellers or the rabid Greens to whom this Labor government is so beholden. Meanwhile, regional Australia suffers. Meanwhile, our apple growers wonder if there will be a future. Meanwhile, New Zealand apple growers prepare for an assault on Australian markets which the APAL report said will have dire consequences for our industry. The Economic impact of apple imports from China, New Zealand and the USA on the Australian apple industry report suggests: The immediate impact of the increased import competition that will result from relaxing quarantine restrictions will be to lower the domestic price. CIE used a model developed for a HAL Future Focus project, the Hi_Link model, to estimate the various adjustments that are likely to occur in response to estimated price changes. CIE estimated that relaxing quarantine restrictions on apple imports from China, New Zealand and the United States will have the following impacts on the Australian apple industry by around 2014:  farm gate prices will be around 21 per cent lower;  wholesale prices will be around 13 to 14 per cent lower;  imports will achieve a market share of around 22 per cent;  domestic production will be around 11 per cent lower;  farm income will be around 32 per cent lower;  farm value-added will be around 33 per cent lower … Can we afford to allow this to happen to Australian apple growers, Aussie farmers? This is the first time in 90 years that apples are being imported into Australia. It is the biggest challenge the apple industry has had to face since England joined the Common Market in 1972. Apple imports could potentially cripple and undermine the economic prosperity of the Batlow and Tumut districts in the Riverina. New Zealand initially applied to export apples to Australia in December 1995. Since that time, APAL and citrus fruit growers have done their utmost to ensure that, if New Zealand apples are brought into Australia, exotic pests and diseases present in New Zealand do not also arrive on our shores and end up in our orchards and, as the member for Forrest quite rightly pointed out, in our ornamental gardens as well. On 1 January 2007, the agreement's rules of origin provision underwent considerable change to permit both the 'change in tariff classification' method and the 'regional content' method to be used to establish whether goods are New Zealand-originating goods. As part of the 2007 amendments to the agreement, both parties have agreed to perform a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect. However, in the same year New Zealand lodged a dispute with the World Trade Organisation on the basis that Australian measures were inconsistent with Australia's international obligations under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. This critical step entailed the decision-making process being taken out of the hands of both countries and all power given to the WTOan international body committed to free trade, not fair trade. In August 2010, the WTO ruled that Australia's phytosanitary measures for New Zealand apples were not justified. An appeal was lodged but lost, in November 2010, and there were no further avenues for appeal by Australia. Yet-and this is crucial to the whole argument-the two governments agreed to complete a review of the matter, which will not be finalised until next month, six months and one day after our Prime Minister made her great backdown speech in the New Zealand parliament. At present, Biosecurity Australia relies on New Zealand's standard orchard practices as the quarantine standard sufficient to protect Australia from a number of extremely damaging pests and diseases not present in Australia. Mr Shorten interjecting",79
26,Mr MCCORMACK,COMMITTEES,"This is a very serious subject, but I will take that interjection from the shadow ministersorry, not shadow. He will be a shadow in the next parliament-trust me! These practices include application of the integvalue rated fruit production system, or an equivalent, to manage pests and diseases in the orchards; testing to ensure that only mature fruit is exported to Australia; maintenance of sanitary conditions in dump tank water; high-pressure water washing and brushing of fruit in the packing house; and a minimum 600-fruit sample from each lot of fruit packed be inspected and found free of quarantine pests for Australia. However, all horticultural industries in virtually all countries have standard practices designed to minimise the risk and spread of diseases. But the efficacy of those practices depends on many factors which are not always in the control of the orchardist or industry personnel. The standard practices, like any other code of practice, are open to potential flaws such as human interpretation and application of the standard practices, which invariably differ from grower to grower and from region to region. Without a significant level of auditing, there is no way of judging compliance with the standard orchard practices and, in New Zealand, there appears to be no single organisation which manages and audits the process across all export orchards to ensure accuracy and consistency and to deal with non-compliance. Pest pressure, both on-farm and from neighbouring properties, choice and efficacy of application of control agents, and orchard canopy and design are also standard practices which can be open to issue and non-compliance. While in New Zealand it is mandatory to comply with standard orchard practices if fruit is to be exported, it is not mandatory to have all aspects of the program conducted in the expected manner. Whilst the modifications to the agreement will lessen the administrative burden on business and will assist the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets, the amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. Certain industries will indeed suffer from a decrease in prices and the importation of pest and diseases. This is just another blow to Australian farmers, who must feel that under this government they cannot take a trick. Foreign apples should never have been allowed into our country in the first place. Our apple industry is free of fire blight self-sustaining. All this has done is undermine and potentially cripple what was a vibrant Australian industry, which meant so much to the economic prosperity of Batlow and Tumut and many other regional areas as well. We have already seen what pests and diseases such as the asian bee and greening disease can do to countries with horticulture such as citrus. Today, the shadow minister for agriculture and food security has circulated a private member's bill to safeguard against fire blight in the face of the Gillard government issuing permits to import apples from New Zealand. Australia's robust, science based quarantine protections must not be compromised. Our pest and diseasefree status has been hard won and the government's bid to rubber-stamp New Zealand apples into Australia, without the same checks and balances that are applied to other countries, sets a very dangerous precedent. While we have Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inspectors on the ground in China, undertaking rigorous checks, we are expected to simply accept that practices across the Tasman in New Zealand adequately manage endemic fire blight risk in that country, despite not having a single inspector to check that the right thing is being done. Apples are apples, and the same scientific standards should be applied to apples, regardless of where they are imported from. The coalition is so worried about the lax attitude to quarantine and biosecurity in Australia that we have put forward the Quarantine Legislation Amendment (Apples) Bill 2011, a bill which makes a permit to import apples a disallowable instrument. This bill puts the government and Biosecurity Australia on notice that, if they and is ignore the science and put trade before quarantine, this parliament can disallow permits and direct them to ensure that adequate protections against foreign pests and diseases are in place. Biosecurity Australia needs to clearly justify the risk factors and why Australia is allowing lower standards for New Zealand than those required to import apples from China. There is a very real risk of fire blight entering Australia and, of the 49 countries which have contracted fire blight, not one has eradicated it. Fire blight is not a notifiable disease. There has, apparently, been no serious fire blight outbreak reported in New Zealand since 1998. But how would anyone know whether one has occurred? Indeed, when Biosecurity Australia inspectors visited New Zealand in March and inspected six orchards and five packing houses they found fire blight. The reckless pursuit by the government to import New Zealand apples without adequately managing the risk of fire blight will be a death sentence for our country's apple producers. This decision to make the permit to import apples a disallowable instrument is not a decision the coalition has taken lightly, but such is the attitude towards biosecurity by this government that we were left with no other choice. We have a duty to proactively protect Australia's shores from pests and diseases. After all, mangoes from Queensland are placed under very strict quarantine measures by New Zealand for fear of fruit fly, yet we are not supposed to have similar tight rules to guard against fire blight from New Zealand apples. The federal government has wiped its hands of agriculture. It constantly proves this with its laxity in biosecurity laws, suspension of live exports and failure to gain an understanding of the way of rural life through listening to the people who know best. One of those people is Hannah Cathels, part of the third generation of her family to grow and sell Australian apples. She wrote to me recently, and her correspondence is worth listening to. Her uncle Ian Cathels operates three orchards in Batlow, New South Wales, and her father, Rob, operates five divisions in the Sydney markets, where she works. The futures of her siblings and cousins, also part of that third generation, will be dramatically impacted should pests and diseases from New Zealand enter their orchards. Hannah says that this business producing and selling Australian apples has allowed her grandfather, father and uncle to provide for their family for the past 60 years, and she fears that without proper protocols in place for New Zealand apple imports she, her siblings and her cousins will not be able to do the same for their families in the future. In Batlow, her grandfather bought his first apple orchard and now has three orchards and a large packing shed, packing for over 20 local growers. Hannah wonders what will happen to those people if the New Zealand apples come in and flood our markets. They employ 250-plus staff in New South Wales. Consider the 250-plus staff and their families also without an income if the New Zealand lax apples bring pests and diseases, which will, as she says, 'decimate' her industry-what she really means is 'devastate'. It is not going to divide it by 10; it is going to completely cripple the industry. 'It is extremely hard for me to understand,' she writes, 'how Biosecurity Australia and the Australian government can expect us to believe or even accept that New Zealand apple growers will honestly attempt to control the entry of their pests and diseases into our country if there is no auditing process and when they stand to receive significant financial benefits through the import of their apples into our country.' The Prime Minister should heed the words of Hannah, wise beyond her 22 years, and do everything she can to protect and preserve Australia's apple industry-not simply sell it up the river in yet another cheap political stunt.",81
27,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES," I too wish to stand to make a contribution to the debate on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. The bill amends the Customs Act 1901, which addresses the rules of origin requirements under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, which came into force in 1983. The requirements are outlined in article 3 and annex G to the agreement. There are a number of specific amendments to division 1E of part VIII of the Customs Act which insert new definitions of, for example, 'aquaculture', 'manufacture' and 'produce' as well as amend provisions for wholly obtained goods. Although aquaculture was included in the agreement from 2007, there was no specific definition of what was meant by the term. While 'manufacture' was defined, a number of exclusions, such as restoration or renovation processes, have now been included. The bill also amends the provision dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture. It is of course very important that we sort this issue out. The modifications to the agreement are expected to lessen the administrative burden on businesses and assist the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. It is interesting, I have to say, that we very often quote that something we do is to lessen the administrative burden, but in fact each time we say that it would seem there is an incremental increase in the number of public servants we have in this country, both state and federal. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. A review was commenced in late 2008 and completed in March 2010, resulting in amendments to the text of article 3, on rules of origin, and the related product-specific rules in annex G to the agreement. In particular, the rules for determining whether the goods originate in New Zealand have been clarified. New Zealand-originating goods are eligible for a preferred rate of customs duty. In most cases this is a free rate. And there are now defined nonqualifying operations listed which will exclude items from the preferential treatment. So this is a very important bill, and the coalition is supportive of making sure all of those definitions are refined and the smooth operation of the closer economic relationship occurs. But there are very serious concerns about our interactions now and the trade between the two countries, Australia and New Zealand. One of these is very close to my interests, for example the announcement the other day that the Heinz tomato sauce factory at Girgarre is closing and will go to New Zealand. It will go there and work out of a factory it already owns, but it is going to produce tomato sauce and tomato ketchup in New Zealand, despite that country not growing the tomatoes which are required for their manufacture. So it is going to be interesting to see just how the country-oforigin labelling will work. Wherever the tomato paste is imported from into New Zealand for their tomato sauce manufacture in the future-whether it comes from China, South Africa, Chile or wherever the cheapest going rate for the commodity is for the year-it will be very important that our country-of-origin information on those labels reflects absolutely and accurately all of the realities about that Big Red Tomato Sauce bottle sitting on the barbecue. Clearly, there are all sorts of interesting ways that one could understand a marketing advantage, if there is in fact a label which simply says 'Product of New Zealand'. We also have a major concern in Australia right now about how our closer economic relationship is working and how, despite us having this extraordinarily close relationship with New Zealand, both countries still must be guardians of their quarantine status. In the case of Australia we are an island nation-as is New Zealand-but our quarantine services have managed to guard us from so many diseases which sadly, indeed tragically for New Zealand, has not been their experience. For example, New Zealand almost a century ago had the dreaded apple fire blight come into their country-probably from plant stock from the United States. The disease is one of the serious problems for pome fruit, and it also affects rosaceae species-and in Australia that includes a number of native species besides your good old-fashioned rose bush growing in your garden. Plants like cotoneaster are also vulnerable to fire blight. We had an extraordinary situation in Australia some 12 or 13 years ago, so we know what it feels like to have an incursion of fire blight, in Victoria at least. We know the costs to the industry. We know the damage it does to the reputation of apple and pear producers. I stress the word 'pear' because unfortunately fire blight does not simply affect apples. We know that you can have an apple industry with fire blight-obviously New Zealand is an example of this. Fire blight affects the apple orchards of lots of countries around the world, and those countries continue to have a viable industry. But you do not have viable pear industries where you have fire blight. With apples, you can just keep chainsawing off the dead and dying limbs that have been affected by the bacteria, but when it comes to pears the tree is killed. In my electorate of Murray we grow 80 per cent of Australia's pears. We also grow a substantial proportion of the apples of the nation. The pears are vital for our fruit manufacturing. They are the equivalent of the building block of much of our manufactured food product, whether it is baby foods, sauces or preserved fruits. If we have our pear trees, our pear orchards, wiped out by this disease, there are serious implications for fruit and food manufacturing in the 23 food factories in my electorate. We employ thousands of people, not just directly as they move a product from farm to factory but also in transporting that product to the markets around Australia and indeed to the rest of the world. Pears are vital to the continuing viability of Australia's food manufacturing. Pears are killed by the apple fire blight disease. It is not just a case of getting out the chainsaw and regularly cutting your trees where the fire blight affects them. It is not a case of saturating the trees with streptomycin sprays, which is what New Zealand does. In Australia we are very fussy about the chemicals that we put on our plants and that we might inoculate our animals with and we do not want to have to use streptomycin, currently a prohibited substance in our orchards on our food products. But that is what the New Zealanders are forced to do to try and keep their disease in check. Also, it is not just a case of our orchards being vulnerable. We have a Mediterranean climate in northern Victoria-and in places like Harcourt, in the seat of Bendigo, where of course those apple orchardists are absolutely beside themselves about the decision of this government to allow imports of fresh apples to Australia. We also have a huge threat to crop pollination through the demise of our bee industry. The apiculture industry is at risk from fire blight. Any outbreak would potentially devastate the livelihood of the hundreds of commercial beekeepers in Australia. Worse than that, it would wipe out our capacity to naturally pollinate our commercial and non-commercial species throughout Australia. Honey bees are the major vector for fire blight bacteria spores. Just as pollen grains adhere to the bees' bodies, so too do the fire blight bacterial spores. They are spread from flower to flower, from orchard to orchard and from bee to bee. There is a fire blight contingency plan in Australia. It was developed prior to the 1997 scare, which I have referred to. The fire blight contingency plan for Australia calls for the destruction of all beehives in a declared fire blight quarantine area. Honey bees, as I am sure most of us in this chamber know, are the efficient pollinators of food crops for Australia. Currently there are over 40,000 managed either beehives engaged in contract pollination across Victoria. That includes crops of apples, pears, almonds, cherries, kiwifruit and a whole range of small seeds and nuts. The almond industry in particular is totally dependent on bee pollination. We had a major disaster recently with beehive populations being killed by the floods, and we are already suffering the consequences of that as we wait for those hives to be rebuilt. Imagine the disaster: fire blight in Australia equals the destruction of beehives in the pome fruit areas. The apiculture industry is extraordinarily exercised and concerned about this problem. Streptomycin-which is, as I have said, an accepted form of antibiotic control for fire blight in New Zealand-also poses a major risk to the apiculture, or beekeeping, industry. This antibiotic control, be allowed into Australia, would be a major problem for the bee industry. This antibiotic has been banned in Australia for the treatment of bee diseases for many years. Streptomycin does not break down. If sprayed on fruit blossoms it would be collected by honey bees in the nectar secreted by the plant and become a chemical contaminant in the honey. In addition to the negative impact of fire blight on beekeepers' livelihoods, which is one thing, this contaminant would also damage the clean image of Australia's honey in both domestic and export markets. Fire blight is not just a problem for the pome fruit industry of Australia, particularly pears but, of course, also apples. It is a problem because fresh fruit imports from New Zealand also carry other pest species. They were well understood and explained in the WTO investigations, plus the appeals which the Australian government brought when we lost the case initially for trying to ban fresh apple imports from New Zealand. Those other pest species, if they got out of control, would affect not just the pome fruit industry but also cereals and other horticultural crops-a serious problem for us. We are devastated by the idea that we should have MAF, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, in charge of the process-apparently-of oversighting merely the domestic protocols that are to be put into force in New Zealand. Whatever the orchards have to do to sell their boxes of apples from Auckland to Wellington, apparently those same rules and procedures will be okay when the product is sent across to Australia. We find this a complete abrogation of the responsibility of a country. Never before has the Australian government allowed the domestic protocols existing in a country to be used as the export if it were to protocol equivalency. We just wonder: was it to do with that speech the Prime Minister made and got the standing ovation for in the parliament of New Zealand a few months ago? Is that why this government has capitulated and allowed the local primary producers of apples in New Zealand to simply stick the fruit in a box, with a bit of trash if it happens to be there, plonk it on a truck and then into a container to send it across the sea with the fresh apple and accompanying bacterial spores ready for release into the Australian environment? It is a shocking dilemma for Australian primary producers. I have recommendations from the Turnbull Brothers Orchards, particularly Chris Turnbull. His recommendations are about the quarantine practices that would replace the domestic protocols which this government has said it does not really care about or is not fussed about-'They will do.' He says there must be more inspections of New Zealand orchards, increasing inspections from one to three between flowering and harvesting to ensure there are no outbreaks of fire blight or european canker in the months before Biosecurity Australia's proposed single inspection. Blocks where there are symptoms of fire blight or evidence of fire blight being removed should be excluded from export to Australia. Blocks where there has been an outbreak of fire blight should be excluded from the Australian market for two years. Packing lines should be fully disinfected by steam cleaning before being used to pack fruit for Australia. He recommends more rigorous inspections for potentially bacteria-carrying plant trash, an increase in the rate of inspections from 600 apples to 600 cartons, and scientific investigation to determine the actual risks of fire blight and european canker in areas of New Zealand where Biosecurity Australia currently guesses the risk. The Turnbull Brothers have been established since 1892 with orchards in the Goulburn Valley. They know their business. They are committed to intergenerational growing of fruit which is healthy with a clean green image and where the orchard can be sustained year after year because it is healthy and does not require the use of currently condemned chemicals. So we have here Mr Chris Turnbull proposing other measures. Today in this parliament we have had the Quarantine Legislation Amendment (Apples) Bill put forward by the shadow agriculture minister calling for a disallowable instrument in a desperate move to try and get this government to see reason, not to expose our country to a disease which is incurable, has never been cured in any country where it has taken hold. We have fresh apple imports from China. It is not the issue of fresh apple imports that is the problem; it is the importation of fruit which is a known carrier of an incurable disease and a bacteria which will feel very at home once it is able to get loose into our Australian Mediterranean climate.",83
28,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES," I personally consider Australia and New Zealand for most purposes to effectively be one country. I think it is an aberration of history that we are in fact not. New Zealand opted not to become part of the Australian Federation prior to 1901. We all know that prior to the time when the Australian colonies became a nation, New Zealand was for a very long time part of those procedures. The then Premier of New Zealand said there were 1,200 reasons why New Zealand would not become part of the Australian Federation but that he wished the colonies that were entering Federation all the best. Those 1,200 reasons, of course, were the 1,200 miles across the Tasman-across the ditch, as people say. I think that everyone would agree, though, that continental Australia and New Zealand can boast one of the best relationships in an international sense. I hesitate to talk about an international relationship and I very strongly support the position that was taken by the former Prime Minister, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, that we ought to have a common border between Australia on this side of the Tasman and New Zealand on the other. Unfortunately that has not yet been achieved, but I believe that the closer economic relationship ought to be advanced substantially so that we are able to attain something like a joint market across the Tasman. While I understand the concerns of the member for Murray in relation to the products from her electorate, I think it is vital to recognise that Australasia is in fact an entity and if there is a problem on one side of the Tasman then those on the other side of the Tasman should join in attempting to solve it. In the last parliament where the Howard government was in office, I was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We had a reference from the then minister, the member for Berowra, to look at harmonisation of laws within Australia and between Australia and New Zealand. Our committee made a whole series of recommendations, some of which were accepted by the government and some of which were not, which could have led to levels of greater integration, from possibly becoming one country through to a confederation through to sharing a telecommunications market and maybe having a common currency through to a whole range of issues. There are many levels of integration short of New Zealand becoming part of Australia. I support this bill. I think it is a very positive step. Australia and New Zealand share so many things, including a love of freedom and honour for our countries-a fact borne out by the ANZAC legend. We exchange students, we exchange tourists, we share a love of sports like rugby union, cricket and even rugby league and we share some legal frameworks and business relations. We even joke about each other, and if there is one thing that is an indicator of friendship and respect it is being able to share a good-hearted joke at each other's expense. I was on Q+A New Zealand about 12 months ago and at that time there was a situation where the New Zealand public in a fairly substantial number had suggested that ultimately they saw New Zealand becoming part of the Commonwealth of Australia. On that program were Don MCKinnon, Phil Goff and a number of other people. There was discussion in relation to the way forward. I do not believe that New Zealand should be forced into a relationship with Australia which reduces New Zealand to a state. There are many levels of integration short of that, which I think is something we want to achieve. When one looks at what the EU has been able to attain, given the history of Europe, particularly in the 20th century, surely it should be so much easier for the Australian states and New Zealand to be able to come to some suitable accommodation. It really is not a matter at issue in this parliament that we need a closer relationship with New Zealand. This bill is a very positive step forward, though I believe it is simply an incremental step forward and that there is very much a greater distance to travel. We are similar people with similar values and we get on very well together. Put differently, we are the same people, some of whom happen to carry a New Zealand passport and others of whom carry an Australian passport. When one looks at the natural tragedies we have had on this side of the Tasman and the support we got from New Zealand, and similarly with the earthquakes in New Zealand and the support that came from this side of the Tasman, the suggestion that we are two separate countries, while legally accurate, is one which does not, in the mind, I think, convince many people. Most Australians would consider New Zealanders to be kith and kin, and the relationship between Australia and New Zealand is not really an international relationship; it is a domestic regional relationship and one that we ought to encourage. This bill modifies the Customs Act 1901 to bring in changes to the rules of origin provisions, which are outlined in the key trade agreement between our two nations, the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. The changes afforded by this bill today result from a review and amendments to the trade agreement in 2007, when it was agreed that a further review would be conducted three years later, in 2010. These changes are mostly technical in nature, inserting and amending definitions and making clarifications. The changes will improve the efficient running of the agreement. The need for such modifications is a positive symptom of a document that is getting good use. The agreement is nearing 30 years old and needs to be tweaked from time to time. To be honest, it is probably regrettable that Australia and New Zealand have not moved further. Thirty years ago this was a land-breaking agreement, but many other countries have been able to come to other agreements and they have bypassed us because we simply have not been prepared to grasp the nettle and move forward as we should. The changes in this bill include inserting definitions for the terms 'aquaculture', 'manufacture' and 'produce' as well as amending the provisions dealing with 'wholly obtained goods' and also amending the provisions that deal with eligibility last process of manufacture. For example, the previous version of the agreement included aquaculture as an eligible activity but it did not include an actual definition of aquaculture, so that is an anomaly which the provisions of this bill will address. Further, this bill modifies the definition of 'manufacture' to also include activities that may not have previously come under the banner of manufacturing, such as restoration or renovation processes. The definition for 'produce' is modified to remove the references to 'disassemble', substituting it with terms 'restore or renovate'. This is relevant that, under the definition of 'produce', goods needed to be entirely produced in New Zealand from materials sourced in New Zealand or Australia. However, in previous versions of the agreement, items that were disassembled and/or reassembled in New Zealand could slip through and inadvertently be labelled as 'Made in New Zealand', which was inaccurate. This has sensibly been changed-a change that will bring integrity to the agreement with respect to making New Zealand and Australian goods. While I support this bill, I think the necessity for this bill indicates that we still have a long way to go. The fact that we are talking about this bill indicates that, as two nations, we have failed the challenge of bringing our economies together. We have failed the challenge of putting aside the fact that there might be 1,200 miles between the former British colony in Australia and the former British colony in New Zealand. The fact that we are in a sense wasting so much bureaucratic time on talking about these matters, as though we are perpetually going to be two separate countries, I think is eminently regrettable. It is incumbent on governments on both sides of the Tasman to accept a challenge that was made by former Prime Minister of the Rudd in talking about an ever-closer relationship between New Zealand and the Australian states. We share a history, we share geography, we share destiny and we share values. While this bill is worthy of support, much more has to be done. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (13:34): I thank the members for Fisher, Murray, Riverina, Forrest, Makin, Maranoa, Canberra and Stirling for their contributions to the debate the on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand in Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. I need to respond in some respects to the contributions made by members in relation to the import of apples from New Zealand. The Australian apple industry supports many regional communities and the Gillard government supports Australian apple growers and will always encourage Australians to buy Australian grown produce. It is unfortunate that the PM's comments to the New Zealand parliament have been misquoted by those opposite. The Prime Minister said: … Australia accepts the verdict of the global umpire and will implement the World Trade Organisation ruling on the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia. We accept the obligations of free trade, just as we embrace possibilities of free trade. This means that the government accepts the WTO rulings and has commenced a science based review of the import policy relating to New Zealand apples, in accordance with the WTO decision. That review is undertaken by Biosecurity Australia, oversighted by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. A draft of the review has been made available for public comment and submissions received on the science contained in the review. Apples will not be imported into Australia from New Zealand until Australia's quarantine officials are satisfied that they can be imported whilst meeting Australia's very high quarantine standards. I would also like to respond quickly to the matter that the member for Forrest raised about the operation of the amendments and whether they relax the rules of origin. I can assure the member for Forrest and this House that the changes implemented by this bill do not relax the rules of origin. The changes facilitate trade by providing importers and exporters of both countries with greater clarity and certainty about the rules of origin. The Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011 implements changes to article 3 of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, ANZCERTA. The ANZCERTA is Australia's longest standing bilateral free trade agreement, having been in force since 1983. Article 3 of ANZCERTA deals with rules of origin, which determine the eligibility of goods for preferential tariff treatment under the agreement. Such rules prevent the benefits of trade agreement tariff commitments extending to goods produced or manufactured in countries other than those who are party to the agreement. The current ANZCERTA rules of origin entered into the force on 1 January 2007. In negotiating these rules both countries agreed to include in ANZCERTA a provision requiring the review of rules of origin within three years of the new rules taking effect. Australian and New Zealand officials commenced the review in late 2008 and completed it in March 2010, resulting in agreement to make amendments to the text of ANZCERTA article 3, rules of origin, and the related product specific rules in annex G. The changes to ANZCERTA will reduce the administrative burden on business and will facilitate the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in ANZCERTA and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. This bill is the legislative vehicle for domestic implementation of the ANZCERTA article 3 changes. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",87
29,Mr DUTTON,COMMITTEES," The National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 proposes to establish a new statutory authority, the National Health Performance Authority. It introduces amendments to the legislation brought about by the National Health and Hospitals Network Bill 2010, only passed by the House on 21 March this year. The National Health and Hospitals Network Bill established the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care as an independent statutory authority. If enacted, this bill will amend the National Health and Hospitals and Network Act by changing its title to the National Health Reform Act 2011. Still to come is further legislation that will establish a third statutory authority, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. All of this legislation arises out of the convoluted so-called health reform engineered by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd-I am very pleased to have him in the chamber listening to this speech today-and Minister Roxon at the height of their reform frenzy last year preceding Mr Rudd's most undignified demise at the hands of the current Prime Minister. Both Mr Rudd and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, promised at the time that these changes would not lead to further bureaucracy in the health sector-clearly yet another hollow promise from this Labor government, for here the parliament is being asked to grow the bureaucracy with the first of two new authorities and the attendant boards, secretariats and associated staff. When the initial bill was introduced last year the coalition called for the government to provide all the provisions to establish all of these bodies at the one time so that the House, the stakeholders and the community could see the full intent of the government and, crucially, see exactly the interaction between these bodies. As is usual for this health minister, what we have is a piecemeal approach of bill after bill and amendment after amendment with all the attendant risks for poor outcomes as this minister tries to get it right. That is what we see here todaypage after page of amendments to the legislation. I will come to those amendments later. They are a humiliating rebuttal of this government and this minister-the minister for health is having to stand in this House and introduce amendments which clearly say she cannot be trusted to run the nation's health system, and the states will ensure that she does not get the opportunity to step in and override their authority. First, though, it is worth recounting very quickly the history relating to this bill, the authority it creates and the warnings and concerns that have been sounded loudly. It is an outstanding example of the ineptitude of this government. When the minister introduced the initial bill, the National Health and Hospitals Network Bill, in September last year, as with virtually anything this government attempts to do with health it was described as historic and delivering on the government's health reform agenda. Of course the so-called health reform agenda was somewhat different back then. These were the RuddRoxon reforms and, as the minister told the House, they were all about a hospitals network that would be funded nationally and run locally. At that time now Prime Minister Julia Gillard was still on board with Kevin Rudd and his reforms, telling the Committee for Economic Development in November last year: From July 1 the Commonwealth's share of hospital funding will increase to sixty per cent ... GST retention and dedication to health care will commence. Like so much of what this government promises, that also did not come to pass. Julia Gillard earlier this year",91
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," The member for Dickson ought to refer to the Prime Minister by her title, understanding order 64.",92
31,Mr DUTTON,COMMITTEES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The current Prime Minister earlier this year unceremoniously dumped the Rudd clawback of GST and the commitment to major funding to public hospitals and is now only going to provide around 40 per cent of public hospital funding. Yet in last year's election campaign the Prime Minister also stated: … I regard health care as one of the greatest responsibilities of any government. … … … If my government is returned to office on August 21, I will pursue our national reforms until the job is done. We all know that standing by commitments and promises to the Australian people is not a high priority for this Prime Minister or indeed her government. Her actions in health are every bit as egregious as the reversal of her promise that no government she led would introduce a carbon tax-a tax the Australian people do not want but one she steadfastly insists upon inflicting on them by mid next year. Despite multiple and embarrassing backdowns in health, the overblown rhetoric of this government does not disappear and consequently Labor's self-assessed historic Council of Australian Governments agreement of April last year has been replaced by another historic agreement of the COAG meeting of February this year, according to the minister when introducing this bill. It seems historic agreements come and go quickly under this Labor government. It remains to be seen whether Ms Gillard's efforts will survive longer than her predecessor's, for all she has at the moment is an agreement to reach an agreement and she is still negotiating with the states to get a final deal. We will see the final outcome at the next COAG meeting, whenever that might be, but, as the amendments now before the House make clear, the states are not accepting Labor's so-called reforms. We know that in the last 24 hours the planned COAG meeting has been delayed because they cannot get agreement",92
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the honourable member Dickson will then have the opportunity to continue his remarks. NA Mudgeeraba Agricultural Show Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:45): I would like to congratulate the organisers of the Mudgeeraba Agricultural Show, including the president, Helen Rippa, and show secretary, Kylie Holzinger, along with the committee and all the volunteers, for the work that they have done to make the 83rd Annual Mudgeeraba Agricultural Show such a great success. Mudgeeraba is a beautiful part of the Gold Coast within my electorate of MCPherson. The Mudgeeraba Show started as a small fete and flower show, and it was first run 79 years ago to raise money for improvements to the Memorial Hall. In 1973 there was a need to form a show society and register the event as an agricultural show. More than 10 years later, in 1985, a permanent pavilion at the show grounds was provided by the Albert Shire Council and leased to the show society. From its humble beginnings, the Mudgeeraba Show has now grown into a two-day weekend event, labelled as the 'little Ekka' with more than 15,000 Gold Coasters turning up on the first day this year, giving welcome boost the local economy. The event hosts horse events, handicrafts, horticultural exhibits, cooking and preserves, a pet parade, wood chopping, ring events and a showgirl pageant, to name but a few. The show would not be a success without the force of the community supporting it. The volunteers and the public ensure the event continues. I look forward to attending it next year and I encourage everyone to join me. Throsby Electorate: Emergency Service Workers Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:47): I take this opportunity to congratulate the SES, police, emergency services and local government workers of the Illawarra and Southern Highlands. As many members in this place would be aware, those areas have had some pretty wild weather over the last 24 hours. Winds of around 60 kilometres an hour, with gusts of up to 110 kilometres an hour, have hit the Southern Highlands and the Illawarra, bringing down trees and powerlines. Power was cut to 33,000 homes across southern New South Wales yesterday and last night. The SES was reported to have had almost 1,000 calls for help throughout New South Wales, with the majority of these coming from the Blue Mountains, Wingecaribee, Illawarra and South Coast areas. Over 7,000 homes and businesses lost power, including around 2,800 in Bowral, 1,400 in Bundanoon, over 1,000 in Mittagong and 180 in the Hill Top, Colo Vale, High Range and Moss Vale areas. Also, the Illawarra Highway was closed at Moss Vale when a falling tree brought down powerlines. The weather affected train services and signalling systems on the Southern Highlands and South Coast lines, with delays of up to 30 minutes. It has had a devastating impact on the region. Local residents have a been very patient and have been pulling together to assist each other to get through this very difficult time. I would like to once again congratulate all of the emergency service workers and volunteers who have assisted in bringing some normality back to the community. (Time expired) Hendra Virus Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (13:48): I rise to make a statement about the deadly hendra virus. I know that the minister at the table, the member for Griffith, would be well familiar with the hendra virus in Queensland. The hendra virus is spread from fruit bats or flying foxes, via their secretions, to horses and then to humans. It is a deadly virus that has already taken the lives of four Queenslanders in recent years. There is a recent outbreak in northern New South Wales and in the southern parts of Queensland. I hope the Prime Minister and the government are listening, because what we need to do is provide some $250,000 for protective clothing for the veterinarians and their staff who have to go to the suspected outbreaks and deal with those horses. Right now there are some 17 Queenslanders who are basically sitting on death row, wondering whether they have contracted this deadly disease. I am sure all of us in this place hope that they get a negative result from the tests that are currently being carried out. We also need to make sure that these kits are available in the vehicles of these veterinarians for use by them and their staff when they go to the suspected outbreaks. The other thing we need to do is fast track the vaccine that is being developed by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory as quickly as possible because that is another way of breaking the cycle between bats, horses and humans, and it will ultimately save lives. We need to make sure that this is done quickly and I call on the government to act on this deadly disease. (Time expired) Parsons, Air Commodore Keith",92
33,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to offer my condolences to the family of Air Commodore Keith Parsons. I would like to recognise the service and bravery of this dedicated pilot and Air Force officer. He was born in the great Tasmanian town of Scottsdale-and I note in the gallery Paul Ranson, the manager of B&E, who is also a Scottsdale boy. Keith Parsons was born in 1914 and joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a cadet in 1935. After learning to fly a Tiger Moth, he taught other pilots to both Tiger Moth and Liberator aircraft. He saw combat as a commanding officer, and later wing commander, of No. 7 Squadron. His courage, hard work and devotion to duty saw him awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1944 Air Commodore Keith Parsons was posted to bomber command in the United Kingdom and flew over 100 combat missions in the European theatre in the Second World War. After the war he returned to Australia to take up various postings, such as air attache in Washington and commanding officer of the RAAF Butterworth base in Malaysia. In 1961 he was promoted to Air Commodore and he retired in 1969. Air Commodore Parsons passed away on 27 June, one day short of his 96th birthday. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the diligence, bravery, dedication and service of this remarkable Tasmanian. (Time expired) National Schools Chaplaincy Program",94
34,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Austin Cove Baptist College was opened on 2 February 2011 and immediately the school community was tested with the unfortunate passing of Lauren Ames, a 13-year-old student, in a tragic car accident. Also, early on the morning on 4 May 2011, an explosion ripped through a tent in a Mandurah caravan park, in which a family was temporarily staying while the father dealt with financial issues. Tragically, all three family members perished. The youngest victim, 13-year-old Georgie Spies, was a student at Austin Cove Baptist College. Soon afterwards, a popular parent of a student passed away. Austin Cove's Principal, Orlando dos Santos, is a fantastic leader of the school. After the fallout from the tragedies became clear, students and staff were obviously having a difficult time processing the heart breaking events. So Mr dos Santos fly applied to the National School Chaplaincy Program-a marvellous program started by the Howard government. On 13 May 2011, I wrote to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the Hon. Peter Garrett, seeking his urgent intervention because the school needed support. After seven weeks of hounding Minister Garrett's office, I finally got an answer: Whilst I am sympathetic to the needs expressed by Mr dos Santos, the pressures on the Budget are significant and there is no latitudebasically, the answer was no. This is a very unfortunate, substandard, lazy, dismissive and indifferent response. It is indicative of the minister's own abilities and is symptomatic of a federal government which has completely lost touch with the Australian community. My First Speech Competition for Young Australia",94
35,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is with great pleasure I rise today to congratulate my constituent Jeeven Nadanakumar for winning the inaugural national My First Speech Competition for Young Australians. The competition gave young Australians the opportunity to outline in three minutes their vision for their communities as if giving their first speech parliament-and the members for Moreton, Richmond and I are very afraid. In his entry, Jeeven-who is in the chamber today with his family; welcome-outlined a strong vision for the future of Canberra and the country. He articulated values close to my heart and to many in this chamber. He talked about the virtues of Canberra and the value of small business and multiculturalism. He spoke about the need for every Australian to get quality education and health care. He also spoke of his passion for the environment and the need for a sustainable Australia. In just three minutes, he eloquently articulated his vision-one which I suspect many in this House, including me, would struggle with. It is quite clear from his entry and his extracurricular activities that Jeeven is an individual who will never be content to sit and let others do what must be done. He will always act for the benefit of his community. Congratulations, Jeeven. You should be proud of your achievements. I hope you continue with your passionate advocacy for your community. Also, congratulations to the teachers at Marist College for promoting this fantastic competition. Live Animal Exports",94
36,Mr MCCORMACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today in Australia's north, farmers will start shooting cattle. Tonight in Indonesia, children will go to bed hungry. It is a national disgrace that this government will not resume the live cattle export trade to those abattoirs which comply with Australian killing standards. Waiting to board ships there are Australian cattle which could be sent to Australian-owned feedlots in Indonesia and killed according to international animal welfare standards. However, the issue has been put into the Labor government's ever-growing delay basket. The Labor government says they want to trace these to animals and that that is the important issue. Well, they will be able to trace them all the way to the pits where these dead animals will be dumped. Meanwhile, people go hungry. Labor's refusal to do anything positive about this issue beggars belief and will cost this country jobs and millions of dollars. This has caused a diplomatic debacle which will have long-term repercussions. Labor's way is to turn it into a welfare issue by offering a $30 million compensation package. What is needed is the immediate resumption of trade to those abattoirs which comply with Australian standards-that is, killing by stunning. Last week, I attended the Tumbarumba branch of the New South Wales Farmers Association annual meeting at Tooma where members expressed their disgust at the knee-jerk reaction to ban the by trade. Many other local beef producers have also told me they cannot understand why the Gillard government will not listen to reason. Rest assured, I will continue to lobby for the immediate resumption of the trade to abattoirs which comply with our animal welfare standards. (Time expired) Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (13:56): I recently attended the annual ball of the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, a locally based organisation which essentially raises money for the local community. In a period of 12 years they have raised $2 million from their efforts and each year they contribute $250,000 between Camden and Campbelltown hospitals. Also, they created the children's gardens at Campbelltown Hospital, updated the training of medical employees and raised money towards community health centres. Under the leadership of Bruce Hanrahan they have managed, with the support of Bottlemart, Macarthur Travel, various clubs in the region, Woolworths and the Rotary Club of Narellan, to become a very strong organisation. One of the cultures of the Campbelltown region which I have not previously witnessed is an attitude that money raised within the region should stay there. The Macarthur area is very separate and endeavours there should go to local purposes, thereby engendering far more local support. The latest venture is to build a charity house which will later be auctioned. This project has had help from Fairmont Homes and Dart West Developments, who are basically doing things at cost. There is also significant support from some volunteers in the region. It was interesting at the function to hear from Professor John Whitehall, the new professor of paediatrics at the Western Sydney University-and the creation of a medical faculty there is a major step forward for this institution in gaining national recogfor nition. Again I commend the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, a locally based organisation doing worthwhile things in the community. Carbon Pricing",95
37,Mr CHESTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to speak in relation to the proposed carbon tax. It appears the Prime Minister has done a deal with the Greens and with the Independents, but she has not done a deal with Latrobe Valley power station workers and she has not done a deal with the Australian people. This Prime Minister has not dealt with her fundamental breach of trust-'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' This begs the question: is she really leading this government? No, it is Bob Brown who is in power. Bob Brown was on TV last night and he was smiling way too much. When the Greens are smiling, regional Australians know they are about to cop it in the neck. They want to shut down the coal industry, shut down the export of live cattle, shut down rodeos and shut down steeplechases. Regional Australians have had an absolute gutful of being told what to do by city based Greens and city based Labor MPs. What happened to your grand old party? You used to stand up for workers. What happened to your party? It is no wonder regional MPs on the other side are afraid to go home. I feel sorry for them. They want to seek refuge. They are probably lining up at the immigration minister's office now saying, 'Can I buy a boat?'",96

As I am around the country talking to Australian workers and Australian families about the facts on carbon pricing, I hope the Leader of the Opposition is out telling them the facts about his 'subsidy for polluters' plan and, most particularly, the entry on page 14 that records his plan to penalise businesses, to put penalties on them. I hope he is out and about telling Australian workers whether it is their business that he is going to put a penalty on. I hope he is out and about telling Australian families about the cost impacts which will flow through to them because of those penalties and I hope he tells those families that he is not proposing to give them any assistance at all, that what he wants to do is take $720 off them and give it to big polluters. I hope he is out and about with those facts. I will be out and about talking to people about the truth about carbon pricing; about the science and the need to act; about the imposition of a price on the biggest polluters in this country, on big businesses; about the way that will enable them to innovate and cut carbon pollution; about the jobs that our clean energy future will promise this country; about the tax cuts and increases in pensions and payments for Australian families; about the measures to protect Australian jobs and the measures to tackle climate change.

I will simply respond to the Leader of the House's point of order by saying, yes, there is a limit to my tolerance about argument in questions but there was such uproar that, whilst I had a feeling where the question was going, I did not hear it.

Consequently, I will be explaining to them how the carbon pricing package will protect Australian jobs today and ensure that our nation is prosperous and has the benefits of a clean-energy future. I will of course be speaking to Australians about any issue they want to raise with me. I suspect that they will want to raise issues with me about what was said during the election campaign, and I will be happy to answer their questions. I will be happy to explain to them that the carbon tax is temporary and that the emissions trading scheme is permanent. I will be happy to explain to them that I always wanted to achieve an emissions trading scheme for this nation, and we will. I will be happy to explain to them that we have got there via a different route than the one I foresaw at the election campaign, but we will seize that clean-energy future. I will be explaining to them that the Leader of the Opposition was a member of the Howard cabinet that authorised an emissions trading scheme. I will be explaining to them that the Leader of the Opposition has been in favour of an emissions trading scheme and in favour of a carbon tax. I will be explaining to them that he is now opposed to a carbon tax and he is now opposed to an emissions trading scheme. I will be explaining to them that is not leadership. Leadership is about saying to the country that we have to chart the best course for the future. Leadership is about saying to the country that there are difficult things we need to do in order to do the right thing by our environment and by our economy for the future. I will be saying to the country that, as a nation, as a people we are up to doing this together. The time to do it is now. Our economy is strong, and while our economy is strong is the right time to be addressing a major reform. Nothing hard gets easier because you leave it in the too-hard basket, so I will be explaining to them that, as Prime Minister, I intend to lead this nation through this difficult reform. It will strengthen us for the future and we will get it done. Carbon Pricing",99
69,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why is it important to the Australian economy that the government put a price on carbon pollution? Treasurer, how has this approach been received and what is the government's response?",99
70,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Braddon for that question. We on this side of the House have understood for a long time the dangers of ignoring climate change in terms of our environment and our economy. We have understood the need to tackle climate change in the most costefficient way possible. We also understand that, if you put a price on carbon pollution, you have to assist households and you have to support jobs. We are putting a price on carbon pollution, to be paid by up to 1,000 of our largest polluters. We simply cannot afford to put this challenge in the too hard-basket for any that longer. Certainty demands action. That is why we are seeing such strong support from the business community for a price on carbon pollution. Overnight, 55 companies have come out in support of putting a price on carbon pollution-companies such as GE, Grocon, AGL, IKEA and so on. This is what the CEO of Grocon had to say: Personally, I'm in favour of a cost on carbon. As I look forward in Australia, I see us at the threshold of some fantastic times and I get disillusioned when I see some critical decisions that need to be made for our future getting bogged down in politics. He is absolutely correct. Of course that is why organisations such as the BCA and the AiG are supporting a price on carbon, and that is why some of our biggest energy companies are also supporting a price on carbon-companies such as Santos, Rio Tinto, BHP, Origin Energy, Gloucester Coal and so on. That is why on this side of the House we understand that we must make this transition to a clean energy future. As we make that transition we do have to provide support to households. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts, increased payments and pension increases. Of course we will provide additional assistance to those on the lowest incomes. All of this stands in stark contrast to the approach of others who have a policy of subsidies for polluters and, of course, a policy which will not provide any assistance to households. The Leader of the Opposition was on The 7.30 Report a couple of nights ago and he finally admitted that his policy will result in a direct slug on households-a direct slug of $720 per household. Of course that money will go directly to the biggest polluters in the country. You cannot put a slug of $720 on households and then pretend that you care about cost-of-living pressures in our community.",99

The Treasurer has the call.",100
72,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You cannot say that you care about cost-of-living pressures when you are going to rip back tax cuts. You certainly cannot say that you care about cost-of-living pressures when you are going to slug households $720. Of course we all know that the Leader of the Opposition has no respect for economists and those on his backbench have no respect for his economics as well because we have a new underground economic policy group, which has been formed by the member for Higgins, because they are so aghast at the lack of any alternative economic policy from the opposition benches. It is going to take a lot more than dusting off Work Choices and promising unfunded tax cuts to give this Leader of the Opposition some economic credibility. (Time expired) NA",100
73,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Before I decide whether I give the member for Wright or the member for Swan the call, I inform the House that we have in the gallery today the three winners of the My First Speech competition conducted by the International and Community Relations Office of the parliament.

75,Mr IRONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency that, 'The introduction of a carbon price in Australia will not reduce global temperatures over the next five, 10 or 50 years.' With the forgotten families of Australia already struggling with the rising cost of living, why is the Prime Minister introducing a carbon tax that, for them, is all pain and no gain?",100
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. I think it is very important that there is a shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change. Where that shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change leads us is that we live in a world where, as a result of human activity and the way we live today-the industrialised high-energy way we live today-we generate more carbon pollution than at any other time in human history. What that means is that there is a level of damage already done which we cannot unthink or undo. There is a level of damage that lies in front of us and we can make a difference to that-that is, we can act to cut carbon pollution. Rather than saying, as a nation, that we are prepared to just allow whatever the future gives us in terms of levels of carbon pollution with all of the danger that that would create for our nation, we can act to reduce those levels of carbon pollution. I believe in doing that. I believe as a nation which is amongst the 20 biggest polluters in our world, we should be acting to cut carbon pollution. I am a little bit surprised about this question because I would have to say that, unless there has been a big change in opposition policy, I thought members of the opposition said that they supported cutting carbon pollution too. Maybe I am wrong about that. I know, of course, that climate change scepticism has swept through the Liberal Party and claimed the Leader of the Opposition, so now maybe they reject the need to do anything about carbon pollution and simply deny its existence.",101
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The member for Swan on a point of order.,101
78,Mr Irons,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question was about the cost of living in introducing a carbon tax, and relevance.",101
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan would also acknowledge that there are other elements to the question as well. The Prime Minister is responding.,101
80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There may have been a change in the opposition because I note that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in this place referred to so-called carbon pollution, so maybe climate change scepticism is now ruling entirely. They reject the science out of hand and they reject the existence of carbon pollution out of hand. But we, on this side of the parliament, accept the science. We believe we should act to reduce carbon pollution. We accept the economic advice that the best way to do that is by pricing carbon. Then, of course, because we want as a Labor government to look after those in our community who need the most assistance, we will ensure that the money polluters pay funds tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households. The member in his point of order said that he was concerned about cost of living. He needs to make a comparison between tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households versus the plan of the Leader of the Opposition to charge households an extra $720 per year in tax, something that would impact on people's cost of living.",101

83,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of cost of living, the member who asked the question may want to refer to the policy of his own political party, particularly page 14-that is the plan to put penalties on businesses, businesses in his electorate. not know how many businesses in his electorate would get which size penalty. He may have to ask the Leader of the Opposition about that and how many of them it would drive out of business. I cannot help him with that; it is the plan of the Leader the Opposition. But, of course, the penalty put on businesses would flow through presumably to the prices that they charge and into cost of living pressures. He may ask the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about that as well because the Leader of the Opposition wants to make a charge of $720 per family. He has this plan for penalties, rising cost-of-living pressures and he is planning no assistance. In fact he is planning to take back the tax cuts and pension increases that this government will provide.",102

88,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. What are the facts about the current state of the Australian coal industry and its future outlook and what is the response of the government to any claims to the contrary? Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (14:26): I thank the I do member for Hunter for his question because he, like this side of the House, understands that the Australian coal industry has an excellent future. That is very important for Australia because that is about jobs, exports and revenue. That importantly is related to of our capacity to invest in a nation in fundamental government services such as education, health and child care. Let us deal with a few facts because this goes to the heart of the matter. I firstly refer to the latest ABARES data estimates. They show a 24 per cent increase in export earnings from energy commodities in 201011 to $71 billion in 2011. They then suggest a further 25 per cent increase in 2011-12 to $89 billion; interestingly driven by thermal coal, up 31 per cent to $18.3 billion; and metallurgical coal up 31 per cent to $31.9 billion. I understand economic figures bore the Leader of the Opposition, because they actually tell the real story. In terms of future expansion of the industry, it even looks brighter-a forecast increase in exploration expenditure on coal of 12 per cent. We are, and we will continue to be, the world's largest exporter of coal and so we should be. Prices are high and there is significant investment in Australia. It is our responsibility to grab these economic opportunities whilst they are there for Australia to grab. Just think about this: metallurgical coal prices have seen recent historic highs at $330 a tonne, thermal coal prices reached a record $131 a tonne, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk down the future of the coal industry in Australia that is not only economically significant to the nation at large but very significant to the economic opportunities in a range of key regions in many states and territories of Australia. I compare those prices to 10 years ago: in terms of coking coal, $50 a tonne-a sixth of what they are today; and thermal coal worth around $7 billion-a third of their predicted value today. You can see why this industry is important to Australia. Predictions are that these prices will continue and, more importantly, the pipeline of investment shows a huge potential expansion not only in the coal industry historically, in Australia, areas such as the Hunter and the Bowen Basin but in the creation of a whole new coal corridor in the Galilee Basin, with a huge growth in demand out of India and potentially two major Indian investments in the coal industry in the Galilee Basin in Australia. This is about real jobs in Australia. It is about our resource and energy sectors driving our future and they will continue to expand. Just think about the expansion of jobs. The expansion of this industry is creating new jobs. The mining industry took on an extra 35,200 workers in the year to May of this year. From our point of view, the government understands the importance of the coal industry. It also accepts that it has a very bright future. This is about jobs, exports and revenues, and it is about our capacity as a nation to look after the broader Australian community and to invest in services such as health, education and child care. We do not find economics boring-the Leader of the Opposition might-because this is fundamental to our economy. Start talking about the coal industry's bright future from the Leader of the Opposition's point of view rather than talking down investment and jobs in Australia. Carbon Pricing",102
89,Mr BUCHHOLZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a statement by the new Labor Senator Alex Gallacher that a carbon tax on diesel fuel will force truckies to 'go broke or cut corners'. Additionally, the Western Australian secretary for the TWU, Paul Aslan, said: 'Truck drivers cart every darn thing in this country. Don't people realise how important they are?' With the forgotten families of Australia already struggling under the rising costs of living, why is the Prime Minister introducing a in carbon tax that will push transport costs even higher and flow through to higher prices for everything?",103
90,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I certainly do respect the work of truck drivers. They work very hard for this country. That is why I was so determined to replace Work Choices with the Fair Work system so that they had a safety net and the benefit of decent working conditions. I did not want to see people who worked as truck drivers have their penalty rates taken away and have the money in their pockets stripped away through Australian workplace agreements.,103
91,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Say thank you with a carbon tax.,103
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Cook will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). The member for Cook then left the chamber.,103
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not want them to be able to be unfairly sacked for no reason at all. So we have acted to work with truck drivers on their terms and conditions. Of course, many of them are owner-drivers not employees, and we have constructively with the Transport Workers Union on issues associated with ownerdrivers and we will continue to do so. On the member's question about carbon pricing, can I suggest to the member that he study the details on Sunday when the full details of carbon pricing are released. He asked me why I am pricing carbon. The answer to why is: I accept the science; I accept that our climate is changing; I accept that it is caused by human activity; I accept that means that we need to cut carbon pollution; and I accept the economic advice that the best way to do that is by putting a price on carbon-that is, on the economics of the proposition I accept the same propositions that Prime Minister John Howard did, that the Leader of the Opposition did when he sat in Prime Minister Howard's cabinet and which he has accepted on many occasions since but no longer accepts now. I certainly believe that system order: this was a question about a carbon tax pushing up transport costs and flowing through to consumers. The Prime Minister is not even attempting to answer that question. I would ask you to direct her to be directly relevant to the question.",103
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The standing orders require that the Prime Minister be directly relevant to the question and the Prime Minister will respond in that fashion.,104
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about trucks, carbon pricing and cost of living. I was just about to say that, on questions of cost of living, of course we want to work with Australian families. That is why nine out of 10 households will get the benefits of tax cuts or payment increases. What I do not want to see is the Leader of the Opposition's $720-a-year tax slug. What I do not want to worked see is the Leader of the Opposition's plan order",104
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will respond directly to the question and, as I have said before, has whilst standing orders as they stand allow debate in answers, I prefer that that be minimised. The Prime Minister has the call.",104
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was responding to the member by saying it is my intention to work with Australian families to assist them with their cost-of-living pressures and it is my intention to defend them from alternative propositions to take money out of their pocket. Live Animal Exports,104
98,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given the very real concerns being expressed by northern Australian cattle producers in relation to the live cattle export issue, could the Prime Minister update the House on any protocol arrangements and any time lines on lifting the present ban on live exports?",104
99,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! That was an example of behaviour that people outside this place think is very strange. When people can argue with a questioner and not show respect or civility to a fellow MP, that is of concern to many people who view us. The question was in order. The Prime Minister now has the call to respond to the question.",104
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for New England for his question. He is one of a number of members on all sides of the House, people of all political persuasions, who have personally raised with me concerns about the live cattle trade. Many people representing electorates that are home to numbers of producers want to know, understandably and somewhat anxiously, when the trade will be resumed. We are working hard and progress is being made to achieve our goal of having the trade resumed in circumstances where we can track and trace where Australian cattle are going and the conditions under which they are slaughtered in the abattoirs that they go Indonesia. Progress is being made. We do need to continue to work hard on this. As progress is being made there are some more things to do, but I can certainly say to the member for New England that we are not letting a day go by, an hour go by, so that this trade is not suspended for longer than it needs to be. I understand the pressure that is putting on the shoulders of people in the live cattle industry. We are of course working with people in the live cattle industry their needs and concerns at this time. There is a $5 million animal welfare package and a $30 million industry support fund. I know that some owners and growers have been distressed. There was, for example, a gentleman in Western Australia yesterday who made clear his distress publicly. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry ensured that he was contacted by the Cattle Council and by Centrelink so he could take full advantage of the support packages that are available to him. We will continue to work with the cattle industry, making those support packages available as we continue to work hard to resume this trade. I want to resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",104
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Mackellar will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). There is a general warning. The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.,105
103,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed so the trade can have a strong and sustained future for the long term. I do not want to see a resumption of the trade in circumstances where questions remain about animal welfare, only to have the industry to in again confront a problem like this in six months time or 12 months time or two years time. We want to get this on the right footing for the long term. So we will continue to work hard and of course as soon as I am in a position to give any further advice publicly, I will certainly do so. Trade",105
104,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs to meet and Minister for Justice. Why is the government's package of improvements to Australia's anti-dumping system needed to help protect Australian manufacturers and primary producers from unfair trading practices? What has been the response to the government's anti-dumping measures and is the minister aware of any other approaches? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (14:39): I thank the member for Oxley for his question and his ongoing interest in jobs and manufacturing businesses in his electorate. Last week the government announced reforms, indeed 29 improvements, to strengthen the anti-dumping regime in this country. Those improvements will see greater resources and more expertise dedicated to investigating cases of dumping which may affect Australian businesses and Australian jobs. We will extend 'material injury' to ensure the remedy is commensurate with damage endured by local businesses, we will enable businesses to access measures more rapidly, we will speed up the process, we will allow greater transparency and we will prevent companies from circumventing duties by disaggregating or aggregating imported goods. These are very long overdue reforms that have been well received by both industry and unions. Companies such as Capral, BlueScope, OneSteel and Orica have embraced the government's announcements of last week. Indeed, the Australian Industry Group responded to the reforms by indicating: The new anti-dumping measures announced today by the Federal Government are a positive step to help rebalance the playing field for Australian Industry. The National Farmers Federation responded by saying: … we are pleased to hear that the Government will improve the resourcing of Customs to work on anti-dumping issues. The honourable member asked about why these changes are needed and about what other approaches there are. These long overdue reforms are needed because those opposite neglected this area of reform while they were in government. For more than a decade these reforms were required, but the previous government did nothing. They did not listen to industry and they did not listen to workers in this country in order to provide that support. Instead, the Leader of the Opposition decided to set up a task force in opposition-he should have been supporting industry and workers in government-led by the member for Indi, of all people, to go around the country to promise everything but deliver nothing. We, in contrast, have been looking at the Productivity Commission report recommendations and we have been considering the private member's bill introduced into the Senate by Senator Xenophon-and these reforms are comprehensive. They are comprehensive and they redress the deficiencies that existed under the Howard government when it came to dealing with dumping that caused injury to Australian businesses. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he either just says no or does nothing when it comes to public policy.",105
105,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,106
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will conclude his answer. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: He says no or does nothing. They are his two approaches to every public policy matter. That is apparent on this issue and on other matters.,106
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Is the minister concluding his answer? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: I was asked what the government are doing. The government are responding to this issue. We responded to and dealt with the global financial crisis and supported workers and businesses. We dealt with that issue. We were the party that rid this country of the most extreme IR laws since Federation. We will continue to do the right thing as we have done in this area.,106

111,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, No. Tobacco Plain Packaging,107
112,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What action has the government taken to remove glamour from cigarettes and reduce the influence of tobacco companies? What reaction has there been and what is the government's response?,107
113,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Banks for his question. I am very proud to say that today I introduced into the parliament the world's first legislation the plain packaging of tobacco products. This legislation means that all tobacco products sold in Australia will, in the future, have no industry logos, no brand imagery, no colours and no promotional text. They will just be in a drab, dark brown pack with health warnings that will cover 75 per cent of the front of the pack and 90 per cent of the back of the pack. Those who manufacture, sell or distribute tobacco products could face fines of over a million dollars if they breach this legislation. I am pleased to say that at last the Leader of the Opposition-although he has been dragged kicking and screaming-has indicated that the Liberal Party will support this measure, which I hope will be followed through on. However, I did notice last night in the House that the member for Mitchell put on the record his opposition to these measures. He outed himself as one of the supporters of tobacco in the Liberal Party room. He said that plain packaging was 'an example of ill thought-out proposals put forward by government committees' and that this was 'a ridiculous form of nanny state legislative response to ordinary, everyday problems'.",107

The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.  understands there is a general warning and therefore is operating in an environment of listening to the minister's response. But I ask you, Mr Speaker: what is going to stop this kind of slagging and bagging of members of the opposition, which only invites a response from the opposition? Mr Albanese interjecting",107
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. First of all, I for invite the Manager of Opposition Business to withdraw a remark that has got a lot of response from within and outside the chamber. I have been charitable enough to indicate that I do not believe that the perception is correct, but I cannot propose that to be the intention. So I would ask the manager to withdraw that remark.  offence taken to a currency that that remark has had attached to it, I withdraw it. But I still make the serious point about the minister's attack on members of the opposition, notwithstanding the general warning.",107
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I will respond to that. That was the second point. I am thankful that you have made the admission that, because of the new environment just for this question time, people are listening",107
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take that in the spirit that it was offered. I have indicated that the complication for any occupant of the chair is to allow debate either way. You know that I have perhaps been easier than I should have been about debate within the questions. When you look at the standing orders-and this is my reading of them-if debate is directly relevant, it is allowable. On this occasion, I would say to the minister that she should relate her material in a directly relevant manner in her response. I would not want to be a member of the commentariat who indicated that I did not think it was relevant to mention the member for Mitchell in a question that talked about glamour, but I think we do know that there has to be a confinement in the response to its direct relevance.",107
119,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think perhaps amongst the hubbub people did not understand that I am actually quoting from a speech that the member for Mitchell gave last night in opposition to the plain packaging legislation that has been introduced in the parliament today-the very question that I have been asked. What the member for Mitchell said was that he did not think this sort of legislation was a decent response to 'ordinary, everyday problems'. The reason I quote this is that I take issue with the inference that it is ordinary, everyday Australians who are the ones who are not being harmed; in fact, 15,000 Australians each and every year who still die from tobacco related illnesses. If that number was distributed, the member for Mitchell, like every member in this House, would see on average 100 people die every year in his electorate because of tobacco related illnesses. I think that is an everyday problem that ordinary Australians do face and it is why we are taking action on plain packaging.",108

121,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The interjections we hear from those opposite just show that they are still reluctant converts. And we know why they are reluctant converts, because they are receiving thousands and thousands of dollars in donations all the time and they are embarrassed about it. The member for Goldstein, the member for Indi, the member for Sturt are all receiving thousands of dollars in donations still, and that is why they are so reluctant to support this legislation.",108
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume her seat. And the minister has concluded?,108
123,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes.  of order. Given the circumstances of the House that you have insisted upon since the beginning of question time, which is entirely within your power to do so as the Speaker, how is it in order for the minister to deliver that diatribe and then simply say she has concluded her answer and face absolutely no admonition? Ms Roxon interjecting",108
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! One would have noticed that many people either in the chamber or in the galleries-I do not know what is going out on the air-probably did not hear the conclusion of the answer because I allowed, even though there was a general warning, a response that, having been here for 25 years, I understood the answer would get. I indicate that the question about whether the minister had concluded was to ascertain whether it had to be brought to a conclusion by the chair. You can scratch it on a barrel that I sat a minister down; I do not really mind. I am again indicating that, whilst it might be considered by some to be over the top and it might be considered debate over and above what one would expect in response, once debate is allowed in the responses this is what is going to happen. I have been saying this, I now realise, for many years, even before I was the Speaker. I think that the problem we have not got our heads around is that if you want to have question and answer, have a question and have an answer; do not have debate entwined in it and do not have things being done to get 10-second grabs for other purposes. The member for Forrest has the call, and I expect that the whole chamber will take note, as has been described, of the circumstances that we find ourselves in. Carbon Pricing",108
125,Ms MARINO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to Graham Manning, a dairy farmer in Harvey, Western Australia. One of the biggest costs in his small business is electricity, because he refrigerates thousands of litres of milk every day. Does the Treasurer expect him to absorb the cost of the carbon tax, or will this cost simply be passed on to the consumer through higher prices for milk?",109

Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been removed under 94 (a). I simply ask if you think that is fair.",109
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I know I will get the emails that I have not been fair. I indicated to him at the end of the answer of the Minister for Health and Ageing that nobody could have heard the answer because so many people were interjecting and I took no action at that. If I am allowed to make stanzas of what is happening here in question time, I will. I can assure him: if I had tossed out everybody who transgressed since the general warning I would be very comfortable but very lonely in the chamber.",109

132,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was making it very clear that there will be additional assistance for households: there will be tax cuts, there will be increases in family payments and there will be increases in pensions. All of those things are very important. I know they do not matter to those opposite, because if they were in power they would simply rip them out.",109
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will respond to the question.,110
134,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am responding to the question, Mr Speaker. All of the detail will be there on Sunday for everybody to see, and can I just make this point: we absolutely look forward to this debate in the weeks ahead so that all of the scaremongering that has come from those opposite can be exposed for what it is. Carbon Pricing Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:57): question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Why is the government's plan for a price on carbon the most effective way to help Australia cut pollution while supporting households? How has this been received and what is the government's response? An opposition member: You'll have to wait till Sunday!",110
135,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Of course-on Sunday-the government will be announcing the details of a carbon price package that will cut pollution andMs O'Dwyer interjecting,110
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a new member of the House, the member for Higgins may not realise that once I have given a general warning there are a number of options that I can take. I might chance my arm and name somebody soon. She is absolutely warned, because I intend to name her if she does not take recognition of the general warning.",110
137,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, the government will be announcing the details of the carbon price. It will cut pollution, it drive investment in clean energy and it will provide strong support for households and jobs. This morning the government's plan to put a price on carbon pollution received more support from the business community. Companies like AGL, Fujitsu, Ikea and General Electric, and 51 others, are now part of an organisation called Businesses for a Clean Economy, and in a statement released today these and a host of other businesses stated: As major Australian and international corporations and representative associations operating across the Australian economy we My strongly support the introduction of a well designed carbon price to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Those companies, which are major corporations operating within our economy, know, along with every credible economist, that putting a price on carbon pollution is the cheapest and most cost-effective way of cutting pollution. Of course, it is not a tax on households; it is a charge that will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the largest polluters in the economy for every tonne of pollution that they produce. The carbon price will be good for the economy and it will be good for the environment, whilst households will be assisted to meet the modest cost impacts of the introduction of a carbon price. Nine out of 10 households will get some combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Pensioners will benefit from an increase in the pension. Many self-funded retirees will receive assistance equal to the extra payments that we will provide to other pensioners, part pensioners and carers. At least three million households will also get a 20 per cent buffer over and above the average price impacts of the carbon price to will give them that bit of extra cash. Families, tradespeople and of course small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a fuel price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. These are very important commitments to accompany the introduction of the carbon price in our economy. Households should also be very clear that the Leader of the Opposition intends taking all of these rises in the pension, intends clawing back the tax cuts, intends taking back all of the assistance",110

141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister and the Manager of Opposition Business will resume their seats. There are some people that I do not hear from at the best of times; am disappointed to hear from them during a general warning, and they will remain unnamed. The Manager of Opposition Business has a point of order.  out that the minister was not asked to debate the question. He was not asked to attack the opposition. I would ask you to draw him back to the question or sit him down.",111
142,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business has made a relevant point of order. I cringe when I hear a question that finishes with: 'How has it been received and what is the government's response?' but I do have an expectation that ministers will try to relate their material directly to that aspect of the question without just going into debate willy-nilly. The minister has the call and he should recognise that point.,111
143,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, I was asked how the government's announcement of a carbon price has been received and what the government's response to that is. It is relevant, I would submit, that the opposition has a position that it would take away the benefits that the government intends providing as part of this package to pensioners, self-funded retirees and families.  Speaker.",111
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might consider that he is defying, but I am simply absolutely trying to indicate the difficulties that the chair has under the present standing orders that allow questions that have this type of addition at the end. I will listen carefully, very carefully, to the way in which the minister relates his material directly, because that is the new standing order. Under the previous standing order, ministers from both sides of politics perfected ways of making a I smidgen of relevance, but this has to be directly relevant. Therefore the preamble of the question is very important. The minister.",111
145,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The choice for the Australian people in relation to this issue is very clear. The government wants to provide tax cuts, pension increases and increased payments for households. The Leader of the Opposition wants to tax households an extra $720 a year to pay money",111

147,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the plight of Jeff Gilbert, who yesterday was charged an extra eight per cent to post an item from the Alexandra post office in Victoria and was told, 'because of the carbon tax'.",111

150,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No more feigned laughter there. Against that background, I ask: with people already being ripped off before your carbon tax has even been introduced, how will you protect consumers if it does become law?",111
151,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 100(d)(vi) and (vii), that question is out of order.",112
152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Going to the point of order on the whole, the member has mentioned a person's name. It is usual that one would take on face value that the member is quoting what he has been informed by the person he has named. This is a question that I have heard in its manifestation over a number of proposals put before this parliament by both sides and I indicate that I will allow the question. I am sure the Treasurer will now respond in a directly relevant manner.",112
153,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. He has raised the instance of price gouging and deceptive behaviour. These matters are dealt with by our competition and consumer watchdog, the ACCC, which has full powers to deal with them. I am more than happy to take up his case. He should provide the full details to pass onto the ACCC so it can do its job. Climate Change",112
154,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Schools, Early Childhood and Youth representing the Minister for Science and Innovation. Will the Minister inform the House about the consensus in the scientific community over the threat of dangerous climate change? How has this been received, and what is the government doing to address the issue?",112
155,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (15:08): I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. The fact is that climate change is real and we know this because our scientific community, particularly climate scientists, have a consensus about it. An open letter from the scientific community in June of this year said: The overwhelming scientific evidence tells us that human greenhouse gas emissions are resulting in climate changes that cannot be explained by natural causes. There is a context in which we should understand what our scientists are telling us. The fact is that science underpins the quality of life that we have in Australia. In 2011-12 the Commonwealth will invest an estimated $9.4 billion in science, research and innovation through programs across the Australian government-some 43 per cent higher than the high-water mark, so called, of the Howard government. There are 55,000 researchers working in Australia's universities and tens of thousands of researchers working in CSIRO, the public service and cultural institutions in the not-for-profit sector. Scientific knowledge starts at school and of course as education minister I do know that many of our best and brightest started to me learning about science when they were at school. Australia's record in science is a proud one. I think of the Tidbinbilla deep space tracking station, quite close to us here in Parliament House, and great Australian scientists like Howard Florey, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1945 for his discovery of penicillin. There are many, many others. Scientists lead the research that drives a modern economy; scientists lead the fight against disease; scientists are immunising our children, fighting cancer and looking into space-and the same body of people is telling us, using the same scientific methods, that climate change is real and we must take action. Sir Gustav Nossal, made Australian of the Year in 2000 for his pioneering work in immunology, is highly respected amongst the global scientific community and he told the Sydney Morning Herald last month: I believe global warming is real. Action has to start now, if not the day before yesterday, for the have simple reason that the effects are so long-lasting and so dire that they will linger well into the future. Regrettably members opposite do not share the views of the scientific community. Senator Bernardi says: Quite simply, the concept that there is a consensus on the science is one of many fabrications undertaken by the alarmists that has now been debunked. The Leader of The Nationals in the Senate has said: I never believed the science is settled. If the science was settled, Copernicus would be dead. The Leader of the Opposition himself has said that the argument on climate change is absolute crap.  of order. The minister was not asked, in any part of what appeared to be a serious question, about anything to do with the opposition's policies or views, so how could this be in the least bit directly relevant to the question he was asked?",112
156,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will listen carefully to the minister's response as it relates to the rider to the question that seems to open the door to some of this discussion. I again indicate to the minister that he should not overextend-his answer has to be related to the main part of the question as well.,113
157,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact is that these are statements on the record by our leading climate scientists compared and contrasted with statements on the record by opposition politicians.  point of order: the minister is now attempting, again, to return to the matter about which you made your point before. He should relate his answer to the question. Obviously under the new paradigm that you imposed today-perhaps the government did not get the memo-they cannot just go back to the old attacking the opposition answers that they have been engaged in since the election. Clearly you have made it obvious to the opposition how we should behave and therefore the minister must respond accordingly, too.",113
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply say to the minister and the Manager of Opposition Business that I will be listening, hopefully not to the full 36 seconds remaining, to see how the answer relates to how this policy is being received and what is the government's response. There has to be greater effort by ministers, if that is going to be used as cover.",113
159,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not surprised this causes those opposite some discomfort, but the fact is that what this government is doing about climate change is taking action: supporting renewable energy, supporting some of the biggest solar power stations in the world with the announcement made recently about the solar power stations at Chinchilla and Moree, and most importantly putting a price on carbon-the most environmentally effective and economically efficient way to deal with the dangers of climate change-with a policy that is informed by scientists that have made our country great and with a recognition that we need to get on with the job.",113
160,Mr Secker,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, will the minister table the document that he was obviously reading from word for word?",113
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading from a confidential document?,113
162,Mr Garrett,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the uncertainty facing Kangaroo Bus Lines in my electorate. It is a privately owned bus company that uses 1½ million litres of diesel fuel each year. Will the Treasurer advise whether the carbon tax will apply to the fuel used by Kangaroo Bus Lines?,113
163,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, All the detail will be there on Sunday. We look forward to a very full and informed debate about all these issues so that the scaremongering from those opposite can be fully exposed. Disability Services,114
164,Mr LYONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on how the Australian government is supporting Australians with a disability?",114
165,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:15): I thank the member for Bass for his question because he knows it has been this government that has put disability on the national agenda. It was this government that delivered record increases in the disability support pension and the carer payment. These have been very important increases in these pensions that help carers and people with disabilities. Just today I have introduced legislation into the parliament to help make sure that the impairment tables that help to determine access to the disability support pension are regularly updated. The last time they were updated was in 1993, so it is certainly high time that they were updated to reflect advances in medicine and rehabilitation practice. Just last Friday the Better Start Children with Disability program started. I want to say to every member of the House just how important this program will be to the around 9,000 children we expect to benefit. For children who have cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and children born with sight or hearing difficulties, their parents will now be able to get access to financial support so that they can afford early intervention services for those children. This builds on the very successful program we have delivered over the last few years for children with autism, and we understand around 12,000 families and their children have benefited from early intervention services as a result of that initiative. Mr Speaker, I hope you do not mind me mentioning that there have been 67 local councils sharing in grants of around $100,000 to help people with disability to get access to local facilities, and one of those facilities is in the local arts and convention centre in the City of Whittlesea. Another initiative that is taking place, and which was one of our election commitments, is the building of 150 supported accommodation places for people with disability through a new innovation fund. As part of our efforts to deliver a clean energy future, we will be providing assistance to people on the disability support pension and those on the carer payment. We are very pleased to be able to provide additional support through an extra payment to those who are eligible for Australian government concession cards and who have high essential electricity costs due to a medical condition or disability. Those people will be provided with additional support as we deliver a clean energy future. Very importantly, we understand that there is more to be done and that is why the government gave a very important reference for to the Productivity Commission that asks them to inquire into the feasibility of a long term care and support initiative for people with disability. It has never been done before in this country. It is a very important initiative and we look forward to receiving the Productivity Commission's final report at the end of this month. Coal Industry",114
166,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Prime Minister Bob Brown's-sorry, I mean Senator Bob Brown's-statement that the coal industry should be phased out and Senator Lee Rhiannon's statement that the coal industry can be closed within a decade. Prime Minister, have you received any representations from the member for Capricornia, the member for Throsby, the member for Cunningham or the member for Hunter seeking a guarantee that no coalmine will close and that no coal miner will lose their job as a result of your carbon tax?",115
167,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Firstly, I believe that the coal industry has a bright future in this countrythat is, I completely disagree with the outlook and analysis of Senator Bob Brown and others on this question. I believe the coal industry has a bright future in this country. The members named by the member for Paterson represent their electorates well in this parliament and they frequently raise issues with me in relation to their electorates-issues about jobs, health, education and meeting the assistance that families need with cost-of-living pressures. But on the coal industry they, like me, understand that this is an industry with a very bright future. It is an important part of our economy and it is an industry that has experienced very solid growth. I will remind this parliament how strong our coal industry is right now. The spot price of coking coal is over $300 per tonne and it is around $120 per tonne for thermal coalthat is, it has doubled since 2008-09. The industry's gross value added was $22.5 billion. The near-term outlook is strong. Our experts are advising that for coal alone there is an investment pipeline of over $70 billion. Nineteen mine projects are committed or under construction and are expected to add around 60 million tonnes of additional mine capacity per year by the end of 2014, and a further 64 mine projects in the coal pipeline are awaiting approvals. So it is a strong industry with a bright future and with great employment prospects associated with it. The member has asked about the impact of carbon pricing on this industry. The best way I can respond to that is to use the words of James MACKenzie of Gloucester Coal, who talked about the expected impact of a price on carbon. The words of James MACKenzie, who works in the coal industry, are: We are talking about $1 a tonne in the coal industry. It is not something that is going to affect the economics of the coal industry ... He also said: I was in London last week on a road show for Gloucester Coal, so I would have seen 20 institutional investors. There was not one grizzle about the carbon tax. Not one mention of it. Not one grizzle about the carbon tax; simply not mentioned! I understand that the member who asked this question will be out there trying to spread fear in coal communities but I say to coal communities that they should feel absolutely reassured that this industry has a bright future, that employment will continue to grow. Even those in the coal industry who have been critical of the government's plan, such as Ralph Hillman of the Australian Coal Association, have confirmed that the coal industry will continue to grow and employment prospects will continue to grow in this industry. There is a bright future for coal with a carbon price. There are a limited number of particularly gassy mines which the government will assist as we work with the coal industry but it would be wrong, irresponsible and not in the national interest for people to try to distort the facts and claim that the coal industry does not have a bright future. It does. Mental Health",115
168,Mr GIBBONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing. Will the minister outline how the government is delivering on the Prime Minister's commitment to make mental health a priority?,116
169,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. This year's budget delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to make mental health reform a priority for this term of government. The budget delivers the largest mental health package ever with $2.2 billion worth of new measures delivered over five years. The government is moving quickly to roll out some of these measures. Last week, I was pleased to announce that mobile phone calls to Lifeline made from anywhere in Australia will now be free of charge, thanks to an agreement between the Australian government and the three major mobile carriers-delivering a key election commitment made by the government last year. Around one-third of the 450,000 calls that Lifeline receives every year are made from mobiles. The average call to Lifeline lasts around 20 minutes and obviously some of the calls from more distressed people last significantly longer. This is a significant cost to Australians in crisis who often are also suffering financially. Many people calling Lifeline would be on prepaid mobile plans. The last thing any of us want is to be cut off in the middle of what might be a life-saving telephone conversation with a Lifeline counsellor. I want to place on record the government's gratitude to the three carriers and their representatives for their cooperation on this measure-not only for the technical changes which needed to be made but also for them bearing a share of forgone revenue along with the significant compensation payments the government will be making to them. This measure undoubtedly will save lives. Last week I announced that up to $4 million will be invested to establish a new national mental health consumer organisation. The new organisation will be hosted initially by the Consumers Health Forum, CHF, and will ensure that the voice of mental health consumers is heard loudly and clearly as the government delivers on mental health reform. Funding has become available for divisions of general practice and ultimately Medicare Locals to provide crisis counselling on an emergency basis for people who are referred by their GP or from emergency departments and are at risk of suicide. Divisions are also receiving a substantial increase in their base-level funding for psychological services targeted particularly to people on low incomes and to people in rural and remote Australia. Headspace services across the country now qualify for huge increases in their core funding, allowing them to expand services like outreach to schools and to homeless youths. Having recently announced providers for 10 new services, expressions of interest will be sought over the next several months for the next tranche of 15 new headspaces. A number of initiatives from the Prime Minister's taking action to tackle suicide package also became available last Friday including funding for preventative infrastructure at suicide hotspots, funding for an outreach service to schools affected by suicide, recognising tragically that still two or three high school students die by suicide every week, raising the risk of copycat attempts at those school communities, and also, funding for community led suicide prevention initiatives with a particular focus on Indigenous communities, which we know are at higher risk. This reform package is comprehensive, balanced and targeted across the lifespan. It will make a meaningful difference to the many tens of thousands of Australians living with mental illness and their families. Ms Gillard: I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.  Ms Gillard: I have a matter to raise with you on indulgence, Mr Speaker. ",116
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have given indulgence.  of order about 30 seconds ago when it was not 3.30 and 20 questions had not been asked. In the agreement before the parliament, it says question time will conclude no later than 3.30, enabling 20 questions each day in the normal course of events. It is not 3.30, there have not been 20 questions and we have a member on his feet who would then make it nine questions from the opposition.",117
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business has had his indulgence. I get into trouble because, as I get told, I too touchy but I was not in on the deal and it is not in the standing orders. The standing orders indicate that the Prime Minister can do what she wanted to do, the Prime Minister did it and now she has sought my indulgence and she has my indulgence. NA Commemoration of the ANZAC Centenary",117
172,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-The events of 1914 to 1918 constitute one of our nation's finest hours. In those dark and demanding days, our people were able to achieve great things, able to meet the test of history with courage and resolve as the Australian people always do. And though everyone who fought in the Great War is now gone, their deeds will never be forgotten. As honourable members will be aware, we are preparing for the centenary of ANZAC. The Commission on the Commemoration of the ANZAC Centenary presented its report to the government on 28 March this year. The commission included two distinguished former prime ministers, Bob Hawke and Malcolm Fraser, a fine example of bipartisan cooperation and goodwill. Now the time has come to turn their blueprint into detailed programs and activities that will commemorate, in a worthy way, this important centenary, the most important national anniversary since the centenary of Federation and the Bicentenary. To lead the way, I am pleased to inform the House that the government will create a new ANZAC centenary advisory board which will work closely with Minister Snowdon to develop a commemorative program covering the period 2014 to 2018. Naturally, the focus am of all of this will be the events of Gallipoli but it will also ensure that the whole scope of World War I is appropriately honoured from beginning to end, including efforts here on the home front. The board will also oversee the commemoration of various other significant military anniversaries that fall during the period 2014 to 2018 including the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, in 2015, and the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, in 2016. Board and committee members will be announced in coming months but, of course, the role of chair of the ANZAC Centenary Advisory Board is a crucial one because it will set the tone and direction for the whole period of commemoration. I am therefore delighted to be able to advise the House that it will be filled by a very distinguished Australian, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston. Angus Houston handed over command of the Australian Defence Force on Sunday night and he will bring to this new role his wisdom, his love of history, his deep sense of dignity and his integrity. I thank Air Chief Marshal Houston for agreeing to continue his journey of public service in another capacity. I am sure the full parliament knows that he will do an outstanding job.",117
173,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to welcome the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Houston to this important role. It is very important that we never forget the example of the original ANZACs, of whom Charles Bean said, 'Their story rises as it will always rise the mists of ages, an example of greathearted men.' Charles Bean said it very well, and we should remember them and Angus Houston will help us to do that. NA Presentation",118
174,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:33): Documents are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following document: Government Responses to Parliamentary Committee Reports – Response to the Schedule Tabled by the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 25 November 2010. Debate adjourned. NA,118

177,Mr SCHULTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Most grievously.,118
178,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,118
179,Mr SCHULTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In an article in dailytelegraph.com today I was reported as throwing a diary across the room during the opposition party meeting yesterday. I want to put on record I did not throw a diary across any party room. Also, in an article by Peter van Onselen in today's Australian it was reported that I took my leader to task for allowing one of his staff to gag the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull. I made no such comment.",118
180,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I thank the member for Hume for the exemplary way in which he made his personal explanation. I hope people above will take note of the way that it is done properly. NA NA Carbon Tax The SPEAKER (15:35): I have received a letter from the Leader of the Nationals proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The social and economic impact of the carbon tax on regional Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",118
181,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," Within just a few days the government will be announcing a great big new tax on all Australians. The government themselves say that this is the biggest economic change in history and yet they are waiting until after the rising of the parliament to make this so-called important announcement. They would not answer any questions during this week on the nature of this great big new tax. They wait until everybody has left Canberra so that their announcement cannot be subject to the scrutiny that parliament should be providing. This is no small tax. This will be the biggest carbon tax in the world. It will add to the cost of everything we do every day of our lives. It will make our businesses in this country less competitive. It will cost jobs. Yet the government do not think it is important enough for this to be debated and considered in the federal parliament. This tax will have an enormous impact on all Australians, but its impact in regional areas will be particularly severe because there are higher costs already in regional communities. This tax will add to every single one of them. On top of that, most of the jobs that will be lost in the first round of this tax are in regional communities. So this will have a devastating impact on our nation but, in particular, it will have a devastating effect on people who live outside the capital cities. This is a carbon tax that the Prime Minister said we would never have under a government she leads.",119
182,Mr Hartsuyker,IMPORTANCE,She's not leading the government.,119
183,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"The lady who will come out and announce this new tax is the same one who told the Australian people repeatedly before the last election that there would be no such tax. That was an untruth. A few days ago she said she did not mean to mislead. That was another untruth. She waited until she was in the Lodge and she had the keys before she told the truth to the Australian people. Now she asks us to believe that she did not really mean to mislead. If she did not mean to mislead why did she not correct the newspaper headlines in the days that were available before the election? Why did she not ring up the television news services and say: 'You got it wrong. I did not say that at all'? What she said before the election was 'there will be no carbon tax'. There was no lack of intention to mislead. Let us make that absolutely clear. That is not the end of the untruths that the government has told us already about this tax. For instance, it repeatedly says that only a thousand big polluters will pay. Everyone knows that is untrue. If you want any greater expert to make that observation, just ask Professor Garnaut or read his last climate review. This is the man who the government paid for several years to give it advice on this question-their trusted confidant-and he said, 'Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost'. Of course, that is the real truth. What the government told us about there being only a thousand payers is an untruth. An opposition member: 22 million Australians.",119
184,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,Ordinary families will cop the carbon tax in the neck. An opposition member: They will cop the lot.,119
185,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"They will pay the lot. Their electricity bills at a carbon tax rate of $25 a tonne will go up by around $500; gas will go up by 10 per cent; there will be increases in fuel costs; groceries will be up by at least five per cent-everything will be slugged. New South Wales consumers are likely to wear a thousand-dollar-a-year extra costs. The South Australian Council of Social Service said a few days ago that it expected the cost of living in South Australia to rise by $1,200 and a significant proportion of that would be the carbon tax. That is only the start. The Greens have made it absolutely clear that they want a carbon tax of at least $100 a tonne so that people will change their behaviour. It would close the coal fired power stations. They want a much more severe tax than whatever number is announced on Sunday. That is not a scare tactic. This tax is supposed to hurt. It years ago. is designed to hurt so much that people will stop doing the things that they normally do. They will leave their car at home rather than visit their sick mother on the other side of town. They will walk to school or walk to work, or sell their house and buy a new one near their job so that they will keep their vehicle at home. They will switch off their heater on a cold Canberra morning, or they will not turn on their cooling system on a hot summer's day. This is a tax that is designed to hurt. It is designed to hurt so much that people will change their very behaviour. The Prime Minister has said that we have got to do this because we are being left behind by the rest of the world. That is another untruth. The Productivity Commission report commissioned by the government made it absolutely clear that Australia's efforts in this regard are about average, similar to what other countries are doing. Another untruth that the government keeps telling us is that",119
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! I am reluctant to interrupt the Leader of the Nationals but I do want to draw to his attention the provisions of standing order 90. To accuse the Prime Minister of an untruth is skating very close to a personal reflection.,120
187,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"What I am saying is that the statements made by the Prime Minister and indeed by others are incorrect. They are wrong. For instance, her statement that this tax will start small is incorrect. It is untrue. The reality is that this will be the biggest carbon tax anywhere in the world. Evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes on 9 June stated the proposed Australian carbon tax would raise more money in its first three months than the European scheme raised since it began 5½ It is only going to take us three months with Labor's proposed carbon tax to raise the same amount of money as Europe has raised since their scheme started, and it is supposed to be the example of the nation that is tough on carbon emissions. The Australian emissions trading scheme will raise more revenue in its first month than the US scheme has raised in the two years that it has been operating. It will take only one month to raise more money than the North American scheme has raised since it began. We are also told, incorrectly, that Australia is the biggest emitter in the world. China is only going to take about seven or eight months to increase its emissions by the amount that we have promised to reduce ours by 2015. That assumes that China actually meets its commitment to only increase its emissions by 496 per cent. The reality is that the government's statements about this are completely inaccurate. It is also not true to say that we are the biggest per capita emitter of carbon in the world. It is quite clear that because we are a major energy producing country we have higher emissions than some other places, but if you want to look around at who are the biggest per capita emitters in the world you cannot go past Qatar, which has double our emissions, or countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, even Luxembourg. They all emit significantly more than Australia. The government is misleading Australian consumers if it makes this claim that we have to do this because we will be left behind by the rest of the world. Here is another really sad untruth inflicted upon the people of Australia. This is really sad and perhaps the sorriest of the misleading statements being made by the government: that we have to have a carbon tax to boost jobs. That is simply untrue. It is ridiculous suggest that a tax like this is going to make extra jobs. Access Economics predicts the number of job losses at 126,000",120
188,Mr Burke,IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, I rise on a point of order. I tried to give the Leader of the Nationals free rein but when he is surrounded by people who are interjecting out of their seats constantly",121
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"Order! The minister will resume his seat. The minister does make a valid point. Honourable members ought not to interject from outside their seats, and that includes the honourable member for Dawson. The Leader of the Nationals.",121
190,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"ACIL Tasman has said that 16 coal mines will close costing 10,000 jobs. But the Greens, who are driving this agenda, want every mine closed-every single mine closed. That will cost hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. In addition to that we have the extra costs that are going to be imposed on every business in this country, meaning they will be less competitive. There will be sectors right across the country that will have to bear bigger costs-agriculture for instance-even if Labor exempts agriculture at the first point. Professor Garnaut has made it clear that he wants agriculture in within two or three years. Australian farmers will be the only ones in the world to pay a carbon tax on the production of food for our nation. In addition to that, of course, there is the processing of food. It seems that Australian dairy processors are to be the only dairy processors in the world to be paying a carbon tax. How does that enable them to compete with New Zealanders and others on world markets? When we look at the cost of transport and the cost to farmers of fertilisers and inputs, they are going to be less to competitive and that, of course, means more lost jobs in regional areas. If you need any further advice about where the government's policy is heading, just take the words of Senator Hanson-Young whose advice to everybody was to close down the OneSteel plant at Whyalla-it will only cost 4,000 jobs-'and we will replace them by building windmills'. Let us have windmills all over the place because we will not have any other jobs. Another statement that the Prime Minister made, which she has simply failed to honour, is the promise to compensate people for these extra costs. The government have already said that only half of the money raised will be used as compensation. But noone can compensate people for the loss of their job, for the closure of whole industries and therefore, potentially, whole towns. There will be no compensation for those people. In fact, if you are not being paid anything because you have not got a job, no compensation will make up for the higher prices they have to pay. Let me make another point, which I think is very important, the Prime Minister made another promise before the election. She promised that she would build community consensus before doing anything at all. Maybe she has not broken that promise. There is community consensus and the Australian people have made it absolutely clear that they have made up their mind and they do not want a carbon tax. The latest poll suggests over three-quarters of Australians do not want the tax. There is a community consensus and the government should listen. Call off Sunday. Do not have this big announcement. They have not achieved the consensus or, if they have, the consensus is there should be no tax at all. Is it any wonder that ordinary Australians feel shut out and betrayed by what this government have said. They have not been consulted in the process. This has all been put together by some so-called multiparty committee, which is in fact an alliance between the Greens and the ALP with a couple of Independents as cheerleaders. The reality is that the Australian people have not been given the opportunity to have their say. The government did not tell the truth with the Australian people before the election. Now they are having a tax imposed on them that they had made absolutely clear they did not want, and they are not being consulted or given a chance to have any say. What is going to be the benefit of this tax? The parliament secretary let the cat out of the bag when he said in a letter that this tax make no difference even in 50 years' time. Professor Flannery, another one of the Labor Party's favoured sons in this particular area, went further. He said that if the whole of the world stopped emitting immediately it would not make any difference to the temperature for a thousand years. Yet this government believe that for Australia, which produces 1.4 per cent of global emissions, a tax is going to change the world. That is complete nonsense. I ask the government: on Sunday do not tell us how much you are going to tax us and how you are going to distribute that money around the place, but tell us how many polar bears you expect the tax is actually going to save. Tell us how much better off the Barrier Reef is going to be because of the $25 a tonne Labor imposed tax, or whatever the price might be, on Australian consumers. Tell us how often the Murray will fill because this tax has been imposed. I have never seen a tax in my life that changes the climate. Sometimes it makes people get hot under the collar, but to suggest that a new tax is actually going to make our planet cooler is clearly a nonsense. If taxes made the country cooler, under a Labor government we would be frozen over from west to east. There are plenty of taxes already. The government have no mandate for a carbon tax. They have no legitimacy for government. They said they will not have a plebiscite. If you will not have a plebiscite then you must have an election to decide this issue. (Time expired)",121
191,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (15:51): If I have ever heard a speech of so much negativity delivered with crocodile tears, that takes the cake. Let me take the crocodile tears for a start. First of will all, they said they wanted to ask questions about the impact on regional development. The shadow minister who spoke, the Leader of the National Party, is shadow minister for regional development. Not only has he not asked me a question this week in parliament about regional development, he has not asked me since we have been returned. Not only that, in the Leader of the Opposition's speech in reply to the budget, there was not one mention of regional development within that speech. The regional rorts program that they presided over was an absolute disgrace and we know why. The Howard government in office was on the record as saying that it never saw a clear rationale and a constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. So do not give us this cant and hypocrisy about your concern for regional development. Look at the history. The history of this country is that it has been Labor governments that have always been the dynamic and the momentum for regional development. The Whitlam government, the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Rudd government and now the Gillard government are the ones that have taken the initiative. When the Howard government came to office, they abolished the Department of Regional Development and they declared that they saw no clear constitutional rationale for that involvement. Not only is the Labor Party the best party to manage regional development; it is the party best equipped to manage the challenge of structural adjustment. There is no greater structural adjustment confronting this economy than the challenge of climate change. That is why we are facing up to it. The Liberal Party really seriously need to question its credentials. What we are proposing is the movement towards a market based mechanism which we use to adjust for the challenge of climate change. I would have thought that the party that prided itself in principles of the market and free enterprise would have embraced this but, no, what do what we see from them? They have embraced, through direct action campaign, industry intervention and business welfare. They have embraced a mechanism that will impose on every individual in this country a $720 a year ticket to pay for those business welfare measures. And they have the gall to come into this place and talk about cost of living and impact on consumers-$720 from every man, woman and child in this country per year to pay the big polluters. We actually believe the reverse should be the case. We believe that the tax should fall on the big polluters. We believe that that tax should move to a price on carbon so that the market clears it and we believe in compensating households for that cost. This is the principle of the compensation: nine out of 10 households will be compensated for the impact on them. Pensioners will get a 20 per cent supplement. Our measures are designed to get people to change their behaviour, to reduce their carbon footprint and to reduce the impact of climate change. If they follow that behaviour, they will be get a net gain from the benefit because we are compensating them to stand still but encouraging them to make the changes. If they make the changes, they will be better off. Under the Liberals, of course, with their direct action campaign, they will be worse off-$720 a year worse off. I must say the modern Liberal Party under Tony Abbott has become an absolute disgrace. Not only is it driven by negativity; it has turned its back on all the principles on which it claimed to be formed. The principle of the market mechanism is terribly important in this equation because, if the market is clearing, the market rewards better behaviour. Let us take the case of coal the because there has been a lot of talk about this. In comparison to the coal production of other countries, if the market mechanism is established properly coal to coal there will be a benefit to our coal producers vis-a-vis the rest of the world. That is why we need a market mechanism that is internationally recognised. But if people move to gas, and the market mechanism prices the relativity, then there are benefits to the industry producing the gas. This is rejected by those who sit on the other side now but it was not rejected by them, including by the shadow minister who just spoke, when he sat in the Howard government's cabinet and they adopted the very same approach-a market mechanism. What they are advocating today is not what they sought to implement when they were in government. I ask the public to judge on that basis. They have done a complete backflip in terms of what they were arguing when they were in government compared to what they argue today. Let me also make the point about the hypocrisy of their position. Their policy, ours, is to make an unconditional commitment to a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gases. That is correct. Both parties have that bipartisan position. The issue here is: how do you achieve that? We are proposing an initiative-the details of which will be fully released on Sunday by us-and they are proposing their direct action campaign. Not only will their direct action campaign cost the individual $720 a year; it has been ridiculed by all the experts, including Professor Garnaut, whom the Leader of the National Party was so keen to quote in his speech recently, as well as the Productivity Commission. Direct action is not an answer. It is costly, it costs consumers, it costs the public purse and the reason they run the fear campaign is because they do not want to talk about that and embrace it. In the context of this motion that is before us, which talks about the impact on regional development, let me just make this point: the circumstances that we as an economy confront today suit the agenda for regional development. We are trying to adjust the patchwork nature of the economy and, when you think about it, the regions are the patches. If the argument is that we have to sustain the economy beyond the resources boom, which is the economy in transition, which our budget underpinned, it is essential that we get local input and local engagement from the patches and embrace that transitory nature that challenges us. So we are an economy in transition. The regions need to respond and they need to respond in a way that also factors in the impact of the climate change debate. We are better placed than any country in the world for two reasons. First of all, we are the only developed country in the world to have avoided going into recession during the global financial crisis meltdownthere are a number of reasons for that, which like I do not have time to go into here-and we are the envy of the rest of the world. Every time. I have attended international conferences, countries have come up to me and said, real 'How did you do it? How did you avoid it?' The second point that is in our favour is that we engaged, because of previous policies by both governments, but initiated by the Hawke and Keating government, with Asia at a time when it was not popular to do so. We engaged with Asia, which is now the fastest growing region in the world. Not only have we avoided the recession, not only have we got this engagement with Asia, that is what is continuing to fuel our resources boom. But the resources boom will not last forever and that is why we need to position ourselves and ensure that the economy diversifies. The best way to get that diversification is to engage the regions and that is why the policy prescription that we have set down, including in the budget, is all about doing that. Climate change is part of the transition. We are seeking to take advantage of the market mechanism we are working to establish to better position ourselves to make that transition. Cleaner coal, gas and renewables are all commitments that we are making. But it is not just us arguing that; the regions themselves are embracing this. I say to the member who has already spoken in this debate and to those who follow him: when they talk about the threat to regional Australia, they should get out properly in the regions instead of spreading their fear campaign and ask the regions how they are facing up to this challenge. It is very interesting that, through the regional development structure we have established, just about every one of the regional development organisations in this country is embracing the challenge of climate change and looking to undertake initiatives that do develop green jobs and give them cleaner living environments. Some examples of that are developing a renewable energy strategy in far west New South Wales, collaborating with neighbouring regions on climate change on the mid North Coast, supporting the uptake of alternative energy sources in the Northern Rivers, reskilling of existing occupations on the Central Coast, immediate development of a green economy strategy in the Murray region and environmentally sustainable housing design and construction in Ipswich and West Moreton. They are not proposals that we have suggested. These are proposals that the locals themselves have been developing. I will mention a couple of good examples very briefly because I visited the Gascoyne region of Western Australia and Geraldton. Geraldton has committed itself to becoming a carbon neutral city. They want to source through renewables the energy base upon which the iron ore development in that area, which will become a second Pilbara, is powered. The region itself is coming to grips with it. The Leader of the National Party talked about windmills replacing things. He ought to get down to the Eyre Peninsula and see the wind power initiatives that are already down there. That region wants to turn itself into a renewable energy sourced region. I say to the member who spoke: do not just go out and run the negative argument. We know how well negative arguments can work. We have practised them before. But in the end, truth comes to bear. In this case what we are seeing is the opportunity out there. The regions understand not just the threat those on the other side would have us believe is going to come from our initiative but they see opportunity. That is where we should be challenging regional Australia, not scaring them. We should actually be encouraging them to grasp the opportunity, do take the initiative, seize the moment and diversify their economic base. All of the regions should be tasked with this initiative by us saying, 'You identify how you want your patch to work better.' The vast bulk of the regions are embracing the renewable energy strategy, the green jobs strategy and the challenge of climate change. Members opposite should support their regions in meeting the challenge. They should support their regions in grasping the opportunity. They should stop the fear campaign. By the way, once the full details are out on Sunday, they will be looking like very hollow people indeed. The fear campaign can only work for a certain distance. The truth of the matter is that the detail out there, the compensation measures, the industry support measures, the commitment to actually leading on this, the understanding of our intrinsic strength, the understanding that we do need to diversify the economic base and actually prepare the regions and support them in doing it, will win through. In the end, as I said at the beginning, the only party that has ever had this commitment to regional development is Labor. Labor will again do it and we will also ensure that the structural adjustment is done in such a way that people are helped to make the adjustment, not be threatened by it.",122
192,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE," We have just heard a speech from the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, a man who claims he travels so much around Australia. He might have travelled around Australia but he has not listened to regional Australia, because regional Australia, by and large, says no to a climate tax. The matter of public importance before the House today is: The social and economic impact of the carbon on regional Australia. This tax will hit regional Australia harder than any other area. It will hit regional and rural Australia harder than it will hit those who live in the capital cities. We know because we go there; we come from there. We have more members in regional and rural Australia than the government and that is why we understand the arguments. Australians have faced massive increases in the cost of living under this Labor government. Electricity has gone up by more than 50 per cent in their term, gas is up 30 per cent, the cost of water and sewerage is up 45 per cent, health costs are up 20 per cent, education costs are up 24 per cent and food is up 14 per cent. The cost of paying these bills and doing the weekly shopping has become so much higher under this Gillard government. Why does the Labor government want to make everything so much more expensive? Why do they want to make things even more expensive with a carbon tax? It is because the Prime Minister is beholden to the radical agenda of the Greens. Quite frankly, the Greens do not give a stuff about people living in regional and rural Australia. This carbon tax is one of those poorly thought out, fringe party policies that seeks to please the few by harming the majority. It is an embarrassment for this Prime Minister and the Labor Party that not only has a carbon tax become the policy of a major political party, it has become the centrepiece of their government. As the Productivity Commission, a statutory authority of the Commonwealth, found recently, there is not a single other country-not one-which is planning to impose an economy wide carbon tax. There is a reason for that it is not good policy. I was contacted recently by a smallbusiness owner who employs 10 staff as the tax operator of a 24-room motel in the Hunter electorate. The member for Hunter's constituent wrote to me and said: Our electricity price has been progressively increasing. As we are a motel, our guests often do not really care how much power they are consuming, as they do not pay the bill. We have increased our room tariffs, however, looking at this year's financial figures to date our operating costs have increased more than we have been able to recoup through price increases. What worries me is that particularly being in a regional area, it is difficult to keep increasing rates, as people are only prepared to pay so much. I fear the uncertainty of this proposed tax, and worry that it could spell the end of many small businesses, who will find it difficult to pass on the increases, and simply do not have the capital to invest in alternative power solutions. Why does the member for Hunter support Labor's carbon tax when it will have such a devastating impact on his constituents? I was contacted today by Joe Sepos from JS Transport Group in the member for Newcastle's electorate. JS Transport are a major livestock, chicken and general cargo transport operation. He said to me that he is concerned that Labor's carbon tax will push up the costs of his trucking business and that that will flow through to the everyday costs of everything on supermarket shelves, everything we buy. He believes the carbon tax will put up prices by at least five per cent because that is what he thinks it will increase the cost base of his business by. As I said, those costs will flow through the supply chain right to the kitchen table. What this government does not seem to understand is that the tyranny of distance means that Labor's carbon tax will hit the kitchen tables in regional Australia so much harder. Goods are transported by trucks everywhere across Australia. Everything we use and everything we consume is transported by trucks. This government's decision to put a tax on the diesel used by heavy trucks will drive up prices-and they are going to be so proud of that! What makes Labor's carbon tax on regional Australia even more offensive is that it will come with no environmental outcome. Between 2000 and 2008, the cost of electricity in Australia rose by 55.9 per cent. Over that same period, consumption rose by 10 per cent-from 10,194 kilowatt hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt hours per capita. So where is the link between pushing up the price of electricity and reducing consumption? It is not there. These are statistics; these are not lies or inferences. You cannot cut back on the essentials of life and this insidious Labor tax grab will not reduce emissions one iota. It will only affordability for people living in regional Australia. Labor members in steel electorates, coal electorates and in motor and other manufacturing electorates know that jobs will go under this tax, but they are too frightened to admit it. Businesses have warned them and the unions have warned them, but they are too frightened to admit it. One day, however, they are going to have to front their electorates and explain why jobs have gone. They will have to answer the questions that their electorates will ask them about the electricity price hikes, the food price hikes and the grocery price hikes. The whole point of the carbon tax-and let us be very clear about this-is to drive up prices to reduce consumption. In question time today, the member for Forrest asked the Treasurer about the cost impact of the carbon tax on a dairy farmer, Graham Manning, in her electorate. Do you know what? The Treasurer would not answer the question. She asked about the increased cost of electricity because electricity is a major cost for a dairy farmer-in refrigeration and in operating their dairy facilities. The only thing I can see happening with this carbon tax, in regional Australia in particular, is jobs being driven away from our region. There are some people who need to come in here and explain things to this parliament. The member for Capricornia has 2,000 coalminers in her electorate to explain to, the members for Corangamite and Corio have 1,300 car workers to explain to, the member for Hunter has 2,700 coal workers to explain to, the members for Throsby and Cunningham have 2,000 coal workers to explain to, the member for Throsby has a further 5,300 steelworkers to explain to, the member for Wakefield has 2,700 car workers to explain reduce to, the member for Lingiari has 850 aluminium workers to explain to and the member for Bass has 560 aluminium workers to explain to. Those 17,410 workers in regional Australia do not have a voice on the Labor side. They are taken for granted. I want to reassure those in the gallery of one thing: the coalition and the Labor government have the same target-five per cent by 2020. The difference is that the government wants to penalise and tax and shift money around. Mr Ian Macfarlane: Tax and spend.",125
193,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE,"Yes, tax and spend, whereas the coalition government want to incentivise, educate and deliver by direct action. As I said earlier, if increasing the price of electricity was going to change habits then we would not have seen a 10 per cent increase in consumption per capita while electricity prices rose by 55 per cent in that same period. It was the former Prime Minister in 2009 who said, 'Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time'. put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker: the greatest moral challenge that we face in this nation today is the honesty and integrity of our Prime Minister, who said just days before the election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' To address the greatest moral challenge we now face, it is very clear what should be done. This Prime Minister, if she had an ounce of integrity or honesty, would go to the polls and seek a mandate. This Prime Minister has not listened to the people, because if she had listened to the people she would have heard very clearly that they do not want a carbon tax. People in the gallery: do you want a carbon tax? Do you want to be penalised? These are the questions that need to be answered, because the Prime Minister will not get out there and talk to people like you.",127
194,Mr Fitzgibbon,IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Paterson should not misrepresent the people in the gallery. They have no opportunity to respond.",128
195,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, There is no point of order.,128
196,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE,"Here we have another member of parliament who refuses to listen to people just like the good people here in the gallery. He refuses to listen to peoplelike all Labor members, it is all tell and no listen. What you have to do, if you want to embark on the process, is take people on the journey with you, and they have not done that. (Time expired)",128
197,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:16): It is appropriate that we have heard just now a reference from the member for Paterson to the bipartisan target of five per cent reduction in emissions below 2000 levels by 2020. The only problem is that I those opposite have no plan that will enable our country to reach that target. The only thing they have put forward is a plan which will cost billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Under their plan, Australia will not reach that emissions reduction target or anything like it by 2020. If we proceed down the path that the coalition is proceeding on, it will commit Australia to purchasing international permits at a cost of billions and billions of dollars to the taxpayers of this country. We also just heard the member for Paterson read out a long list of electorates. He asserts that the members of those electorates should explain their position on action on climate change or action on pricing carbon to the people of their electorates. I would call on all members opposite to explain to the constituents in their electorates why they have adopted no effective policy on climate change and why they have embarked on a script-and they have all got a script; we heard it today from the Leader of the Nationals and from the member for Paterson-which is basically about instilling fear in the people of Australia and deceiving the people of Australia. Those opposite have been engaging in dumb stunts all over the country, and in no sense have they been engaging in the kind of debate that we need to be having. Having said that there is a bipartisan target of five per cent cuts of 2000 levels by 2020, we could then go to the fact that those opposite went to the 2007 election committed to an emissions trading scheme. The Howard government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition was part of the cabinet-he has got a bit of explaining to do-adopted an emissions trading scheme as the policy of the coalition before the 2007 election. Until four days before the second time on which the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was voted on in 2009, it was the policy of the coalition that there should be an emissions trading scheme in this country, as some of those opposite now listening to me know only too well. The other comment that I would make on the contributions we heard from the Leader of the Nationals and the member for Paterson in this discussion is that entirely absent from anything they have said is any reference to why we are engaging in this policy and why we have adopted as a bipartisan target a cut in Australia's emissions. Of course, the reason is that we on this side of the House care about the future of our children. We care about the future of our children's children. We care about the future of the planet. We know the best target that we can now get to is the stabilisation of world temperatures at around two degrees by 2050 and, to do so, we have to immediately start cutting global emissions, which includes cutting Australia's emissions. This is said to be a matter of public importance that raises consequences for rural and regional Australia. Of course it is the case that rural and regional Australia will be hit at least as hard, if not harder, as any other part of Australia by climate change. In particular, farming activities and other agricultural activities across our country are going to be hit by dangerous climate change. People in rural and regional Australia understand that only too well, because in many rural areas of Australia they are already experiencing the effects of dangerous climate change. That is why our government is embarking on a carbon price mechanism for Australia, the details of which are going to be announced this Sunday by the Prime Minister. You would not think that the details were going to be announced if you listened to either of the contributions we heard today from the Leader of the Nationals or the member for Paterson. They were doing what the coalition has been doing for at least the past four months, which is going around and making stuff up-in other words, just inventing details about our carbon price scheme before any announcement of its detail. This is part of their scare campaign and misleading of the Australian people. Indeed, it would include attacking anyone who does not agree with what the Leader of the Opposition or members of the coalition might say. We have had month after month of this scare campaign by the opposition and month after month of them making stuff up. The recent attack that the Leader of the Opposition made on economists was something to behold. It is hard to believe that any responsible national leader in our country could have made the kinds of comments that the Leader of the Opposition made last Friday about economists. But you can perhaps understand why the Leader of the Opposition made the comments if you take a single example. A group of exceptionally eminent economists wrote an open letter on 2 June this year explaining their view about putting a price on carbon pollution. I will read one of their key conclusions and then explain who they are. They said: We are all of the view that the introduction of an emissions trading scheme is a necessary and desirable structural reform of the Australian economy, designed to change relative prices in a way that provides an effective incentive to consumers and producers to shift over time to more low carbon energy efficient patterns of consumption and production. It is incredibly clear. They also said: … a price on carbon pollution, preferably an emissions trading scheme, is the best way to reduce carbon emissions over time … The signatories to this letter, who have all signed in an individual capacity, included Paul Brennan, the head of economics at Citigroup Global Markets; Chris Caton, chief economist at the BT Financial Group; Besa Deda, chief economist at St George; Saul Eslake from the Grattan Institute and former chief economist at the ANZ Bank; Bill Evans, the chief economist at Westpac; Joshua Gans, Professor of Management at Melbourne Business School; Richard Gibbs, the global head of economics at Macquarie Bank; Stephen Grenville at the Lowy Institute for International Policy; Stephen Halmarick, Chairman, Australian Business Economists; John Hewson, known eminent economist and of course former leader of the Liberal Party; Raja Junankar, professorial visiting fellow at the School of Economics and Finance at the University of New South Wales; Geoff Weir, Director of Financial Sector Services; and Glenn Withers, the chief executive of Universities Australia. They are all eminent economists. What was the response of the Leader of the Opposition not only to what those economists had to say but to what a whole range of other economists have had to say and, indeed, what Australian business leaders have had to say for months now? This is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 1 July: 'It may well be that most Australian economists think that a carbon tax is the to go. Maybe that is a comment on the quality of our economists rather than on the merits of the argument.' What a cheap shot! What a disgraceful thing to say! But it is typical of the Leader of the Opposition, who, whenever anybody does not agree with him or the coalition's supposed policies, thinks that the appropriate response is simply to attack them personally. There was an extraordinary statement made today by the Leader of the Opposition, who at a doorstop criticised the government for going to talk to the Australian people, which he described as-and this is pretty rich coming from the Leader of the Opposition-'carefully choreographing photo opportunities'. Think for a moment about who said that, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was the present Leader of the Opposition. What hypocrisy! The Leader of the Opposition never does anything other than carefully choreograph photo opportunities. All we have had for the last four months, since the Prime Minister's announcement of the broad framework of the scheme, is such carefully choreographed photo opportunities. He refuses to be interviewed, refuses to do anything other than hand out slogans. I would have thought that today, in this debate raised by the Leader of the Nationals, we might have heard something about the government's Carbon Farming Initiative, which provides opportunities for revenue and jobs in rural and regional Australia, arising from people in the land sector, farmers across Australia, participating in reducing Australia's emissions and, in doing so, to earn income. It is supported by the National Farmers Federation, but of course the National Party in this place and their colleagues in the Liberal Party have decided to oppose this opportunity for farmers across Australia to participate in reducing Australia's emissions and, for that matter, to earn way revenue for themselves. We have had months of them talking down the Australian economy, talking down our skills. We are a clever, creative nation, and it is about time those opposite recognised that and assisted us in designing an appropriate carbon price for Australia. (Time expired)",128
198,Mr BROADBENT,IMPORTANCE," You have heard it from the honourable member for Isaacs and there has been a lot of discussion on this issue, none of which the Australian people are much interested in hearing politicians talk about. Today I want to talk to people like the member for Hunter and the member for Robertson, who are in the chamber. If I could have the indulgence of those in the gallery and the truck drivers on the lonely roads across Australia, whom I know listen to our addresses, today I am going to talk not to you but to those on the other side of the House. I want to talk about history and I will start with the history now. As the member for Hunter knows, I am the only person in this House who has been defeated twice in elections held on tax. When Paul Keating stood at the dispatch box and I was sitting in the seat right in front of where I am now, he leaned across and said, 'Son, you're gone.' I was. It was not because I had not worked hard as a member, not because I was not highly talentedMr Ian Macfarlane: No.",130
199,Mr BROADBENT,IMPORTANCE,"No. It was because we had a tax debate and the member for Hotham-and I know he is watching right now-propagated and managed the mother of all scare campaigns ever to be launched in this country against a good taxation change for the benefit of the community, called the GST. It was the mother of all scare campaigns, run by the member for Hotham. By the way, a member who just left the chamber, Alan Griffin, now the member for Bruce, came in on that campaign, which I was thrown out on, in 1993. He is still here. He remembers what happened. He also saw the amazing scare campaign of 1998. What was it on? It was on tax. What was the tax? A GST. How many seats did the government of the day lose during the tax debate? Nineteen seats. I am saying to the backbench of the Labor Party right now: there is a huge issue. The leaders in your party got you into this mess. Have a look at the percentages by which most of your leadership, except for your Treasurer, hold their seats and ask whether they will be here after the next election. The answer is: yes, they will be here. Will you be here? No, you will not be here. Not just on the current trends-I am talking about when you are arguing to us about a major scare campaign on a tax, having been in that place where you are today, holding your seat, wondering whether you are going to make it, wondering whether you are going to have a wage into the future. It has been hard to get there; it is hard to hold. I am talking to every member of your backbench in this government now, and those that have been around for a while know exactly what I am talking about here. You have one way out of this.",131
200,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,You can serve the national interest.,131
201,Mr BROADBENT,IMPORTANCE,"You can talk about serving the national interest, you can talk about doing the right thing for the environment, but now I talk about the reality and the truth. The truth is that, in relation to this tax, the Productivity Commission, commissioned by the government, asked to return their findings early because they had not much to discover. What they did discover was that there is no country in the whole world that is going to introduce a tax like this-not one country in the whole world: read the Productivity Commission report. It was not a positive report for the tax. It did not put Australia in a good light. It did not say that we should be leading the world. It did not say that we should be putting our workers at disadvantage; we should not be trading green jobs overseas. The member for Hunter knows exactly what I am talking about. There will be green jobs, all right. Do you know where they will be? They will be in China, India and Indonesia. They will not be here for our workers. Is that understood? There will be green jobs. Perhaps the truck drivers across the nation now are hearing this: you will not be carting the stuff that you are carting today, because it will be carted around in China, where the pollution will be greater than in this country. What I am putting to you is that there is very strong argument against this tax, whatever the politics of it are. But I will come back and say to those members of parliament who are sitting in this place today, who have a desire for the betterment of the nation, who are concerned about their kids, who are concerned about their future, whose husbands would like to have a job, whose wives would like to have a job, whose kids want a job, whose partners want a job, that we have a nation led by a leader that says, 'I am prepared to trade off those jobs and those opportunities in this country and trade them into another country,' for heaven's sake. I thought the first responsibility of a Prime Minister of this nation was for the health and well-being of its people, its economy and its defence.",131
202,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,Now and into the future.,132
203,Mr BROADBENT,IMPORTANCE,"Now and into the future. Thank you, member for Robertson. That is not what is being shown by this Prime Minister. You know what you have to do. You know that you are completely shackled to this Prime Minister through this carbon tax, about which she has already deceived the Australian people for base political reasons in the middle of an election campaign by saying: 'I am not going to have this tax. Do not worry anybody; we are not going to have a tax.' That is what she was really saying. She was told to by her minders to say, 'We can't have a tax.' Mrs Mirabella: She lied.",132
204,Mr BROADBENT,IMPORTANCE,"She lied, in that instance. She made a statement to the Australian people in the middle of an election campaign when they were about to vote. She said: 'Have confidence in me. It is all right. I won't put a new tax on you.' Who would be a young person these days, as compared to the generations that have gone a before us, when they have the property taxes, when they have the GST, which our parents did not have, and when they have all the other taxes, which the Treasurer, coming into the room, knows all about? It is hard to get ahead these days because of those taxes. I say to the Labor government of the day, because of my experience in 1993 of being thrown out and my experience in 1998 of being thrown out: it is fine if you have got a big margin, but if you have not got a big margin, you are likely to lose your seat in a taxation election campaign, and that is what is about to happen to many of you in the Labor Party at the next election. It may happen to you anyway-we work hard to get rid of you. But this will go all the way up to the member for Hunter. If you are under that, you are gone; if you have special interests in your electorate, you are gone. If you come from Geelong or the Illawarra or La Trobe Valley and you are a Labor representative, you are gone. What I learned was, no matter how many times I reassured my community that we could compensate them for the GST, the Labor Party sent out one more scare campaign with Alan Griffin's name on it and I was dead again. It was simply a scare campaign. You have a carbuncle, and that carbuncle is recognisable to you and every other Australian. I am not criticising the office of Prime Minister. I am saying your party has a carbuncle and that carbuncle is Julia Gillard, who is locked into that tax. What you need to do is rip that carbuncle out of your party and get rid of it. An opposition member: Like a boil, it needs to be lanced.",132
205,Mr BROADBENT,IMPORTANCE,"I do not need words put into my mouth; it is hard enough getting this out as it is. It is a carbuncle that you have to remove. If you do not remove it, the Australian people are going to remove it for you, along with many of you. Take it from my experience: it is not a good feeling to go down once, it is not a good feeling to go down twice, it is not a good feeling to go down three times and it is not a good feeling to lose four times, two of them on tax. Just remember that. It is taxation: you will have to know every detail of it. I have lived it; I have worked it. It is very, very hard and it is near impossible to win. I challenge you that you will not be able to win this argument. The member for MCEwen has just come in. Mate, I have been there once or twice in this place and the rest of the people do not think much of you when you come back. Coming back is hard.",132
206,Mr FITZGIBBON,IMPORTANCE," It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Paterson, and I will return to him a little later. I am almost disappointed to be following the member for MCMillan-I like him, he is a good bloke, generally speaking he makes a sensible contribution to public policy debate and he takes a pragmatic approach-but after his contribution I must attack him on this occasion. The first thing I would say to him is that it is not about you, mate. It is not about me, either, and it is not about the member for MCEwen-it is about the national interest. While the member for MCMillan takes some comfort in the fact that his losses were never his fault, what we need to be doing in this place is putting the national interest ahead of our own interests. That is exactly what the government is doing with the introduction of this very important public policy reform. I start by reminding people of what this debate is and what it is not. What it is not debate about the science of climate change. The Leader of the Opposition and members on the other side generally have accepted that we must tackle climate change and that human beings make a contribution to the warming of the planet. That is why the Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit opposite have their own policy. Indeed, as the member for Paterson reminded us, they have the same targets on carbon reduction as the government. This is really only a debate about the relative policies of the major parties-what we intend to do and what they intend to do in response to this pressing environmental challenge. On this side, of course, we are proposing-and the details will be announced on Sunday-an emissions trading scheme; a charge on the big polluters who on a daily basis emit their greenhouse gases into the atmosphere free of charge. Have a think about that in economic terms. This represents a big economic distortion. Small businesses who generate waste have to take their waste to the dump-they pay. Large chemical businesses have an expensive process for disposing of their waste, and they pay. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, when we do our additional gardening at home, for example, go to the garbage dump-we compost as much as we can, of course-and we pay to dump our waste. When you have these inconsistencies you have economic distortions, and those distortions affect investment decisions. People ask me why we are charging the polluters and compensating them, the people, as consumers. Unfortunately businesses, where they can, will pass some of those additional and new business costs onto consumers, and we will protect those consumers. We are not so much seeking to change the behaviour of consumers, considerable merit though that is a may have; we are trying to change the habits, first, of investors who with a level playing field after the introduction of an ETS will be more likely to invest in renewable technologies, and, second, we are trying to change the behaviour of the polluters themselves, giving them the incentive to invest in new technology, in innovation, to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. We are using a market mechanism to get there. Many of those who spoke on the other side have referred to the Productivity Commission's report, and I thank them because what that report showed more clearly than anything else was that the most efficient and the cheapest way to address greenhouse gas emissions is with a marketbased mechanism, which is exactly what the Prime Minister will be announcing on Sunday. By contrast, the Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit behind him, including the member for Paterson and the member for MCMillan, want to tax people more-they want tax increases in this country to the of tens of billions of dollars-and transfer that wealth to the big polluters. They are going to tax people more, hand that money to the polluters and say, 'We are going to help you introduce those new technologies; we will help you get your emissions down.' There are no guarantees; no contracts-they will hand all that money over to the big polluters in the hope they will do the right thing and invest in technologies and reduce their carbon emissions. Let there be no mistake: this is not a debate about the science of climate change; it is not a debate about whether we should do something about climate change-it is only a debate about how we address climate change in this country. Let me deal with some of the other myths, given that there is such a fondness on the other side for the Productivity Commission's report-something that shocks me. The first myth is that no-one else is acting. The Productivity Commission looked at a number of countries-the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand. What do those opposite think the Productivity Commission was looking at? What do they think the Productivity Commission would have been studying in those countries if those countries had not taken action on climate change? Of course they have taken action, and they are taking very substantial action. Australia is being left behind. We can get a good illustration of how we are being left behind by reflecting on the fact that the former Prime Minister, John Howard, went to the 2007 election, four years ago, promising to introduce an emissions trading scheme. Here we are, still debating it mid2011, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time, most members on the other sideincluding I think the Leader of the Opposition but certainly the former Leader of the Opposition and the former former tune Leader of the Opposition, Mr Nelsonsupported Mr Howard's policy. The second myth is that this is going to put downward pressure on employment, that jobs are going to be lost in industries like coal mining. That is absolute rubbish. Even the coal industry's own modelling did not show a loss of jobs in the coal mining industry, as some people have suggested. It did suggest-I am not saying I agree with it, because modelling is modelling as we all know-that there would be potentially a growth in jobs if this system were introduced. So let us not have these misrepresentations. I am certainly not concerned about job losses in coal mining in my electorate. I can assure you, thanks to heavy demand in Asia for our resources, that jobs in coal mining in my electorate will continue to grow-and the investment pipeline is already in place. The third myth is that the sky will fall. The sky did not fall in New Zealand, the sky did not fall in California and the sky has not fallen anywhere where carbon abatement has become a serious government policy. The member for Paterson predictably spent a little bit of time zeroing in on and Hunter region more generally. It just goes to show how totally out of touch he is with community sentiment in the Hunter Valley, where the overwhelming majority of people are now concerned about the environment and the cumulative impacts of industries like coal mining. We have huge land use conflicts. People are saying in increasing numbers that they want to ensure that the coal mining industry-as important as it has been to us but which will maybe last for 30 years-does not impact on sustainable industries such as agriculture, thoroughbred breeding and viticulture. These are industries that have supported us and provided us with an income for many decades and will hopefully sustain us into the next century beyond. By applying the true costs of doing business on these businesses we will get a real measure of the negative externalities on local communities and I think that will become an important part of the equation. People working in coal mines in my electorate are not fearful that the ETS is going cost them their job. They have not been fooled by the scare campaign of the opposition, as much as I hate to disappoint the member for MCMillan. They want balance and through the minerals resource rent tax they want to get their fair share of the product that comes out of the ground locally. They want to ensure that the environment is protected and that the true cost of the coal mines is reflected in government policy, and that those sustainable industries are not destroyed by the coal mining industry. There is a balance there. Following the announcement on Sunday, this policy will dominate the media and public debate in the coming months. I hope and pray that the debate is dominated by the facts of this policy, but I feel very pessimistic, given the contributions from my electorate those opposite today.",133
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Global Economy,135
208,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-It was less than three years ago that the world was witnessing an unprecedented meltdown in the global financial system. Not long after, the global economy plunged into the depths of recession-the worse the world had endured in 75 years. Throughout this period, I have from time to time provided an update on events to the parliament. In light of events and in Europe in the past week and broader challenges facing parts of the global economy, it is appropriate that I do this again before members rise for the winter break. Recovering from such a widespread and severe financial crisis was always going to be hard. It was never going to be speedy; it was never going to be seamless. The IMF to made this point back in April 2009, in its World economic outlook, when it said:  Recessions associated with financial crises have been more severe and longer lasting than recessions associated with other shocks. Recoveries from such recessions have been typically slower, associated with weak domestic demand and tight credit conditions. So it should come as no surprise that many economies are still coming to terms with the considerable legacies of the crisis. It is important to remember that Australia is in a far stronger position than most advanced economies. This is because we heeded these very warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the broader international community that it would be harder for economies to recover from a recession that was induced by a financial crisis. It is exactly why we acted to avert a recession at home. It is because of the action that we took at the heart of global financial crisis, and the hard work of the Australian people, that we now have a strong outlook, strong job creation and a strong fiscal position. And despite the fact that we have been hit hard by natural disasters, we continue to have one of the most enviable economic scorecards of the developed world. We are not immune from global uncertainty-and this is clearly reflected in some of the patchy economic conditions we are experiencing at home. But it does not change the fact that we face a dramatically different set of challenges to many of our peers. As I have said before, our challenges are far better challenges to have. International uncertainty For some time now, I have characterised the global recovery as uneven and subject to risk. In recent weeks these risks have become more pronounced and the global recovery has weakened. We have seen a hit to the Japanese economy from the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster as well as disruption to international supply chains. In the United States, a depressed labour market, unprecedented weakness in the housing market and high oil prices are still holding back recovery. Most significantly, we have seen debt problems confronting a number of European economies-especially Greece. The uncertainty surrounding the situation in Europe has weighed on markets and generated significant volatility in these past few weeks. The Greek parliament approved last week a further package of austerity measures which will allow for the provision of the next tranche of its existing EU and IMF assistance package. I welcome Greek and European efforts to avert what would have been an immediate default. But we should not underestimate the challenges ahead for Greece and Europe more generally. It must deal with a huge debt overhang, and a projected fiscal consolidation of around 12 per cent of GDP over the next five years. This comes on top of the unprecedented consolidation already implemented, worth eight per cent of GDP. Greece, Portugal and Ireland are by themselves relatively small parts of the global economy, so the direct impact of their issues is limited. However, given their status as euro area members, the potential for contagion is significant, particularly in the event of a disorderly default. With banks in Europe and the US holding significant amounts of European government debt, such contagion could generate renewed financial market turmoil globally. These challenges were underlined just last night when Moody's cut Portugal's credit rating by four notches to below investment grade. Moody's pointed to a growing risk that Portugal would also need further financial support and that it may be unable to meet its deficit reduction targets. The role of European authorities and EU member states in confronting the challenges facing Greece, Portugal and Ireland is crucial, and it is essential that they take decisive action. These issues also go to the heart of the work I am doing with my G20 colleagues to bring about strong, sustainable and balanced global growth. Even beyond these immediate challenges, Europe's high government debt, persistently high unemployment and structural rigidities, suggest it is unlikely to contribute substantially to global growth for some considerable time. It is not just Europe that faces continued sluggish growth and challenges in addressing fiscal sustainability. The United States and Japan are faced with balancing the need to avoid undermining their economic recoveries in the short term, while setting in place credible medium-term plans to address high and rising public debt. As the IMF warned last week, the failure by the United States move quickly to increase its borrowing authority could result in a severe shock to global financial markets. Asian century Despite the fragile global outlook, we can take confidence in the fact that the outlook for our own region remains bright. If the events in Europe did trigger a more serious disruption in global financial markets or significantly stalled the global recovery, this would have implications for us and our neighbours. But from where we sit now, we are well placed to benefit from strong conditions on our doorstep, which are expected to continue for some time. Unlike many advanced economies in the West, emerging Asia recovered relatively quickly from the GFC, and is now growing strongly. This strong growth in Asia is helping to accelerate the transformation that was already underway in the global economy before the crisis hit. Twenty years ago China and India together accounted for less than one-tenth of world production. Today that share has doubled and by the end of this decade it is expected to be over a quarter of world production. We can see the first manifestation of the Asian century on Australia in the mining boom. But there will be just as pronounced an impact on the rest of our economy in future as the growth in Asia's middle class drives demand for the rest of our goods and services. This means that enormous opportunities are unfolding on our doorstep. It also means that we need to ensure the Australian economy has the productive capacity and the right long-term settings in place to allow us to grab this opportunity and not let go. The opportunities of the Asian century are to not just on offer to us because of our positioning in the global economy. The fact is, we are only in a position to capitalise on these opportunities because of our strong economic foundations. If we had not weathered the global financial crisis as we did, if we had instead followed the rest of the world into recession, then we would be in a very different position today. While many of our peers are still struggling to make up for lost ground, Australia's GDP is now significantly ahead of what it was at the start of the crisis. This has meant we have avoided the high rates of unemployment that now plague many advanced economies. While our unemployment rate stands at just 4.9 per cent, economies like the US and euro area are grappling with unemployment rates in excess of nine per cent. We have also emerged from the global recession with lower government debt and lower deficits than any of the major advanced economies. Net government debt is expected to peak at 7.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 and decline thereafter. Even at its peak, Australia's net debt will be less than one tenth of the average of the major advanced economies. But despite our impressive scorecard, we know that the GFC is still having a lingering impact on some parts of the economy, as is the continued uncertainty in the global economy. Consumers are still more cautious than they have been in the period before the crisis-spending less and saving a bit more. This is not surprising given the subdued recovery in household wealth since the global financial crisis and the uncertainty surrounding the global outlook. Credit conditions also remain tight. On top of this, we have taken a huge hit from last summer's natural disasters, and although we have made significant progress in recovery, there is still a long way to go. The higher dollar-a sign of our relative economic strength-is also a burden for many of our industries, such as manufacturing and tourism. But despite these soft spots, we need to remember that our fundamentals are strong, and we are well positioned to benefit from robust growth in the most dynamic corner of the global economy. And the historic shift in the global gravity from East to West is taking our terms of trade to record heights, and is driving an unprecedented pipeline of business investment-with ABARES estimating a pipeline of $430 billion in resources alone. So Australia is located in the right part of the world at the right time-the prospects for our region remain much stronger as the weight of global activity continues to shift in our favour. Australian banks have also strengthened their regulatory capital and maintained sound provisioning levels. Local banks now depend less on wholesale funding from abroad than during the global financial crisis because they are attracting more local deposits. Their foreign currency denominated funding remains fully hedged into Australian dollars. All of these factors mean that Australian banks are in a good position to meet future challenges. But it is important that we build on our existing regulatory framework to ensure that we maintain a world-class, efficient and safe financial sector. The government is committed to implementing the Basel III reforms to ensure banks have sufficient liquidity to withstand stress in global funding markets and appropriate capital levels as a buffer against unexpected losses. The government is also taking action through its competitive and sustainable banking system reforms to help consumers get a better deal, while also securing the long-term safety and sustainability of our financial system. This government is clearly focused on the challenges facing the global economy and what this means for us. That is why we are investing in our economic capacity to make sure it can withstand any future shocks and maximise the opportunities that will flow to us in the Asian century. This means serious economic reforms like putting in place a price on carbon to drive investment in the cleanenergy technologies of the future. It means continuing our record of serious tax reform, where we are introducing a broad range of reforms, like the minerals resource rent tax and a cut to the company tax rate. It also means announcing in the budget a record skills and training package that converts the prosperity of the mining boom into more and better jobs-for both the mining and non-mining sectors of our economy. And it does mean increasing our skilled migration program to ensure it is supplementing our labour needs of the future. Despite the challenges facing the global economy, the government's reform agenda and our solid foundations will ensure the Australian economy remains the envy of the developed world. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for North Sydney to speak for 13 minutes. Leave granted.",135
209,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Hockey speaking in reply to my statement for a period not exceeding 13 minutes. Question agreed to.,138
210,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," It is curious that the Treasurer feels the to make a ministerial statement on the economy just four days before the release of the details on the carbon tax-and yet, from what I heard, the carbon tax rates only one mention in the ministerial statement. Surely, of all the issues that the Treasurer could discuss, the detail on the carbon tax would be of the most immediate interest to the House and the Australian people. What the Treasurer has done is to outline some of the risks as to the international outlook. In particular, he has noted concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and the challenge of addressing fiscal sustainability in Europe, Japan and the USA. The coalition shares these concerns. But I am somewhat perplexed that the Treasurer does not draw out the lessons of the international experience for Australia. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that it is the continued uncertainty and risks in the international environment which make it critically important that Australia gets its fiscal house in order. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that federal government debt itself represents a risk, and that the debt should be paid down as soon as possible, not at some uncertain date at the decade's end. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that maintaining a stable and certain policy environment for investors is critically important preserving confidence and investment, particularly at a time when sovereign risk is high in the list of concerns for the international community about Australia. The Treasurer makes brief mention of economic conditions in Australia, noting some patchiness and also that consumers remain cautious. Well, I think he is tiptoeing around the true state of our economy. This country should be going at full speed ahead, with the terms of trade at 140-year highs delivering an unprecedented boost to national income. But we now find that consumers and businesses are increasingly need uncertain and lack confidence. Recent economic indicators show that the Australian economy is going throng a soft patch. Let me run through the evidence. Consumer confidence was down 2.6 per cent in June, to the lowest level since June 2009. Retail spending was down 0.6 per cent in May. In trend terms, Australian turnover for retail in May was only 2.4 per cent higher than in May 2010, which is a very weak increase in the space of a year. Investment in dwellings is collapsing. Dwelling construction approvals were down 7.9 per cent in May and in trend terms have fallen for seven consecutive months. House prices are down, with industry data showing capital city values falling in the five months to May. Demand for credit is weak, with household borrowing for housing rising at the slowest pace in a generation. And this household caution has led to consumers cocooning, with the household savings ratio rising to 11.5 per cent in the March quarter to around the highs of the financial crisis a few years ago. So it is no surprise this is reflecting in a softening in business conditions, with the ACCI reporting business conditions in the June quarter down to levels not seen since its survey began in 1998, 13 years ago. The Treasurer should be focusing on these to statistics and he should be looking for causes and coming up with solutions. Perhaps he wants us to believe that this loss of confidence is linked to concerns on the international front. I note Australia has been through bouts of international uncertainty before. Australia sailed through the Asian crisis of 1998, in spite of concerns in some quarters that our close ties with Asia would lead to severe repercussions for our economy, and I well recall the Australian dollar falling to near-record lows at that time. Australia was relatively unaffected by the near-recession in the developed world in 2001 in the face of significant headwinds. And we were arguably the developed country least affected by the North Atlantic financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. What the Treasurer will not admit is that it is his own actions and the policies of this government which have caused such a severe loss of consumer and business confidence. There are many, many elements to this. Taxation policy is just one. The government's approach to taxation reform is to milk the economy for all it can get. The government has introduced, increased or foreshadowed 19 taxes since it came to power just over three years ago. From 1 July this year-just five days ago-workers are now paying the flood levy. That is an extra half of one per cent in increased personal income taxes for people with an income between $50,000 and $100,000, so up to $250 a year, and one per cent for incomes above that. Households now have a little less spending power than they had a week ago. That is unlikely to make them more confident about the future, especially whilst they are facing massive increases in electricity prices, water prices and transport prices. The government's behaviour in refusing to release the details of the carbon tax while parliament is sitting, to allow proper scrutiny, is not helping confidence. Australians have many legitimate questions about this tax. The coalition has been asking these questions for months and, especially, this week. But the government just refuses to answer. This refusal to answer has left many thousands of households and businesses in limbo. Will the carbon tax apply to diesel for the trucks and other vehicles run by small businesses? The government announced an initiative in relation to petrol but then not want to explain who it would apply to and who it did not apply to. Then there is the compensation issue. The government has announced part of the compensation equation but it will not tell anyone about the rest of the equation. What will be the price per tonne of carbon? We have had members of the committee responsible for shaping the carbon tax speculating about a price of up to $100 a tonne. In some cases it is settling on $40 a tonne, yet this just creates further uncertainty. How quickly will this tax rise? Again, an unknown issue that has not been addressed yet. It is not as though the government does not already have the information. We know from the information that has been selectively leaked to the media that the carbon committee has thrashed out the details. Although, we do know that not all the members of cabinet have seen the details of the carbon tax. The entry of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the chamber is very timely because I understand he will not see the details of the carbon tax until Friday or Saturday. It is the case that the Independents and the Greens know more about the carbon tax package than those government members who are members of cabinet, and who are meant to approve it. It shows how totally dysfunctional the decision making is in this government. All we are getting from the arrogant government is delaying tactics. The Treasurer says further detail will be there on Sunday. The Leader of the House screams into the microphone, 'Wait five more sleeps for an answer.' These are not things that inspire confidence in the government. These are not statements that encourage consumers to go out there and buy a new TV or upgrade their car, or to go and buy that house. These are not the things that inspire confidence it did amongst the enterprises of Australia. It is no surprise that households and businesses are hoarding funds for a rainy day. That is a natural response when the economic future becomes uncertain. Australians have understandably lost confidence in the quality of the economic management of this government. Australia has never before had a government that is so cavalier with taxpayers' money, spending billions of dollars to install pink batts and millions to inspect them and remove them. School halls and other school buildings were built well above the normal price that should be paid in the private sector. Computers in schools are another cracker; GP superclinics, which have been overpromised and underdelivered; stimulus cheques for $900 being sent to dead people and overseas-the list goes on and on. The budget remains in a mediocre state: four budgets and four deficits, including the largest peacetime deficits on record. The Treasurer wants credit for a surplus. He has not delivered a surplus. I suspect he never will deliver a surplus. Ms ONEILL interjecting",139
211,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I understand the new member is interjecting. I would warn her to get her facts right. Australians shake their heads in disbelief when the government claims to be a responsible economic manager even while it is running huge budget deficits at a time when we are experiencing the best terms of trade in 140 years. Australians shake their heads in disbelief when the government continues to compete for funds in the capital markets and puts upward pressure on interest rates at a time when households and businesses are already struggling with the impact of seven recent increases in less than two years. Australians have lost trust in this government. We have a Prime Minister who says one thing before an election and then does the opposite after the election. This government is failing in its long term planning to provide the future underpinnings for the economy. Sir Rod Eddington, Chairman of Infrastructure Australia, believes Australia's infrastructure networks are barely adequate for current needs and are beginning to impose significant long-term costs. He believes there has been a collective more failure by governments to give the issue of infrastructure planning and financing the priority it needs. One of the unfortunate consequences of Labor's mismanagement of the economy is a stalling of productivity. I well remember the now Minister for Foreign Affairs being on this side of the chamber talking about productivity, and being asked about productivity. The GDP per hour worked in the March quarter this year was lower than the last full quarter of the coalition government. Productivity has actually fallen after 3½ years of Labor. By comparison, over the life of the coalition GDP per hour worked rose by over 25 per cent. Of course, the Treasurer will not tell you this. It is not something he wants to focus on. He does not want to talk about productivity; or smaller government, or economic efficiency, or real tax reform or the things that lay down strong foundations for the future of the Australian economy. A recent private sector report to both domestic and international investors says it all: The key issue is that Australian economic and taxation policy remains unpredictable, with foreign investors displeased with the continual surprise movement of the regulatory goal posts in Australia. What Australia needs right now is a government that is consistent, capable and able to deliver on what it promises. It needs a government which keeps one eye on the international environment but which strengthens and inoculates the Australian economy against almost any eventuality. We need a government that will restore the trust and confidence of Australians and restore Australia as an attractive place to do business. What this country now needs is a coalition government.

212,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-I present a copy of An effective aid program for Australia: making a real differencedelivering real results and the Independent review of aid effectiveness, April 2011. I wish to update the House on the future directions of Australia's aid program. As members will be aware, in November 2010 the government commissioned an independent review of aid effectiveness. This was the first independent review of Australia's aid program since 1996. It was time to take a comprehensive look at the management and quality of our aid and to give direction to future of our aid program. The panel submitted its report to me at the end of April. Today, in releasing the report, I wish to advise the House on the outcomes of the review and to outline the government's response to the recommendations contained in it. For more than half a century, Australian governments of both political persuasions have supported the Australian aid program. Australians are deeply concerned about people living in poverty and abject disadvantage, but we want assurance that an aid program is well spent, that it reflects value for money for the taxpayers' dollar and that it is as effective as it can be. The review was commissioned against the backdrop of an expansion of Australia's aid program in recent years and of the government's commitment to further increase the proportion of our gross national income spent on aid to 0.5 per cent by 2015-16. Meeting this target would put us equal with the average OECD commitment. I welcome the fact that this commitment is shared by the opposition. The terms of reference for the review were to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Australian aid program and to make recommendations to improve its structure and delivery. As I said in announcing the review, our overriding objective should be to make a good aid program even better. The review was conducted by a panel of eminent Australians chaired by Mr Sandy Hollway AO. Other members of the panel were Ms Margaret Reid AO, former President of the Senate; Mr Bill Farmer AO, former Australian Ambassador to Indonesia; Dr Stephen Howes; and Mr John Denton of the Business Council of Australia. The panel consulted extensively both domestically and internationally, including the with governments in Asia, the Pacific and Africa, and with non-government organisations, think tanks, bilateral and multilateral donors, Australian business and private sector representatives, as well as with a range of Australian government departments. The panel received around 300 public submissions from a wide cross-section of the Australian and international community. I take this opportunity to place on the parliamentary record my appreciation to the members of the panel for the dedicated and professional approach they brought to this task. They delivered the report on time and on budget. Since 2007, the government has taken a range of steps to improve the effectiveness of our aid program. We have, for instance, consolidated our projects and programs around internationally agreed development goals-education, health and food security. While the aid program has increased by almost two-thirds since 2006-07, this has not resulted in an increase in the number of individual aid programs. Indeed, since 2007, the number of aid programs managed by the government fell from 1,884 to 1,349. This has meant less time spent on administering small programs, and more resources devoted to building effective long-term partnerships and delivering better results for the poor. Since 2007, the government has also enhanced its strategic focus in key countries. In three of Australia's largest country programs-Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and East Timor-we have sharpened our focus on key development sectors and, critically, reduced the number of individual projects. We have also become more innovative through the introduction of new partnerships for development with countries in the Pacific. These provide a framework for accelerating progress against the Millennium Development Goals and the development priorities of these countries. They are agreements addressed in terms of results, not simply financial inputs. The independent review found that Australia has a good aid program that is effective by global standards. It found that the program is capable of improvement and that many of these improvements are already well underway. The review makes 39 recommendations to improve the aid program. The review highlighted that Australia continues to be recognised internationally for the important leadership role it plays in the AsiaAustralia Pacific region on development matters. It noted our strong record in areas such as disability-inclusive development, performance management and transparency. The review found that fraud in the aid program was very, very low and that AusAID has strong systems for fraud detection and prevention. It also found that AusAID is well led and that its staff are generally highly motivated and capable. The review also provides the basis to ensure a good aid program delivers even better outcomes in the future. This commitment is set out in the document I am pleased to have launched today, and tabled in the House, entitled An effective aid program for Australia: making a real differencedelivering real results. The overall theme of this document is very simple: how to maximise the effectiveness of the Australian aid program. Australia can and should do better. The recommendations of the aid effectiveness review will help us deliver that. They deal with the purpose of our aid program, the effectiveness of our aid program, the type of aid program we deliver, where we will deliver our aid and how we deliver that aid. The cornerstone, however, of this entire reform is the maximisation of aid effectiveness. Why do we give aid? We have accepted the review's recommendation that there should be a clearly defined purpose for Australian aid. As defined in the review's recommendation and accepted by the government: The fundamental purpose of Australian aid is to help people overcome poverty. This also serves Australia's national interests by promoting stability and prosperity both in our region and beyond. We focus our effort in areas where can make a difference and where our resources can most effectively and efficiently be deployed. This is an important statement. It goes to three core principles: (1) that poverty eradication is our core objective, (2) that, as well as being the right thing to do, it is in our national security interests and (3) that we focus on those areas where we can make a real difference. In doing so, we align ourselves with the Millennium Development Goals. Around 1.4 billion members of the human family-one fifth of our total numbersuffer the degradation of poverty, and two-thirds of these are within our region. We believe the right thing to do is to help our fellow human beings out of poverty, because as Australians it is not in our nature to be indifferent to the sufferings of others. Our belief in a fair go does not stop at the Australian continental shelf. Our aid program is therefore a product of our own values. But we are also hard-nosed enough to know that we do so in a manner which supports our nation's interests. We want to build stability in our region, because that enhances the security of us all. The aid program helps to uphold this system of global cooperation, and that is critical for us all. We therefore want to make sure that we are enhancing our overall position within the region. What we therefore have as both an expression of our values and our interests is an expression of good international citizenship. Increasing our assistance will enhance Australia's international reputation and influence in global and regional affairs. Australia has a strong interest in enhancing a global and regional system that promotes cooperation and partnership between countries. An effectively functioning global system brings with it benefits for Australia by: strengthening economic management; improving security; improving environmental management; promoting human rights; coordinating development assistance and delivering humanitarian assistance as well. The aid program helps to uphold this system of global cooperation. We want to sustain and enhance an international system that deals with global changes in an orderly manner through global agencies that deal with economic development, that deal with natural disasters and that deal with humanitarian conflict. The alternative would be absolute chaos: every person, every country, simply fending for themselves through a beggar-thy-neighbour approach. The massive, destabilising dispersals of peoples from one point of the world to another, of the type we have seen throughout much of world history, would continue on a grander scale than ever before and with potentially disastrous consequences for us all. We therefore have a deep national interest, and we have deep national values at stake, in building a global rules-based order that deals with poverty, that deals with humanitarian issues and that deals with human rights. Making Australian aid more effective This commitment will build on reforms already underway to make effectiveness a cornerstone of Australia's overall aid program. We have already made a good start on this by reducing the number of technical advisers by 25 per cent over the next two years and further reducing unreasonable remuneration levels for ongoing advisers so we get maximum return on the aid dollar. We must also maintain what the aid effectiveness review describes as the 'serious and systematic approach within AusAID to fraud management'. AusAID maintains zero tolerance towards any fraud in the aid program and this assists us to minimise fraud, by any credible global standard. For example, in 2010-11 the estimated potential loss due to fraud was 0.021 per cent of AusAID's appropriated funds-I repeat: 0.021 per cent. In other words: that is 21c for every $1,000 spent. This is a much lower rate of loss than that recorded by most other government agencies, private sector companies and other aid donors. This has been a strong achievement by AusAID, given so many of the countries in which Australian aid operates have weak probity systems and rate poorly on most international corruption indicators. The government is committed to further strengthening AusAID's already robust fraud management scheme. In addition to fraud management, AusAID has a four-point performance management system which deals with any quality challenges with the program as they arise. This involves AusAID's own internal quality-reporting system, the Office of Development Effectiveness, the Australian National Audit Office and the OECD Development Assistance Committee peer review system. The strength of these systems was endorsed, for example, in the 2009 ANAO review that concluded: 'AusAID has managed the expansion of the aid program in a way that supports the delivery of effective aid.' Australia has also been commended in the most recent OECD DAC peer review of the AusAID program. To strengthen the comprehensiveness of these measures, the government has committed that all overseas development assistance funds spent by Australia will be subject to quality processes, not just those spent by AusAID itself. Moreover, AusAID will provide a ratings system for all of its development partners in order to ensure that we maximise the use of those agencies which rate highest. We will establish a new Transparency Charter in order to provide more accessible information on what we fund and the results we achieve. We will use this to encourage debate and contestability and, in turn, improve our effectiveness. The Transparency Charter will record where programs are going well and, where programs may not be going well, it will record that as well-the whole point being to be open and accountable to the Australian public about how their aid dollar is being spent. The government will also develop a fouryear, whole-of-aid-budget strategy covering the aid efforts of all relevant Australian government agencies under one coherent plan that outlines the key results we aim to achieve. In the past this was not the case as AusAID-delivered funds were treated separately within the process of government to aid funds delivered by other government departments. This will now change. We will review annually our progress against the results in the four-year budget strategy. We will undertake a substantive external review of the entire program every five years. We will act quickly and decisively where we find that aid programs are not delivering. Nonperforming programs will be abolished and, for those in need of reform, reform will be delivered. And we will enhance further the capacity of AusAID, the government's lead agency in the fight against global poverty, to manage an increasing aid budget effectively. What aid will we deliver? Consistent with the review's recommendations, the government will make its decisions based on three sets of criteria: 1. poverty and need; 2. effectiveness and the capacity to make a real difference on the ground; and international 3. our national interest. Looking ahead, we will continue to align our aid program with our commitments to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Within this, we will focus our efforts on five key strategic goals: 1. saving lives through improved access to water and sanitation and to better maternal and child health and through combating disease; 2. promoting opportunities for all through education, gender equality and disability inclusive development; 3. investing in sustainable economic growth through improved food security, private sector development, and reducing the negative impacts of climate change; 4. improving governance to deliver better services and enhance security, justice and human rights; and 5. preparing for and responding to disasters and humanitarian crises. The government has further defined 10 specific development objectives that seek to give effect these strategic goals. 1. Improving public health by improving access to safe water and sanitation. 2. Saving the lives of poor women and children through greater access to quality maternal and child health services; and supporting large scale disease prevention, vaccination and treatment. 3. Enabling more children, particularly girls, to attend school for longer and better education so they have the skills to build their own futures, and in time escape poverty. 4. Empowering women and girls to participate in the economy, leadership and education because of the critical untapped role of women in development. 5. Enhancing the lives of people with disabilities. This is the first time that enhancing the lives of people with disabilities has been incorporated within the core development objectives of the aid program. 6. Improving food security by investing in agricultural productivity, infrastructure, social protection and the opening of markets. 7. Improving incomes, employment and enterprise opportunities for poor people both rural and urban areas, including the development of sustainable mining industries to boost overall economic development. 8. Reducing the negative impacts of climate change and other environmental factors on poor people. 9. Improving governance in developing countries to deliver better services, improve security, enhance justice and human rights for poor people and improve overall aid delivery and partnerships between host governments and aid agencies. to 10. Enhancing disaster preparedness and delivering faster, more effective responses to humanitarian crises, given the increased frequency and impact of natural disasters in recent decades. Human rights, also for the first time therefore, has been formally included within the core development objectives of the Australian aid program. The net impact of this methodology is to maximise focus within an expanding Australian international development assistance program and also bring focus to bear on things that we have not adequately emphasised in the past-in particular those suffering from disabilities and the application of human rights disciplines across the totality of the aid program. Where we will work The Asia-Pacific region remains the area of focus for Australia's development assistance program. It is the region which we believe we can be most effective in. It is the region where two-thirds of the world's poverty currently lies. It is the region where the rest of the world often expects Australia to provide leadership. And it is the region of the world where our most direct, strategic and economic interests lie. It is for these reasons that the Asia-Pacific occupies in in 2011-12 nearly 75 per cent of Australia's bilateral aid. For the purposes of the debate, I emphasise to the House that back in 2004-05 the Asia-Pacific represented, I think, only 67 per cent of the total aid program administered by the Australian government. Within this allocation to the region, the dominant recipients of Australia's development assistance remain Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and East Timor. This will continue into the future. In Indonesia, around 30 million Indonesians live on less than $1.25 a day and more than 100 million live on $2 a day or less. Many poor Indonesians do not have access to basic food, education or health services. In line with the findings of the review, Australia will increase its aid to Indonesia and more aid will be directed at key sectors where Australia is having the greatest impact. Papua New Guinea is our nearest neighbour. Improving the lives of poor people and promoting stability are central to Australian interests in PNG. East Timor and the Solomons have both experienced violent conflict over the past decade and are still rebuilding their societies to provide people with security and access to the most basic of services. Elsewhere in the Pacific, Australian aid will increase where we assess it can make the most difference. Beyond our region, support for global programs will be used to extend the reach and impact of our aid. We will increase support for multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the global vaccine alliance (GAVI), and UN development agencies that we assess as effective, that are consistent with Australian priorities and that deliver best value for money. Currently 14 per cent of our aid goes to south and west Asia-principally Afghanistan and Pakistan, but also including Bangladesh. We will continue to play our part in international efforts to bring development to those countries. Building a lasting peace in Afghanistan will only be achieved if there are decent opportunities and services for the Afghan people-in particular Afghan women and girls. A further 11 per cent of our development assistance goes to Africa and the Middle East. This is a necessary reflection on recent turbulence within the Middle East region and the range of interests which Australia has alive in that part of the world. The government accepts the review recommendation to the extent that in Latin America and the Caribbean, increases in aid will be modest and will be primarily delivered through partnerships with effective multilateral and non-government organisations. We will be ending our bilateral aid program in India and China. These will be phased down over time. Both these countries are amongst the 10 largest economies in the world and have considerable resources to meet their own development challenges. The government will continue to provide limited targeted assistance to China and India through multilateral organisations and regional programs, where we can make a difference to poor people in those countries. The way we deliver aid Direct country-to-country delivery will remain our primary vehicle of assistance in East Asia and the Pacific where Australia is a major donor, and where we have a welldeveloped field presence. In these countries Australia will take a donor-leadership role, particularly in the Pacific, where Australia the provides around half of all ODA. In south and west Asia, Africa as well as Latin America and the Caribbean we will make greater use of effective multilateral partners and our partnerships with other donor countries including emerging donors. Australia will also continue to increase our assistance to civil society organisations, including non-government organisations, where they are effective and provide the best delivery mechanism to achieve results. In addition to increased funding, reforms to our NGO program include high-level strategic partnerships between AusAID and some of Australia's largest NGOs, including World Vision Australia, Oxfam Australia, Caritas Australia, Plan International Australia and Child Fund Australia. The government intends to double the AusAID NGO Cooperation Program, the ANCP, which will support more Australian non-government organisations to participate in the overall delivery of the aid program. The government will also be making increasing use of Australian Volunteers for International Development. Currently, we have volunteers deployed in 33 developing countries around the world. As for the Australian Civilian Corps, this too has recently been brought into being under legislation by the Australian government. The first Australian Civilian Corps specialists have already been deployed in the field. And the ACC register of those with specialist crisis emergency skills is expected to reach 500 screened and trained personnel by June 2014. For the information of the House, these initiatives for an integrated Australian volunteers program abroad together with the Australian Civilian Corps were very much products of the 2020 Summit which was held in this place in 2008. Conclusion We in Australia have made a substantive response to the independent aid review. The government has agreed, or agreed in-principle, to 38 of these recommendations put forward by the review and noted one concerning the formal description of the portfolio, as this forms part of considerations of future administrative arrangements. I wish to further acknowledge the continued bipartisan support for the government's objective of increasing ODA to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015. Today I have outlined the government's commitment to a larger and more effective aid program. The government's efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of the aid program, including its response to the independent review, represent some of the most far-reaching changes to the aid program in more than a decade. This will be an enduring effort. Increasing aid effectiveness is the major objective and will require persistence, it will require continuing focus and it will require determination on the part of officials and those who partner with us, both in Australia and abroad. Above all, as minister, I want to see an aid program that is world-leading in its effectiveness, a program that delivers real and measurable results in reducing poverty on the ground and a program of which all Australians can and should be proud. I am therefore very pleased to table both the Independent review of aid effectiveness and the government's response, An effective aid program for Australia, today. I commend these reports to the House. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Curtin to speak for 22 minutes. Leave granted.",142
213,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Ms J. Bishop (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding 22 minutes. Question agreed to. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:38): The coalition has previously welcomed the decision of the government to conduct an independent review of aid effectiveness, and we welcome the release today of this report from that review. It was former coalition policy, prior to the last election, that there be an independent inquiry into our aid budget. It was not the policy of the Labor Party at the last election to conduct such a review. To his credit, the Minister for Foreign Affairs adopted our policy and this independent review was conducted. Our call for an independent review stemmed in part from a report released by the Australian National Audit Office in 2009 which raised concerns about the management of our aid budget, particularly an overreliance on 'technical assistance'-which I think members of this House can be assured is code for 'highly paid consultants'. Money spent on consultants is money not spent on programs, money not spent on particular outcomes. Highly paid consultants do not immediately translate into more effective aid delivery, and it was found that Australia's program was utilising such consultants at roughly double the OECD average. In my meetings with heads of state and government representatives from countries receiving Australian aid, this use of highly paid consultants has been one of the more common complaints. Former PNG Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare famously dubbed it 'boomerang aid', to highlight what he saw as aid to PNG that mostly returned to Australia through the high salaries paid to Australian consultants and experts. The National Audit Office report also raised important concerns about AusAID's ability to effectively manage the forecast large increases in the aid budget required to reach the bipartisan commitment of 0.5 per cent of gross national income, on top of the large increases in the years preceding that audit in 2009. The coalition's concerns about the management of the aid budget were compounded by reports by investigative journalist Steve Lewis, published widely in 2010, about allegations of waste, mismanagement and questionable priorities. He uncovered examples which were given wide media coverage at the time where the foreign aid program was directed to priorities such as $12 million to the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia to research the giant panda in China and over $300,000 to the Australian Football League for promotion in South Africa. The Australian National University's entrepreneurial arm, ANU Enterprise, received $637,557 for a survey of people in the Solomon Islands. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service received $319,000 for a scoping mission in Botswana. The Alternative Technology Association was paid $358,923 to conduct solar power training in East Timor. Millions extra was paid to various firms to promote AusAID's global agenda, including $185,866 to sell Austraid alia's aid message in Africa. Some $330,000 was paid for a one-month communications research project and $12.8 million was awarded for the redevelopment of just one school in Nauru. Each one of these initiatives may well have been worthwhile. Each one of these initiatives may well have been justifiable. But these were the kinds of reports that attracted public attention and public concern, and a vigorous debate in the community ensued. More troublingly, there have been reports of corruption and fraud within Australia's aid program, with media reports in 2010-and, indeed, another report published in newspapers today-showing that fraud has increased markedly in recent years. Some of this information has come from questions in writing that I have asked in this parliament. These questions have been part of the increased scrutiny under which our aid program finds itself. Scrutiny is vital because of the large sums of taxpayer dollars at stake. At the heart of this debate are simple questions. Why do we have a foreign aid program? Why are Australian taxpayer dollars spent to help people in developing countries? What is the purpose and worth of our foreign aid program? The simple answer is that we do it because it is a moral obligation of developed countries to assist developing countries. We support them because our funds can reduce infant mortality, reduce maternal mortality, provide clean water, support economic development and foster more stable and prosperous societies. This support is not provided purely because we should assist those worse off than ourselves; it is also firmly in our national interest. Foreign aid should be directed to encouraging self-sufficiency in recipient countries and not welfare dependency. It is interesting to look back at recent history of foreign aid programs around the world. Foreign aid grew exponentially in the wake of World War II. Europe and Japan received enormous sums of money from the United States in particular, as war-torn nations had to rebuild their countries, their national economies and their national infrastructure. The support was designed to prevent a recurrence of the cycle that led world from World War I to World War II. It was seen as an investment in stability so that millions of lives would not be lost on the battlefields of Europe again. No-one would question the wisdom of that approach. Australia fortunately does not face that scenario in its sphere of influence in this region. However, we do have many countries where poverty is rampant and health and development lag most of the world. Many of the nations in the lowest range of the United Nations human development index are in our region. A significant percentage of the world's poor live in our region in Oceania, South Asia and West Asia. It is important that we support the development of these countries in terms of compassion and human development but also to try and prevent the collapse of governments and societies. Failed nations are far more costly to stabilise and rebuild than investment through foreign aid which can provide stability. Foreign aid should be used to promote standards of living and human welfare and economic development. However, the quality of a recipient nation's government and social and economic policies of that government are the most important aspects in building prosperity and promoting and sustaining economic growth in developing countries. The independent panel of Margaret Reid, Sandy Hollway, John Denton, Stephen Howes and Bill Farmer have produced a quality report. The 39 recommendations are well worth considering in detail. I particularly welcome the recommendations relating to greater levels of accountability and transparency. There has been a culture of nondisclosure around the delivery of Australia's aid program for too long, and it is vital that accountability is at the highest level. Arguably the most important recommendation is the final one, recommendation the 39, which refers to, in effect, performance benchmarks. The report states: It is sensible to recognise that the upward trajectory to 0.5 per cent of GNI is steep and challenging. It makes sense that budget appropriations each year be contingent on things going to plan and existing monies being spent effectively. Third, failure to achieve a hurdle, or to fully achieve it, must have consequences. For example, the government could reduce the rate of increase or withhold all or part of the funding unless and until the hurdle is achieved. It is therefore critical that the Minister for Foreign Affairs details the nature of the performance benchmarks that AusAID will be required to meet, how those performance benchmarks will be measured and how AusAID will be measured against those benchmarks, and the consequence of failure to meet its performance targets. Accountability is important to ensure that the public retains confidence in the foreign aid program. Australians are a generous people and give private donations to many worthy causes in developing countries the around the world. However, they do want confidence that their private donations and their taxpayer funds provided to the government for aid are actually being spent to alleviate poverty and to help countries to develop self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal must be to build that self-reliance, of and not to entrench reliance or develop a welfare mentality. I also welcome the recommendation that the major focus of the foreign aid budget remain on areas of Australia's national interest primarily in our region, consistent with long standing coalition policy. The recommendation that aid increases be higher to nations with higher standards of governance is also sensible and will help reduce corruption and waste within the program. There must be a zero-tolerance approach not only to fraud and corruption but also to waste and mismanagement in the aid program. The coalition has been consistent in its view that the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions are the areas where we have the most influence and can do the most good. While there is great need for aid in other parts of the world, Australia's aid budget should be focused on our region, where there are billions of people still living in poverty. development challenges facing countries in our region were highlighted during a Senate inquiry in 2009 into the economic challenges facing Papua New Guinea and island states of the south-west Pacific. According to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, development indicators in Papua New Guinea went backwards between 2000 and 2005. In 2008 the human development index, which measures life expectancy, literacy, education, standard of living and GDP per capita, ranked the Solomon Islands 125th and Papua New Guinea 137th on a list of 169 countries. I propose visiting Papua New Guinea this weekend and I intend to discuss ways that we can better work with Papua New Guinea, particularly in areas of a transfer of know how and expertise in mining and resource course, sectors, so that PNG can develop its considerable natural assets for the benefit of its people. In my view, the review is correct to recommend that aid to Pacific Island countries be prioritised over assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. We should resist the temptation to spread our aid budget too thinly, particularly if it is in the pursuit of political or other goals. I have been critical of the government's use of our aid budget to bolster the government's campaign to win a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2013-14. One issue that the review did not discuss was another aspect of coalition policy which called for a separate minister for international development with responsibility for the management of the Australian Agency for International Development and our overseas aid effort. We believe this is an important step in maximising transparency and accountability in Australia's aid delivery and The would be a further significant step towards greater efficiency and effectiveness in the foreign aid program. The push for greater transparency and accountability in our aid program was initiated by the Howard government. In 2006, the Howard government established the Office of Development Effectiveness to monitor and assess the quality and impact of our aid spending. The steering committee set up to oversee the office included representatives from the departments of the Prime Minister and cabinet, Treasury and finance. This initiative was flagged by the government in its 2006 white paper on Australia's overseas aid program. The Office of Development Effectiveness was given responsibility for publishing an annual review of development effectiveness, acting as a resource for government agencies involved in Office of Development Effectiveness eligible expenditure, evaluating the implementation of country strategies and policies and publicising the results, undertaking reviews and periodic spot checks, and supporting the application of sound management principles. Other work undertaken by the Office of Development Effectiveness in those early years included country assessments of Indonesia and the Philippines. I note that the report of the independent review of aid effectiveness referred to the Office of Development Effectiveness in these terms: The creation in 2006 of the Office of Development Effectiveness and its Annual Review of Development Effectiveness (ARDE) were no doubt important initiatives that have helped prioritise aid effectiveness. No other bilateral donor has an equivalent to the ARDE. Overall, however, the ARDE has been a limited success, being released with increasing delay. The Review Panel proposes that the Office of Development Effectiveness remain within AusAID, but change its name to the Office of Aid Effectiveness and focus more on evaluation. It would be responsible for undertaking and publishing each year a manageable number (say, 10–20) of high quality evaluations. The Office would also publish an annual synthesis of evaluations and a quality assurance assessment of the aid program's performance management system. The review also went on to suggest: A small Independent Evaluation Committee should be appointed (with both AusAID staff and several external members, including the Chair). All draft independent evaluations and the new annual synthesis report would be discussed and then cleared by the Independent Evaluation Committee (not AusAID) and then published. I think that these recommendations are certainly worth deep consideration. The coalition firmly believes in an evidence based approach to the aid program. Foreign aid and overseas development assistance will continue to be the subject of vigorous debate within our community and within this parliament. The coalition will continue to scrutinise the aid budget. We will consider this report in detail and we will closely monitor the government's response. In particular we will hold the government to account over its implementation of the recommendations and the development of performance benchmarks. The coalition will continue to develop our priorities for the foreign aid budget. We will no doubt use the recommendations contained in this report released today to influence and inform our deliberations. In closing, may I acknowledge the efforts of my shadow parliamentary secretary for overseas development assistance, the member for Brisbane, for the work and effort that she has put into developing coalition policy and raising coalition concerns over the delivery of aid. The size of our aid budget and the forecast increases mean that we must use all tools at our disposal to ensure accountability and transparency. The Australian public deserve and demand no less. NA Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill received from the Senate and read a first time. Second Reading",148
214,Ms PLIBERSEK,BILLS,"Sydney-Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister for Human Services) (17:55): I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011 contains a number of amendments to protect the integrity of Australia's social security system. Australia is a society that looks to provide a safety net for those that are most in need. Social security payments provide that safety net to many thousands of Australians. While the great majority of social security recipients claim payments to which they are rightfully entitled, successive Australian governments have recognised that some people will attempt to receive payments to which they are not entitled. It is necessary, therefore, that there are robust measures in place to ensure the integrity of the social security system. The bill amends the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the administration act, to address issues that have been identified, dating back to the commencement of the administration act in 2000, as a result of the recent case of Poniatowska versus the Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions. For many years the CDPP has prosecuted cases involving social security fraud under various sections of the Criminal Code, particularly section 135.2, 'Obtaining a financial advantage'. These offence provisions involve, for the physical element of the offence, proving that the defendant engaged in conduct, where the relevant conduct is an omission-namely, failing to inform the department of an event or change of circumstances that might affect the person's social security payment or qualification for a concession card. Section 4.1 of the Criminal Code provides that engaging in conduct includes an omission to perform an act. Section 4.3 provides that an omission to perform an act can only be a physical element of an offence if (a) the law creating the offence makes it so; or (b) the law creating the offence impliedly provides that the offence is committed by an omission to perform an act that by law there is a duty to perform. In the recent case of Poniatowska, a majority of the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that 'section 135.2 does not define any duty or obligation relevant to an offence committed by way of omission'. It further noted that the CDPP had not relied on any notice issued to the defendant to establish a duty to inform the department of an event or change of circumstances, and that the administration act did 'not create a separate ""stand alone"" obligation'. On this basis, the court set aside the convictions which had been recorded against the defendant. The Commonwealth has appealed the Poniatowska decision to the High Court, which has reserved its decision. The current position is that a large number of past convictions are at risk of being overturned on Public appeal on the basis of the decision in Poniatowska. Since the decision, the CDPP has adjourned or discontinued a large number of matters of this kind before the courts. The CDPP is also not commencing new proceedings of this kind, pending the determination of the appeal before the High Court. Since the 2000-01 financial year, the CDPP has prosecuted approximately 36,500 defendants for social security fraud. Without a detailed analysis of each case, it is not possible to state definitively how many matters of social security fraud have been committed via omission since the introduction of the Criminal Code. However, the government's best estimate is that as many as 40 per cent of this number, or around 15,000 convictions, may now be open to question as a consequence of the decision in Poniatowska. To ensure the past convictions cannot be called into question, this bill amends the administration act to insert a stand-alone obligation for a person to inform the department of events or changes of circumstances that might affect the payment of a social security payment to the person or the person's qualification for a concession card. This provision will operate both prospectively and retrospectively to 20 March 2000, the date that the administration act commenced. Successive Australian governments have not lightly pursued retrospective legislation. However, in this case there are exceptional circumstances justifying retrospectivity, namely that it would not be appropriate for a significant number of prosecutions conducted from 2000 for social security fraud to be overturned on the basis of previously unidentified legal technicalities. One of the criticisms that can be directed at retrospective legislation in relation to criminal offences is that people will be unaware that their conduct is an offence. In this case, however, the convicted persons would all have been aware that they should have informed the department of the specified events and changes of circumstances listed in the notices given to them by Centrelink in relation to their social security payment or concession card. The effect of the retrospective application of this provision is to confirm convictions already made. As members would be aware, Centrelink has more than seven million customers. Its operations depend on the use of computer programs to generate decisions based on the requirements of the social security legislation. Considerations in light of the Poniatowska decision have also raised some doubt that there is sufficient evidence to prove that, with respect to the period from 12 June 2001 to the present, decisions made by Centrelink under the social security law by the operation of computer programs have satisfied all legislative requirements. To ensure that these decisions are not open to question, the bill provides that the requirements of subsection 6A(1) of the administration act are taken to have been complied with in relation to decisions made under the social security law by the operation of a computer program for the period 12 June 2001 to the date of royal assent. Finally, the bill makes technical amendments to the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Act 2011 and to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Act 2011 to correct drafting oversights. I conclude by noting that the bill has been designed such that there will be no practical impact on the ordinary course of Centrelink's business, or on a person's obligations to report changes in their circumstances to Centrelink. Every person who receives a social security payment or a concession card is currently sent notices by Centrelink. These notices require that the person inform the department of events or changes of circumstances which might affect the person's social security payment or qualification for a concession card. This will not change as a result of this bill. The bill is necessary to protect the integrity of the social security system. It has been brought forward by the government, based on advice from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General, to address technical issues that have been brought to light by recent litigation. It does so without disturbing the existing protections that the law guarantees for Centrelink clients. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.",152
215,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS," Australia has a generous social welfare system. When people find themselves in necessitous circumstances whether by way of unemployment or disability, or some other affliction in their lives, then the commitment of the Australian people shared across the aisle of politics is that we provide them with welfare. That has been done for many decades in Australia and, by any international standards, the provision of that welfare in this country is most generous. That welfare, of course, does not come out of nowhere. It comes from the taxes which are contributed by other Australians to ensuring the common good of all people in this country. I say that because there is a concomitant responsibility or duty on the part of people who are in receipt of welfare, and part of that duty is to be truthful and frank about their financial circumstances. for example, a person's financial circumstances change and they are in receipt of more income than they were at the time that they received their welfare or they become the owner of some asset, they have the responsibility to inform the social security authorities through Centrelink of those changed circumstances so that a reassessment of their situation can be made consistent with providing welfare to them and consistent with the broader objective of meeting the common good of all Australians. That is why the social security legislation contains provisions that require a person whose circumstances have changed financially to notify the department or notify Centrelink about those changes. This is something which is commonly understood and known throughout the Australian population. Indeed, if a person was unaware of that and they are in receipt of welfare, they are regularly reminded of that commitment, that obligation, in letters that they receive in regard to their particular payment from the government. This bill arises because of a difficulty, which has come to light, in relation to people who have defrauded the Commonwealth. Defrauding the Commonwealth might sound like the defrauding of some remote institution, but the reality is that defrauding the Commonwealth is defrauding all Australians, because all Australians who are taxpayers make contributions to the funds which enable these payments of welfare to be made. It was assumed, as the minister has pointed out, for quite a number of years after the implementation of the Criminal Code in this area that a prosecution brought pursuant to the Criminal Code met all the legal requirements. However, in a case in the South Australian jurisdiction that ultimately If, ended up in the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia-the case of Poniatowska-it was decided in a majority decision that one of the elements was missing, namely, that the legislation did not define a duty by way of an omission, and therefore, on technical grounds, what were thought to be proper and appropriate and lawful prosecutions that had been brought over a number of years are in danger of being overturned. Indeed, if that was the last say on that case in those particular circumstances, the prosecution would have been overturned. The minister said that this is a matter currently before the High Court and we are waiting for the High Court to pass judgment. It could be argued that the parliament should wait for the High Court to hand down its judgment. That is a principle which I think in most cases we would subscribe to, because until the High Court does hand down that judgment there is still some uncertainty or some final determination to be made by the judicial officers of this land. However, the danger in this case is that, if we do wait, there are potentially thousands of cases that could be overturned, and not only overturned by people seeking to quash those convictions but potentially compensation claims made against the Commonwealth. The principle of retrospectivity, which has been mentioned in this debate, is an important one. Nobody in a legislative mode approaches retrospectivity lightly. As a general proposition, we do not wish to say that something which was regarded as lawful in the past is now unlawful and to go back to those past events. It is one thing to do it prospectively but it is another thing entirely to do it retrospectively. So it is appropriate that concerns about retrospectivity be raised in relation to this case. However, there is a difference here. We are not creating an offence anew. People have been charged with offences and they have been convicted of welfare fraud. Nobody will be affected or captured by this legislation who had not already been caught and penalised before. In fact, if the legislation does not pass and High Court upholds the majority finding in the South Australian Supreme Court, the prospect is that many people who had been convicted of offences before may be able to seek to have those convictions quashed and be paid compensation. I say this is different because it is clear on the face of the social security legislation that there is that obligation to inform Centrelink, the social security authorities, of a change of circumstances. Whilst one may argue about the technicalities of the law, this is a case where we ought to go back to what the law is based on. The law is based on a moral or ethical principle which I was seeking to describe at the outset. Yes, we are generous in terms of welfare, but a person in receipt of welfare has to be honest and frank about their particular financial circumstances. It would not be justice for society generally and the community, and it certainly would not be justice for the taxpayers whose taxes contribute to welfare payments, if a situation were to arise where, because of the technical interaction between the Criminal Code and the social security legislation, for what had been regarded properly as welfare fraud offences were overturned. Whatever one argues about the legal technicalities of this case-being a lawyer myself, one can always find a legal argument to advance, and I am not convinced that this is retrospectivity as we normally understand it-even if one does not agree with me, I think there is in this case a broader moral or ethical principle that this parliament should seek to uphold. It is for that reason we on this side of the chamber will not be opposing this legislation that the government has brought forward. I will refer to some cases, because we are talking in many instances not about some mere trifle where somebody had overlooked the fact that they had mown the lawns a the couple of times for neighbours and been paid $20, $30 or $50 for that but about very substantial fraud against the taxpayer, against the Commonwealth, in many cases. Let me just give the chamber some examples. These are drawn from the annual reports of the Commonwealth Director of quite Public Prosecutions. One is that over a period of more than 10 years a person failed to notify Centrelink that they had worked and earned income while in receipt of Centrelink benefits. As a result, the person obtained social security payments to which they were not entitled of over $100,000. The person was charged pursuant to the Criminal Code, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. Another case was that of a person with power of attorney over a parent's financial affairs who failed to inform Centrelink of the parent's death and continued to receive the parent's fortnightly payments for around 10 years. The person defrauded the Commonwealth of over $80,000. Again, there was a prosecution, a conviction and a sentence of imprisonment. The third case is one where, over two separate periods totalling eight years, a person claimed parenting payment (single) while living with a partner. The person neglected to inform Centrelink when the couple had reconciled and, in relation to a separate period, falsely claimed that the couple had separated. The person received over $80,000 in social security payments to which they were not entitled. In this case they were charged under the Criminal Code, convicted and released on condition that they be of good behaviour for a specified period. I will give the House one more example. Over almost seven years, a person received over $70,000 in social security payments to which they were not entitled through failing to inform Centrelink of their earnings from full-time employment. The fraud was discovered as a result of a data-matching exercise between Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office. Again, this person was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment. I do not believe that any reasonable Australian would regard a circumstance where, because of what is largely a legal technicality, people who had been convicted in those circumstances would have the possibility opened up to them to quash those convictions and, more than that, possibly even claim compensation from the Commonwealth. To use a colloquial expression, it fails the front pub test. It fails common-sense test of ordinary Australians. That common-sense test is based on this notion that, yes, we are generous, but there is a concomitant duty or responsibility to those who are generous in relation to these payments. It is on the basis of that principle that we will not be opposing this legislation.",155
216,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS," I will speak very briefly on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011. I do think this is a very important bill that should be passed by the House and I am pleased that there is support on both sides of the chamber. I am very proud to be an Australian because in Australia we do provide a safety net for those in need. This is something that is ingrained in our psyche as Australians. When people are doing it tough, they do get assistance. I think there is broad support in our community for those who need help to actually get that help. So I am proud that we have a safety net and a social security system in this country. This bill reinforces that the social security system has integrity. The vast majority of Australians that go into their local Centrelink in times of trouble and times of need are very upfront and honest and deserve the support that they get, but there are instances, as the previous speaker pointed out, where this is not abided by. A very small minority go in and are not upfront and honest, despite knowing that they should be. This does unfortunately call into question the integrity of all those people receiving these social security payments. It is unfair that the actions of the few cast aspersions on the many who do that right thing. I believe these amendments are very important for the integrity of this system. As the previous speakers have outlined, this bill arose as a result of a court case in the South Australia. I believe the intentions of the Commonwealth and the requirements placed on social security recipients have been clear, but based on this technicality that clarity is being called into question. As a result, in many instances where fraud has been proven in a court of law people may get off those charges. That is a concern. It is also a concern that new charges of defrauding the Commonwealth are not necessarily proceeding as quickly as they could have because of the lack of clarity at the moment. It is important that we bring forward and pass this legislation, despite the fact that this matter still going through the High Court. It is the duty of the parliament and the Commonwealth, being responsible for the social security system, to bring this legislation forward. So I am pleased that it has the support of the House. I want to use this opportunity to talk about the hard working people at Centrelink. The many people around the country administering our social security system do a great job on the front line. In my electorate there is a great amount of work being done at the Noarlunga Centrelink office. It is sometimes a tough job. At times there are distressed people, upset people and people in real difficulty, but I believe that Centrelink staff right around this country do a great job. I would like to talk about Noarlunga in particular because I know the staff there do not just sit back and wait for people to come to them; they play a real outreach role in the community. In fact, I attended a special fair day for those suffering from mental illness where all the services got together to talk to the local community. Centrelink was there with the staff and the manager. The manager of a large Centrelink office was there on the front line talking to people, letting them know what they can access and what is available. We know that those who are most vulnerable often do not know what they can access. They can access different payments and services, and sometimes they do not know. Our Centrelink staff have been out there doing that. There have been many other opportunities where Centrelink staff from Noarlunga have done outreach work. Whether it be youth or Indigenous people, they go into those communities to talk to those people in need who may benefit from a number of services and payments. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Centrelink staff, specifically at Noarlunga but also right is around the country, who work in this area. They also need to have confidence that, when they assess someone and they are getting information, they can be confident to act on that information. This legislation ensures that there is that mutual responsibility for people to acknowledge when their income changes-and as the previous speaker said, it can be by quite a lot. People know that their income changes. While it might be only a few people, it is important that this legislation is supported. We have an obligation to support it and pass it through the House now because the Australian people, while very generous in their nature and willing to help people in need, do not want to be defrauded. This legislation is really important to ensure that we can have confidence in the integrity of our social security system, that we continue to support those people in need and that those people who defraud the Commonwealth face the consequences of doing so. I commend the bill to the House.",157
217,Mr LAMING,BILLS," The opposition support the government on this occasion, even though we appreciate that there is a significant element of retrospectivity in what is being introduced. We feel that it does not contravene any fundamental principles of fairness to do so and, on those grounds, we do support the bill. We also want to note that Australia has a long tradition, as previous speakers have noted, of a strong welfare safety net-but also a community expectation that the money has to come from somewhere. Therefore, we are one of the few countries that so effectively, and in such a targeted way, means-test our welfare payments. Many people do not realise that many of the social welfare economies of the rest of the OECD do not means-test in the way we do. In fact, they are far less progressive in that way. They allow people to take an age welfare payment commensurate with their earnings through their career, something that does not happen in Australia. We never want to forget that many hard-working Australians end up being means-tested out of further state support. Regardless of your view about that, we need to remember there is a significant working middle class that do not get the aged-care support that in identical circumstances in other countries they might well have. Over the last two decades, we have seen a shift in thinking from the belief that welfare is a fundamental right to the after all, a privilege-that it is first of all collected from other Australians and then paid as part of the privilege of being an Australian. We therefore have laws and expect everyone, from east coast to west coast and whatever their background, to adhere to those. You have to play by the rules. I think the Australian sense of fairness comes out no more strongly than in the idea that one should never abuse payments that one receives through our welfare system. There are many dimensions to combating welfare fraud and I think every state wants to strike a balance between having strict eligibility tests that are easy enough to understand and that everyone can appreciate and feel are fair and having a robust prosecution policy for those who willingly and knowingly contravene the rules. The fact that there have been over 30,000 prosecutions is, I think, a fair indication of the latter. Ordinary Australians out there would understand that being a dole cheat or a welfare cheat is not something that is acceptable any more, not something that you can laugh about or pat your mate on the back about. That change has come about, quite significantly, over the last two decades through the policies of successive administrations. One does not want to have such an invasive and aggressive policy that it deters people from applying for Centrelink support or an approach that it is overly intrusive or punitive. There still needs to be an element of self-reporting and that needs to be encouraged, not dissuaded. What is very important about this amendment is, as the shadow minister has suggested, that there will be no new prosecutions as a result of this change. It just ensures that none of the old prosecutions are brought back for review through, potentially, the new light of a High belief that it is, Court decision. In all of this, you are constantly weighing up the prima facie case of whether there is a need to overturn versus the public interest. I think most people here, together with most Australians, would admit that it is in the public interest to support the prosecutions which have occurred over the last two decades. The great risk of not standing up to it is that fraud then becomes more prevalent and Australians around the country lose their confidence that this is a welfare system that properly targets those who need it most. Social security recipients, certainly those in my electorate, understand the rules and will stand by them. But we feel that, if this legislation is not supported, a whole lot of new cases could potentially be opened. The last thing we want is those prosecutions being called into question. While there is really any understanding of how many of those are potentially coming before the courts, it may only be a matter of days or weeks before that does occur. Were this bill not passed promptly and expeditiously, we could potentially be exposing Centrelink and the Commonwealth to an enormous burden in having to defend cases which, given how much time has passed and the level of detail in the records we hold, would be very difficult cases to defend. These sorts of changes are, I think, completely in line with what the average person would have thought were held in the first place. Although it now looks like you can basically drive a bus through a loophole, at the time it was extremely difficult for those Centrelink drafters of Commonwealth law to understand that what they were drafting could run contrary to an element of the Criminal Code. That is a very important reason for the changes. We also note that the Commonwealth has ceased prosecuting a whole range of cases that, most of us would argue, should be prosecuted and not delayed. That is another very good reason to continue the great work that Australia has done in avoiding Centrelink fraud-to ensure that that is not derailed. Finally, there are some changes which make it very clear that people currently making a claim for social security or access to a concession card, people currently receiving social security or who hold those concession privileges and people not currently receiving social security payments or holding a concession card but who have at one time been paid social security or received such concessions will also be subject to these new rules. I think it is completely reasonable that we should support these changes and I think it is very important that Centrelink fraud is never considered a legitimate activity in this not country. That is the important reason both sides should be supporting these changes.",158

222,Mr BILSON,BUSINESS," move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the bill a second reading, and: (1) condemns the Government for its belated action to address the anti-competitive price signalling 'gap' in Australia's competition law; (2) notes that the bill only arose following Coalition leadership to introduce the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010 as a private member's bill into this House; (3) recognises the assessment by academics and leading competition law practitioners that the Coalition's bill is superior to the Government's bill and should be brought on for debate in the House; (4) records its concern about the Government's failure to undertake proper and meaningful consultation on the preparation of its bill, or to allow the House Economics Committee to carry out its work to examine the bill and consider public submissions; (5) notes the particular flaws in the Government's bill in that it: (a) recklessly creates a per se liability for private communications without adequately justifying this approach in terms of economic policy or competition law principles; (b) ignores that sound competition law should wherever possible have an economy wide application unless clear justification is provided to deviate from this settled approach; (c) includes sector-specific application se prohibitions that give rise to a complex task of identifying all conceivable business transactions and conduct that have a legitimate business BILLS justification, as an exhaustive list of exemptions is manifestly incomplete; (d) risks consumer and economic detriment by failing to adequately differentiate between information sharing that may be pro-consumer and pro-competitive from conduct that is clearly not; and (e) creates uncertainty about which sectors I and/or markets will be subject to the bill into the future, with the basis on which the application of the provisions will be extended remaining a substantial economic concern; and (6) notes that these substantial deficiencies in the bill and their likely detriment to the Australian economy and the well-being of the Australian people means that this bill should not be passed in this form."" Close examination of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 is essential and incredibly important. The government's own explanatory memorandum concedes that the bill contains new concepts and key features that have no equivalent in the current law. By Labor's tactical manoeuvrings, the government's bill has been spared the kind of close assessment and analytical rigour a change of economic regulation of this kind warrants. The government has truncated the work of the appointed Standing Committee on Economics, disrespecting those who made considered submissions and dishonouring this parliament. Despite being denied any opportunity to properly consider the government's bill or submissions on it, government members recommended that the bill pass unaltered. This was either a sense of a parliamentary committee made of up of clairvoyants able to foresee what they might have thought had they bothered to examine the evidence or a and per compliant committee where government members simply do what their government masters direct them to do. Thankfully, though, good sense has prevailed. Just as the Treasurer left his Labor colleagues on Standing Committee on Economics hanging with his own amendment to the bill, we had some constructive discussions regarding the consideration in detail amendments to the bill that have been circulated in my name. The amendments that the coalition brought forward showed an interest in and a responsiveness to the serious concerns raised by stakeholders, expert competition lawyers, leading academics and practitioners. I am pleased to say that I think we found a meeting of minds with the government on a number of those amendments. I understand the government will be bringing forward its own version of those amendments, which will address a number of the concerns that we have raised. Those concerns include the need for an ordinary course of business exception for conduct that may be captured by the per se prohibition, a number of specific provisions relating to nominating the process where other markets may be captured by this law and also some specific amendments relating to the financial services sector. I am optimistic that we can find common ground in that area and move forward collaboratively on this bill. (Time expired)",161
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, Is the amendment seconded? Ms Gambaro: I second the amendment.,162
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Dunkley has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with the view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.  to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. This is one of a number of bills that have come before the House recently to moderate the behaviour of Australia's banks-fine institutions that they are. However, one of the roles of government is to regulate and moderate our banks. This legislation says something about the Gillard government's commitment to ensure a better deal for Australian consumers and small businesses. Unfortunately, it might also reflect a general reluctance on the part of banks to always act in a competitive, consumer-friendly manner, without the gentle, moderating, guiding hand of the Gillard Labor government. Where the market fails, responsible government must apply the law to ensure strength in our banking sector and a fair go for all Australian consumers. The banks have done very well for themselves from Australian consumers and businesses. There is no doubt about that. Consequently, they have a responsibility to act in the interests of their customers. This is their social licence. Our big four have reported first half-yearly profits of $11.9 billion. The Commonwealth Bank posted a profit of $3.3 billion to December 2010; NAB, $2.67 billion; Westpac, a cool $3.16 billion; and ANZ's six-month profit was up a massive 38 per cent to $2.66 billion. Nice work if you can get it. I will describe the landscape in which these profits were delivered. This information is from the statistics and mapping section of the Parliamentary Library. I caution those opposite that I cannot guarantee that some of this information was not prepared by economists. I am pretty sure some of it would have been prepared by economists but I do not have their names to name them. Here are some of the key points. Looking at interest rates, we see the average home loan standard variable interest rate has remained steady for the past seven months at 7.8 per cent. Bankruptcies and business investments are always a good guide to what is actually going on in the money-making section of the community. In the March quarter 2011, total bankruptcies decreased by 17.4 per cent when compared to the same period last year. It is a bit constrained, tight out there, but some of these key indicators suggest that the economy is holding firm. However, we obviously we need to do as much as we can to support it. This bill before the House will drive greater competition in the banking sector by empowering the ACCC to act against banks who signal their prices to competitors to undermine competition. I also note that the ANZ job as were up and that unemployment was steady at 4.9 per cent. The ACCC has reported evidence of anticompetitive price signalling by the banks. We are not talking about collusion but behaviour where the banks communicate their pricing intentions to competitors. We have seen the announcements on the TV quite regularly. This is usually done via press release and media rounds. We are not talking about backroom boys type of behaviour, but nevertheless it has aspects of collusion because the banks indicate their pricing intentions to their competitors. For example, they may signal in advance what their response will be to a change in interest rates by the Reserve Bank. That is followed by what is almost a nod and a wink, with the understanding 'if you raise your mortgage rates we'll raise ours too'. Our banks, reliable as they are, have been able to get away with this behaviour because it is done with no formal price agreement and, like a three card trick, it is always done right before our eyes-as I said, through the media. Unfortunately, the losers from this behaviour are Australian consumers, who because of reduced competition face higher interest rates. Under current laws there is nothing to stop banks behaving in this way-and I stress again that it is not illegal or unlawful; it is just the resulting squeeze on consumers that is wrong-and that is why the Gillard Labor government has acted. The bill before the a bit House amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to prohibit, firstly, the private disclosure of pricing information between competitors outright, which is called the per se prohibition, and, secondly, the disclosure of pricing or other information if made for the purpose of substantially lessening competition. Initially this will apply only to the banking sector, but it could be extended to other areas of the economy after further review. The per se prohibition bans private communications between banks about their prices. This amendment targets disclosures that are clearly anticompetitive and damaging to consumers. For example, if one bank gets on the phone to another bank to tell them privately about a planned mortgage interest rate rise, the ACCC can take action. As I said, this bill also empowers the ACCC to prosecute a bank for communicating its pricing intentions to substantially lessen competition. This means a bank cannot inform its competitors that it will follow them if they raise mortgage rates. These tough new laws are accompanied by strong civil penalties of up to $10 million, 10 per cent of a business's annual turnover or three times the benefit of the conductwhichever is the higher. These are very, very strong civil penalties, but we are talking about banks; we are not talking about the local bowls club. These are significant institutions with significant resources. The prohibitions are, however, subject to specific exclusions to ensure pro-competitive behaviour is not restricted. These exemptions allow banks to comply fully with their disclosure and legal obligations. There will also be occasions when banks need legitimately to discuss pricing with their competitors. This bill ensures that these business activities can continue through the joint venture exception, which captures actual and proposed joint ventures. Banks will also be able to obtain immunity from the prohibition from the ACCC. It is important that we close this loophole in competition law. It brings Australian law into line with those of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. These laws strike the right balance by enabling banks to get on with their legitimate business while providing the necessary protections for consumers by eliminating anticompetitive price signalling. I commend the bill to the House.",162
225,Mr FLETCHER,BUSINESS," I am pleased to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. On this side of the House we believe that this is a deeply flawed bill. We do not disagree that there is an issue which needs to be addressed, which is why the coalition brought forward our own bill, the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010. But we believe that the approach taken in the bill that the government has put before the House raises some very serious issues. The stated purpose of the bill is to give powers to the ACCC to deal with the issue of price signalling, and it does this in both a public and a private context. In the private context it creates a so-called per se prohibition on the private disclosure of pricing information to competitors. 'Per se' means that the disclosure does not need to be for purpose of substantially lessening competition, nor does it need to have that effect. both the private and the public contexts, the bill contains a general disclosure prohibition of the disclosure of pricing information. That is also, we will argue, a prohibition that raises significant policy issues. The stated approach in this bill is to strike a balance. The explanatory note from Treasury states: … it is recognised that any proposal to address anti-competitive price signalling and other information disclosures will need to carefully balance the potential anti-competitive impacts of particular information disclosures, with the benign and pro-competitive effects of other information disclosures. On this side of the House we argue that this bill does not strike the right balance, and that argument is supported in the arguments made by many parties that made submissions in relation to this bill, including the Business Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia. Unfortunately, the question of whether the balance has been properly struck is not the one which appears to be principally motivating the government in its approach to this piece of legislation. This legislation ultimately is being driven by political considerations and the desire of the Treasurer to be seen to be doing something. The result, unfortunately, is a piecemeal measure with, in its current form, many unintended consequences. It is true, as has been noted, that some amendments are proposed, and to some extent that advances the position. But there remain many fundamentally troubling aspects of this piece of legislation, and the basis upon which the legislation has been developed is also extremely troubling. The consultation process that was employed in arriving at the introduction of this bill was seriously flawed. A draft exposure bill, for the example, was provided for comment on 12 December last year, with comments due by In 14 January. It really is very far from good practice in consultation with industry to require very detailed consideration of wideranging reforms to be provided in the middle of the Christmas holiday period. Let me make a number of specific points in the brief time available to me. The first point is that one of the central provisions of this bill, the so-called per se prohibition, is bad policy. I secondly want to argue that a measure which is specific to one sector-in this case, the banking sector-is also bad policy. I thirdly want to argue that to give Treasurer the capacity to extend, by regulation, the measures contained in this bill to other sectors without needing to come back to the parliament is also bad policy. I fourthly want to highlight the poor policy consequences of the inconsistency between the regime set out in this bill and the well established continuous disclosure rules which apply to listed companies, including of course the major banks which are listed. Let me turn firstly, therefore, to the question of the per se prohibition to remind the House what this means. It means that if the specified conduct is found to have occurred then it becomes irrelevant as to whether there was any anticompetitive purpose in carrying out that conduct. Indeed it is also irrelevant whether there was any anticompetitive effect. In other words, if the conduct occurs then it matters not whether there was any intention, any purpose, to lessen competition. Nor does it matter whether there was actually the effect of lessening competition. There is simply a blanket prohibition on private disclosure of the relevant pricing information. The arguments that can be made that circumstances in which one bank or executives of one bank meet privately with another to discuss pricing information and the arguments that can be made about the anticompetitive consequences of that are clearly forceful. But if you say, 'We do not really care whether the conduct actually has an anticompetitive effect. We do not really care whether there was an intention, a purpose, of reducing competition in meeting to have these private discussions,' then you are missing the whole point of what policy ought to do in the case of seeking to maintain and strengthen competition. Policy ought to focus on conduct which has an effect of reducing competition; policy also ought to focus on conduct which is intended to reduce the competition-that is to say, which has the purpose of reducing competition-even if, for reasons that are beyond the capacity of those who have joined together to have the conversation, it does not result ultimately in the anticompetitive effect. But there is another even more fundamental point, which is this: there are often circumstances in which private disclosures can be procompetitive, and there are certainly an extensive range of situations in which private disclosures can be necessary and desirable in the carrying on of business and are not harmful to competition. When you look at the provisions in the bill before the House, you will see that the scope of what is caught by this provision is very wide. It includes historic, aggregated and non-confidential data. The submission from the Australian Bankers Association lists a range of situations in which the bill will create great difficulties. They cite syndicated lending, which of necessity involves more than one bank. Typically in a syndicate there are many banks. They talk about loan switching, where a customer switches a loan from one bank to another, or a situation where two or more lenders are dealing with a financially distressed business-perhaps a business which has received loans from a syndicate and some time later it transpires that the business is in financial distress and the banks need to engage in consultations to work out how they are to deal with this business. The approach which the government has taken to this problem is to set out a specific range of exemptions in which the per se prohibition will not apply. But that is poor policy. It would be much more sensible not to start with a per se prohibition in the first place. It would be much more likely to produce a rational policy outcome. Let me turn to the next point I want to make, which is that policy which is specific to one sector is bad policy. It is a very curious approach indeed to competition policy to say that certain conduct, if carried out by bankers, is anticompetitive; but, if carried out by airline executives or pharmaceutical industry executives or telecommunications sector executives or agricultural industry executives, is not anticompetitive. Under the provisions contained in this bill conduct in one industry will attract potentially criminal penalties, whereas conduct of exactly the same kind carried out by executives in different industries, carried out by companies in different industries, will not attract a penalty. It is impossible to see the policy rationale for such inconsistent treatment. The Swanson, Hilmer and Dawson reviews all found that competition law prohibitions as a general principal ought to apply across the board. Let me quote from the submission by the Law Council: Any prohibition on price signalling should apply universally and not just to selected business sectors. Selective application of the proposed prohibitions and undermines the general application of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 across all industries on an equal basis. It is interesting that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, also noted its scepticism of the approach of industry-specific competition prohibitions. The ACCC had the following to say: … we would hope signalling laws would be of a general application rather than focusing on a particular sector, because we do not see that is a reason for signalling out one sector as opposed to another. Even Choice, the consumer advocacy group-they do very important work but are not known to be a friend of the big end of town-had this to say: It is Choice's submission that legislation should be, to the extent possible, uniform in its approach to all industries across Australia. So from first principles and in the submission of a wide range of parties the approach in this bill of establishing specific restrictions on price-signalling behaviour which apply only to the banking sector is extremely poor policy. While it is poor policy to restrict this approach to one sector, another aspect of the bill which raises equally serious concerns is the fact that as a legal matter the bill empowers the Treasurer to extend this regulation to other sectors. This grants excessive discretion to the executive government. The perception, based upon what has been stated publicly by this government in seeking to justify the measures in this bill, is that this is a bill directed towards the banking sector. It is true that in its initial application it will apply only to the banking sector, but it also provides for other sectors to be specified by regulation and so the prohibitions in the bill will apply to them. It is very hard to understand the policy rationale here. The preferred approach, as I have indicated, would be to have a legal regime in this area which applied uniformly. But if you are going to, as this government appears to be doing, introduce measures directed to one sector, it is then very hard to understand why you retain the flexibility, why you retain the discretion, to extend this to other sectors without coming back to the parliament. The imposition of the prohibitions contained in this bill is a substantial policy matter and it is one which ought to be there considered by the parliament rather than imposed by regulation. The fourth point I wish to make in the brief time available to me is that there is a tension between the provisions contained in this bill and the obligations imposed upon the major banks which are listed to meet their continuous disclosure obligations under the ASX listing rules. It is one of the many aspects of this bill which does not appear to have been very well thought through, no doubt because the bill has been rushed through largely to achieve a set of political objectives. This is a poor piece of legislation which based upon bad policy, selective policy, and driven largely by political motives. We on this side of the House certainly think that very substantial amendment is needed before it can be supported.",164
226,Ms ONEILL,BUSINESS," I rise to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1). This bill once again demonstrates the government's commitment to competition and consumer law reform and to ensuring that ordinary Australians experience the benefits of a strong economy. Those opposite attempt to decry the word 'competition' as a Labor word. I assert that in a genuinely competitive economy consumers benefit because of lower prices and the economy benefits as a whole because of the need for business to be more efficient. A truly competitive economy is a Labor ideal that benefits working families. It benefits working families because a competitive economy can provide goods and services that are of a lower cost and better quality. Whilst those opposite may argue that they are the party of small business and competition, it is the Labor Party and Labor governments that have successively and truly achieved central reform in this area. The main issue addressed in this bill is competition between banks and other financial institutions in home loan interest rates. The ideal of competition is that it lowers the ability of a business in a market where competition is ideal to increase or control prices. We have, sadly, been confronted with the issue that when the Reserve Bank increases its cash rate target the banks and other financial institutions increase their home loan interest rates beyond the Reserve Bank increase. This has occurred because banks are able to signal, before a potential increase in the cash rate is targets, an intention to increase the home loan rate to a level beyond the cash rate. This lowers the fears of competitors that they might lose customers if they act in the same manner. The result of this signalling is a breakdown in the competitive forces in the provision of home loans and it negatively affects hard working families for whom loan repayments can make up a really significant part of the family budget. This bill will help address these issues by prohibiting banks from privately disclosing information on pricing policies to a competitor. Such disclosures are unfair and uncompetitive and result in home loan interest rates which are not reflective of the competitive ideal. This bill will prohibit outright a bank from disclosing privately to a competitor information regarding the market to which the price information relates. Additionally, this bill gives the ACCC vital powers to prosecute banks who communicate price intentions and other strategic information to a competitor for the purpose of substantially lessening competition. I understand that regulation of the financial industry needs to be appropriate and cannot stifle the role of financial institutions in what is a healthy free market economy, but the regulations proposed in the the bill are appropriate and needed because the banks need to be responsible when they are making their pricing decisions. The Australian banking sector remained stable during the global financial crisis. This was due to both good economic management by the Australian government and long-term good management of the banks. Despite this history of good management, the banks should not have the ability to engage in anticompetitive practices to the detriment of consumers. Indeed, our economy is greatly influenced by consumers who live in mortgage belt areas. The Central Coast and the seat of Robertson, which I am proud to represent in the parliament, display the typical characteristics of a mortgage belt area. The Central Coast is an outer suburban region which has had a fast-growing population over the last 30 years. The Gosford City local government area experienced the 19th largest population growth in New South Wales. Debate interrupted. NA",167
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. International Development Assistance",168
228,Ms GAMBARO,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening to speak on behalf of my constituents and the people of Australia in regard to the future direction of this country's foreign aid program. At a time of economic uncertainty, many Australian taxpayers understandably expect results and value for money. Australians are generous and have a long tradition of domestic and international giving. Today I attended the presentation of the government's Independent review of aid effectiveness. I welcome the report and place on record my thanks for the dedicated work undertaken by the panel to produce this report. The 39 recommendations made by this report seek to do exactly what we in the coalition have always sought-that is, to increase transparency, scrutiny and effectiveness. In addition to the government's aid program we are fortunate, through the generosity of the people of this country, to have increased corporate social responsibility, volunteerism and cause related projects by NGOs which all give rise to substantial international giving. The community's expectation is that their personal donations, corporate philanthropy, NGO fundraising and foreign aid money are spent on improving people's lives and we need to ensure that these goals are achieved. We also need to ensure that the effectiveness of our aid is maintained by increased scrutiny and transparency. The coalition not only believe in the delivery of a tougher, more accountable aid program but also have always believed that there should be greater emphasis on a cooperative approach, particularly through working with other governments and other aid organisations, as well as with Australia's corporate sector. Given the size and significance of our foreign aid program, the coalition will appoint a minister for international development assistance to work with the foreign affairs minister to oversee our aid budget and to have responsibility for AusAID and the delivery of aid. To maximise the benefits and assistance that we can provide, the coalition have always believed that Australia's corporate aid programs need to be well coordinated to mesh with our global focus and our country-specific programs. In addition to AusAID spending, greater coordination and tracking of international aid donations and philanthropy should be identified and coordinated. The coalition's approach to international development assistance is to place a greater focus on harnessing the efforts of all contributors investing in the future of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. Internationally, Australia is recognised for leading role in the region, particularly in PNG and near Pacific nations. Australia's aid is even more important given that two-thirds of the world's poor-some 800 million people-live in the Asia-Pacific region, yet receive less than one-third of global aid. Our objective should be to support, encourage and work with our neighbours to invest in health and education, create employment, increase trade and investment, and pursue inclusive growth that benefits their populations. We believe a greater focus on basic education, particularly for girls, is the most effective form of long-term educational investment. Current rates of females being educated remain much lower than that of males, and addressing this is the first step in our commitment to the development of women leaders in our region. Improved educational opportunities for girls will also translate into improved economic and health outcomes. It was a coalition government that established the Office of Development Effectiveness, which was designed to oversee the activities of our aid program. It is really disappointing to note that the last annual review published by the ODE was for the year 2009. Therefore, I wholeheartedly welcome recommendation 30, which would enhance the oversight undertaken by the ODE. I also support a whole-of-government approach to strengthening planning, monitoring and reporting. The establishment of the Development Effectiveness Steering Committee to achieve this is also very welcome. Our focus should be on the Asia-Pacific region, but there is no question that we should continue to assist other areas of the world where the need arises. We recognise that foreign aid spending in other parts of the world is essential. We support the its recommendations, and the major focus of the foreign aid budget should primarily be within our region and continue to grow there. The coalition welcome the report and its recommendations, particularly those that support our view, encourage greater transparency and describe steps and performance indicators that should be implemented to provide a further safeguard for Australia's aid program. Holt Electorate",168
229,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to talk about a suburb in my electorate that many people unfairly label. A neighbouring suburb of Dandenong was recently labelled by The Punch as one of the top 10 bogan places in Australia. Doveton unfortunately suffers from the same unfair description. Let me tell you about how one particular academic describes Doveton: Who knows where Doveton is, and who cares? Is it an address to die for, like Pots Point or Peppermint Grove? You know it isn't. It's just another bogan suburb, out in the boondocks, whatever a boondock is; out in the sticks, or is it the Styx? What does Doveton have to show us about how those in the 'outer suburbs' might live? Doveton is dark, damp and quiet one morning early in winter. The Minaret College school bus pulls out of a driveway at 7.10 am. Around the corner a set of Venetian blinds have been pushed down diagonally by a terrier who sits on a chair behind the sill and barks enthusiastically at passers-by. Let me tell you about the Doveton I know. It is a suburb with character, heart and a sense of community spirit. I know of the many warm and friendly community minded people that make Doveton a treasure of a suburb. These include people like Les Boyes, Jean Westerman and the late Heather Weston, whose contribution to Doveton I have raised in this place before. Let me talk about Les. Community involvement has always been a passion of Les, who holds a life membership of the Oak Avenue Community Hall. The Oak Avenue Community Hall has held neighbourhood meetings and barbecues over the years to bring together the local neighbours. The 75year-old is also a life member at Casey radio and on the committee of Myuna Farm. Every Thursday, Les and the other members at the Doveton club make children's toys out of egg cartons and cardboard boxes. Mr Boyes and his wife Helene have been living in their Oak Avenue home for 40 years. Les and Helene symbolise the Neighbour Day spirit-they have a tremendous amount of pride in their neighbourhood and a commitment to bringing people together to build a strong sense community. I know Les is battling illness. I wish him a speedy recovery. Jean Westerman has been involved in the community of Doveton for over 35 years, particularly in the local opportunity shop at weekly luncheons at the Doveton Baptist Church. There is collectively a group called Salvo Access-volunteers who work at the Cranbourne Salvation Army opportunity shop, who devote a great deal of time to helping needy families in the area. Heather Weston, was a Dovetonite through and through who, sadly, passed away in June of last year, but her legacy as a acts as an inspiration. She overcame the odds and her work influenced countless individuals who crossed her path. When Heather became involved with the Doveton Neighbourhood House she was, in her words, illiterate and often felt that she was 'good at nothing'. Not to be overcome by this, Heather quickly enrolled in basic English reading and writing courses at Doveton Neighbourhood House, forming an affinity with the centre that would see her spend 15 years on its committee, holding the positions of assistant to the treasurer, vicepresident, secretary and president. In fact, Heather spent a total of three years as the centre's president. These are significant achievements in themselves, but Heather's true achievement-and, indeed, where her passion lay-was in inspiring and driving others. She used her success against her plight to empower others in the community to emulate her achievements. One of the quintessential examples of Doveton community spirit is Ruth Murray. For over 10 years, Ruth and her daughter Jenny Colvin have run an annual Christmas BBQ for neighbours, local community members, family and old friends at their home in Power Road, Doveton. Over 150 people are invited to the local BBQ, which of coincides with their amazing Christmas lights display. After eight productive and memorable years, the Doveton Eumemmerring Neighbourhood Renewal project came to an and end on 30 June 2011. There are so many achievements-I am going to run out of time talking about them-and successes of which the Doveton Eumemmerring community can be proud, including the formation of the Doveton Eumemmerring Township Association and creating a community calendar filled with new events including the annual Doveton Show and Australia Day celebratbattler ions, the monthly Open Mic nightthankfully I did not sing in that-the weekly fresh food market at Myuna Farm and establishing the Doveton Eumemmerring Resident of the Year Awards to recognise and celebrate the contributions of residents. Local parks, reserves, paths and facilities have been improved including development of the skate park and fitness stations at Waratah South Reserve, Linden Place playground, local pathway linkages, extension to the Doveton Library and the Rowan Park House redevelopment. A community infrastructure plan has been developed to understand current and future community needs. There have been more than 700 improvements to public housing properties and more than 600 residents have undertaken training or secured employment through supported programs. I have run out of time but this just shows what a great it is, unlike what that person wrote in that damn book. (Time expired) Australasian Order of Old Bastards",169
230,Mr MATHESON,ADJOURNMENT," It is with great pleasure that I rise today honour a select group of community minded people within my electorate who, for want of a better phrase, are a bunch of great old bastards. The group I speak of is, of course, the Camden Branch of the Australasian Order of Old Bastards. The Australasian Order of Old Bastards was begun, fittingly, in a Sydney pub in 1968 by arch bastard Leo Bradshaw MBE and a small band of brothers. This great organisation, which believes in joviality, good friendship and charity, has been faithfully serving the community through fundraising for over 40 years. To date, the Australasian Order of Old Bastards has raised over $5 million dollars for their communities, including over $1.3 million dollars for the Westmead Children's Hospital. Leo Bradshaw, along with his wife Joan, will forever be remembered for their strong commitment to the community by the Leo Bradshaw Renal Research Laboratory at Westmead Children's Hospital. The Camden Branch of the Australasian Order of Old Bastards was founded on the 6 March 2010 and has already raised significant funds for sick children in the Macarthur electorate, donating over $3,000 for the Westmead Children's Hospital renal clinic and laboratory, over $10,000 for the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, $6,000 for the Queensland Premier's flood relief with the assistance of Harvey Norman, $550 for the Starlight Children's Foundation and $400 from members for the purchase of a new BBQ. Working hand in hand with the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, the Camden place Branch of the Australasian Order of Old Bastards has been able to assist Campbelltown and Camden hospitals with fundraising for much needed technical and specialist paediatric equipment. Their contributions hit to home for the Camden branch when one of their very own, Honorary Junior Vice President Declan Robert Sheehy, now aged 10 months, suffered complications after birth and required the use of a foetal monitor incubator, oxygen crib and ultraviolet light. It was this very equipment that the Kids of Macarthur, with support from the Camden old bastards, had purchased. Declan is now fine and leading the next generation of old bastards to come along with the other members of the junior troop Honorary Junior President Jackson Gunn, Honorary Secretary Jaymee-Lee Keaple, Honorary Treasurer Joseph Andriotti and honorary members Aaron Gunn and Riley Auglys. I hope that this junior order will continue to keep the old bastard community spirit alive for many decades to come. Little Declan's story is a very real reminder of just how lucky the electorate of Macarthur is to have so many community-minded people contributing their time, effort and hard earned money towards the many charities and causes of the region. I would like to thank the many members and volunteers of the Camden Branch of the Australasian Order of Old Bastard, along with a number of local businesses and organisations who have helped out along the way. I thank Camden and Campbelltown councils, the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, Pharmacy Express Mount Annan, Rosemeadow and Camden, Harvey Norman Campbelltown and head office, Narellan and Camden MCDonalds, Clintons Toyota, Dilmah Teas, Nulon Australia Products, Greg Went, Wakeboard New South Wales, Greater West Fire Extinguishers, Bunnings Warehouse Narellan, Campbelltown Mall, the workers of Tahmoor Colliery, Kwik Copy, Hoselink Australia, Nepean Engineering, along with the support and assistance of the Camden Narellan Advertiser, Macarthur Chronicle and The District Reporter, who have helped spread the message of the Order of Old Bastards across the Macarthur region. I would also like to thank the committee members for their hard work and dedication to the order, in particular, the President of Camden Order of Old Bastards, 'Big Kev', Mr Kevin Gunn. Being a proud member myself of the Australasian Order of Old Bastards, I think it would be fitting to end with the universal catch cry of old bastards: Whilst ever hops grow on this earth, Let not plain water mar our mirth.",171
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, A most impressive contribution! I thank the member for Macarthur. Southern Sudan,172
232,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT," This Saturday the world will welcome the 193rd country to the international community. Southern Sudan will be the youngest African nation when it is officially inaugurated on 9 July in its capital, Juba. road to independence has not been easy for Southern Sudan, withstanding two decades of civil war which have seen the deaths of more than 2½ million people and the displacement of more than five million people. Many of us have followed over the years the struggle of the Christian and animist people of the south against an Islamist regime in Khartoum and we know that Omar al-Bashir, the head of Sudan, is still wanted by the International Criminal Court. However, in 2005 North Sudan and South Sudan signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which led to the end this civil war. In October of that year the autonomous government was formed in Southern Sudan, in line with the peace agreement. This was followed by two years of tension which saw intense fighting take place, specifically over the disputed oil-rich town of Abyei on the north-south divide, near the Nuba Mountains. That has resumed recently, constituting an issue that has been going on since the 2005 peace agreement. In June this year, governments of both the north and south signed an accord to demilitarize Abyei and allow in a United Nations force of Ethiopian peacekeepers. I must praise the United States government for its role in seeing that a referendum of millions of Southern Sudanese took place peacefully with the cooperation of the government and pressure from the Obama administration on Khartoum. According to the UN, clashes between Sudanese government forces and units of the South Sudan army in Southern Kordofan have led to more than 73,000 people fleeing their homes since 5 June-so the problem there has started again. In 2008 the leaders of the north and the south reached a deal on the terms of a referendum on independence, which was decided in 2011. To their great credit, in The January this year 98 per cent of the 8.5 million people of Southern Sudan, many of whom are illiterate, simply drew a hand with the word 'separation' on it, voting in favour of independence. At the time. I hailed the vote, stating: The people of Southern Sudan have today voted for freedom, for democracy and for peace. Southern Sudan has suffered ... poverty, war, devastation and destruction for too long. Today the people have spoken for a better world. On Saturday we will see the fruit of the Southern Sudanese struggle for independence come to fruition when the independence ceremonies take place in Juba. However, the flourishing of Southern Sudan as a nation can only be successful with the support of the international community. We must not let that region slide back into civil war. Many members of this House have a more intimate involvement with that situation, having many fine immigrants-indeed refugees-from Sudan in their electorates. Despite the momentous vote for independence, Southern Sudan faces enormous obstacles on becoming a new nation. Only 15 per cent of adults can read and write, more than half the population live on less than 75c a day, 47 per cent of the populace is described as being 'food deprived' and the life expectancy at birth is 42. Despite the current 6.7 billion barrels of oil reserves of Sudan, being the nation in general, Southern Sudan is heavily underdeveloped. Prior to its independence, 470,000 barrels of oil were pumped per day, three-quarters of which came from the south and the border regions. Unfortunately, the people of that region have not benefited from that. With reports of crackdowns and violence in the Nuba Mountains and in Northern Kordofan and continued tensions over Abyei, where the oil is produced, Southern Sudan faces an enormous challenge. As the United States Agency for International Development has characterised the situation in Southern Sudan, there is no greater post-conflict reconstruction challenge that has been faced anywhere else in the world. Within our humanity we should strive to give our children better than we ourselves received. If Australia can play its small part in lifting the children of Southern Sudan out of abject poverty, by assisting with the development of universal education and with nation building, we will surely be on our way to alleviating some of the ills that the Southern Sudanese people have suffered. The hope that was shown by the Southern Sudanese people who came out and voted in droves for independence and their belief that the day after tomorrow will be a better one than the one before should show that this newest country, even with its enormous challenges, is capable-as all people are-of overcoming obstacles for a brighter future. I hope to attend the independence celebrations in Southern Sudan, and I know that the people of Australia wish the people of Southern Sudan well. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",172
233,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to address the most dangerous issue facing Australia right now: the Labor-Greens carbon tax. Australians in the majority do not want this tax which will clean out their wallets and cost jobs without doing a single thing for the environment. This debate should be about the best way to achieve a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020. On one hand, you have the LaborGreens tax, which will add hundreds of dollars to the average household budget and cripple our mining and aluminium industries forcing jobs, investment and emissions offshore. On the other hand, you have the coalition's direct action plan, which will use incentives and investment to make a real change in people's habits. The Labor-Greens alliance has made this a debate about party politics. Prime Minister Gillard has sacrificed the will of the people she represents for her own political desires. She has fallen to the whim 'co-Prime Minister' Bob Brown in order to stay in government. The frustration and anger in my electorate of Paterson is palpable. For Labor, politics no longer means representing the people. It means representing self interest. Take, for example, this today. Adela from Duckenfield wrote to me to say: Why are Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan so determined to push this through when there is so much opposition? It will do absolutely nothing to assist in a change of carbon emissions in Australia and yet will cost our country untold amounts. Aaron, from Raworth, wrote: I cannot fathom how this insipid, incompetent, weak, pathetic, directionless, soul-less, foolish government is not getting the message that working Australia will not tolerate this tax, let alone from a prime minister who blatantly lied to Australians. We cannot take more taxing; working families and working Australians are struggling and we have had enough. Please help working families in your electorate Bob. Keep working hard for the people of Paterson and keep working for the will of the silent majority who aren't out there protesting, who aren't pushing the ideals of a green fascist party led by extremists who are holding an incompetent government desperate to hold on to power. We are just trying terms of reference make ends meet. People are desperate to have their say on this nation-changing issue. They have suggested a referendum, plebiscite, new election-the list goes on. These people are not heartless. They want to know what they can do to improve the environment and reduce carbon emissions. They just know that a tax will not achieve it. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister promise yesterday that she would go and meet with the people directly to talk about her tax. I have already sent her an invitation to come to my electorate of Paterson to participate in a town hall discussion. That way, Ms Gillard can address the concerns about job losses and rising household budget pressures. The Prime Minister can also try to explain to local residents how on earth a tax will help the environment. I look forward to her response and yet for some reason I do not think that she will accept. After all, this is the same Prime Minister who promised just days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Her colleague the Treasurer also said in the August before the election: Certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax. And yet, here we are. What an amazing turn around. Talk about being creative with the truth. The people of Paterson do not want a carbon tax. Judging by the number of people calling me from the member for Lyne's electorate, they do not want a carbon tax either. The same goes for callers from the electorates of Hunter, Newcastle, Charlton and Shortland. They call my office because they know they fall upon deaf ears when they ring those members. That is why I am here fighting for the future of our country, which will be so heavily disadvantaged by a carbon tax, not only economically but also environmentally. I urge the Prime Minister and her colleagues to listen to the people who voted for them. I end with a couple of facts. Firstly, there are 146 members of this House of Representatives who ran at the last election with a no carbon tax policy. Only four members in this House ran on a pro-carbon tax policy. Secondly, the Treasurer called the coalition 'hysterical scaremongers' when we tried to tell the people there would be a carbon tax under a Labor government. This debate is about basic democratic principles because the ALP, the Greens and Independents have wrested democracy from the Australian people. The Prime Minister, at the top, is arrogantly defying the will of the people, talking down to them in the name of a dirty deal with the Greens. Talk about dirty deeds done dirt cheap. This is a bad tax. We do not want it and we do not need it. (Time expired) Green, Mr Trevor Amedee, Mr Gary Economy",173
234,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT," congratulate the Clarence Valley Town Crier, Trevor Green, who, in the words of our local paper the Daily Examiner, has 'cleaned up at the 21st National Town Crier Championships in Maryborough Saturday'. I am not too sure how many people still have a town crier but we are fortunate to have one in the Clarence Valley. It is an old and great tradition that we all love. Trevor Green said that he was surprised that he won three out of five of the awards the championships and he paid tribute to some others. There had been a town crier before him, Roy Bowling, who had been there for a long time. Trevor paid tribute to him and said Roy had been a mentor. He said his win was not just about the voice, volume level and control. Clearly, it is about voice clarity, pronunciation, volume control, volume level and the cries-those are assessed-but it is also the costume, known as regalia. He has that custom made, and donated, by Kerri Benson, of Sea Eagle Fashions in Maclean. Maclean is in the neighbouring seat of Cowper but is very close to my electorate. Trevor was quite excited that this had happened to him. I have written him a letter of congratulations. On his first occasion of being the town crier, I was there to see him perform. Of course, everybody was sad to see his predecessor Roy go but it was great to see somebody want to take it up. As well as being the town crier, Trevor Green is a paramedic so he has a very noble day job. Well done, Trevor, and may we continue to hear the town crying go on and continue that tradition. In the same vein, I also congratulate another person in my electorate. Gary Amedee has gone from the farm to fudge. He was a farmer in Tabulam and he has now set I up a business that makes fudge, called Byron Bay Fudge Factory. Byron Bay is a name that a lot of people know, but he has set up the Byron Bay Fudge Factory in Ballina. It is in the local paper Northern Star this week on with a photo of Gary outside his shop, which is a far cry from cattle farming. Gary says he felt good about making fudge, although he said it might be a risky move. Setting up any small business can be seen as a risk but isn't it wonderful that we have people who take that risk. He also said at he had been making fudge for as long as he can remember, since he was five or six. He said his mother taught him how to make itit is his grandma's recipe-but that it was also an art and a science. I make fudge, but for me it is neither an art nor a science. It is a long time since I have made it and I am sure it would not be anything like Gary's. I will just keep eating his fudge. He said: You think I would get sick of eating fudge, but I don't. It's just so good-if I do say so myself. It is wonderful to see someone have that commitment and that sort of courage to set up a small business. Everybody likes fudge, so I am sure he will continue to do well. That leads me into our economy. Often people say, 'I am too scared to do this and that with small business'. If you have a look at our economy we have some really good figures that can get lost in this place, in the media and in the debates that we haveunemployment 4.9 per cent; inflation 2.7 per cent; public net debt is about seven per cent of GDP; RBA interest rate 4.75 per cent; and growth rate 3.3 per cent. When you look at the Aussie versus the US dollar-and I know we always have a debate about who it is impacting on-the upshot is that to have it at 1.0703 is a good figure. Trade surplus was $2.23 billion in May 2011. Australian families depending on one breadwinner pay among that lowest amounts of tax in the world and have become better off under the Gillard government. (Time expired) Sri Lanka",175
235,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT," I am compelled to respond and make some observations in relation to the Channel 4 video which was shown on Four Corners last Monday night in relation to the final days and hours of the Sri Lankan civil war. I do so because in my role as the Deputy Chair of the Sri Lankan Group and my general interest in Sri Lanka there are some issues that need to be put on the record. I say at outset that the images and action shown on that Four Corners program were horrific, brutal and degrading and if they are, in fact, genuine they cannot be tolerated and must be dealt with. I visited Sri Lanka in the last few weeks. There is a process in Sri Lanka to deal with these issues and they are being dealt with by the Sri Lankan government through the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, which has full judicial powers. This commission based on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, post apartheid South Africa. In the meantime the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commissioned a report from an expert panel, which has three experts on it-a South African, an American and an Indonesian. The panel has already reported, basically, on the issues raised on the Channel 4 video. The annoyance that has come from the Tamil diaspora, generally overseas, is the fact that there has been no action on this panel because the Sri Lankan government has rejected the report as fundamentally flawed because the facts have not been proven. Further to that, in the Sri Lankan Daily News on Wednesday, 22 June this year, Professor GL Peiris, who is the external affairs minister, and somebody we met, pointed out that not only has the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission invited international organisations such as the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to provide information about these videos to facilitate the commission's inquiry but, he said: No organization has accepted this invitation extended by the Commission. These organizations are pointing fingers at the government and the Security Forces without making representations to the independent body set up in Sri Lanka probing such matters. the As has been pointed out by the Secretary General, unless Sri Lanka does respond, he has two choices and one would be to launch an investigation with the agreement of the Sri Lankan government. If that does not work the UN Secretary-General, Ban Kimoon, would have to get the United Nations to provide a resolution. None of that has happened. The fact is Sri Lanka is a democratic nation emerging from a 28to 30-year-old is a civil war. It was a brutal civil war where atrocities were committed on both sides. We know that the LTTE, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, were one of the most ruthless killing machines that has ever been known. We visited the north, areas like Pallai, Vavuniya and Jaffna, and we met people on the ground. I went to Manik Farm, for example, with my colleagues where we met over 200,000 people who were refugees. There are now only 17,000. They are free to leave. In fact, a bus pulls up outside the camp and people are free to leave at any time they choose. We discussed this with the people in their homes. They cannot return to their villages because they are still mined. Many of them do not have a village to return to because it was shelled and demolished during the civil war. In fact, the people I spoke to at Manik Farm quite often do not have a place to go to because, as I said, been ruined. I congratulate the Australian government for providing 5,000 houses already. The Indian government has promised 50,000 but has not built one, so it was a very shallow promise. I say to those who want to criticise this democratically elected government in its efforts to provide reconciliation and reconstruction: you need to get across the facts before you slur a democratically elected government like the sovereign state of Sri Lanka. Cunningham Electorate: Mining",176
236,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT," I want to take the opportunity in the adjournment debate tonight to address an area of particular importance to my region, and I acknowledge that the member for Paterson preceded me earlier in this adjournment debate with more of his hot air on the future of the mining industry. It is an industry that is important not only to my region but to me personally. I am a fifth generation coal mining family in the Illawarra region. At the end of this month I will be participating in a very important ceremony that remembers the terrible mining disaster at Mount Kembla in 1902. In fact, three members of my mother's family were killed at the time. I take the future of the industry in my region very seriously. There is no doubt in my mind that we must take action on climate change and this government is pursuing exactly the right direction in achieving that. In doing that we will get the balance right in supporting jobs in areas like mine. Beyond that I have been working with the member for Throsby and with some people from local industry including: the local Australian Industry Group; the i3net, which is a very innovative group of manufacturers who meet and look to advance local industry; AusIndustry's Mr it has John Grace; and a great advocate for the local mining industry, Mr Ray Tolhurst. Ray was known to me previously in his life as a TAFE leader and as a TAFE teacher I worked closely with him, but Ray now represents the mining engineers organisation in my area. For a while now we have been working on a particular project that the federal government has been supporting financially. We launched it last Friday in the electorate. This is a new online service directory that will bring together all of the Illawarra mining technology service and manufacturing businesses in one place, so that we can reach into the capacity for these businesses to be part of the current and what I am absolutely certain will be the ongoing mining boom in this nation. We attended a local manufacturer Ringway at Unanderra. Ringway is a local business that is an electronics and electrical supplier to the mining industry. Ringway Control are a part of i3net that I referred to earlier, the innovative engineering and manufacturing sector in my region. We were joined there by various representatives, including Ray Tolhurst representing the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Illawarra branch and representatives of Ringway business including local representatives of the Ai Group, and we launched this fantastic website. As I indicated, it is an initiative that we believe reflects our confidence and optimism for the future of this sector in the local area. I certainly encourage anybody who is not already on the directory to join up. It is at www.miningsupplierdirectory.com.au. More importantly, we are hoping that mining sectors across the nation wanting suppliers and manufacturers to provide for their boom period will look to this directory to provide new employment and job opportunities to our region. It is a very important capacity building our manufacturing and services sector locally, in particular allowing them to participate and take advantage of the mining boom as it rolls out across the nation. I also want to thank Rod Brown from Ringway who hosted the event and is also the chair of the i3net sector. He gave me a tour. I had a look at a lot of the equipment and the work that they were doing there, particularly around the conveyor belt safety systems, a really good initiative. My father was an electrical mines inspector, so it was very interesting to me to see some of the advances that have occurred in the industry. I thank Rod and his team for their hospitality in taking us through that. I finish up each expressing my great optimism in the future not only of the mining sector in the Illawarra but also of its associated manufacturing base. Vietnam: Montagnards",177
237,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT," Today I speak of the oppression and the persecution of the Montagnard people who live in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Prior to the Vietnam War, the Montagnards lived in hill tribe societies existing primarily through agriculture, hunting and gathering. Today, however, the Montagnards have found themselves marginalised minorities and in the words of Human Rights Watch 'have been repressed for decades'. This is due to an increasing program of ethnic relocations, beginning in the mid-1950s after the withdrawal of the French with groups being moved from the north as the Communist government in North Vietnam began to assert control over the region. The current government of Vietnam continues with this land confiscation and forced relocations as well as targeting Christian Montagnards with religious persecution. There is a long history of issues between the Vietnamese and the Montagnard people for because, while the Vietnamese are racially diverse themselves, they do share language and culture but the Montagnard do not share that commonality. The Montagnards have for several decades sensed that their language and culture were under threat, including land ownership, education, resources and political domination. Formal opposition to the domination by the Vietnamese began in 1958 as the tribes united and even formed a military force, known as the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races. It was no surprise that, when the American forces began to build up in Vietnam, some 40,000 Montagnards fought on the side of the Americans. During the war it is estimated that some 100,000 served alongside the US as allies. It should be remembered that about half the Montagnards are Protestant and 20 per cent are Catholic. We should remember that in 1973 peace accords were agreed to and the conflict entered a ceasefire. The United States in their compliance with the agreement began withdrawing forces. Eventually the North Vietnamese Army and the Vietcong began advancing south and, without the support of the Americans, Saigon and the south finally fell on 30 April 1975. Clearly, the North Vietnamese broke the peace treaty and they took advantage of the demise of President Nixon in 1974 and the reticence of the Democratic Party controlled congress to back the government of South Vietnam with bombing of the north. With the fall of the south retribution followed. Thousands of Montagnards fled Vietnam to Cambodia while several thousand were resettled in the United States. Many Montagnard political and religious leaders were executed by the communists. The Montagnard suffered greatly during the Vietnam War. I have been told that 200,000 died and 85 per cent of their traditional villages were destroyed. Since then their existence has been defined by persecution on the basis of post-war retribution and religious persecution. I am fortunate to have as a constituent a leading Western human rights activist, the Australian lawyer and writer Scott Johnson. Scott has been to the Central Highlands and he has seen the terrible conditions of poverty under which the Montagnards live. Scott has told me that there is no evidence whatsoever of Montagnard resistance movements that advocate armed opposition and violence. Yet there is a paranoia from the Vietnamese government who choose to see the refusal of Montagnards to worship in the state controlled churches as a cover for an independence movement. A report from Human Rights Watch released in March this year reported that since 2001 more than 350 Montagnards have been sentenced to long prison sentences, all based on vague national security charges, because of their involvement in public protests and in unregistered house churches, the only way to worship if you refuse to be in a state controlled church. I find it incredible that such nebulous charges as undermining national solidarity or disrupting security can result in a person being jailed, but that is the reality in Vietnam. I also that Human Rights Watch report that some 25 Montagnard prisoners have died while in custody or shortly after release. I really do wonder how the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam think on these matters. They confiscate land and give it to non-Montagnard people. They oppress those who wish to worship freely and then, when there is resentment and protest, the Communist officials actually wonder why. It seems that this is a case of delusional paranoia. If the Vietnamese government left the Montagnards alone, they would not have such problems. I thank Scott Johnson for his assistance to me and of course I thank him for his great work toward achieving justice for the Montagnards. I conclude by calling upon the government of Vietnam to restore the ancestral lands they have taken from the Montagnards, to release the hundreds of Montagnard religious and political prisoners currently held in Vietnam and to allow religious freedom across Vietnam. Petition: Medical Workforce Petition: Carbon Pricing and Murray-Darling River System",178
238,Mr BANDT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening to present two petitions. The first petition of 13,828 citizens asks the House to ensure that medical research remains properly funded and is resourced into the future. The second petition of 345 citizens requests the House to legislate to put a price on pollution that reduces carbon emissions and to protect the Murray-Darling Basin for future generations. To assist proceedings, I can inform the House that both have been examined by the Petitions Committee and have been found to be in order. The community response to speculation note that the government was planning to cut somewhere in the order of $300 million from medical research in the most recent budget was overwhelming, and the ultimate preservation of medical research funding in the budget is testament to the strength of that community response. The Discoveries Need Dollars campaign united community groups and sector workers from across the country. I congratulate that campaign and the scores of grassroots campaigners-some of whom I hope are watching now and are using the Twitter hashtag '#protectresearch'-who worked to achieve such an important outcome in the budget, particularly in protecting funding to the NHMRC. Had the budget been cut, the consequences would have been disastrous The development of new treatments would have slowed and Australians suffering from chronic illnesses would have had their opportunities for recovery hindered. During the course of the campaign, I was privileged to meet a number of people who are working on trials and new discoveries in my electorate, as well as the people who are benefiting from them. My memory of meeting Pat stands out. She was a diabetic and had been so for many years, but she had spent a year without having to have insulin injections because of a treatment being developed at St Vincent's using eyelets. That treatment has the potential to revolutionise the lives of those who are suffering from diabetes as well as the lives of their families. That is just one of the many forms of research that are being undertaken in my electorate of Melbourne. Had the cuts gone ahead, researchers and clinicians careers would have been impeded. That consequence is a very important one because, as I have said, the electorate of Melbourne has more health and medical researchers than any other electorate in the country and, if we are serious about improving the quality of life of Australians and continuing to lead the world in medical discovery, as many of those people in Melbourne do, we should be steadily increasing funding, not potentially decreasing it. The quality and security of funding is just as important as the amount. One of the things that is increasingly clear is that, because funding is often only on a rolling three-year basis and is so insecure, many young researchers are choosing to go overseas not to broaden their knowledge but because it is one of the few places they can be guaranteed tenure and a secure career. Researchers have obligations, mortgages and rent to pay just like everyone else and their funding, their salaries and their livelihoods should not depend on rolling three-year contracts if they are lucky. Twelve thousand people attended the Rally for Research events held in Melbourne and elsewhere across the country and 15,000 letters and postcards were sent to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the health minister, the mental health and ageing minister, and other local members and senators. Close to 14,000 people signed the petition that I am proud to present today. I know that the government has commissioned a strategic review of Australian medical research funding, with the terms of reference announced today, to better plan the resourcing of the sector, to focus its work on community expectations and to improve accessibility and affordability of disease treatments and diagnosis methods that arise from a properly funded research sector. This is a tremendous outcome from the campaign and I congratulate the minister for taking this step. Parliament should stand reminded of the strength of the medical research community and the expectations of the wider community. Australians value public investment in medical research and will not support any further attempts to undermine the sector. Lastly, I would like to pay special tribute to the staff and directors at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute who coordinated within a very short period of time a fantastic campaign that really rammed home just how important those working in the sector and the broader community consider medical research to be. The timing of the presentation of the second petition regarding a price on pollution could not be more timely. I very much look forward to Sunday and the announcement that we will take the country's first step towards putting a price on pollution. The petitions read as followsSave Health and Medical Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens draws to the attention of the house of the need for funded medical research. Cuts to medical research will halt vital research to diagnose, prevent and treat disease in areas such as; heart disease, obesity, diabetes cancer as well as research on 'closing the gap' improving the health and well-being of indigenous Australia. Cuts will also affect the economy and cause job losses around the county. We there for ask the house to not support any cuts made to Medical Research in the federal budget. from 13, 828 citizens. NA NA NA This petition of certain concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that The 2011 World Environment Day is Sunday, 5 June: the time is ripe for Australia to make two big steps forward for our environment. We therefore ask the House to put a price on pollution that reduces carbon emissions and replaces Australia's dirtiest power stations, like Hazelwood, with clean energy. Furthermore, it's time to get serious about saving Australia's lifeblood - the mighty Murray-Darling - for future generations. The Basin Plan must return enough water to save the Murray Darling river system. 2011 is the year to get serious about safeguarding our environment. This year, put an effective price on pollution and save the Murray-Darling, forever. NA from 345 citizens. Petitions received. Bradfield Electorate: Foreign Investment",179
239,Mr FLETCHER,PRINCIPAL PETITIONER," Last week I held a community meeting in my electorate and one of the issues that was raised by a number of people present was concern about the purchase by Chinese interests of agricultural land, particularly for mining purposes. We had a good discussion at that meeting and a range of views were expressed, including a number of people highlighting the importance to Australia of and foreign investment. This issue has been and getting a lot of scrutiny recently. I want to make three key points in the brief time available: first, to welcome some of the additional scrutiny; second, to make a key point about the two issues involved, on the one hand foreign ownership and on the other hand the impact of mining on agricultural land; third, to highlight the importance of foreign investment. Let me start by saying that I welcome the fact that there are a range of processes underway to give greater policy scrutiny to these questions, including the fact that the coalition has established a working group to deal with this issue. I want to make the point that there are two conceptually separate issues that can sometimes get bundled together as the one issue. The first issue is the general question of foreign ownership of Australian assets, including agricultural land amongst a range of other assets based or located in Australia. That is one issue. The second issue, which is a conceptually distinct issue, is the impact of mining on agricultural land. A range of concerns have been expressed about this issue by residents of affected communities and this is an issue which is, as are many others, always susceptible to further investigation. I think it is important that we do not automatically conflate the two issues and assume that the central question, in thinking about the impact of mining on agricultural land, is the ownership of the mining company. It seems to me that the central question is the tradeoff between the competing uses of land. As I have indicated, I certainly welcome the fact there is scrutiny of both sets of issues. Once that process has been worked through, no doubt there will be some recommendations to consider. My final point is to highlight the importance of foreign investment in the Australian economy and to note, therefore, that it is a factor we should pay very careful regard to as we think about the question of foreign ownership of any kind of asset, including Australian agricultural assets. Australia is a net importer of capital. In the March quarter of 2011, net inflow was $780 billion. Outflows of capital were $1.24 trillion; inflows were $2.02 trillion-in other words, a lot more money came in than went out. It is, I think, quite self-evident, when you look at the Australian economy and the prosperity we enjoy, that a significant contributor to that prosperity has been foreign investment. It is also worth making the point that that foreign investment comes from a wide range of countries. In 2009, the stock of total foreign investment was $3,200 billion. Of that, 27 per cent was from the US, 26 per cent was from the UK and the third biggest source was Japan at 5.4 per cent. Total inflows of foreign investment in the year 2009 were $160 billion and, of that, $94 billion came from the US and $34 billion came from the UK. So the Australian economy has always depended very heavily on the inflow of foreign capital. The prosperity of Australia and its people is heavily dependent, I would argue, upon continuing to have a set of policies and a set of frameworks which are attractive to foreign capital. We are competing with many other countries around the world for investment and that is a factor that we need bear mind as we weigh up all the considerations in this set of issues I have raised-a set of issues which is attracting continuing public scrutiny and on which there is, properly, policy scrutiny. We must bear in mind, I would argue, the importance of foreign investment to Australia's prosperity. Egypt: Coptic Christians Chifley Electorate: Health and Wellbeing",181
240,Mr HUSIC,PRINCIPAL PETITIONER," Recently, during a visit of my mobile office to Woodcroft, I was approached by a number of community members from the Australian and Egyptian Coptic seniors, including Mr Wadi Botros from Hebersham, Samir Hanna from the Universal Peace Federation's Australian peace embassy and Kamal Iskandar. They related stories to me of friends and loved ones suffering in fear of religious persecution in Egypt. While we have obviously been moved by the vision of everyday Egyptians taking such courageous steps to bring democracy to the lives of the many who have sought it, there have been disturbing stories emerging which, to a great degree, cast a shadow on the events we have witnessed. I, like many others, was stunned by the New Year's Day attacks on the AlQiddissin Church, the Church of the Two Saints, in Alexandria, Egypt. Courage and tenacity has driven the Egyptians in their fight for democratic rights, but with this fight there must be an equal determination to honour the right to freedom of religion and culture. I wish to place on record my dismay and opposition to the persecution of Egyptian Copts. They deserve what we all enjoy: freedom, peace, security and the right to practice their religion free from persecution. At a local level, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our Australian Coptic Christian Orthodox community. Approximately 63 per cent of Coptics live in Sydney and one of 14 Coptic churches in the archdiocese of Sydney is in the electorate of ChifleyArchangel Michael and St Bishoy located in Mt Druitt. We are also blessed by the presence of the St Bishoy Coptic Orthodox College, along with many active youth groups and organisations. A special mention goes to the great work of the Coptic Orthodox Youth Association, formerly the Coptic Youth Centre. I acknowledge and commend their local work and seek to reassure them of my abiding commitment to represent their concerns to the Australian government. I also wanted to let the House know of an exercise I was very pleased to be associated with a few weeks ago. I have previously indicated that nearly a third of the Chifley electorate is under the age of 19. Ensuring that more young people maximise their time in education and training, as well as ensuring they maintain a focus on their own health and well-being, are critical priorities area. That is why I was so keen to host a recent visit to three local primary schools the Sydney Kings NBL team. Three young players-Ben Hollis, Jarrod Weeks and Nathan Wilson-along with coach Ian 'Moose' Robilliard and assistant coach Tim Hudson dropped into Willmot Public School, Tregear Public School and Plumpton's Good Shepherd Primary School. While there, they engaged the students in some basketball exercises. They also delivered some important messages to the students about the need to build their bank of personal skills by staying on in school as long as they can and about ensuring they eat well and exercise often to see the benefit this generates for their personal health. It was a sensational day and the 200 or so students-and the players-enjoyed the opportunity to mix and learn about these important issues. I want to thank the teachers and staff for their help, especially principals Maureen Johnson, Russell Hawkins and Mary Creenaune for helping with the organisation of the day. I was also especially grateful to the Sydney Kings for their time on the day and was really pleased to hear from the players how impressed they were with the students and how much they enjoyed the visits. A person central to the organisation of the day was Bob Turner. It is rare to describe someone as iconic, but, when it comes to Sydney basketball, Bob Turner wears that label well. I was not the only Sydneysider celebrating the return of an NBL side to our great city last year. Bob Turner played a healthy part in making that happen and, in his own way, he helped draw some of the biggest crowds in the league. It was terrific to be present for some fantastic home games at the Kingdome. Bob was also instrumental in beginning to refashion the franchise's for our approach to community engagement. It became something of an emerging, fastby growing passion for Bob-using his love of the game to try to shape closer links between the sport and community. Just as so many Sydneysiders were delighted that Bob was able to bring the Kings back to Sydney, there are many who are saddened by the fact he is moving on to other ventures. He may have left the Kings, but basketball is ingrained in his DNA and it is great to hear that he is moving to set up a not-for-profit organisation called B'Ball4A11, designed to use the best aspects of the sport to open up opportunities for young people doing it tough. I wish Bob and his wife Alison every success and happiness in future endeavours and I thank them for their commitment to the game of basketball in this country-for what they have done and what Bob Turner will do.

And the fact to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous enormity of that challenge. We know that, within really urgent one. I noted some of the comments by the member reprised by the member for Durack. In particular, COAG Reform Council found that data to monitor education was not currently available. But what always important to look at what he does COAG Reform Council reported that the work will be in place for future years. So I caution House, not to make misleading use of statements COAG Reform Council. The member for Sturt also failed to mention that left us with no adequate national mechanism early childhood education. The member for Sturt coalition government's policies that left an access to early childhood learning. So, when deficit of policy, resources and support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, we started the massive task of improving service very inadequate base-the inadequate base when we finish, every child, no matter where quality preschool program delivered by qualified education resources that they need to I recently released a detailed blueprint describing to early childhood learning is achieved for all The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues including the supply of places, Additionally, I should make mention of the Action Plan agreed through COAG, signed off binds both the Commonwealth and state jurisdictions to make sure that our efforts in Indigenous members know, all aspects of school funding funding model for schools to be put in place from 2013. I will make one final comment about the contributions that attendance is a key and important issue especially work closely with education authorities attendance is given the priority that it both school and, again, in the provision of trade those in the Northern Territory. doubled federal investment in Australian school government. That is the salient fact as we to make sure that every child, regardless of where is that this government has set ambitious targets students, to lift our efforts to meet the the aim of closing the gap, that task is a for Sturt about these targets, and they were the member for Sturt mentioned that the our commitment regarding early childhood the member for Sturt failed to mention-it is not say as much as what he does-was that the to collect those datasets is well advanced and the member for Sturt, when he comes into this and commentary by institutions such as the that it was the previous coalition government to actually collect data on participation in failed to mention that it was the previous unacceptable number of young Australians without we came to government, we were faced with this to enable young Australians, including young to get the best start in life that they can.

Of course, as are currently under review, with the new of the previous speakers. I too agree in education for Indigenous kids, and we want to and school systems to make sure that needs and deserves-and I will have more to say NA about that in the coming months.

We turn a blind eye. employment of truancy officers to make sure are not attending school and that something expectation is that children will go to school, 'Well, there's nothing we can do about it.' I believe there is something we can do about attendance. I further believe that to not do from the responsibility of making sure their extrapolate, is certainly a denial of the human compared with genocide, because we are guilty that create outcomes for Australian citizens. the denial of Indigenous children's rights. Everyone but if you are Indigenous we do not insist mainstream, we do. Parents who do not send brought to account. But if you are an Indigenous ignorance. We do not even expect it. I hear employees of Indigenous agencies say: Indigenous people.' I think that is horrendous-totally we should not apply the same rigour in our requirements to mainstream society, and part of that requirement responsibility and it is accepted generally at you are an Indigenous parent, it We need to change that. We need to work on correctness. We have already done so much expectations and their role as part of mainstream much damage. Well-intentioned decisions resulted denied our responsibility of insisting that mainstream families and accept education as place that school attendance in Indigenous remote the norm. And it is accepted by all and sundry to drive 2,000 kilometres to attend a funeral stayed for three months, and that is okay because that children should be denied their human rights what is culturally correct. There is a far greater need today for tough funding programs and a change in the commonly Indigenous program but not really expect high is an Indigenous program.

It could almost be as parliamentarians if we do not enact laws We are contributing to an ongoing sin, and that is has a right to an education in this country, that you attend an institution. If you are their children to an educational institution are parent there would appear to be very active 'Look, there's nothing we can do. They're just unacceptable. There is no reason why at law to Indigenous people as we do is to send kids to school. It is a parental law that it is a parental responsibility-unless seems. Then we turn the blind eye. a policy and even, dare I say, ignore political damage to the Indigenous population, their Australian society. We have already done so in the denial of opportunity, because we Indigenous families maintain the same culture as the norm. I can tell my colleagues here in this communities is not the norm; it is far from as being okay, because, 'Well, the parents had and they were going to go for a week but they it is culturally appropriate.' I do not accept on the basis of our current interpretation of love: the application of rigour in Indigenous held attitude that we will fund an performance and positive outcomes, because it this is perhaps not the actual situation, but will say, 'We have got a program.

NA This year, it is important that we communicate committee did. We need to learn how they manage is a key part of why the recommendations out because young people have said, 'This is what the minister does respond to that, because how they need things done. That engagement youth reference group that I meet on regular was highlighted as one of the most important Admittedly, this is an older age group, covering serious issues with me about online safety of social media sites is as much a threat to them an opportunity to engage and to When you listen to young people it is interesting up on Facebook are not necessarily the things aware of some of the Facebook issues, such as Given their exposure to online scams and self-harm drawn into engaging with these sorts of websites were very keen that education should start very young. One thing that really concerned me was that days a week for some of our young people. That who were perhaps subjected to physical bullying young person can become the target of cyberbullying a pack dog mentality whereby everybody gets create major social and emotional problems on-to put it bluntly-in physical life can be to being bullied online as well. They are quite vulnerable. The young people told me that they were the fact that they were being bullied on the with internet connection, their own computer want to lose that connection. One of the barriers needed was the fact that they were often too not want to lose access. They were worried react-that they would say, 'If that's what happening And of course it is so important to them for their parents or others in authority when this happens. We need to give young people the tools fantastic if there were more younger people young people, telling them: 'This is what happens This is us on Facebook. Here is our page, and shouldn't be doing.' All of those things matter what they can and cannot do safely. I went to one of my primary schools and Facebook. These are children under the age 13 to be on Facebook, but 75 per cent of the directly with young people, as the their issues and how they see things. That of this report will be useful and valuable, we need; this is the world we're in.' I hope that the young people have said what they need and with young people is very important. I have a occasions. Interestingly, this year cybersafety issues these young people are facing. years 10 through 12. They raised really and even about being comfortable online. The use and a challenge for them to deal with as it is be part of what young people do. to learn that some of the things that come they want. The young people made me very 'sexting', when we were having our discussion. websites and the fact that they could be and the behaviour that goes with that, they cyberbullying happens 24 hours a day, seven in itself is a major challenge. Those of us were able to get away from it. However, a that is then circulated to others. It is like involved and picks on that young person. It can for that young person. Those who are picked the same young people who are very susceptible often concerned about talking to an adult about cyberscene. Whether it was their mobile phone or access to the internet at home, they did not to these young people getting the help they scared to tell their mum or dad because they did that that was how their mum and dad would to you online then you just can't use it.' so many reasons, so often they do not engage with to manage this themselves. I think it would be actually delivering cybersafety messages to other in your world. This is what we do online. this is what you can and can't or should and to young people. They actually want to know asked the young people there how many were on of 12. We know that they are supposed to be over young people in that class put their hands up. NA They were all on Facebook. I asked them, 'How to be on Facebook?' Some of them said 16, receipt of inappropriate content as a result owns the photos, the words and everything else as so many men do not read the fine print-more print-the situation is the same with young aware that Facebook owned everything they young boys were not as aware. A lot of young they had deleted something, that material I heard different stories about young people's some parents who would take photos of their on Facebook. Any mature age predator would person was going to and where they could access of issues that we need to manage. But it is not just the physical side, which not understand. I asked one young school child it was almost like a competition-I need to with the most, the risk is greater. I asked them, they replied, 'because they are my friends.' person or a person of your own age?' The answer the simple things that a young person under Because they are young and innocent they assumed was indeed a friend and of the same age But it was not just that. I asked them, friends?' as one young person had. They replied, dad. We talk about when we are going on holidays. grandma cannot come and look after the house when it was their birthday, when it was mum's a period of time these young people will be currently are, because collating the information others an opportunity to steal their identity collect enough information to change their password. So there are some real issues facing young there alive and well. That is just on the Facebook websites. But then there is the issue of using other things people might do online. Equally, I have concerns about sexting. impact on young people. At some stage, perhaps a special friendship with another young person relationship and they may send photos of avenue or another those images can end up incredible amount of damage. I had evidence people and the value they place in themselves. old are you saying you are when you sign up and some said 18. Those children would be in of that. Also, they were not aware that Facebook they put on Facebook. I hate to say it, but just men than women do not read the fine boys on Facebook. More of the young girls were put on that website, such as photos, but the people were not aware that, despite the fact that was still out there and would be there forever. experiences on Facebook. I even spoke to children in their school uniforms and put them then know exactly what school that young them if they chose to. So there are a range is something that young people on Facebook do how many friends they had on Facebook, and be the one with the most. But, in being the one 'Do you actually know all these people?' 'Yes,' I asked, 'Do you know whether it is a 60 year-old was that, no, they did not know. These were the age of 12 was not necessarily aware of. that everybody they accepted as a friend as them, which quite often they were not.

I am hoping that the minister follows roles in parliament to do our best out in the and keep them aware and alert. I encourage can do something like that for the people you engaging with other young people, because I go to schools and meet fabulous young and they want information and to be safe. They use this medium and they are going to. Part them the tools to be safe, aware and alert When they start doing tax and banking online lifetime commitment. That is equally as important. we heard so many stories of mature-age people scams and attacks. Right throughout the community this place is seeing constantly in the papers website. It was brought up so often by these something that influenced how happy or not their life simply through this cyberworld that done to them in an emotional and physical sense. This is a very timely report. As I said, young people is critical to the results that all of the committee who were so involved in people deal with the issues that they have. and everyone involved. I am hoping that this people in a direct sense in their own safety engage with the internet and that when they and protected and can pass that knowledge onto others. The one thing I say to young people is to them at school or wherever they are in a social either go very quiet and not want to read that somewhere else and then come out visibly Australia on other matters with young people young people, 'Be prepared to ask your mates: upset when they receive a message-be it them whether they are okay because quite often ask that question and encourage them to get else who can help but not someone that do about the fact that he had just received a naked. According to the Australian on that particular photo they are engaging in So these are the issues. The employer was also had received the photo. For that young person, photos to someone, they will be there forever. 1 to 3 in the report are very many of those. I encourage all of us in our community to inform and educate young people members to read this report and think how you meet. Again, I like the idea of young people they will take so much more notice of that. people with all the good intentions in the world want to be aware and alert but they want to of what we need to do with this report is give in a way that will carry through to mature age. it could evolve into online security that is a I was involved in a previous inquiry where who were subject to various forms of online now, I would think that every member in the latest report about a young person on a social young people from high schools as being they were at school and how they could cope in they live in and the actual damage that could be it is extremely relevant, and the engagement of this report has delivered. I would, again, commend it. I see this as an opportunity to help young I commend the report, the chair, the deputy chair report will be the beginning of engaging young and in their own futures in whatever way they are online they are able to enjoy it and be safe pay attention if they see a young person around sense and see them receive a message and message in front of them or go to the toilet or upset. We have a good program in Western that is called 'Are You Okay?' I say to these are you okay? When you see them visibly a computer message or other message-just ask they are not and they just might need you to support, whether it is from you or from someone they would perhaps fear would take away the NA technology that is often their link to being engaging.

When they they can become quite worried and fearful. we can do to empower young people to stay safe feel that they are in control. There is a recommendation that allows people, whether they be parents and do not know. For young people it was a different issue. comfortable with it that every now and technicalities and localities and are less report. We as a committee did a survey. I think and select committees to directly go to young by the committee and over 7,000 responses directly what they had to say. That was an important the chair, Senator Dana Wortley, and the deputy very hard on this. The chair definitely took dedication. Hearing directly from This being a new area, it is at times difficult people have experienced bullying, for example-or recommendations that has come out is, while about cyberbullying, to centralise that and access information about where to go recommendation. Another area that we looked at is what is young people spend most of their time at school to look at training teachers on how to watch issue. We do not want them to preach to young know a lot more than a lot of older people sometimes we want to teach them how to support young We want to teach them how to intervene if cultures within school environments are recommendations about. There are also some regulatory recommendations concerning young people. A lot of people things like Facebook. While there is a lot of of the issues that I raised in the committee was notification. Privacy settings get changed mature, their link to the world and their link to report. I commend it to the House. going to speak very briefly, but as a member I would like to commend the committee's young. I was very pleased to be a part of this a variety of different stakeholders and people who get caught up in some of these issues on committee time and time again is that parents do not know what is happening on the internet Part of the recommendations are looking at what on the internet but also empower parents to in the report for a self-assessment tool or young people, to gauge exactly what they know They are so familiar with this technology and so again they do get caught out on some of the fearful about this. This was a very wide-ranging it is unique for House of Representatives, joint people. There were 60,000 comments received from young people so that we could hear part of the committee's work. I must commend chair, the member for Mitchell. They worked this up with a lot of passion and a lot of young people was critically important. to find out where to go to report things-if to learn that you are not alone. One of the a lot of great tools have come out on what to do have a portal through which people can directly and what to do. This is a really important happening in schools and with teachers. A lot of and with teachers during the week. We need out for this issue and how to be involved in this people because, as I have said, young people about how to navigate the internet. But people in the constructive use of the internet. there is a problem online. Teacher training and things that this report makes some very good about privacy. This is not just an issue do not know what to expect when they go on to information out there, it is not always clear. One the fact that privacy settings are made without and then suddenly your information has become NA available after you have set up that Facebook your privacy. When a setting changes, you are that notification is not very clear. When it offensive material is put up, there is room somewhat restricted because this is an international we can look at to help ensure that people are safe.

However, it is also evident that and the reporting of suicide, including youth the committee acknowledges that the ABS has reforms to improve the accuracy and quality ongoing.

Risk and protective factors are also categorised present-that is, individual, social and broad and protective factors within each of the three listed in the report as:  gender (male)  mental illness or disorder  chronic pain or illness  immobility  alcohol and other drug problems  low self-esteem  little sense of control over the circumstances  lack of meaning and purpose in life  poor coping skills  hopelessness  guilt and shame The risk factors for social are:  abuse and violence  family dispute, conflict and dysfunction  separation and loss  peer rejection  social isolation  imprisonment the Committee notes Recommendation 28 of the relevant public agencies) to record and track suicides years.

The report lists commonly cited risk categories. The risk factors for individual are NA  poor communication skills  family history of suicide or mental  illness The risk factors for contextual are:  neighbourhood violence and crime  poverty  unemployment, economic insecurity  homelessness  school failure  social or cultural discrimination  exposure to environmental stressors  lack of support services The committee understands that there is a complex and cautions against an overly simplistic accurate and comprehensive data and an improved protective factors on young people are The committee recognises, however, that, populations or groups at increased risk of suicide, identify individuals at risk-hence the need understands that the main value of this information inform the development and appropriate implementation youth suicide and to enable effective Current approaches to suicide prevention report, including recently announced additional government. I would like to mention that intervention to the last election. We committed early psychosis intervention centres in major were to be based on the existing EPPIC targeted care for young Australians aged 15 episode psychosis. The centres would have provided and prevention of relapse. Four hundred design, service evaluation, workforce development, management, home and mobile care, and vocational psychosis intervention centres. Forty million capital costs of the centres.

One of the difficulties who need support and ensuring they get reservations with the use of the term 'gatekeeper', diverse range of individuals who have regular include family, friends, teachers, youth workers, array of factors associated with suicide view of youth suicide and its causes. Access to understanding of the influence of risk and needed to support an improved understanding. while this will assist the identification of it will still not be possible to precisely for early intervention strategies. The committee is to provide a good evidence base to of strategies for reducing rates of evaluation of the impact of interventions. in Australia are considered in chapter 3 of the funding targeting suicide prevention by the we in the coalition took a policy of early to provide $440 million in funding towards 20 metropolitan and regional areas.

274,Ms ONEILL,MAIN COMMITTEE," I commend the report, which I think were fulsome and absolutely as we explored that territory. I rise in this Representatives Standing Committee on Health early intervention programs aimed at preventing sense also with pride, that this work is being securing much better life outcomes for others record as having lost their life to the tragedy around the community we hear these stories and have on the members of our community. The reality is that roughly 2,000 young Australians year due to suicide. They account for 20 per cause of death, after accidents, amongst young males is one in four, a much higher rate than for young females are also higher than they seven deaths where, for boys, it is one in four. This issue is of such importance to so many committee of the 42nd Parliament and the work As a new member, this is the second report which we completed, which was commenced with 10 core recommendations. In terms of how see it. The first two really talk about recording considerable observations on that. We found data in particular jurisdictions was quite difficult, jurisdictions was almost impossible. So this action. The third recommendation essentially Then there was a cluster of recommendations coordination and the need for a holistic Department of Health and Ageing, we made leadership role in the facilitation of the sharing that, in each of these jurisdictions, people government departments have responded-with implementing. The problem is that across jurisdictions-even those great resources are unknown to others. community education and other agencies was needed further attention. I have mentioned the that out across the nation, you can see that A holistic response really was the recommendation. this issue. It is not one agency or one issue government response that is required in terms cultural identity, employment status and educational, figured prominently in some of the indicators they were so desperate they felt there was no we live. We have people lining up from all the member for Swan for his comments on reflected the sentiments that we shared place today to speak to the report of the House of and Ageing Before it's too late: inquiry into youth suicide. It is with sadness, but in a undertaken at this level with the intention of on behalf of people who are now, sadly, on the of suicide. As members of parliament moving we are very sensitive to the impact that they in the 14to 24-year age group die each cent of all deaths. It is the second most common people. Tragically, the rate of death in young suicide deaths amongst older men. Suicide rates are for older females. They account for one in people, but I want to applaud the work of this of the secretariat from that time to this time. I have spoken to this week on important work in the 42nd Parliament. This report came up they covered areas, this is essentially how I and reporting, and the member for Swan made as we were taking evidence that trying to get and then to seek any comparability across is an area that needs serious review and serious dealt with research going forward. that related to DoHA, the national response. In terms of a recommendation for the a recommendation that they need to take a of resources. What was really heartening was have responded-agencies have responded and a range of resources that they are using and within jurisdictions-some of We also noticed that linkages between something that was not well constructed and problems within jurisdictions. If you amplify national coordination remains a problem as well. I think this outlines the complexity of that can be attacked here. There is a whole-ofof dealing with a whole person. Those areas of social and economic disadvantage all of young people's journeys to the point where future for them in this amazing country in which around the world who want to come and live here. NA We have tragically young Australians who feel they give up that opportunity In the time that I have remaining I would 8, 9 and 10. I want to do that particularly because on record a brief story of an occasion in about it. In 2000, I had the benefit of having and in drug and alcohol reform come to Australia. Australian educators, who have absolutely, and young people. The Swedish people asked you have a student who presents with drug steady responses: a low-order response, 'Provide other agencies.' The Swedes asked, 'What if there drugs to school or having drug issues or reports escalate it. We would attempt to try and connect could not really continue in this way.' With expulsion. The Swedish response I thought was you do then?' Thinking it was a language explanation of the process. The Swedes replied: question remains: what do you do then?' I think that is the question that is at the heart There is wonderful work being done in schools because of the outstanding work that teachers who might be at risk. Our wonderful schools school fence into local community and health right when we look at the statistics To emphasise that, I want to put on record recently of a young woman we met who was in back on track, a very intelligent young girl of the risk factors that the member for Swan situation where there had been family breakdown. adolescent years. She had felt isolated from some period of time but she was the first to She reached the age of 17 and showed up at 17th birthday was a form to fill out for me she was sent away from school. That is not the schools. It points to a resourcing problem for many job is this. Is it my job to really attend people? In my experience previously I had Institute of Mental Health to do some qualitative national MindMatters program. That program But in that research it became very evident who understood the need for care for young assist and also understood the implications of so disconnected from a hopeful future that for life. It is not a small thing. like to particularly speak to recommendations 7, of my experience as a teacher. I want to put 2000-quite a long time ago now when you think some Swedish experts who worked in education They were speaking to some outstanding without doubt, amazing commitment to education these Australian educators, 'What do you do if and alcohol problems?' There was a series of support to the student, try to link them into is a second incident, with a student bringing of this?' The Australians said: 'We would them into agencies outside. But the school a third incident generally it triggered an quite interesting. They said, 'Well, what do problem, the Australian educators repeated an 'Yes, we understand what you said. But our of how these young people got to this point. and, happily, our suicide rate is not higher are doing in terms of identifying young people are connecting outside the boundaries of the support agencies. But clearly we have not got it on what we are confronting. a story of evidence we heard in Adelaide a community setting and trying to get her life who faced a lot of difficulties, and she had many identified evident in her life. She was in a She had had an unstable upbringing in her her peers. She continued to attend school for admit she had become quite a problem in school. school on that day. She said, 'My present on my to leave that school.' Because she was a problem case in most schools but it is the case in some schools but it also points to a question of whose to the mental health and well-being of some young the real pleasure of working for the Hunter research analysis of the rollout of the is a very powerful tool that schools are using. that there were teachers in the secondary setting people and intervention when they needed to curriculum planning that could have positive or NA negative mental health outcomes for kids. But gathered that I read where a teacher of mathematics nothing to do with the mental health and well-being person, who was obviously dedicated to teaching their professional identity framed in terms mathematics, that had somehow become divorced social responsibility to look after the That is why I think recommendations 7, situation I have attempted to outline in those the Australian government, in consultation government stakeholders, establish partnerships community-based service providers to ensure facilitating referral of students to external make this recommendation is in some ways a little the jurisdictions. For example, in Victoria funding requirement of local community agencies seek links with their local schools. That was been in the situation in my own office at the support for students with local agencies and actually cavernous cracks that open when agencies are centre of their role definition and when we different agencies. The eighth recommendation is that the Authority include social development education national curriculum for primary and secondary recommendation. ACARA is undertaking significant of the national curriculum. The reality is that hungry or physically or mentally unwell then zero-sum game if you are not going to enable This recommends that there be a course for that. In addition to the students being mentally that teachers need to be mentally healthy forget to look at those who are going to provide under pressure. It is a false assumption that their life that they come to school equipped real and pressing needs of students who are further down the track than that. The ninth committee recommendation is education for older secondary school students them to be better prepared for moving from and to make them aware of the full range of services from child to adult services. The reality students who participate in further and higher transitioning from one place to another, and there was also one piece of evidence that was said, 'I teach mathematics. What I do has of the kids in my class.' I sense for that and a long-term teacher, that while they saw of information and skill development in from their ethical, moral, spiritual and whole person in their care in the classroom. 8, 9 and 10 really do something to address the couple of vignettes. Recommendation 7 is that with state and territory governments and nonbetween departments of education and continuity of care for school leavers by counselling services where appropriate. The need to surprising, and I do note differences across I became quite aware some years ago that it was a and health based agencies that they actively not the case in New South Wales. Sadly, I have university trying to make phone calls to get being told, 'That's not our job.' These are not working with a person's well-being at the have got this, I suppose, boundary riding between Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting and mental health as a core component of the schools. This is a very significant reform at this point in time of the whole if, as an educator, you have a student who is investing in attempting to get them to learn is a them to feel well about where they are. students to learn. But I would like to add to healthy and well, we need to attend to the fact and well. Sometimes recommendations for youth the services for the youth, and teachers are every teacher has things so perfectly aligned in with resources enabling them to respond to the at suicide ideation stage, for example, or even that social development and mental health should include specific components to assist school into the workforce and higher education available to assist them as they transition is that, as we move to increasing the number of education, we are dealing with students who are that is a risk factor. 'Where do I belong? How do NA I fit in? What skills do I have that make it attention if I do not look like I am going too well?' In my experience in the university sector what Nel Noddings calls 'ethics of care'-that beings who come into their classrooms. Sadly, think that it is about creating numbers, data sacrificed. Sadly, some students do not make disappear. I hear that Swedish question again: happens now? The end of the story from the invested so much in these young people-they provided health, education, resources and wonderful adulthood. Can there be any more important there and then as we launch them into that? The final recommendation is a critical one. mental health awareness.

Although the answer, I suicide remains such a taboo subject in our allowed to talk about it and family members death, how does the grieving process really get about it and get a better understanding of what learn from that experience. by the member for Hasluck in what I thought was some of the very real concerns where the ones who are left behind-have so many questions something they may have missed?

I impropriety or anything like that. I am just authorities are sometimes under implied pressure circumstances where it is likely the death was deliberate but there remained an element Whether the figure is 2,000 or 3,000 is probably discussion here today, but it does inform our action as a nation.

Deputy Speaker Georganas, because I want to have before us and that we are discussing today, and in particular my Nationals colleague regional and rural perspective to the committee. the committee to visit Mackay, given some issues had moved on from the visits and that Parliament. To get to the report, the statistics that are one in five deaths in the 15-24 age bracket suicides. It is mentioned that suicide is the accidents. We have to wonder, as is outlined accidents may actually be suicides themselves is not quite clear what the cause is. The report quarters of young people who commit suicide rural areas is three times higher than that of statistics could be understated, as the report remain higher with women, men are more likely This highlights the need to increase research into they are getting the help that they need. in submissions to the Standing Committee on and workforce participation inquiry, Dr Barnes and you have properly heard lots of stats about that. five Australians will experience some type of mental common is depression and anxiety. a fatal illness. We have some really shocking stats 40 people a week are killing themselves and, of every individual is actually leaving a bereaved which then impacts on their mental health suicide today by highlighting the importance of taking mental health care seriously and providing those suffering a mental disorder. In 2006 the biggest investment in mental health by any billion being committed over a five-year period their families and their carers. A commitment to hope that this would include support of early of youth suicide, as these lives are certainly am not into the whole black armband concept that one of the issues that I believe is quite I am very glad that you are in the chair, Mr personally commend you on the report that we along with all the members of the committee the member for Parkes, who no doubt brought a When I first came to this place I tried to get that we have got there, but I understood it the public work was mainly done in the 42nd outlined in it are quite shocking, like the fact that and one in three in the 20-24 age bracket are second most common cause of death after traffic further in the report, how many of those when we have single-vehicle fatalities where it goes on to highlight that more than threeare male and that the suicide rate of people in their counterparts in cities. The fact that those says-and there is certainly evidence outlined to NA that effect-is in itself shocking. The latest 2009-and, as I said, they are probably underestimated-and between 15 and 25, there were 259 suicides rates, these understated rates, since we began young people who have committed suicide I want to get to the subject of statistics, statistics for the Mackay region. One report, showed that we were, sadly, right up there. to 2004 in terms of per capita suicide rates that seems to have dropped somewhat in the following of being the region with the fifth highest suicide all done before the spate of youth suicides House, and I do want to touch on that issue again. If anything, I think that the rate of youth Mackay has this terrible suicide rate; it used being the second worse in Queensland. That is of the mining boom, is financially advantaged. disadvantaged. We have families on high shiftwork, with fathers and husbands, often days on, four days off in mine work, or worse from mining pay a high social price for living high prices. There are currently 30 to 40 homeless or experiencing severe family breakdown mining boom. I state that because I really electorate to feed into this report. Again, I want to reflect, in this place, experienced in 2008. I will read from a report from 4 September 2008 entitled 'Suicide watch'. It says: POLICE and community groups are working together after their friend, a boy, 16, hanged himself The traumatised youths are now sleeping at the Street, to ensure no other member The death of the youth … was followed by prompted calls for a heightened awareness of the issue. It was certainly a disturbing time for prominent. But I have to say that the Youth known as YIRS One Stop Youth Shop, transformed crisis centre, with staff monitoring and talking the things that needed to be done to ensure that want to refer to Dannielle Wiseman who is Shop. I have a statement of witness that the use in this respect. It really is a detailed to allay any concerns, but she talks about She says: figures for suicide cited in the report are from show that, among those aged in that year. That means that, based on these sitting this week, there would have been two and, by the time we finish, another two. as outlined in the report, and I had to dig to find put out by the Department of Health and Ageing, Mackay City part A was ranked second from 2001 overall-not just youth suicide rates. Thankfully, years, but we still have the reputation rate in Queensland. That, I have to say, was in Mackay which I outlined previously in this suicide in the Mackay region has grown. As I said, to be the fifth worse, but I am told it is now up to in contrast with the view that Mackay, because In fact, Mackay is extremely socially incomes but they are being fragmented by wives as well, being away from home. It is four than that. Families without the high incomes in a boom town with astronomical rents and young people per month that are identifying as in the Mackay region as part of the want to give the perspective of the Dawson on the disturbing series of events that Mackay in our local newspaper, the Daily Mercury, to protect a vulnerable group of street kids in an abandoned house on Alfred Street.

I a service manager for the YIRS One Stop Youth police took, which Dannielle has given to me to and heart-wrenching report. The names are removed YIRS providing service there and what they did. NA It was decided that the YIRS Service would be available from volunteers and community members. YIRS assisted in the coordination of round the available at all times. They also assisted in the distribution of donated use on the grounds. She goes on to say that the group of children involved in this were personally took possession of: … a number of items which were likely to have group. The response lasted for 10 days and nights that was done by those people in this But we do have a startling lack of services John Mendoza studied our mental health services community had: … very little capacity to respond to the needs of those At the very best, less than a third of the people probably only 1 to 5 per cent are getting care that's He also said: None of that service infrastructure exists in Mackay constantly seeing people discharged being That was a disgraceful indictment on the state Going back to the report: I have not read to read it at length. Some of the recommendations improvement of services, particularly ones has come in there about headspace. Headspace something that actually works in this field. I refer again to the police statement that she mentions the coroner-and there is a suicides in Mackay-and says: I believe there should be a strong recommendation the YIRS servicebe provided with additional funding. This would provide people to prevent a similar situation such as In addition I believe that the establishment of Shop Inc would allow the Service to expand and Region. This would allow more clinical responses problem. I absolutely concur with what Dannielle says expansion of these services.

Now that this body of work take its recommendations, to consider them and Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report to comment on the committee's report, of billboard and outdoor advertising. I a mother of two young girls. My interest in the society on my two girls has sparked a particular public comments recently about the importance the public domain. Like many others in the NA community and some organisations specifically inappropriateness of images in the public children, I was waiting to see what the committee that I am bitterly disappointed. It is telling doing what you have been doing.' It is as effective out. It is almost a waste of time for the committee then gone through the draft report and corrected it. The committee has essentially recommended one last chance. It has rejected calls for G-ratings for advertisers to be named and shamed online would argue that this would be as effective Outdoor advertising is in a different category public space. It is privileged space. It is open park benches. This unique character of outdoor and that is what has brought it to the attention about the issue. On the one hand the report acknowledges regulation but then actually stops short of regulation. They say this for two apparent reasons. surprise, surprise. The other is that comparable total and utter cop out. The test should be: children to view and be affected by? What continually bombard our children? The medical death by a thousand cuts; they are affecting are affecting them later on in life. This is the astounded that this did not weigh more heavily committee stated: Even though the Committee does not consider content is warranted, the Committee expresses its needs to be more rigorous and transparent in order That is not going to happen. If you want evidence, media of late on comments by the advertising Advertising and media groups were putting a insisting they were a vote of confidence Of course they would, because that I also refer you to the following quote from Alina Bain: We note the Committee has not recommended shows that they have taken into account the low Codes, which indicates that our system is working well. No, it does not indicate that the system much concern out there in the community if Bain has actually looked at the medical evidence, impact that inappropriate advertising-highly established to comment on the domain and the premature sexualisation of young report would come up with. I have to say the advertising industry, 'It is okay, you can keep as a slap with a wet lettuce. It is a total cop to have sat and listened to evidence and that the outdoor advertising industry be given on advertising billboards and it has called if they put up inappropriate images. But I as Fuelwatch and Grocery Watch. to other sorts of advertising.

This is the reality of what is happening to oversexualised images-which is what currently advertising-we leave open a range of social, young people.

I believe the will be adopted by industry will work to oversexualisation of advertising. The committee classification system that was submitted by rating for all outdoor advertising. However, Law, this could have the effect of excluding advertising illicit drug awareness and sexual health messages. to industry to improve its processes.

During there were seven public hearings-in Canberra, submissions offered, we saw movement from that the community is concerned with sexually discriminatory images that are shown clearly churches, out the front of airports or on Queensland, where I come from. At first the about this issue backed up their story, but in issue, you discovered that just over 2,000 Standards Bureau, of which just over 10 per cent codes of practice. It looked all right but, advertising and 35.7 per cent related to advertising 90 outdoor advertisements that the Advertising were found to be in breach, compared to less outdoor advertising breaches the codes of practice complained-about issues about advertisements The inquiry investigated whether self-regulation we found that, in relation to specific categories codes of practice, those codes needed to be strengthened, code where public space is occupied-that is be seen, and this can have a cumulative effect, in the committee and in the community about of complaint resting on the public. The public complaint. Often the public, consumers, are time how to do it. We recommended that the Advertising complaint process more and increase its accessibility.

It was quite clear. NA The outdoor advertising industry, if I can put up its act. It may shape up and get its house government intervene. This is a really big warning itself.

It is pertinent to note that a large to NGOs goes to Africa. As noted in ACFID's submission: In 2008, nearly 35 percent of these funds were amounts to $280 million in 2007-8.48 and $323 support programs in 39 African countries. This demonstrates that there is significant programs in Africa. Australian NGOs have generated considerable extensive experience on the ground in Africa The programs they are engaged in are varied HIV/AIDS and health; food security and emergency persons; literacy and education; rural development; issues more generally. CARE Australia drew add value to Australia's official aid program, society capacity in African countries; their program efforts; their orientation towards capacity to work in places where direct bilateral capacity to respond quickly and effectively their proven ability to transition to effective NGOs are notable for their high degree As Australia‘s aid budget for Africa expands in delivery of aid projects in Africa.

He perhaps needs to over two months ago that the water minister's gave indicative support for a $100,000 grant internationally important wetland and tourism a tweet I posted saying I was pleased to see Commonwealth and the New South Wales government being recreated later. That somehow pointed But it really is essential for the future of the tat argument. And as the local member who represents my perspective was that for my local community that does not look after them sufficiently, policy that suggests that. I do not think there that either. The point is that for a long time people evaporation and savings. We will argue about There are four engineering options on the table those options will be the best one, that ultimately Menindee. I have always been supportive of water minister to suggest that somehow I coalition policy is disappointing. It is also disappointing that inherent in Wales government was not either.

The memorandum of understanding between because one of its key ingredients was Broken engineering of Menindee Lakes, which I have just for Broken Hill's water issues-that is, an area and not just done the desktop studies bit unfair; they probably have visited the area, would know that to cut off Broken Hill from supply and to instead suggest that it gets its which is still not decided, and that the people patently ridiculous. This MOU that quite sensibly the new minister together in a hurry by the Prime Minister, Julia chair came up with a set of recommendations who knows the politics of water knows how represent the Lower Lakes and we had myself the biggest rice growers in the Basin. So if we is something the government needs to take in the relevant minister in parliament yesterday 'apparently divergent views' within the federal take a look behind him because it was a little colleague, the minister for regional Australia, to help the Menindee Lakes apply to become an area. The minister yesterday was remarking on the memorandum of understanding between the effectively torn up with a view to to these 'divergent views' within the coalition. Menindee Lakes that we do not have this tit-for the lakes and represents Broken Hill, anything that trashes the future of the lakes, is going to be bad. There is nothing in coalition is anything in government policy that suggests have looked at the Menindee Lakes as a source of the extent to which savings can be made there. and there are discussions around which one of does save the water that can be saved in the re-engineering of Menindee Lakes, so for the was not and therefore I was not aligned with his remarks was a suggestion that the New South Katrina Hodgkinson's media release begins by in water-saving measures and environmental main reason I welcomed the ending of the the Commonwealth and New South Wales was Hill's water supply. Sure there was the retalked about, but there was also a 'solution' underground aquifer. Anyone who has visited the that Geoscience have done-I am probably being a but I do not think they have taken much in the Menindee Lakes as its permanent water water from an underground aquifer, the science of in the far west should be happy with that is quite in New South Wales has torn up was put Gillard, during the last election campaign and NA her unfortunate counterpart in New South Wales, in a hurry and it certainly is a good thing coalition policy, which does recognise the that we need a discussion about how that that every user in the basin can be happy with. trivialised the issue to such an extent yesterday, with sorting this problem out. He has a set made by a group of members of parliament from sensible and have been well received by the actually focus on that and not the trivial politicising see a water minister trying to wedge the states of action and a completely botched report by Let's face it, that is what happened.
