1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister now in a position to make a statement in reference to a cablegram recently published in the press to the effect that it is denied in Great Britain that this Government asked for a Conference last year?,11
2,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,"To what cablegram does the right honourable member refer-to that which appeared in the Herald, or to that which appeared in the Argus?",11
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"To that which appears in the Herald, wherein there is reference to the publication of a White Book. The cablegram in the Argus and Age speaks of a Blue Book.",11
4,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,The same publication must be meant. It is not likely that a White Book and a Blue Book would be published on the subject in one day.,11
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On 10th October of last yearSansard, Vol. hod., page 1981 - the honourable member for Capricornia asked the Prime Minister these questions1. Whether the Government has requested the Imperial Government to convene a conference of representatives of the Dominions and of the United Kingdom f 2. If ao, at what time and place is it proposed to hold the Baid conference? 3. What subjects, if any, have been suggested by the Commonwealth Government for discussion at the conference? The replies given to those questions were1. Yes. 2. Those to be mutually arranged. 3. Defence primarily. On 14th October of last year-Hansard , Vol. lxxi., page 2020- Mr Bruce Smith called attention to the matter. He saidSince the House met on Friday last, reports I mve appeared in the newspapers to the effect that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence have made important statements concerning the necessity for holding an Imperial - Vaval Conference. Some rather important details seem to be briefly expressed in tbose reports. Will the Prime Minister give the House the benefit of the information that he gave to a private gathering? To that the. Prime Minister repliedI am not aware that I gave any information KENDELL to a private gathering, except that I made the most general reference to tlic fact that we requested the Imperial Government a conference, with a view to determining future constructional developments in connection with the Navy. That is all I have said. The newsParliament papers are doing the rest, and I canuot help that. Can the honourable gentleman say now yuu whether the statement in the White Book montioned in the cablegram, is correct?",11
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,My answer to posed the right honourable member last night was that at the proper time. I would give having him the fullest possible information. The time to do that is not when a censure amendment is before the House. NA,12
7,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The night before I asked if the papers in connection with the survey contract made with Messrs. Laurence and Chalmers in connection to with the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway might be laid on the table of the Library. Possibly Prime Minister has overlooked the matter.,12

10,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Capricornia) [2.36] Before making a few more or less uncomplimentary remarks about the Ministry, wish to compliment the honourable memRAILWAY . ber for Adelaide upon his maiden effort of last evening. It will be a long time last before we forget that brilliant debater, the lamented Alfred Roberts, and any honourable member would find it difficult fill his place; but his successor has made a good commencement j and he has a good knowledge of the Labour question, the a strong voice, and the g if t of ready repartee, which will be very useful to him",12
11,Mr BKENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,And to us.,12
12,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"And to the party to which he will readily admit it is an honour to belong: I also congratulate my m e M in - old opponent', this'honpijable member' for - has ferf& « ^ l(rtBiijft. f t c r n he is Hispolitical opinions'have'undergone no change. They are opinions which were very popular in the middle of the last half century. He belongs to the Manchester school in politics, and his views on Free Trade and Labour have never altered. But nature has endowed him with such a fine presence, with such a cultured manner, and with such eloquent diction, that we are always glad to hear his speeches. He has, too, such a refreshing candour-honorabl e members opposite might consider it somewhat brutal-that his remarks are very agreeable to listen to. I am glad to observe that a reconciliation has taken place between him and the Treasurer lately.",12
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,We were always very good friends.,13
14,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do not know whether a new party is about to be formed opposite, but I hope so, because one led by the Treasurer, with the honourable member for Parkes as lieutenant, would do a great deal more good for the country than that now led by the Prinie Minister and his chief lieutenant, the Attorney-General. I join - with those who have expressed regret that the Governor General is about to retire from his office for reasons of health. I have never had a conversation with Lord Denman, but I have heard him speak on two or three occasions, and I have read his speeches. To my mind those speeches disclosed considerable wit and humour, and an earnest endeavour on his part to faithfully fulfil the functions of his distinguished position. We have had some failures in the Commonwealth as Governors-General. Lord Dudley, for instance, is generally recognised as having been quite unable to rise to the dignity and responsibility of the position.",13
15,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Is the honourable member going to discuss that matter on a motion tion of censure? What has the Ministry to clo with the shortcomings of the Govsome ernor-General referred to ?,13
16,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I think that Lord Denfused man ranks in the same class as the late Lord Northcote, who was a great cess as Governor General. Personally, I do not believe in imported Goscrutineers vernors-General, and I hope that political parties in Australia will make it a plank in their platforms as soon ber as po$s^b1e.,l£at, alLGovernors^(3ienBral of the Commonwealth shall be 'Australian the-fmrposes > citizens, so that our Australian [10j- 2 may be given a chance. I do not believe in allowing any political paity 12,000 miles away to nominate persons for positions in the Commonwealth.",13
17,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Why , there would be confusion in the honourable member's own ranks if that occurred.",13
18,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do not regard the honourable member as of sufficient calibre to warrant nie in paying any attention to him. My chief concern this afternoou is with the Ministry and their worksgood, bad, and indifferent. In the first place I wish to refer tb the blunders of the Government. . The Ministry-mos t of the members of which have had a university education-hav e not exhibited the capacity to govern this country. Upon consulting Who's Who, for example, I find that the Attorney-General is a B.A. and LL.D. of Trinity College, Dublin, and M.A. and LL.D. of the Melbourne University. One would expect that a gentleman who has had such a superior education would disclose the capacity to govern Australia. But what did he do as soon as he got into office? He commenced to break the law. The spirit, if not the letter, of our Electoral law is that all ballot papers and documents connected with an election shall be placed in sealed packets which shall not be opened until a Justice of the High Court orders them to be opened. But the Attorney-General, in his anxiety to discover something to back up the slanders of the Government on the people of Australia, broke the Electoral law by ordering the officials to open the certified lists of voters. This opening of the sealed parcels containing the electoral lists was not to take place in public, but was to be done in secret. ' There was to be a Star Chamber investigaby electoral officials, and certain permanent officers, with a view to discovering evidence that would be useful to the Government. The Attorney-General reto allow any member of the general public to be present when the parcels were sucopened. When he was pressed by the honourable member for Ballarat to allow to be present he repliedThe suggestion made hy the honourable memfor Ballarat has been considered from all points of view, and it has been thought that for of the'""preliminary investigation it isuindesirable to shave any one Jnitlsent .save>fi'vouths sponsible officers - It is quite true that the honourable gentleman gave way, but he did so only as the result of public opinion created by the criticism of honourable members. Blunder No. 2 was that committed by the Hon. Littleton Groom, Minister of Trade and Customs, a gentleman who is described in Who's Who-wit h his own approval, no doubt-as a distinguished scholar of Ormond College, Melbourne University, an M . A . and LL . M . What was the blunder that he made? He allowed 32,387 tons of sugar to be taken out of bond without the payment of duty. The duty which ought to have been paid on that sugar amounted to about £150,000. The Minister sheltered himself behind what he declared was a mistake on the part of the late Minister of Trade and Customs. We do not admit that any mistake was made by the honourable gentleman's predecessor in office, or by the late Government. It was the duty of the Minister himself to become acquainted with the habits of the clients of the Government, and not to have allowed that sugar to have passed out of bond. It is quite true that £150,000 has since been paid by way of duty, but it was not paid until after an Act had been passed authorizing its collection. Blunder No. 3 was the abolition of preference to unionists, and here again I have to turn to my friend the enemyI mean the Attorney-General. a very great objection to wage earners' trade unions, but he has no objection to trade unions of employers. Nobody ever heard him utter a word, for against the Bankers' Union-a which exists for regulating the rate of interest, for deciding what charge shall be made for keeping accounts, and which determines the discount rate on bills. Who ever heard the honourable say a word against the Ship-owners' Union, which regulates the freight and passenger charges around our coast, and which agrees to non-competition gard to trade routes? Who ever heard him say a word against the Coal Vend, which regulates the price of coal, or against the Property Owners' Association, which exists for the purpose of keeping down rates and keeping up rents, and of discouraging municipalities from building houses, and thus entering into competition with them? Mr Higgs. Who ever heard the Attorney-General say a word against the Employers' Union, which, generally speaking, has been formed for the purpose of keeping up the price of goods, keeping down the rate of wages, and of start Union? I note in a balance-sheet recently published in connection with that gentleman's tramway union, that the "" other receipts, donations, and subscriptions "" amounted to £289, whilst in connection with the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union the amount so contributed was £436 3s. 9d. Who ever heard the Attorney-General say a word against the Farmers' and Dairymen's Union ? That is a union formed for the protection of farmers and dairymen, a very legitimate object. But it is formed also to keep up the price of butter, and to in duce the Government to spend as much as they can possibly secure in aiding the. farming industry.",13
19,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What unions has the Attorney-General ever condemned?,14
20,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The only unions the honourable gentleman condemns are the unions of the working classes. H is antipreference law is not directed against any of the unions I have just been enumerating, but against working-class unions, the carpenters, labourers, stonemasons, plumbers, and other unions of He has tradesmen who may be engaged upon Government work. I cannot, this afternoon, refer at length to the work done by the working men's unions, but I might briefly instance, refer to the Amalgamated Carpenters and union Joiners Union, some of whose members will be affected by the action proposed to be taken by the Attorney-General, and his colleague, the former leader of the Labour party in New South Wales. The gentleman Carpenters and Joiners Union has distributed about £3,250,000 in benefits of various kinds amongst its members, in sick benefits, unemployment, accident, with re- trade privileges, superannuation, contingent and benevolent f u n d , and compensation to widows of members. Nearly every trade union-and I could enumerate fifty or sixty of them, and probably will do so at a later stage, when the Attorney General brings forward his anti-preference to unionists Bill-is formed on the lines adopted by the Amalgamated Carpenters and Joiners Union. The Attorney-General belongs to the closest trade union in Australia-the Lawyers Union. It is characteristic of gentlemen of his type that they are absolutely unable to "" put themselves in the other fellow's place."" If , for example, the Attorney-General - were put out of his present position as one of the leaders of the Victorian Bar, and, as a boy, brought up without any advantages at school, and compelled to take his place in the ranks of the labourers, I venture to say that if he found that Parliament was not moving any faster than it is at the present time to improve the conditions of working people, he would be a Syndicalist, a direct action man, a man prepared to use force. We have only to notice the attitude of the honourable gentleman in this chamber. When asked a question the other day he was so supercilious in his attitude that, the Speaker had to call upon him to rise in his place and give his reply",14
21,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is characteristic.,15
22,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is characteristic of the honourable gentleman. I say that, in my opinion, if he were down amongst the ranks of those who have to g r a f t for their daily wage at hard manual labour, he would be so disgusted with the slowness of parliamentary procedure that he would belong to the Industrial Workers of the World. I notice that the honourable gentleman has been referring recently to Labour's ugly big brother, the Syndicalist. The honourable gentleman ought to be the last to talk about anybody's ugliness. Stri p the Attorney-General in .Court of his w i g and gown, put a suit of rags on him, and stand him in the dock charged with not having sufficient lawful visible means of support, and I venture to say that any intelligent jury would convict him without calling any evidence. The honourable gentleman has a great objection to unions of workers deciding that their members must receive 10s., l is . , or 12s., a day, but the Lawyers Union to which he belongs is backed up by all the Parliaments of the States of Australia, by the Commonwealth Parliament, and by the Judges. Let a non-union lawyer-if any honourable member can imagine such a thing-attemp t to appear on behalf of a client in any Court of Australia, and the Judge would immediately say, "" I cannot see you."" If the non-union lawyer insisted upon being seen, the Judge could commit him for contempt. Further, if the non-union lawyer insisted upon appearing in the Court the police would turn him out, and if he still continued in his desire to earn a living outside the union he would be put in gaol. No doubt the Attorney General would consider it very wrong if the Waterside Workers Federation decided that only a certain number of the members of their union should apply for work at Howard Smith's wharf, and a certain other number at the Australasian United Steam-ship Navigation Company's wharf. I have no doubt he would consider that a very dreadful thing. I have here a document that has been issued by the New South Wales bar, headed, "" Circuit Rules."" This document shows that barristers in New South Wales can only register their names to appear in certain places in that State. For example, it is provided that a barrister must register himself for one Circuit in New South Wales, the Northern Circuit, including various towns, the Southwestern or the Western, and the secretary to the "" Bar Council""-that is the elegant name of the trade unionshall keep a register of the names of barristers attached to each Circuit. Now as to the rates of pay, it is providedNo barrister shall accept on any Circuit other than the one on which he shall have been registered any brief the fee on which shall be less than twenty guineas, if in the Supreme Court or Assizes, or less than fifteen guineas if in the District Court or Quarter Sessions. No King's CounselI believe our friend the Attorney-General is onenot being a permanent Crown Prosecutor on his Circuit shall accept a brief on any Circuit the fee on which shall be less than thirty guineas. These matters are fixed by law. No doubt, later on, when the Labour party in the Australian Commonwealth propose to pass a law-and I hope the time will not be long in coming-to provide that no employee in the Commonwealth shall be paid less than a minimum wage the Attorney-General will object strongly to the passage of such a law, and will urge that the unfortunate workers shall be subject to cut-throat competition for their labour, although he and all his class have the law, the military, and the police behind their demands for the payment of whatever fee their union decides is a fair one. Blunder No. 4 of the present M in istry is the proposal to reduce the maternity allowance. In a Governor General's Speech submitted here about a year ago it was declared that the Government proposed to l i m it the present maternity allowance to necessitous cases. that mean ?",15
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is not the wording of the Speech.,16
24,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I know that the Treasurer did not put it in that way, but it was proposed that the Government should give the maternity allowance only in "" necessitous cases."" It will that those words "" necessitous cases "" were used. What does that mean ? It means that before a woman about to become a mother can secure the maternity allowance she must declare herself a pauper. She must say that she is poor and in need.",16
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"You would like to waste public money on people who do not want it . What, you want to do is to give the money to rich people.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Order ! orable member for Capricornia is addressing the Chair.,16
27,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,We have explained to the Treasurer before today that the reason why we are willing to give the maternity allowance to persons who happen to be rich is to remove the stigma of charity or pauperism.,16
28,Sir JOHN EORHEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Oh , yes-povert y and pride!",16
29,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Why should not a poor person have some personal pride?,16
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Do you thin k that Ave ought to keep this system going for generations? You will r u in the country if you do.,16
31,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It is only a million.,16
32,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Order ! This speech cannot be converted into a dialogue.,16
33,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It will cost m lions and millions by-and-by.,16
34,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Order !,16
35,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"If - we referred to Acts ,of Parliament which were passed when thenjcight ""honourable gentleman3yas Premier of Western Australia no. doubt we would find in his electoral law denying the right to vote to a person who> Avas in receipt of relief from a charitableinstitution.",16
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,They have that provision now in the State Act. I did. not introduce the provision; it was therewhen I took ofiice.,16
37,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Whil e the Labour partyhave the power, they will prevent the right honourable gentleman and his colWhat does leagues from paying the maternity allowance only to poor persons. Do honourable members opposite pay no attention topre-natal influences ? HaA'e they no idea that the mental state of a mother has an important influence on the child? What, mother with any regard for her offspring would go to a Government Department, be found and sign a document that she is a pauper?' I do not believe that there is a Avoman in Australia who would do so. To propose to l i m it the maternity allowance was a blunder, and I would like to know Avhether honourable members opp'osite would propose to seek a double dissolution on that question. Blunder No . 5 Avas one which, I haA'e no doubt, came from the At torney-General. I can imagine that only a politician like the honourable genThe hontleman would propose to destroy the secrecy of the ballot. The proposal was that before an elector could obtain a ballot-paper he must sign the but t of it , andso enable the honourable member to discover how the people in his electoratevoted if he so desired.",16
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Y o u do not think, that, do you?",16
39,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Certainly it would.. One can understand when the Attorney General was willing, to break open thesealed parcels of electoral lists",16
40,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Y o u must not forget that the ballot-papers were to be numbered! also.,16
41,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Quite so.,16
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The absent vote is numbered now.,16
43,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"And the electors wereto sign the ballot-papers. One can. i l - imagine the Attorney-General, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, and theVice-President of the Executive Council, the conducting an inquiry into the butts of the ballot-papers to ascertain how certaini persons;Jvp'ted. \ ^ (j ., n ; 0",16
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,-Is ;-not that thei : a provision system with absent voting ?,16
45,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I should imagine that the honourable member for F r a n k l in does not agree with any proposal to compel an elector to sign the butt of the ballotipaper. But he and several others are going to their .political r u in in following the Attorney-General.,17
46,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,And the Treasurer.,17
47,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Treasurer, I am - glad to see, is a Knigh t of the Crown of It a l y . I found that information in Who's Who, the other day.",17
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That appeared tgood while ago.,17
49,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I believe thoroughly - that the Treasurer is not in sympathy with the Attorney-General in liis proposals, nor is he in sympathy with this giving works to contractors such as marked the Teesdale-Smith case. This morning I found in a Western Australian paper a speech of the right honourable gentleman on day labour, which is utterly opposed to - giving out contracts of that kind, and I am sure that he will not go back on his principles as readily as the Prime Minister has done. Clause 19 of the Electoral Bill of this Ministry was a clause requiring - an elector to sign his name on the butt - unless he made a verbal declaration that he was unable to do so. That is to say, - every man and every woman applying to vote must sign his or her name on the ballot-paper. I desire to know if the Prime Minister and his colleagues want a - double dissolution on that question. Another blunder of the Ministry was the - endeavour to abolish Saturday as a polling - day. Now, the Saturday polling day is .a very great convenience to the majority - of the people. Fanners, especially, seldom go into the town or village in the middle of the week. If they do go to town .at all it is generally on Saturday afternoon, and very often they return on Sun-day. Another blunder with which the P r i m e Minister may be credited w a j the proposal to establish a Federal Agricultural Bureau without consulting the 'States.",17
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Giv e me a rest.,17
51,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am sorry that I canmot give the honourable member a rest. I would like to give him a long political --rest, but he will not take it . I'wTU'prove -<to the House'this' afternoon that'he will mot at any time take a political rest. I now come to the Ministry's broken promises. The Prime Minister told us in the speech he made on the 12th August, that "" the purification of the rolls is being proceeded with,' and every endeavour is being made to in sure their accuracy."" a That - statement was made nine long months ago. But last week-o n the 16th April-the honourable gentleman told us that the rolls "" are in a shocking state."" Nine months after the Ministr y had been in office, ala though they told us on the 12th August last that the purification of the rolls was proceeding, the Prime Minister told us that the rolls are in a shocking state. Is not that a sufficient reason for turning him out? of public Mr BILEY - TJnde r which Department is the electoral law administered?",17
52,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"TJnde r the Department of the Prime Minister, who has as his assistants, Senator MCColl and the Honorary Minister. What has become of the proposal of the Postmaster-General to introduce a measure for the appointment of three Commissioners to manage the Post Office? I understand from the press that he has decided to retire from office, because he is so disgusted with the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department. He may be, as the lionorable member for Gwydir interjects, overwhelmed with the work which has to be done, but the fact is that he finds the Department almost unworkable. At any rate, he promised us a Bill for the appointment of three Commissioners to manage the Post Office. I ask the Prime Minister where is that Bill which was promised nine months ago? What became, too, of the Ministerial jiropqsals - vote-catching proposals, no doubt - for a scheme of superannuation for public servants, and a scheme to secure a retiring allowance to those serving in the Military Forces? I wonder that the honourable member for North Sydney is not prodding the Ministry up, aud asking what has become of their Bill ? Again, what has become of the comprehensive scheme for national i nsurance on a contributory basis, embracing sickness, accident, maternity, widowhood, and dunemploym&llt ? Th'fe' i , ,; Prime Minister knows all about unemployment: He is a'man with a most extraordinary talent; in fact, I think he is the greatest political actor on the Australian stage today.",17
53,Mr DANKEL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is saying a lot.,18
54,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is saying a lot. We hear of Edmund Kean, Macready, Henry I r v in g , Rignold, and Walter Bentley. Those eminent actors have made a great and lasting impression, but none has shown greater versatility than the Prime Minister. He has the ability of being .able to play a part to suit any gallery. His speech, made in July, 1913, to a deputation of unemployed, shows that he knows all about unemployment. honourable gentleman said on that occasionI think the very last thing a Government can afford is a huge unemployment problem. Every 1 day, every hour, a man is out of work over a given point he is deteriorating. He begins to deteriorate once his spirit and hope begin to go, and, therefore,-1ie is n serious problem for the wisest statesman to consider time has come to lay this burden fairly on the whole country in the shape of a contributory insurance scheme. We are all in it, and we cannot escape from it, and we are all more or less responsible. What has become of that scheme? The Minister for External Affairs is appalled at the prospect of investigating the mass of information which the Government Statistician has prepared, a mass so great that it is impossible to carry it up to the Minister's office. When are we to get that Bill to deal with sickness and accident, widowhood, and unemployment? It was promised a year ago. become of the Land Bill for the Northern Territory, a Bill which was to take the place of the Ordinance?",18
55,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I hope to bring it down next week.,18
56,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Then where is the promised bankruptcy law? Where is the law proposing to deal with offences against the Commonwealth? nothing of that. Is it because the Prime Minister and his colleagues expect to be amongst the first! to be arrested under that measure? Now I come to another proposal. Twelve months ago the promised us a Bill to deal with reciprocal trade. Reciprocal trade seems to me a sort of preferential trade, and I am not in favour of preferential trade, except upon the basis of a union rate of wages. I object to any sweater, under the flag of patriotism, getting his goods into this country at a cheap rate to compete with Australian goods and manufactures. Reciprocal trade seems to me to be only a device of Free Traders to get goods imported into the country at a cheaper rate.",18
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Are you not in favour of reciprocal trade?,18
58,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am in favour of it only when the man, who sends goods into this country, accompanies those goods with a certificate that they have been manufactured at the standard or tradeThe union rate of wages. The Ministry promised twelve months ago that they would introduce a Bill to deal with anomalies in the Tariff. What has become of that Bill ? Honourable members may have noticed in the daily papers a couple of days ago a cablegram referring to a strike of cricket-ball makers The employed at Tunbridge in Kent. Those men were on strike for an increase in wages of 5s. per dozen balls, and they were skilled workmen who received only 30s. per week. The manufacturers declined to give the increase asked for, because they said the Tetailers would not pay the price, and the retailers are not paying the price because they have to compete with the cricket-ball manufacturers in India. The patriotic British capitalist, who is such a great lover of Britain and the Empire, has taken his capiWhat has tal to India, and is employing .cheap labour to produce goods which will compete with the manufactures of the United Kingdom. It is individuals like those employers in Kent, who pay tlieir employees 30s. per week, whom I object to being allowed to bring their goods into AusWe hear tralia under any preferential Tariff. I have referred to a number of the Bills which the Ministry promised, but I do not believe that they had any intention of passing any of them, because we have it on the authority of the Government Whip, who spoke at Murwillumbah, Ministry New South Wales, on 9 th February, thatThe Cook Ministry, wben it took office, did so with the deliberate intention of appealing to the country. They had made up tlieir minds to secure a double dissolution, which ° would come this year, but he could not say exactly when. There we have a statement made by the Government W h i p , who, we must believe, enjoys the confidence of the M in istry, that it was the deliberate intention of the Ministry from the very first to try to get a dissolution. I ""have my doubts about the Prime Minister desiring a dissolution. The Attorney-General wants it . As a - chain is no stronger than its weakest link, so this Liberal party is weak in this fact, that it can do nothing without the consent of that conservative honourable member. A f t er we had been sitting in this chamber for about three months, after the last election, the At torney-General, it is said, rose at one of the Liberal party's Caucus meetings and said, "" I am tired of this, and if you do not bring in double dissolution Bills I will leave politics."" And the Liberal party, having a majorit y of only one, had to bow to the honourable gentleman's wishes. Only a gentleman of the type of the Attorney-General would have the i m pudence to ask for a double dissolution. Why should sixty-six men be sent to the country in the interests of forty-five so called Liberals? What reason has the Attorney-General for believing that a double dissolution will help him at all? The Liberal party did not get a single senator returned in 1910. The people of Australia thought so little of the Liberal policy that they would not return a single Liberal senator in 1910, and in 1913 they returned only seven Liberal senators out of eighteen. Those seven represent the full strength of the Liberal - party in the Senate today. What reason have they for believing that if they go to the country now the Australian public will give them more than seven senators? I do not believe they have any reason for so believing. It seems to me that the public of Australia should realise that under the present Federal Constitution there is only one party that can govern Australia; that there is only one party that has the power to pass legislation; that is the Labour party. W it h the Constitution providing for one adult one vote, the big cities of Australia will return the senators, so that for all time the Senate will have a majority of Labour men. In regard to the Lower House, however, country districts, swayed by the influence of Conservative papers like the Melbourne Argus, where the people read nothing but the biased views of journals established to voice the opinions of capitalists, owing to the fact that the Labour party have not a press to voice their views, may possibly return Liberals in a majority. The result will be a dead-lock I wish to devote a little more attention to the Prime Minister, and show that he is not in earnest in his professed desire to great pass legislation.",18
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Accordin g to your reasoning, you are keeping yourselves out of power - Why not, then, go to the country and get into power ?",19
60,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Prime Minister did not follow me. I say that a majority in the Senate is assured for the Labour party on account of the big vote in the big cities, whereas there may be a doubt about the House of Representatives owing to the influence of the capitalistic press in the country districts, which was able to send a Liberal majority into this House, while it could only return seven to the Senate.",19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"In that case, what is Parliament going to do ? Is there to be a perpetual dead-lock ?",19
62,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"There is to be a deadlock u n t i l the people realise the insincerity of the honourable members on the Ministerial benches. I shall prove out of the mouth of the Prime Minister that he is insincere in his proposals to introduce the legislation to which I have referred this afternoon. He is reported in the Melbourne Argus of the 8th August to have said at WangarattaWhy should the people always be crying out for legislation? Had tliere not been eightythree Acts in the last three years placed on the statute-book? What more could the people want? Those who were continually asking for more legislation were really worse than Oliver Twist in his demands. Here is another speech, made at a cafe in Melbourne, where the New Zealanders were giving a dinnerWhether Parliament would do any business . remained to be seen. It had been at work for some weeks without any result, but he was not sure whether the country did not want a rest from legislative enactments. There had been eighty-three enactments during the period in which the Labour party was in office, but he did not know whether the country was any the bettor for it. The present Administration was certainly not going to be responsible for a record in that direction, and he, for one, would not be sorry for that fact. This speech was made on the 22nd September last. Speaking at the Agricultural Show the following day, the Prime Minister said to those assembledIt does not much matter what the Parliaments do. You can get along in spite of us, if only the elements are kindly, and if only we leave you alone. The lionorable gentleman is a master of the art of electioneering. This was said at a time when the rural workers' log was in evidence, and when it was expected that the Federal Parliament would give the benefits of the Federal Arbitration Act to the rural workers.",19
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I do not think it had any reference to that matter.,20
64,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Then what did the honourable gentleman mean by saying "" so long as we leave you alone ' ' ? There was loud cheering; and the Prime Minister said, "" I knew that would fetch y o u . "" The Prime Minister is a man who can play many parts. Addressing the unemployed, he can make a speech to suit them. Addressing the Chamber of Manufactures, he can simulate a lot of indignation against Judge Higgins; he can tell them that he has heard of Judge Higgins giviug a decision in which 99 per cent, of the proceeds of the industry were to be mopped up in paying the wages and conditions imposed by the award.",20
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I merely from the report of the Public Commissioner.,20
66,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable gentleman did not tell the Chamber of Manufactures that he was referring to Government employment. He led them to believe that it was an award concerning private employers. Now I come to the talk of the honourable gentleman about having no desire to hang on to offiee, and I shall prove that he will hang on by arms, legs, feet, and hands. On the 7th August last, speaking regarding an election, he saidWhen it came, the Ministry would be ready . for it. Much, however, would depend on the temper of the House. If the House was there"" to do business, the Ministry would be also there to do business. If it wns there to wrangle, then it would find that the Ministrywas not there to wrangle. The Ministry was not there hang on to office at any price-certainl y not at the price of its political reputation and 8'>The. honourable gentleman also saidjijthat he had been up to the Senate, and had the other distinguished scholars. seen a Labour man taking charge of the business, and he proceededI want to say that that kind of thing cannot be tolerated in a free Australia, and this Government does not intend to put up with that kind of thing for very long. I shall prove out of the records of Parliament that the honourable gentleman isprepared to spend Government money tokeep in office. What happened in connection with the Tasmanian grant?",20
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,An act of justice..,20
68,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"During the last Parliament, the Australian Labour party, under the sections of the Constitution, granted! Tasmania £500,000, to be spread over a period of ten years. Tasmanian members, when they saw the state of parties in the House, realized their opportunity, and3 brought pressure to bear on the Government to get another £400,000. Ministersi n the Senate were asked whether they proposed to carry out the recommendation of the Royal Commission, and p a y this further sum, and the Government,, the members of which claim to have somepolitical honour and reputation, said, "" We will not consider the question."" In fact,, they told the senator who asked the question that they would have nothing whatever to do with the matter - What happened ? The honourable member for Bassin this Chamber submitted a motion that the £400,000 be paid; and the Ministry,, quoted having heard a whisper that the honorService able member for Franklin and anotherTasmanian member would otherwise voteagainst them, decided, with in eight daysafter their refusal, to bring in a Bill"" authorizing the payment. Wliere is thepolitical honour of the Government?"" Where is the political honour of the At torney-General ? I know that that gentleman is very sensitive on the point, but hedid not mind supporting the proposal. He was one who took a stern stand, and' said that the Government would not p a y the money; but with in eight days, when he was confronted with the possible defeat"" of the Ministry, he reversed his form , so that the Prime Minister might hang on tooffice. I now desire, in a few words, to conto trast the conduct of this university eduhonour. cated Ministrywith the Ministry thatpreceded them. . First, we have th&.Attorney-G,ejieral as.a B . ^ . and LL;D.,rand Of - course, they are entitled to a ll the credit - due to them for having passed with such ""high honours at the universities. Let us Hook, however, at the record of the indi^ vidual members of the late Ministry. First we have the honourable member for Wide Bay, who was a miner, and was ;never at a university; and then we have vthe honourable member for West Sydney, -.who, though a lawyer, was not, I think, - educated at a university; the honourable rmember for Barrier, a miner; the honourable member for Darwin , a banker; the 'late honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr C. E. Frazer, an engineer; Senator Pearce, a carpenter; the honourable member for Yarra, a journeyman hatter; Senator MCGregor, a builders' labourer; Senator Findley, a compositor; and the late member for Adelaide, Mr E . A . URoberts, a wharf labourer. Let us now contrast the work done by 'the two Ministries. Many of the eighty.three Acts which were passed by the .Labour Government were really monumental in their effect. The land tax is at -.the present time producing a revenue of £1,200,000 per annum, and I am very ,pleased to know that the honourable member for Eiverina, on his own admission, Ihas to pay £11,500 of that every year. Tn order to be liable for such a sum the honourable member must - have land worth about - unimproved value. This tax, ''honourable members may have observed from this morning's newspapers, is having the effect of making big land-owners - cut up their estates, and while it is doing 'that, it is also compelling a number of .people to pay taxation which otherwise would have to come out of the pockets of - the working classes.",20
69,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I think the honourable -.member for Biverina said that that - amount of taxation was paid by a com..pany with which he is connected.,21
70,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable member - for Riverina, I think, used a first per;scnal pronoun.",21
71,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He said, ""my company.""",21
72,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Did he ? Another Act, - opposed by honourable members opposite, - was the Australian Notes Act, which has --enabled the public tp get the benefit of the nofe' issue,-and of Jprofits which formerly ""'Went - into the pWketis^of bftttk , sharef 7 iholders.' "" The Commonwealth Bank, the inauguration of which was also opposed by honourable members opposite, though not fulfil l in g the functions which the honourable member for Darwin had in his mind, is certainly doing good work, and, I believe, will do better work as the years rol l on. We have to our credit also the Conciliation and Arbitration Act , which gives the President power to convene compulsory conferences of employers and employees, and strengthens the Court's power to give preference to unionists; and honourable members may have observed that the President of the Arbitration Court has been able to remove considerable trouble by calling compulsory conferences under the Act . The Australian National Labour party also 2 :>asse d the Postal Rates Act, which established penny postage throughout Australia and to other parts of the Empire. The Public Service Arbitration Act , which gives the employees in the Public Service power to appeal to the Arbitration Court in regard to questions of wages and conditions, is also to our credit. Then there is the Seamen's Compensation Act , which provides a scale of compensation for widows and relatives; and we know that the other day the widow of the second officer of the Burwah, who fell overboard and was drowned as the vessel was passing through the Sydney Heads in a rough £500,000 sea, was awarded £500, which the shipas ping company had to pay. Then there is to our credit the Inter-State Commission Act , which, no doubt, will prove of great service to Australia. I am not sure, however, that it was wise fco hand over the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission, for there is urgent necessity for it to be speedily dealt with. I know that the Attorney-General does not believe in Protection, but he swallows his Free Trade proclivities because he loves power, of which he seems to have a good deal in the Cook Ministry at the present time. The Labour Government also passed the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act , and the Judiciary Act, increasing the number of High Court Judges from five to seven. I am very sorry that we did not appoint the Attorney-General to the H i gh Court Bench, where, I think, he would have made a far better '^showing'-tbafiny'he' does here - Further, there was'--trie'' Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act , abolishes the deduction on account of the possession of a home, and provides that all blind people shall receive an invalid pension of 10s. per week. When will the Attorney-General and his party be able to match that list, which represents only a few of the Acts passed during the three years of the Labour regime? If he stays in office for ever, the Attorney-General will never be able to pass a tenth of such measures. Mr W. H. IBVINE - Do not suggest such a thing.",21
73,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Attorney-General, like the honourable member for Parkes, is politically quite out of date. The ideas which he tried to impress upon the minds of the. people of Victoria, when he in augurated the Kyabram reform movement, and later tried to pass his Coercion Bill , which was very much on the lines of the recent South African tyranny, will not find favour today. In his Coercion .Bill the honourable gentleman had a clause penalizing any. person found guilty of giving half-a-crown to an individual on strike. Under it , it would have been an offence to give a subscription of half-a-crown to any people who were out on strike against unfair working conditions.",22
74,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Eve n if it was to feed tlieir wives and children?,22
75,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Yes . The Bill was passed on the lines of some of the Coercion Acts which operated in Ireland, and it is surprising that such legislation should have been introduced by an honourable gentleman who, according to Who's Who, claims relationship with the Irish patriot John Mitchel. The Attorney-General finds it impossible to place himself in the position of "" the other fellow."" His environment has been such that he has no sympathy with "" the man on the j o b . """,22
76,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"W it h the "" under dog.""",22
77,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He has no sympathy with the ""under d o g "" - with the man who has to toil hard for his living. There Argus. are many thousands of such workers i the Commonwealth, b ut he cannot symThere pathize with their views. He has also, between them. apparently, an extraordinary fear of the Syndicalist, whom he declares to be Labour's ugly big brother. He does not realise, as was pointed out the other night, and that nothing will be done. that it is the failure of parliaments meet the necessities of the growing numofiice ber of the educated populace that makes which it possible for Syndicalists to obtain a liearing at all . Syndicalists are to be found, I suppose, today in almost every .country, and they are to be found solely because the parliaments are so slow in meeting the necessities of the people. The nations have now to educate their children. They must do so if they do not wish to lag behind, and the educated children of the nations, on reaching manhood and womanhood, desire a better share of the wealth that is produced than was secured by their fathers and mothers. There is no reason why they should not have a larger share, but the Attorney-General cannot see that.",22
78,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He cannot see that "" the schoolmaster is abroad.""",22
79,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Attorney-General was himself a schoolmaster, and still has the habit of the pedagogue. He tours the rural districts of Victoria, giving expression to liis ""views concerning monopolies and combines, but he offers no remedy. I repeat that he cannot place himself in the position of the wage-earner who has to work hard for his living. He is quite out of date as a member of his party, and he is going to wreck it . Mr W. H. IBVINE - The honourable . member cannot object to that.",22
80,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do not, but there are in the Ministerial party several honourable members who, I believe, would be willing to vote for what might properly be called Liberal legislation, but who are being politically ruined by the Attorney General. Although this country is crying out for legislation, the Attorney General stands in the way of the satisfaction of that demand. He says in effect to his colleagues, "" If you do not bring forward the two test Bills and secure a double dissolution,. I shall leave you, and then you will incur all the odium and disgrace attaching to your failure to stand up to the Labour p a r t y .

He has said that he will not even by a deliberative vote go out of office. All the parliamentary traditions as to a Prime Minister refusing to carry on unless he has a majority of three or four have been cast to the winds, and the Prinie Minister is going to stop where he is as long as possible. I challenge the Attorney-General to bring forward his test Bills, and to let vis have a dissolution. I am perfectly willing to go before my constituents tomorrow, for I think a dead-lock has arisen, and that there will be nothing but talk during the rest of the life of this Parliament. sincerely hope that the Prime Minister and his Attorney-General will go before the electors. If we do go to the country the political situation will not be determined on such a paltry issue as that of the Preference to Unionists Abolition Bill. It will be decided rather on ques-' tions that directly affect the people. One salient question will be the attempt of the Government to destroy the Commonwealth Bank. Their proposed surrender of the savings bank branch to the States is only an attempt to destroy the power of the Commonwealth Bank, and for that the Government must reckon with the electors. The electors will also require them to account for their attempt to diminish the maternity allowance, and to require mothers seeking it to declare themselves to be paupers. The electors will also consider the endeavour made by the present Government to destroy the secrecy of the ballot-to find out how the peoj>le vote-by making them sign the butts of the ballot papers. That will be a test question, and those honourable members of the Ministerial party who do not agree with the Attorney-General will have to face it. Mr W. IL IRVINE - Who are they?",22
81,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"On e has only to turn to the record of speeches made in this House to find that there are members of the Ministerial party - who do not agree with the Attorney-General, but who, owing to party considerations, have to follow him. Those honourable members will have to meet, not the question of preference to unionists, but the attempt of the Government to destroy the Commonwealth Bank and to reduce the maternity allowance.",23
82,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Commonwealth Bank, as it is now, cannoo be destroyed.",23
83,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Government have given the people a sufficient indication that they would destroy it if they could. 1I have shown the House the differences between the two parties. I think I have proved that the Prime Minister - will hang on to office at all costs, and that there is no sincerity in regard to the programme which the Government have put before us. They do not intend to pass anything. Judging by their record, we have no reason to believe that they would not go I on holding office for ever on the present conditions.  would happen if they got a majority?",23
84,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"They have no hope of getting a majority. If they did secure a majority in the Senate and in this House, we know perfectly well that they would destroy adult suffrage. The Constitution says there shall be adult suffrage, but it contains no provision to prevent the Liberals, if ever they get power, from so altering the electoral law that it would be impossible for all the people to vote. They might introduce the provision of the British Elections Act, that a man must be eighteen months in a given locality before he can vote. As the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out last night, only 7,000,000 out of 41,000,000 odd people in the Old Country have the right to vote. The Attorney-General is looking for fight-I do not know that his followers are so anxious-bu the can get all the fight that he wants from this party. We are ready to go to the country as soon as ever the Government can get there, but I suppose they are not going there until they have purified the rolls by striking out as many Labour electors as possible. We on this side are quite ready to meet honourable members opposite and go before our masters as soon as possible.",23
85,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Hindmarsh) [3.53] - I do not know whether we ought not to apologize to the Government for taking part in this debate, because, according to the Attorney-General, it is part and parcel of a scheme. which we have hitherto pursued to waste the time of the country, and prevent any legislation from being passed. I am not altogether prepared to take that view of it , because there is ample warrant for the censure motion now before the Chamber. If there were none prior to the moving of the amendment by our leader, the revelations that have heen made from day to day in connection the Teesdale-Smith contract have amply justified it since. Another reason why a debate of this character ought to take place in the National Parliament is that it is most desirable that the attention of the House and the country should be directed to the existing state of public affairs. No-confidence motions that have taken place in days gone by, both here and elsewhere, have in most cases represented a dispute between the Liberal and Conservative parties, who were having a field day with their tongues in their cheeks, without caring a rap about the interests of the country. what happened under the three-party system, but now, thanks to the electors, we have a clean-cut issue between two parties only. One outstanding feature of the position today is that, even in this sunny land, where the conditions of the workers are better than in any other part of the Empire, there is a feeling of industrial unrest. It is to be found all over the world, and will continue for many years to come. It has arisen because the intelligent workers of the community have begun to realise that the conditions are not altogether what they should be. The great mass of the wage-earners are working for a bare living. I do not say they are starving, because they have been able fo raise the standard of living slightly, they are certainly working for a bare living, and there is always the fear before them that, with a diminution they will have to stand idle and see their savings eaten up. That condition has existed for years past, and will, I think, persist. On the other hand, the plutocratic section of the community hold all the means of production and exchange, and have the backing of the financial, commercial, and .business interests. upshot in a nutshell is that on the one side only one in thirteen of the workers of Australia leave anything death, while the private wealth of the commuuity has increased by £150,000,000 during the last five years. That great wealth is neither more nor less than unpaid wages. That is too serious a question for party bitterness or recriminations between one side and the other. wpuld^Jbe my last wish to. deal with the nwtt^ainjjjthat Ugh^**""^ .desire to. tjeat it'as. a ..modern historical, fact, worthy .of the serious attention of every man in the Mr Archibald. community. Every one should ask himwith self whether he is not in favour of a voluntary charge which will materially improve the conditions of the great masses of the workers, so that it may no longer be true that all they possess in this world is the power to labour for others, with the risk of periodical Unemployment and consequent suffering ampng tlieir children. It can be said, to the honour of many Australians, and many others who speak our language in other countries, that these views are not conmerely fined entirely to the workers. There are men with princely wealth, and women of culture and refinement, who believe in That is such an alteration in the economic conditions as will increase the prosperity of the whole people. All I ask of any man is that he shall make up his mind what he is going to do. Never mind about tomorrow. What are you going to do today? A r e you going to join that party which is trying to bring about a better state of society than that under which we now live? That is the question which every one should be called upon to answer. I do not say that the Labour party never make mistakes, bub I do claim that the Labour movement in Australia today stands for the principle I have enunciated. We have had a mandate from the people to bring about betbut ter conditions. We have a majority in another place, and in this House we are as near to a majority as it is in trade, possible for any minority to be. What is the attitude of the Government in regard to this matter? True to its Conservative instincts, it is opposing all evolutionary change. Changes must, come, as the result ofeither revolution or evolution. Revolution in Australia is unthinkable, but the pace may be made The in Europe, and we may be dragged in , whether we like it or not. Therefore it is of vital importance that we should at their think straight and see clearly. The party that opposes us is supported with Conservative principles of the worse type, and to it may be applied what Thackeray said of George IV , "" it has great opportunities for doing mischief, and does not miss a single one of them."" We all reIt gret that the. present Governor General is leaving Australia,,. This, distinguished p n t l w a ^ ^ b r o u g h t ^ o the^discharge','of ? .his, duties ,an. .acquaintance^. with., .public ""affairs, and a masterly way'or dealing with them, that have gained the admiration sf all, and cause us to ""wish him well in the future. It is a matter of regret to me that he cannot finish his term of office. Noblemen can be picked up any day, but gentlemen of his stamp are few and far between. I make this reference to him because I am about to quote from the Speech which he has addressed to Parliament. Although I have never been a resurrectionist, I do not quarrel with those who believe in resurrecting the words and deeds of the past. ""We have been told by the Governor General t h a w During the first session of this Parliament my Ministers, for reasons which they advise me were beyond their control, were unable to pass legislation on many subjects outlined in their policy statement presented to you on 12th August last. Those subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favouritism in Government employment, and the restoration of the electoral provisions for voting by post. My charge against Ministers is that they have done nothing, and have had no in tention of passing legislation in the in terests of the country. The Prime M in ister, speaking at Mount Gambier, said that he had been unable to get legislation passed because of the rough treatment which had been, given to non-contentious Bills here and in the Senate. I suppose that in the interests of party it is never desirable to make a full statement about any fact. There must always be the suppression of what it does not suit the politician to tell his audience. If the Government was not. successful in its legislative efforts last year, Ministers had no one to blame but themselves. treatment by the Labour party was remarkable for its generosity, and they played for a f all . Their manifesto in cluded an alteration of the Electoral law and the passing of legislation to prevent the rural worker from approaching the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Such a manifesto was a declaration of war, and, as such, must have provoked opposition. Some of us have been associated with the Labour movement _ during the full term of its existence-that is, for about twenty years-and we had either to abandon our principles or to allow the Government to give effect to a policy which was entirely antagonistic to them. The'Government proposals had to be contested Vat every, sfop'. '-We have''a' right to expect* t h a r MiriisteVs w l i o ' V c e i v e from the Governor General a commission to administer the affairs of the count r y in the King's name shall be alive to the situation of the day. The present Ministers are not. Their proposal meant that the rural workers, who are only just beginning to organize, should be deprived of privileges and rights that are enjoyed by the metropolitan workers. The party opposite hypocritically cants about its love of justice and its desire to give every one a fair deal; but this is not fair play.  member think that the rural industries should he subjected to trade union conditions ?",23
86,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The rural worker is entitled to as much liberty and protection by the Law Courts as auy other worker, and no Government would have made the proposal to which I have referred had not Ministers been actuated by unjust motives. My honourable friend, when supporting them, was as unjust as they were.  as much liberty as any others.",25
87,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I leave it to tin House and to the country to decide whether I have exaggerated anything. This Government is Conservative and anti-Labour, the most stupidly Conservative Government that the world has seen for many years. I am not foolish enough to think that even under an adult franchise the people of this country may not occasionally call a halt, and say to the party to which I belong, "" You.had better Their stop. We shall let the other side come in to give us breathing time before we go onward again."" That has happened before in the history of the world, and will happen again. The late Marquis of Salisbury, when Leader of the Conservative party of Great Britain , a man who forgot more than Ministers opposite ever knew or will know, when asked to propose the repeal of a measure that had been passed by his predecessors and opponents, said, "" You cannot repeal what has been enacted. It is impossible to retrace your steps."" But this hotch-potch Conservative crew instead of adhering to the best traditions of their party, attempted to repeal the measures passed at the instance of their predecessors in office. At the last"" elecu tion', we had the heaviest pqll ever ¥S lW 'cor&ed in Australia/ and if anybody had reason to grumble at the result, it was not my honourable friends Yet they immediately gave utterance to gross slanders upon the people of this 'Commonwealth. I am pleased to say that in my own constituency I had a walk-over, but 87 per cent, of the voters enrolled there exercised the franchise for the candidates. What was the object of the Electoral Bill which the Government brought forward last session ? members will recollect that we that measure for weeks, and we owe the people of this country no apology for our action. After the lapse of a considerable time, the Bill was dropped, and disappeared from thf> business-paper. have no hesitation in affirming that its object was to secure an attenuated and to keep as many Labour voters off that roll as possible. That is the way in which the Government proposed "" purge the roll ""-a term with which we have recently become very familiar. objective of that Bill was a sufficient justification for our attitude towards it last session. Por instance, it provided no new names were to be placed upon the roll a month before the issue of the writ. In itself, that would have resulted in the disfranchisement of a large number of electors, including all those young people who had attained their during that month, and who, in the very nature of things, would be anxious to become enrolled. sure would have inflicted a gross injustice upon them, seeing that they had been guilty of no offence. The complaint is often heard that there are more names upon the roll than there should be. But, under healthy conditions, that always be the case, by reason of the fact that many persons change their residence without obtaining transfers, and are thus necessarily enrolled twice. The Bill further provided that ballot-papers were to be printed in blocks, and that when an elector attended the polling booth, he should be required to sign his name before receiving his ballot-papers, so that anybody might know exactly how he voted. How effect was to be given to such a system in the metropolitan divisions, I do not know. However, there was the intention plainly expressed of destroying the secrecy of the ballot. Then it was proposed to repeal the deposit of 5s. which has to be made by any person who objects to the name' of any Mr Archibald. certainly elector appearing upon the roll. I say opposite. that that penalty was imposed to protect the worker who has to move about because of economic conditions which he himself has not created. That is the way in which the Government met this Parliament, and attempted to carry on the Senate business of the country. Had they come down here with a number of non-contentious measures Honourable fought Mr Rodgers - Like the Norfolk Island Acceptance Bill , for example.",25
88,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I would point out to my honourable friend that if the Government had been sincere in their deI sire to enact legislation for the benefit of the Commonwealth, they would have roll, brought forward such measures as the Norfolk Island Acceptance Bill and the Agricultural Bureau Bill , but would to not have submitted for our consideration the Electoral Bill . That is what a The Conservative Government with any respect for Conservative traditions would have done. They might have introduced that a Companies Bill , a Bankruptcy Bill , or a Marriage and Divorce Bill . These are all questions which still require to be settled, and for the settlement of which people are urgently crying out. In what majority position would we on this side have been if we declined to pass such measures? extremely Undoubtedly it would then be said that The mea- we were a factious Opposition, whose grievance was not with the policy of the present Government, but that they were in office and our friends were not. I am prepared to ask any elector of Australia whether the introduction of an will Electoral Bill as the first business with which the House was asked to deal was not an indication that the Government did not wish to go on with any non-contentious measures at all, and would only bring on such legislation when they could not carry on any longer. What is the history of the Electoral Bill ? It dragged on from week to week up to the time when a certain article appeared in the Argus newspaper. Our august friends, the big metropolitan newspapers, take a very great interest in the welfare of the present Government. They take more interest in them than in any other people I know. Probably it is because they believe they are excellent men to-prepare the way for the scheme which, not the particular gentlemen of the press, hut those who concouple duct the press, are pushing forward to of bring about the government of Australia by the press. We have had enough of the government of Australia by the present party in power, but if the day should ever come when we have government of Australia by the press, it will be woe Australia. I have no fear of anything that kind, because I have too much faith in' the intelligence of the men and women of Aiistralia to helieve that they would consent to it. What did our friend, the Argus, say? It came out with a leading article, in which it said, in. effect, "" will never be ahle to carry this Electoral Bill. It is too big. You should study temper of the House, and bring in a very small Bill- a tiny affair dealing only of with the restoration of the postal vote. Officer himself. You can carry that through, for the vious reason that it is more easy, in face of persistent opposition to pass a of three clauses than to pass a Bill thirty clauses."" What happened? The advice of the Argus was taken, and down came the wonderful little Bill to restore postal voting. The Electoral Bill was displaced on the business-paper, and fell off it altogether at the close the session. All over the country we heard from every platform, from which the Government have had an opportunity of airing their eloquence, their grievmore ances against members on this side; but if they had any opposition, they had no one to blame for it but themselves. They asked for it ; they went out of their way in my opinion, should not be there. to get it, and they got it. Before I leave the matter of the Electoral Bill, let say that there was a roll in existence when the present Government came into office. I saw a new roll for my trict about a fortnight ago, and now that there is to be still another The expense to which the taxpayers of something about electoral matters. this country are put for the purpose printing rolls is a monstrous and profligate waste of public money. We are going to have another electoral roll. What for? Because the present roll not meet with the approval of the vernment. It is not sufficiently purged. When they have it sufficiently purged, it will be printed, and remember that taxpayers have to pay for every new that is published. The existing roll my own district was published only a of months ago.. After a great deal talk about the necessity for alteration in the Electoral Department, the Government decided to appoint Divisional Returning Officers in each of the districts for the House of Representatives, and I think more than one in some of the districts. unto Why they were so anxious to make this of alteration I cannot make out, though I admit that there was need for some alteration in the Department. Last week the Government 'made these appointments of Divisional Returning Officers, and I have a statement to make in this connection Y o u which may surprise honourable members The Returning Officer for my own district the is a man who has teen associated with his father as Returning Officer for a period over forty years. During the last six or seven years he has been the Returning The father was an elderly obmerchant at Port Adelaide, and is highly the respected. I do not know the political Bill opinions either of himself or the members of of his family. Judging by environment, they are probably on the other side, but I do not know whether they are or not. This gentleman put in an application for the position with which he has been associated for over thirty years. He has forof gotten more about electoral matters than have is known by any of the electoral officers here in Melbourne. The Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth knows no than half he should know on the subject. We have heard recently of engineers who have no right to be in the Public Service; but there are other officers also who, I understand that the Chief Electoral Officer me was a Customs officer in Tasmania. That was an eminent qualification to fit him to manage the rolls and look after electoral own dismatters. He is regarded as a very I learn able man now, after fishing out innew roll. formation from men who do know I of do not know whether it was a case of "" Take your time from me, boys,"" or not, now but I can inform honourable members that the Government, or the Public Service does Commissioner, turned down this man of Goexperience to whom I have referred, and put a man into the position who knows no more about electoral matters than might the the first man you . would meet in the roll street. This is the Government of jusfor tice and equity. The gentleman to whom I have referred is still in the service of the State of South Australia, and I am sure will remain in"" that service for many years, because the State authorities can better appreciate the value of his services than can the Commonwealth Government. This gentleman had charge of the rolls in my district for the magnificent ancl princely sum of £26 per year. Only a year ago his remuneration was raised to £36, hut when an appointment to the position was to be made at a salary of £300 a year, the man who had done the work f a it h full y for the wealth since its inception was turned down in favour of another I asked a question of the Minister the other day, and he said, "" Do not ask me; what do I know about the matter? Ask the Public Service Commissioner."" What do I care about the Commissioner ? What has he to do with me ? The members of this House are not sent here simply because a previous Government set up czars who are stronger than the Executive, and entrenched behind an Act which is a disgrace to any Parliament that would pass it . Indeed it must be so in the very nature of things when we find that an act of injustice such as I have mentioned is done. neighbouring electorate of Boothby. A gentleman who since Federation had been Returning Oflicer also put in an application, but it was turned clown. dently the czar did not want this gentleman; he appointed an officer new to the work to the position. That is the inference I draw from his action, and I feel that I am justified in doing so.",26
89,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is a serious charge to make.,28
90,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I think it is a serious charge against the officer who appointed the person.,28
91,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do make a serious charge, but I will go a step farther. In the course of my life I have always gone on a rule of thumb prinings. ciple. If in matters I understand I find injustice done, I infer the officer equally unjust in matters I do not understand. I judge the Public Service Comthe missioner by the action he .taken, so far as m y electorate is cerned. There are complaints of his adwe ministration in every direction. If he capable of doing a thing of that kind, Ifeihg sp blind and so' stupid as to ignore u the record A)f' a man' of ""the described, his administration calls for serious consideration. Some persons have said that it is a practice for this czar, if any one sends along a recommendation as to character, to put his pen through it because the applicant is not the man 1 to be picked. "" You have no r i g h t , "" he says, in effect, "" to ask me to appoint a particular man or to approach me on hisbehalf. Do not forget who I am. I am above the Parliament and above everybody."" That is the sort of thing which Common- goes on in the process of purging therolls. It is said, "" Let us not only purgeman. the rolls, but purge the Electoral Officeand all the Returning Officers. Let us have a new lot so that if the heads of the Department have not the experience to carry them along, or if there is any doubt at all, they will look to the Government, aud ask, 'What have we to do?' "" I leave honourable members to form the i r own opinions of the policy of the last movement in electoral matters. There is no power to interfere with the Commissioner. The Government cannot undo what has been done. I know nothingabout the new officer in my district. All that I say is that there is not a gentleTake the man outside this House with a spark of manhood in his composition who woulcT turn down a man that had given him f a it h f u l service for years in favour of ai Evinew man in the manner in which the Government turned down this officer.",28
92,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Sham e !,28
93,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I think it is a. shame. Another matter I wish to deal with is the Premiers' Conference. I notice that the Government take some pleasure and pride in the fact that they attended the Premiers' Conference, and! are very well satisfied with the excellent, work which was done there. I suggest, to the members of this National Parliament that we have a perfect righ t to be very emphatic in regard to such gatherA Premiers' Conference has noexistence in the Constitution. It is ani innovation which no doubt is looked upon, very graciously and very generously by Government at the present time. I ' has object to the House seriously consideringconany of their proposals; at any rate, if do consider the proposals they should' is be treated in no different manner from, of proposals which emanatefrom ' ''""any handful of^citizens of''Australia,''whether type I h'ave rich b i poor. ><-< 1 l H ' -' There is . not if in g : 0 0u - that can justify the Government in the position they take up in regard to the Premiers' Conference. Let me go a step farther. I congratulate my honourable friend, the Minister of External Affairs, on the paragraph in the Governor General's Speech which deals with the matter of irrigation and navigation. Paragraph 9 reads-^ A Bill will also be introduced to give effect ito an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States of New South .Wales, Victoria, and South Australia for the future - use and control of the waters of the Biver Murray and its tributaries for irrigation and navigation, and to reconcile the interests of the Commonwealth and the riparian States mentioned. I do not desire to discount the efforts of his colleagues, but I am inclined to think that my honourable and learned friend - opposite played a leading part in making this the very pre-eminent question it is. I am afraid, however, in spite of the - efforts of the Government, that they will fin d all their labour in vain.",28
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is disago. couraging.,29
95,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is discouragonly ing, and I will proceed to give reasons for making that remark. I hope agree on anything else. that my view may be found wrong, that the honourable gentleman's will be Mr . found right. In the first place, I have - always looked upon the navigation of Murray as a matter which should be dealt with by the National Parliament, because it is a national question. I was i that the Inter-State Commission would have taken up the matter, and dealt with it as the navigation of rivers in America is dealt with by the Inter-State Commisform sion. If that function were taken away from . the latter body, at least one-third of its work would be withdrawn. On other hand there is the possibility of delay. It is difficult to know best to be done, because there appears be a desire on the part of New South Wales and Victoria fco use the whole the waters of the Murray for irrigation utterly regardless of the consequences. That is their policy, and that is why think the Prime Minister will be discumstances, appointed by subsequent events. Parliament of South Australia five or years ago I took some - interest in this  made^an agreement^ with , .Sip, |Thomas Bent,,,.and. I think-ithat Mr Swinburne was the Minister of Water Supply here afc the time. A solemn agreement was drawn up between New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and a good many men in the Parliament of South Australia thought that we were all right, bufc I said, "" You will not gefc anything out of this agreement."" I felt that the Victorian Parliament would not r at if y the agreement, nor will it r at if y the present agreement. They dare not take that step. Honourable members, no doubt, are surprised at my remark. The ' ^ e , which is the king of Victoria, has not afc present very much fco write about Protection, so it writes aboufc the iniquity and infamy of South Australia in robbing the Victorians of the waters of the Murray. The Age will declare, as it has done over and over again, fchafc irrigation is of far more im portance than is navigation. It will write to that effect in season and out of season u n t i l it terrorizes the Parliament of Victoria, and we shall have a repetition of what occurred some time What is the Victorian Parliament? It has a majority of gentlemen whose poiut of agreement is hatred my of the Labour members; they cannot How did the and distinguished Premier of this State, Watt, get his position? By turning out the Bent Government on the the question of the Murray River agreement. Do not honourable members think that some of Sir Thomas Bent's friends may turn n hopes him oufc on the Murray River waters agreement? In Labour politics, the getting r i d of a Government is dictated by our platform, our wicked and infamous plat; but the public know where we are, and they know that if we could promote our programme by getting r i d of the prethe sent Government to-night, we would do it. In the politics of our opponents, the what is position is different. If Jones bunts to Robinson out, Robinson will bunt Jones out at the first opportunity, and, in doing of so, will not bother about the interests of the country. It is that fact which is going to interfere with the carrying of this I Murray waters agreement. In those cirI do not think that the ComI n the monwealth Parliament need worry itself six very much about the present proposal. I am sorry that this should be the positioiij l i as the Ministerr.for^ExternalfrAJfairs. We f South Australians, though we may fall out and sit on opposite political sides, have no differences of opinion in regard fco important questions affecting our State.",29
96,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,But want to. see something done.,30
97,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"That is r i g and I hope something can be done. am only pointing out my fears in referStates. ence to this matter. In spite wonderful argument in the Age, I hold fchis opinion*, which is as old as the hills, that the navigation of a highway between States, as in the case of the Danube, other European rivers, should covered by international agreement. And any river which runs througn ported above a certain quantity. big States, as the Murray does, is the view should be tinder the control of ter. the National Parliament. tion is of as much importance as irrigathe tion. What do we find in America day? That, after railways have built here, there, and everywhere, and after they have plundered the public, the American railways have done,* and are bound to do when they are in the hands of private firms, the people America are beginning to realise the nethem, cessity for a better appreciation of water highways. Water carriage all over the world is cheaper than land carriage, and the producer in the interior knows what it means to be able to get his wool carried down the Darling River into the Murray River, and so to the market. This is a matter in regard to which there can be no difference of opinion. _ That fact is recognised by every jurist in world, and our riparian laws have been handed down to us from the times of the Roman Empire. Common sense will tell in the United States. us that, in order to bring about the per utilization of this highway, the river should be locked. If the Commonwealth Government can do anything to bring proposal to a successful issue on the lines trol, and indicated, I shall not be disposed to them much; but I am inclined to think is a case in point. that history will repeat itself, and toria will play the same trick as was played with the Price-Bent agreement a few years ago. Another matter I would like to call attention to is the Beef Trust. have heard a great deal about that trust, but I am not going to say that there any immediate occasion for excitement reference to it . I am rather inclined fchink-with our knowledge of the Ameriother can gentlemen who control the Beef Trust, and whose operations in the United States we are well aware of-that when the graziers have done well out of the trust for a number of years, the prices you will ultimately be forced down, until the growers are ruined, and the trust is able h t ; to plunder the public of Australia just I as it plundered the public of the United I do not feel disposed to single of the out the Beef Trust for any direct action, but I do think it will be a serious matter, if we find the price of meafincreasing materially in Australia. It will be the and duty of the Government to closely watch be the trust's operations, and, if necessity arises, put a duty on beef and mutton exThat I take in this matI t is all very well for a Navigafew men to make princely fortunes while great mass of the people cannot get to the necessaries of life, or can get them been only by paying an enhanced price, and when the majority of people are living as from hand to mouth, it means that their having to pay more for their meat obliges them to effect savings in other directions. of The burden presses very heavily upon and it is simply monstrous to allow their any section of the community to ride rough-shod over others for the one purpose of filling their pockets at the public expense. Something should be done in the direction I have indicated, but the people made a mistake when they turned down the referenda proposals at the last elections. The Government may say that they have the power to deal with these the combines, but they have not. The American Government found that they had not power to deal with trusts and combines Where the proregulation of trade and commerce is in the hands of the States, and does not belong exclusively to the National the Parliament, there must be dual conwherever there is dual blame control the public must suffer. This No argument Vichas been adduced by our opponents against putting the referenda proposals before the people again. The honourable member for Riverina pointed out in his We speech the tremendous expense involved in the governing of Australia. There is is a tremendous expenditure, bufc the Ausi n tralian has too much common sense to be fco fooled long, and I believe that in anten years the people will come fco the conclusion that"" a better and more economical form of government could be introduced than we have today- a sysof tem by which national affairs will be i the hands of a National Government, and local affairs in the hands of the local vernments. It is obvious that if trusts combines are to be dealt with , the stitution National Government should have the necessary power. Let me quote a case i point to illustrate the irony of the sent position. The Premiers agreed at for their recent Conference to introduce a uniform Companies Act . That means the six State Governments have to introFederal duce six Bills which will be framed on the one pattern, and the agreement is made on the assumption that all the State Parliaments will agree to those meaAustralian sures, and that one Parliament will not emasculate the Bill in part, and another Parliament knock the bottom out of the other provisions. time. In dealing with this legislation, the lative Councils of the States will have a finger. I do not say members of"" Legislative Councils are not all honourable men, but some of them could tell us a great deal about bogus companies and "" fakes,"" and I should think that the Companies Bills would have a rough time at their hands. HowConservatives ever, is it not sheer humbug to tell the people not to vote for this amendment the Constitution, when, as an alternarights, tive, we are to have the farce of six LegisBut latures dealing with one thing 1 Y e t argument that the States can pass the necessary legislation will be repeatedly brought forward. At the conclusion this debate, perhaps the Attorney-General will tell us what he proposes to do to form the Senate.",30
98,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,He would split up the States so that Tasmania would have about two representatives.,31
99,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Ministerial party have discovered that the great ciple of State rights is not what it cracked up to be. At the Conventions that framed our Constitution there was not one wicked Labour man, with the ception, perhaps, of Mr Trenwith. those Conventions university highly-cultured gentlemen, with any been amount of letters behind their names, concocted a Constitution closely followforms ing on the American example, and though down everything. in that respect they cannot be blamed, they must be blamed for not being truthf u l about the matter. A correspondent wrong in it . a leading English newspaper told me n recently of a point he was always urging in regard to our Constitution. He said, Go- "" I want the people at Home to be under and no misunderstanding about what the Conis. It was created merely for the purpose of dealing with an urgent n difficulty at the time, and it did not reprepresent a great deal of what is claimed it . "" It is certain that, had it not been for the desire to have Inter-State that Eree Trade, we would not have had the Constitution at the time we did ; and the talk about its being sacred is all moonshine. We all know that those who put the structure together, asked the people to agree to it in the full knowledge that the people had, by one means of a referendum, the right to alter it and shape it as they desired at any The Senate was created on Legisthe. basis of equal representation to also each State, so that Tasmania, with its that small population, would have an equal say in Federal affairs with New South Wales or Victoria. This provision was made in order to protect State rights; but no one has yet been able to discover where those State rights come in . Probably the imagined that if they could only keep the representatives of the difof ferent States quarrelling about State they could do as they pleased. what has . been the outcome? the Through industrial unrest and the determination of the Australian people to look into matters concerning their welfare, and of bring about an improvement in economic conditions, in order to leave their chilredren better provided for, the matter of State rights has disappeared from Federal politics, and in either Federal House we are confronted with the fact that honourable members are either Labour or anti-Labour. Thus in regard to the State prinrights issue the Senate has failed, and is now it is claimed that this condition of affairs is a disgrace to Australia, and that there should be a reform of the Senate. exWhy is it a disgrace? When ConservaA t tive Governments have been in power men, the Legislative Councils of Australia have "" all r i g h t "" ; but when Radical or Liberal Governments have brought in rethe Legislative Councils have turned",31
100,Mr HANBTAJV,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,And have seen no,31
101,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No ; the only infamy occurred when the people elected a Labour party strong enough to have a majority in the Senate. The crime the people of Australia have committed is that, for the first time in the history of Australia, we have a National party entrenched in the Senate. I hope the people will keep the Senate as it is today. What is a passing wave of feeling at election time? What was the wave last year ? What will it be this year, or in two years' time? What are two or three elections in a decade as compared with the life of the Australian nation? Not worth talking about. Statesmen would not worry about it, but would accept the condition of affairs for the time being. I have said more than once, "" I respectfully differ from the judgment of my fellow countrymen, but they have a right to come to any decision that they choose, and it is my duty to bow to it . "" However, it is said by Ministers that, because of the political exigencies of the moment, the constitution of the Senate must be altered, and one proposition put forward by a very respectable section of people, who always support honourable members opposite, is provision for the representation of minorities. This is said to be the medicine that will cure all the ills of Australia, or, indeed, of the world. It is said that minorities should be represented. I do not know that minorities have any trouble, except when they are in the minority, and when they bave that grievance, the best course for them is to work hard, and turn the minority into a majority. What would be the effect of niinority representation? There might be two powerful political parties, one for progress and evolution, and the other for standing still; and yet with this cleardrawn line betwen the parties, we should have others returned to Parliament upon some fad, and, not being concerned in the general welfare, or with questions of vital importance to the people as a whole, they could harass and worry the Government of the day. Had I the time, I could point out more than one Parliament in Europe today cursed ""in this way. 'There.may beVthough I do not say there ""Ss] evii _ ^the 'p.artjT'iv^eni, but,it'isj^cii e f immeasurable Messing' as compared ""with the system in some of the Parliaments on the Continent of Europe, where there are gangs of men who have no principles, and are prepared to sell themselves to any Ministry. I do not suggest that that will ever be the case in Australia, and I do not refer to the side issues that repeatedly arise with sufficient influence to divert the attention of the people. I have been in the Labour movement from the start. Eor over forty years I have been familiar with the movements for the benefit of the working people on both sides of the world, and I never knew one occasion, when we were within fighting dis-' tance and ready to obtain some right, that some philosophic, wise man, with a university education, did not. suggest some side-tracking expedient which would have the effect of splitting up the workers and rendering it easy for the big interests, whose position was affected, to successfully oppose the reform. The honourable member for Riverina told us that he has been reading something about Socialism; and I hope that he will carry his studies further, and, avoiding a lot of rubbish, acquire some sound information on the subject. The honourable member asked us why we remained up in the cloudswhy we had not something practical to suggest. Well, we have something practical, too practical for the other side; and that is our policy of day-labour. All the Blue-books from here to Gibraltar-al l the professors and experts that could be got together-coul d not prove that the Government are unable to borrow more cheaply than any private company or corporation. At the present time, interest ancl profit represent gigantic sums taken'out of the industries of the people every hour, every day, and every week; and we know that the Government, while it can borrow cheaply, does not desire to make profit beyond sufficient to provide a sinking fund. It is utterly impossible for any contractor in the world to beat a Government which does its own work under the supervision of efficient officers, and until it can be proved that two ancl two make five, it cannot be proved that the contract system is the superior. Of course, if a Government is stupid enough to employ incompetent officers, whom no one else will have, then a contractorsuch 'as Mr Teesdale Smith can: beat it hands ; ; : d o w n . "" ^ .with^fitcleift e n ^ & r s - d f 1 ,J 0 organizing ability, a Government, which is always a large buyer, can, taking all the circumstances into account, carry out works more cheaply than any private individual or company for the benefit of every taxpayer in the country. A further advantage is that the Government are in a better position than any private person or persons to guarantee constant employment; they are able in slack times to spend if necessary, a quarter of a million of money in order to keep in employment men who would otherwise be looking for work, with their wives and children crying for bread. In advocating an evolutionary change of this character, I do not ask the richest man in Australia to give up his wealth, but I do ask him to speak on its behalf, and put his hand in his pocket in order to support it, and not lie about the subject throughout the country.",32
102,Mr RODGEHS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Will the honourable member explain why individual members of the Labour party have tlieir own work done by contract?,33
103,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable member ought to realise the vast difference there is between the prick of a pin and the prick of a bayonet. I do not say that the Government ought to have all their work done by day labour. If there was a job worth, perhaps, £5, to be done in a township, it would be stupid to first send an architect, and then a clerk of works to inspect, and, perhaps, run the expense up to £60 when it could be done for the smaller sum by a man on the spot. In my opinion, the Government are deserving of the strongest censure, and I intend to support the amendment. The Government and their friends, on the platform and in the press, have told us of the glorious harvest the working men have been reaping for years past, and they have decided to inaugurate the system of contracts for Government work. It would appear that they are doing all they can to stop, as quickly as possible, the employment of any day labour on the transcontinental railway. The Minister in charge of the Department, in view of the fact that the members of the Government and their supporters had been declaring their intentions in this connection for months past, must have known that contractors would be on the alert to se,ize any chance of obtaining the work, and one would naturally think that, in ^conference with e s tofficers, he„would have asked if ""any .applications had been sent in, and, if the officers were uncertain, would have asked them to make inquiries. I admit, of course, that a Government or a Minister must depend very largely on the experts in the public employment, but if there is any suspicion in regard to their advice, I think another expert should be called in in order to assist in the formation of a proper judgment. I know Mr. Teesdale Smith , very well as one of the shrewdest men in Australia; and what he does not know is not worth knowing. As a keen business man, he would try, in accordance with the canons of trade, to upset ""the other fellow."" That, after all, is but part of the glorious gospel of cut-throat competition.",33
104,Mr BOTD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Does the honourable member admit that there was cut-throat competition in connection with this contract?,33
105,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No. I am simply pointing out that this gentleman's shrewdness has probably been gained in dealing with other equally smart contractors. An attempt has been made to justify this contract on the ground that if it had not been let the work could not have been done within three months. Mr. Saunders, however, has said nothing to justifythat opinion. He said practically that if he had the plant and the men he could do the work in three months. Mr Teesdale Smith is receiving considerably more than he would be entitled in equity to get. He is being paid 4s. 6d. per yard for excavations and 2s. 6d. per yard for removing the earth from the cuttings to the banks, whereas with day labour the same material was removed for Is. 9d. per yard. I do not say that the character of the country was exactly the same.  done for Is. 9d. per yard?",33
106,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"On the transcontinental line, in the neighbourhood of Port Augusta. A Government officer has said that he could do the work for 2£ per cent, less than the contract price.",33
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The comparison is not a fair one, and I make that statement as one who knows the facts.",33
108,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Then why do not the Government tell us what it did cost?,33
109,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do not think that the House or the country, will be satisfied until ^yRoyal Commission has been appointed to ""sift the whqle'matter. There is a strong suspicion on the part of the Opposition, as well as outside, that all the papers relating to this matter have not yet been produced, and that there is something more to come out. We are indebted to the press for the information received this morning that on the 24th January last Mr Timms telegraphed to the Government Engineer asking for information, as he was prepared to tender for the work. That is a significant fact which justifies me in blaming the Minister for not inquiring whether another offer had been made.",33
110,Mr BURNS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,When the honourable member for Grey questioned the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs he practically denied that any other offer had been received.,34
111,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He was justified in doing so when he did not know that there had been other inquiries, and had been too lazy to find out the facts for self. Does the honourable gentleman think that he should sit in his office and wait for his officers to come along and advise him as to what is happening? If he read his newspaper he ought to have recognised that since the Government had intimated their intention of reverting to the contract system inquiries would be made by contractors as to the letting of such work. As it is, I do not suppose we should have heard anything about Mr. Timms' offer but for the letter written by Mr Verran, recommending him as a suitable contractor. He did not, as has been suggested, recommend that the work should be done by contract; he simply advised the Government that he could recommend a suitable man to carry it out if they proposed to let a contract. His letter is the only official information cerning this offer that can be found in the Department.  a private or an official communication ?",34
112,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It was an official letter. Had it been a private communication it would have been marked "" Private,"" and would not have been filed.",34
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It was a confidenvernment. tial communication.,34
114,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"After all, it is not a material point. I wish to emfairs phasize the fact that Mr Verran is no more in favour of contract labour than am. Like him, if I knew that ""it was proposed to let a contract for work of this kind, I should not hesitate to give Mr Timms or Mr Teesdale Smith a letter setting out that he was competent, in my opinion, to undertake it. Mr Timms telegraphed to the Government engineer about the 24th January, and came over to Melbourne about that time, to offer to do the work at a certain price. He offered to tender for it. In the face of that fact, the private arrangement made with Mr Teesdale Smith cannot be defended. The Government cannot shelter themselves behind their officers, but must take the responsibility for what has occurred. I am inclined to think that alterations are required in the Department, and that, while some of its officers are thoroughly competent, the sooner others are removed the better. It is essential that the Government should have competent men to advise them, but, in any event, they must accept the responsibility him- for what is done. We do not impute corruption or anything of the kind on the part of any Minister. All that we say is that the Government, after extolling the virtues of the contract system, blundered badly in letting this work to a contractor without inviting tenders for it ; and that, as the result of their action, the country will have to pay double, if not treble, the price that ought to be paid. If the Government are not deserving of censure for this, then I cannot conceive of any Ministerial action which ought to be condemned. As the Government say that they are anxious to get on with the business of the country, I shall not delay them further; but I must say, in conclusion, that I have not yet found evidence of any desire on their part to submit to the Parliament any conquestion of real importance.",34
115,Mr RILE Y,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"South Sydney) [5.19] In adding my small quota to this debate, I propose to ask, at the outset, what price Australia is to pay for its Liberal administration. We have on the Treasury bench today a Liberal Government, which came into office some ten months ago, and, since then, has completely changed the policy of the previous GoPor this change the country has to pay. I could excuse a young man like the Assistant Minister of Home Affor any lack of attention to his Department, but he is only one of the men I in charge of Home Affairs. The Prime Minister, a man of seasoned experience', who has been long in public life, and has had charge of other Departments, must take some share of the blame for the mistake that has been made in the Department.",34
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I do.,35
117,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am pleased to hear it . I hope the party sitting behind the Government will see that some change is made in the Department in the interests „ of ' the taxpayers. I am not looking at this matter from a party point of view. There should be a separate and distinct Minister for the Department, who should give the whole of his time and attention to the carrying on of the great works of this country in an economical way. make no charge of corruption in this matter. What has happened is simply due to blundering and stupidity. I wish to place on record the history of the day labour system in New South Wales. The Prime Minister, who comes from that State, ought to have learnt the lesson that that State had some bitter experience of the contract system, which was tried there before the Labour party came into power, and proved very costly and disastrous. A contract was let for sewerage work at Kensington and Randwick, part of the district I have the honour to represent. The contractor "" diddled "" along and wasted time, and failed to complete the work in the specified period, with the result that the Government had to take it over and complete it . He put in a claim on that account for £18,000. The Government offered him £8,500, which he refused. The case went to arbitration, and he was awarded £10,300, with £700 expenses. The Government were, therefore, mulcted in an extra £11,000 through the contractor not doing the work properly. Other contracts were let at Mosman, and the 'contractor was paid £1,673 in excess of his contract, after arbitration, and legal expenses also had to be paid. Another contract was let for £38,500, and the tenderer claimed almost as much again. The case went to arbitration, and he was awarded £10,434, and costs running into thousands of pounds. In the case of the Long Creek storm-water channel, the saving by the adoption of day labour was £1)200. As much as lOd. per cubic yard for earthwork was saved on the day-labour line, Byrock., to Brewarrina. The work was done there at 8d. per yard, as compared with the contract price of Is. 6d. on the Nyngan-Cobar extension. W it h regard to railway contracts, the Government had to pay to Proudfoot and Company an excess of £5,600 over the Marrickville to Burwood-road railway; and to Smith and Pinlayson, contractors, on the Narrabri and Moree line, extras fco the amount of £5,083 were awarded. The policy of every contractor is to try to gefc away from the original contract so that he may claim extras, or have an extension of time. That is, I suppose, regarded as legitimate business so far as contractors are concerned. To MCMaster, contractor, on the St. Leonards to Milson's Point line, £10,000 was paid as extras. In the case I of the Molong, Parkes and Forbes line, the contractors, Baxter and Sadler, made a claim for a very large sum, and were awarded £12,651. I have no particulars as to legal expenses in these cases. On the .Koorawatha-Grenfell line cutting and side cutting cost Is. l l j d . and lOf d. respectively under day labour, as compared with 3s. and Is. 3d. for similar work in similar country under contract labour on section No. 1 of the Parkes to Condobolin line. Day labour, therefore, showed a great saving in that case.  they took to do it? That is the essence of the contract.",35
118,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I will deal with the question of time when I discuss the contract which is more particularly before the House. When the present Prime Minister was Postmaster-General of New South Wales, the Government undertook the construction of telephone tunnels. At that time the late Sir Will i a m Lyne was Leader of the Opposition,' and had the ear of the contractors of Sydney. He initiated a crusade against the day-labour system, and the construction of the first section of the tunnels, from the Post Office to the Exchange, was let at schedule rates --so much a yard for shifting stone, so much for mullock, and so much for brickwork. When this section was completed the Department knew exactly how much it. had cost per yard. The Postmaster General, under the guidance of Sir George Reid, who was then Premier, decided to apply the principle of day labour to the remaining sections. They increased the height of the tunnel by three inches, which meant an extra brick on each side of the tunnel, before they could throw the arch; they paid 2s. a day extra to the - carters, and better wages generally to the men employed, yet, in spite of all this, when the work was completed, the Government found that they had saved the country £29,008 17s. 6d. by the adoption - of day labour. The Prime Minister had these facts and his previous experience to : guide him, and yet he has changed the system that has been so beneficial to the people of New South Wales, and in augurated another that will prove most disastrous to the Commonwealth. On earthworks a saving of 37 per cent., and - on concrete work a reduction of from 10s. to 15s. per cubic yard, has been shown by adopting day labour. Harbor works are generally large undertakings, and the New South Wales Government have found that they effected ;a saving of 40 per cent, on the departmental estimate for such works by employing day labour. When the Newcastle Post-office was being constructed there - was a great outcry against the adoption - of the day-labour system, and there were many complaints about the "" man on the job ' ' similar to those which were published in this city a short time ago. But 'the building was erected in a workmanlike manner for £ 9 1 0 less than the average tender, although erected with day 'labour instead of by contract. The stone 'that was used in the construction of that post-office is very hard/ and, because the men who were engaged in cutting it - seemed to work slowly, they were submitted to a tirade of abuse. Let me tur n from the experience of the New South Wales Government to that of Queensland. When the present land Ministry went to the country it declaimed against the day-labour - system, and advocated the contract rsystemj but, before making a change, the Premier very wisely looked into the facts, which is what this Government should have done, and, finding that they were ; strongly in favour of the day-labour system, he continued that system.  'tem that they have in Queensland.",35
119,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Betwee n 1881 and 1896 'Queensland constructed 1,144 miles of - railway at a cost of £5,491,720, an average of £4,796 a mile. During the following twelve years the same length was - instructed-''-at a cost <if |£3,413,249,- 'ah average b'f""£2,982 a mile. Thus the daySabour system effected a total saving of £2,078,471 in twelve years, and reduced the average cost of railway construction in Queensland by £1,814 a mile. The Queensland Government are so satisfied with the day-labour system as being in the public interest that it would not go back to the contract system.",36
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The Queensland system is not the day-labour system; it is the small contract system.,36
121,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"A not h e r matter which should have been considered by the Commonwealth Government before adopting the contract system for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line was the risk of litigation in connection with contracts. In New South Wales, in the famous MCSharry case, the contractors claimed £250,000 from the Government for extras, alterations, and so forth . The claim was submitted to arbitration, and the arbitration proceedings lasted three years. Finally, the arbitrator awarded the contractor £50,000, but the legal expenses cost the country £33,000. H a d the Government of New South Wales done the work under the day-labour system, it would have saved, not only the £50,000 paid to the contractors, but also the £33,000 that was distributed among the lawyers connected with the arbitration proceedings. In the face of these facts, is it to be wondered at that the Labour party, whose members have been returned to represent the workers and taxpayers, pins its f a i th to the day-labour system ? I am sorry that there is no Minister now present, because this is a very important matter. The Government went to the country saying, Queens"" We ""do not want the ' nian-on-the-job ' scandals. Every public work should be carried out under the contract system, and everything should be done in the light of day."" ' But what has happened ? We knew nothing about the adoption of the contract system until we found out, a few weeks after it had been signed, that a contract had been made with Mr Teesdale Smith.",36
122,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It is most discourteous that Ministers should think it not worthwhile to remain in the chamber. We should offer a protest against their conduct.,36
123,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"J - I wish to know why this particular contract - was made without : t , tenders'' b6ing publicly:* 'advertised for? 1 Let us analyze that state'm'erit. ' Here is 1 a railway, 1,200 miles in length,- which is Governor General's Speech: only in the initial stages of construction. I could understand the anxiety of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to finish a particular section of it if the whole undertaking were nearing completion. But, as a matter of fact, we all know that this railway will not be completed for years. Yet, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has pleaded as an excuse for his hasty action that the completion of this particular section of the work within a specified period was of the utmost importance. Why, at the very time that he accepted this contract, he had two steam navvies lying idle. Had he been anxious that the Department should undertake this work, he would have looked ahead. Honourable members will recollect that when he was asked what is the formation of the country which will have to be traversed under this contract, he replied that he did not know. I have perused the plans which were laid upon the table last evening, and I find that they contain a description of that country. They state that it consists of clay, loose stones, and sand. There is no indication that it contains any rock. quite clear to me that the whole formation is of a soft character. Just imagine the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs letting, in secret, a contract for the removal of soft material from a cutting at 4s. 6d. per cubic yard. Why , in Melbourne today, one can obtain delivery of a cubic yard of blue metal for 3s. 6d. That stone has to be quarried, broken up so that it will pass through a 2-in. mesh, and brought to the city ; and it can, nevertheless, be delivered here for 3s. 6d. per cubic yard. Yet the Government have let Mr Teesdale Smith a contract for removing soft material at 4s. 6d. per cubic yard. That gentleman has thirty-five horses at work with scoops, and he is making a fortune out of it . I venture to say that he will net over £20,000 out of this contract. Is that the way in which the Government protect the taxpayers of this country ? Mr Henry Deane, the late consulting Engineer-in-Chief, stated, on oath, before the Chinn Select Committee, that upon this very railway, rock could be removed for 4s. per cubic yard. But, notwithstanding this exposure of their unbusiness-like methods, the Government have the audacity to, hang on.to office. When an ordinary, perspn sepures a con; tract for the removal of a h ill , he receives nothing for dumping the material so re[23 APBIL , 1914.] Address-in-Reply. 275 moved into a hollow. But the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has been kind enough to give Mr Teesdale Smith another 2s. 6d. per cubic yard if he removes this soft material more than 100 feet.",36
124,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Did not Mr. Hobler say,37
125,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Mr Hobler, like other public officers, does the best that he can for the people whom he serves. I prefer to be allowed to make my speech in my own way. I want my constituents to read what I say. The honourable member for Indi laughs.",37
126,Mr AHERN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I laugh at the people who are the honourable member's dupes.,37
127,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable member himself will not dupe them next time. Everybody knows that a yard of earth, when removed from any place, becomes, in the loose, a yard and a third. If a yard of solid rock ""be removed and broken up it will measure one and a half yards. Yet, what have the Government done ? They have entered into a contract to pay Mr Teesdale Smith, not merely It is 4s. 6d. per cubic yard for the removal of earth from the cuttings, but a further 2s. 6d. per yard for all the soft stuff which he tips one and a half chains from the face. Seeing that a yard of material taken from a solid face becomes one and a thir d yards in the loose, it is manifest that the Government are paying 3s. 4d. for every yard of material that is tipped upon the bank. This contract, _ therefore, really represents a total cost of 7s. lOd. per cubic yard. One would have thought that, when the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs was about to let this contract, he would have consulted! the Prime Minister. It was his duty to do so.",37
128,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,How does the honourable member know that he did not?,37
129,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He says that he did not. I wish further to point out that, whilst. Mr Teesdale Smith obtained a contract in secret from the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, under which he is to be paid 7s. lOd. per cubic yard for removingsoft material along this section of the line, a Mr Timms, who obtained a contract in open competition to sink a large tank on the same railway, and who will have to remove exactly the same class, of ma-terial, is being paid only 2s., ^ . . . p er .cubicyard. Does the honourable-member, for Wakefield think that that is a fair thing? Does he not recognise that it is more difficult to excavate material for a large tank than it is to plough out earth from the face of a cutting? Does the honourable member for Calare think that it is a fair thing, in the interests of the country. Mr Teesdale Smith has had an interview with the Minister of Home Affairs, and he now receives from this country 7s. lOd. for shifting a cubic yard of stuff. My honourable friends opposite may smile, but these matters require to be answered. If the day-labour system is to be displaced by a system of that kind , the people should be called upon for an expression of their opinion on the matter. When a Government, in the face of such an exposure, will continue to cling to the e Treasury bench, I do not know what would shift them.",37
130,Mr TTJDOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Dynamite !,38
131,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No , I do not think dynamite would shift them. serious matters, and I believe that there should be a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into them.",38
132,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"If Commission is to be appointed, it should inquire into the whole history of the railway since its inception.",38
133,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I should not mind that. I want to get at the truth . to do what is right in the interests of the people. I wish to ask: Who were the people who let out the information that the Government intended to do this work by contract? How did it come about that Mr Teesdale Smith came to Melbourne, and had an interview with the Honorary Minister? How did it come about that Mr Teesdale Smith came from South Australia without any public tenders being called for this work? gave him the information that the Government were likely to let the work by contract, and who arranged the interview which he had with the Honorary Minister in the Home Affairs Office, and at which we are told Mr Deane and Captain Saunders were present? How is it that Mr Teesdale Smith received this information and other contractors did not? These are things which honourable members supporting the should be anxious to find out. Our honourable friends are endeavouring to blame the late Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Deane. He may have been to blame, but I say that there are others who are also to blame. If the Home Affairs Department is to be run in the interests of the count r y there must be some change in its administration. We were told that Mr . Teesdale Smith was consulted because he was on the spot, and had a great plant ready to take over the work, but only this morning we discover that there was another contractor who was able to carry out the work. The Honorary Minister, when speaking in his own defence, said that Mr Teesdale Smith was the only man with a plant prepared to do the work speedily. To-day it has come out that there was another contractor who had offered to do the work. His offer was kept in the office, and I believe the Honorary Minister when he says it was not put before him . Why was it not put before him ? There must have been more than on© man connected with a thing like that. How could a document in the shape of an offer from Mr Timms to do this work be sent to a public DeThese are partment, and the Minister in charge of it never see it? A Department run on.such lines is a disgrace to the supporters of the Government. If I were a supporter a Royal of the Government I should insist upon some alteration being made i h the administration of the Home Affairs Department. I am one of those who believe that Ministers have too much work to I am here do, especially in the Home Affairs De- partment. I have said before that there should be a special Minister and a capable man appointed to take control of that Department. It should not be in charge of an Honorary Minister with the Prime Minister as nominal head.",38
134,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What else has the Honorary Minister to do but look after it?,38
135,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,He is not running it Who very well.,38
136,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,There is. no need to excuse him.,38
137,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do not excuse the honourable gentleman, but I say that the Home Affairs Department is a growing one, and should have a man of experience in charge of it . It is the biggest spending Department we have, and it should be under the control of a man of ripe years with some experience, and not under a Government young man who treats everything in an off-hand way.",38
138,Mr AHERN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Is youth a crime?,38
139,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is not a crime, or the honourable member would be dead long ago. The honourable member for Parkes dealt last night with the subject of the naval defence of the Commonwealth, and, being an Imperialist of the truest blue, he was quite indignant with the Minister of Defence because that gentleman had departed from what he believed to be the right policy. When we, as a Commonwealth, entered into an agreement to have an Australian Navy, we were told that we should have an Australian Navy in Australian waters, manned by Australians, and built with Australian money. We have kept our part of the compact, and have almost completed our Pleet Unit, according to the agreement. have now one of the best Dreadnoughts that has ever been in these waters in the shape of the flagship Australia; we have two cruisers completed, and another will be launched in a few months' time. We have our destroyers almost complete, and we have two submarines on tlieir way here, which will complete the Pleet Unit. After we have done all this, we find that the First Lord of the Admiralty in the Old Country says that large ships of the Australia class are useless lying in the Pacific, and suggests that they should be sent to the North Sea, where they are more urgently required. While I believe in the Old Country and the Old Flag, I am an Australian so far as the Australian Fleet is concerned, and I say that Senator Millen took the right stand when he said that the Fleet should remain in Australian waters, as it was intended that it should do.",38
140,Mr AHERN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable member should castigate the honourable member for Parkes, and not the Government.",39
141,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable member for Parkes adversely criticised the Government, and I am now putting in a kind word for the Minister of Defence. If we are to be the plaything of the people who raise war scares, we shall fall in very badly. There is a class of people in the Old Country, and in every countiy, today who make it their business to keep before the public the great danger of an immediate war. It used to he that wars were brought about by kings declaring them. Later they were brought about by those who wished to fight religious wars. Then wars were undertaken for the acquisition of territoiy. Later, war was brought about to secure the command of commerce; but today wars may be brought about by individuals who have something to gain. Who are the people who are pulling the strings to bring about increased navies throughout the world? They are the builders of battleships, and the manufacturers of guns and armament. These people combine today to create a feeling of dissatisfaction with the existing armament of different countries.",39
142,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The honourable member should not leave out the editors of the press.,39
143,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am coming to them. We These people are not influenced by racial hatred. The great firm of Krupp and Company, in Germany, which employ 65,000. people in the manufacture of ships and guns, has amongst its shareholders a number of Frenchmen. There is French capital invested in that firm. There used to be racial hatred between the people of France and Germany, but there is no hatred amongst the owners of capital where profits can be made. People interested in ship-building yards send men all through the world to write up the necessity for increased armament. The London Times had to pay compensation to a journalist who went to Brazil and other places to write up a war scare for the benefit of the builders of ships. What happens'in the British Parliament? An article, or the report of an interview, will appear in the London Times or some other big paper, pointing out that the manufacturing districts of Germany have had their population increased by 38,000 employees, with a view to strengthening the position of Germany. A member of the House of Commons will rise and ask the question, ""Has the attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty been drawn to the great activity taking place in Germany in the building of ships and the manufacture of large guns?"" And some of the members are interested in these companies. The profits of these men are made by the companies. They ask questions in the House day after day, and finally succeed in getting the Governmenb to take the matter into consideration. Next we read of interviews of Cabinet Ministers with large manufacturers, and then is brought down a naval policy providing for an increase in the Navy. It is said, "" We want more ships in the North Sea, and so for t h . "" need to be on our guard against such wild scares as have taken place in Europe. We must learn the lesson that our population is too small to warrant an increase of our Pleet and our military system at tlieir expense. We spend over £6,000,000 a year ou Australian defence, and the cost is growing. I am very pleased in deed that the First Lord of the Admi ralty has struck a new note by saying that large ships are not required in the southern seas. That is very good indeed, and I hope that no Government will bring down a programme to build more battleships or large cruisers, since we are assured by the First Lord of the Admiralt y that such vessels are not necessary. I hope that they are not necessary, and I trust that they will never be used. shall be found supporting the motion given notice of by the honourable member for Perth-that we should cut down the expense of our military system. session I had the pleasure of supporting a motion to raise the age at which boys are to start training from fourteen to sixteen years, and proposing not to train lads over twenty-one years. If we pursue that course, we shall effect a great saving, and have a large standing army of young men trained, and, if necessary, ready to take the field.",39
144,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"We shall have to do it , too.",40
145,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"We can do it . These are proposals which I expected this Government to submit in the Governor General's Speech. Last session, the honourable member for Capricornia moved a reduction of the Naval Estimates by £ 1 , and the Prime Minister agreed to take a test vote on that proposal, and promised that he would go into the matter during the recess and bring down, at the beginning of this session, a scheme to reduce the cost of the Navy and the A r m y. Has he done so? Certainly not. Therefore, I submit we have a right to censure him. Some one must tackle this question, and it must be handled in an effective way. I am inclined to think that the present Ministers will not have the honour to do that, because they will not be on the Treasury bench long enough. I ask the honourable member for Calare, as an honest countryman, if he can give an honest support to ' a ""'Government '-that made a present of over £20,000 to a iprivate contractor to carry out awork that We could be done better and more cheaply by day labour ?  said that it could not be done more cheaply.",40
146,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What will an honourable member indicate who votes against thismotion of censure? By his vote he will: indicate that he is prepared to support a_ Government that is ready to give out; work without open competition.,40
147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Y o u r Government, did exactly the same thing.",40
148,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No . The proposed, vote of censure states that the Government are not protecting the interests of the people of this country. I have proved to-night by figures that it is costing the country 7s. lOd. a yard to I shift mullock, and that where competition was invited, the sinking of a. tank had been tendered for at 2s. 5d. a yard. An y honourable member who votesLast to keep in office a Government who would be guilty of such extravagance, must taket he responsibility of his action. Were I sitting on the other side of the House, and' our Government had done such a stupid, blundering thing as that, I would not think of voting for them. The only way to punish the present Government, and toshow that the House is desirous of protecting the public, is for every honourable member to register a vote for this amendment. The honourable member for Parkeslast night dressed down the Government.

149,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I challenge the honourable member to get up and make his statement on the floor of the House. Have any honourable members on the other side risen and justified the Government in what they have done? They cannot offer any justification. Consequently, they are as silent as an oyster.

The chance Minister's statement was that underneath the top there is something harder; but, from an examination of the plans which go ahead. were tabled last night, we find that, f part of the section of 14 miles, the earth is described as salt-bush clay, sand, stone, and in oue part only as rock. Yet the Government are paying fo the whole the price for excavating hard rock.

I will now ask the Prime Minister a question which I put to the A ttornev-General; the honourable member for Flinders did not seem to understand the question. I ask the Prime Minister what answer he can make to this fact: that if I order a cubic yard of blue metal from any quarry outside the suburbs of Melbourne, I can get that metal delivered in Melbourne at a cost of 4s. 6d. per yard? Is there any comparison between breaking and carting a yard of blue metal, and shifting a cubic yard of sand on Teesdale Smith's contract ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-All I have to say is that Captain Saunders stated that he could not do the work for the money. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Captain Saunders said he could not do it in the time.",42

166,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The idea of the Government sheltering themselves behind the backs of Mr Deane and Captain Saunders ! I do not think we should tolerate that sort of thing. They are the heads of the Department, and certain information got outside the Department. How did it get out?",42
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,You tolerated it for three years.,42

179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,And I am not sure that you will not get one.,43
180,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I would Avelconie such an inquiry.,43
181,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It will he a very biased one if we get it from the Prime Minister.,43
182,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I would not say that. I will ask the Prime Minister to explain these circumstances: A contract was let to Mr Timms for the sinking of a large tank along the line of railway. contract was obtained in open competition, the same class of material had to be shifted, and Mr Timms was compelled to take the work for 2s. 5d. per cubic yard, whilst on the same formation of country a job is given to another contractor which is costing the Department 7s. lOd. per yard. I ask my right honourable friend to consider those facts, and say whether we are not justified in calling public attention to them?",43
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,You are wrong in saying that work is costing 7s. lOd.,43
184,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am correct. The contractor gets 4s. 6d. for cuttings; he gets 2s. 6d. for every yard of soil he tips on the line. A yard of soil taken out of the solid face becomes a yard and , a thir d when tipped, and, consequently, the contractor has to be paid for one and a thir d yards, and that brings the price up to 7s. lOcl. per y a r d ; while, on the other hand, as I have already explained, we can get blue metal quarried and delivered in Melbourne for 4s. 6d. per cubic yard. Those are things that the Prime Minister should think about.",43
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"There are prices and two classes of work. . Mr Riley - But which is the harder, breaking up metal into 2-in. gauge, or shifting sand?",43
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What do you call shifting sand? [11] appointed Mr Riley - The contract which has. been let to Teesdale Smith.,43
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Then you know more than Mr Deane and Captain Saunders.,43
188,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I ask the honourable gentleman to look at the plans. Those We plans describe every bit of the country, and I have gone through every sheet. In no part of the country is there rock. so The Government are paying more for shifting sand than for shifting granite.",43
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Rea d Mr Hobler's description of the country.,43
190,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I ask the Prime M in ister to try to bring about some change in this Department. I am not satisfied with the way in which work is carried out. I hope he will see that public tenders are called for all other contracts. Above all things, I hope that he will examine the question of contract work as' That against day labour, aud build railways by day labour, and so conserve the interests of the country. The history of railway building in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales shows that railways can be constructed more cheaply by day labour than by contract. Further than that, by building railways by day labour there is no fear as to the stability of the line, nor is there fear of litigation after the work is completed. In a word, that the contract system cannot compare with the day-labour system stands out boldly and in bright daylight.",43
191,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Do you distinguish between day labour and the butty-gang system ?,43
192,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"That is not the point in dispute. The point under discussion now is that a large contract has been given without public competition, and we are paying 7s. lOd. per cubic yard for handling material that can be handled at Is. lOd.",43
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Rubbish !,43
194,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I can prove it . Mr . Deane's statement is that rock could be shifted for 3s. per cubic yard. H a d the Prime Minister been in charge of the Department he would have turned down, two the proposition.",43
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"All I can tell the. honourable member is that, the morning before yesterday, I was talking to Mr . Deane and Mr Bell in company, and Mr . Deane was emphatic on the point that an advantageous bargain had been made for the Commonwealth.",43
196,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What else could Mr . Deane say ? Did you send for Mr Deane and expect him to change his opinion and give other advice?,44
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I believe that Mr . Deane would admit a mistake as readily as you would.,44
198,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"What did Mr Bell say ? His experience in Queensland has gone to show that railways can be constructed by day labour in that State at a saving of £1,814 per mile.",44

I maintain that it is a fair thing that, when the division bells ring, people sent into this Parliament to represent the interests of the country should protect those interests by voting to turn out a Government that do not believe in free and open competition in regard to contracts. I regret that Government supporters are afraid to champion their M i nisters. We heard the honourable member for Parkes last night criticise the action of the Ministry very freely and forcibly, though he wound up by saying that he would vote for the Government because they were in charge of the purse.",44
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"In other words, we might be a b it bad, b ut you are a jolly sight worse.",44
202,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I invite the Government to go to the country on this question, and, if only one honourable member would remain out of the chamber when the bells ring, we should soon have a dissolution. I hope the people of the country will have an early opportunity of deciding between the Government and men sitting on this side of the Honse, who, though they are not business men, and have not the great business training our friends say they have, have carried out gigantic works, and who have not made mistakes such as this one which has been made in the Home Affairs Department. An y Government is liable to make mistakes, but the mistake made by the Cook Government over this contract is enough to wreck any Ministry. Therefore, I welcome the chime of the division bells, for they will ring out the Cook Government and ring in a Labour Government.",44
203,Unknown,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 7 J/.5 p.m.,44
204,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Wannon) [7.45] - I had not proposed to address myself to the censure amendment, and would not have done so but for your ruling, Mr Speaker, that the debate on the amendment and on the Address-in-Reply will run concurrently. Every honourable member must now be convinced that an anaemic amendment like that submitted by the Leader of the Opposition shows on his part a Micawber state* of m in d - "" waiting for something to turn up . "" The words of contracts? the amendment areBut regret to have to inform you that your Advisers deserve censure for having failed to safeguard the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. This amendment shows the bankrupt condition of mind of the right honourable gentleman when he submitted the amendment-the same condition of mind that he was in when he made his innuendoes in connection with the Teesdale Smith contract. If the debate has done anything it has proved to honourable members on both sides that the House has very little patience with a man who has not the courage of his opinions or the courage to formulate charges, but who whispers them al l around the country in the most poisonous manner possible. If there be anything in the amendment, it rests on the Teesdale Smith contract. My object to-night is not to set up a defence of that contract. In my opinion, with a contract system, there should be open competition, with opportunities for the nation's best contractors to tender; and it is not with a view to in any way qualify the Liberal opinion of what that system is that I rise. As to the charges levelled against the Honorary Minister, we must remember that, after all, any man in the position of a Minister of the Crown is apt to make a slip; and' I regard the present case as showing a mere slip on the part of the honourable gentleman, as a result of the expert advice tendered to him. He was anxious to speed along with the line, and to in crease the facilities for the completion of the work, and, in my judgnient, all that can be said is that, with the best of in tentions, he committed what might besaid to be an error of judgment. Ifc would appear that the Leader of the Opposition spoke before he knew the facts, which have practically only come to light in this Chamber; and I give the right honourable gentleman the credit of believing that had he known the facts as he knows them now he would not have made the charges. The exception that has been taken to the price resolves itself, of course, into an attack on the experts of the Department; for that is not a matter on which we can expect any M in ister to be posted. If a Minister has to be qualified to take out measurements and ascertain the price of every undertaking entered into by the Commonwealth we shall find it very difficult indeed to get men competent for the position. In the present day it is the custom and habit to rely on expert opinion and advice, on which the world to a great extent revolves and operates. One aspect of the matter has, I think, been rather unfortunately referred to. I mean the hint or suggestion that the country is going to pay an extra price for the material removed. The honourable member for Denison last night, mustering to his assistance twenty-five years' experience in contract work",44
205,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The member is misrepresenting me.,45
206,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Perhaps the honourable member will wait u n t i l I have finished the sentence. The honourable member said that he had had twenty-five years' experience!,45
207,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I said I had twenty-one years' experience of work on the railways.,45
208,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Speakin g with that experience, the honourable suggested that, as regards bank, the Government are going to pay for a larger quantity of material than that which was contained in the excavation. I should like to know if there is any human means of ascertaining the measurement of the spoil or material other than its measurement in the bank. Is it humanly possible to put back the spoil into the excavation from which it came? Is it possible to do otherwise than estimate the spoil by the space it takes up in a bank ?  tion.",45
209,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The excavation is measured in order to pay for the material [ll]- 2 taken out, and on the contractor is i m posed the obligation of moving the mater i a l for a chain and a half and formin g it into a bank; and the honourable member for Denison indicates that the Government will he paying, practically, a price and a thir d for the same material.",45

211,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Yes , putting - the spoil on the bank. Is it humanly possible to do otherwise? Has not the contractor to remove every yard of the stuff for which he is paid? Millions of cubic yards cannot be taken out and deposited in a wedge. It is taken out with pick, spade, and scoop; and we know that this class of material expands when exposed. Therefore, I submit that the suggestion of wastefulness goes by the board.  were paying for a tank to be excavated he would not say that.",45
212,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I would pay for what came o u t of the excavation;. and I may tell the honourable member that I have paid for many a tank.  honourable member pay for the spoil, as well as the excavation ?",45
213,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"If I required the material to be placed on a bank 2 or 3 chains distant, I would, as every practical man knows, have to pay for that material so placed. This matter opens up once had more for our consideration the great question of contract versus day labour. Thanks to the new Engineer-in-Chief of Railways, we have recently had a true interpretation of what the day-labour sysmember tem is, as adopted in Queensland. Ih the answer to the Honorary Minister, Mr . Bell saidAs desired by the Minister, I have to advise that the method under which railways have been constructed in Queensland for a number of years has been by a combination of day labour with small contracts, butty-gang, or piece-work. W it h that proposition I find myself in agreementThat is to say, whenever convenient, the work has been given to men who Tmployed others to assist them, parties of m<-< working together, or men working alone. I may say that I am not a slave to either system. The two systems sliould be kept in competition with each other in the Commonwealth, the one as a check upon the other, and each employed where economy and efficiency will best result f r o I candidly admit that were it possible to exercise absolute control over the whole of the men engaged upon big works, day labour, from an economic point of view, would appear to be the better system. Control is the dominant factor in the success of any enterprise, be it public or private.",45
214,Mr ABCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That applies everything.,46
215,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Undoubtedl y control is the dominant factor. There are two aspects of the day-labour system, and it is time that we faced the question very seriously. On the one hand we have to consider the economic, and on the other the political, aspect of this system. hold that we should be ill-advised in allowing a system to be grafted upon Australian life which would permit the nation's employees on large undertakings to determine the conditions upon which they should work. My honourable friends opposite will admit that the union system is at once the frame-work, the legs, and the arms of the movement that returns tbem to Parliament, and I consider it would be dangerous, having regard to the present position of political parties in this country, for the nation to give itself over entirely without any competition to a system that is dependent upon the day labourers of the country. Where it can be proved that day labour can be effectively controlled I am in favour of its adoption when a huge plant need not necessarily be purchased by the Commonwealth. But we have in Australia today millions of pounds' worth of plant which has been got together by those who have organized and have prepared themselves to undertake the nation's contracts. If we were to adopt the day labour system in its entirety we should throw on the scrap-heap those millions of pounds' worth of plant.",46
216,Mr ABCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The contract system scrap-heaps the working man.,46
217,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It does not. Even in the course of the present debate honourable members opposite have had to admit that the private contractor is paying a higher rate than the Government of the Commonwealth were prepared to pay.,46
218,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,He could well afford to do so.  m it . him a present of thousands of pounds!,46
219,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I know that my honourable friends will always reply that the contractor is obtaining from the Commonwealth a sufficient reward for his labour to enable him to pay a higher rate. That argument is certainly open to them, but I do not think that they can secure any change from it so fax as the contract now in question is concerned. At its to completion it will probably be found that the contractor, instead of making the large profits which the Labour party allege, is out of pocket. When we pass over the question of the Teesdale Smith contract we at once take the sting out of the whole censure motion. If the Government should be censured at all it is I in respect of that contract. The remaining material on which the Opposition rely in support of tlieir censure motion is mere flapdoodle,' and but a repetition of the thread-bare subjects which have occupied the attention of this House on three different occasions. This question has certainly produced heat, and some unpleasant things have been said. Like the honourable member for Herbert, I deplore the fact that there is imported into the debates of this House unnecessary heat and a good deal of personal animus. I hope that I shall make no such contribution to the debate. Ib is not my in tention to do so, but if some one comes in my way then the f a u l t will be his own. I feel it my duty to refer at this stage to a statement made by the honourable member for West Sydney, Mr . Hughes. Every one will agree that the honourable member deserves the admiration of this House for the way in which he has, by his ability, come to the fron t from what might be called a back mark in Australian life. But I do tliink that the honourable member, perhaps unwittingly, was very ungenerous in his references to another member of this House. Having tickled the ear of his supporters by an attempt to classify the members of the Liberal party he went on to speak of that section of it which he declared saw the light, but would not follow it . Ab the head of that section he placed the Attorney-General. He then referred to a second section of this party - thos e who, he said, did not see the light, and were incapable of seeing it . My comments have nothing to do with the rank and file of our party. If the honourable member chooses to place me in the second division, well and good. Let me read what he saidAt the head of those who see the light but will not follow it, I place the Attorney-General, and at the head of that class who say that everything is nil right I place the Treasurer. I am perfectly persuaded that if by a wave of the hand we could go back 150,000 years, and interview the cave man on this great question, we should find his views so strikingly analogous to those qf the right honourable the Treasurer that there would be no friction between them. That may be the sort of stuff that brings plaudits to the ear of the honourable member for West Sydney, bufc it certainly brings no credit to him. The Treasurer for a quarter of a century or more has enjoyed recognition and distinction at the hands of the people of Australia to an extent that, perhaps, no other honourable member has done. Indeed, if I may be pardoned for saying so, I think that the right honourable gentleman stands out as being probably the biggest man in Australia by reason of his political and practical achievements, and that it ill becomes oue who has received the admiration of his fellow members to reflect on a. right honourable gentleman who has won recognition, not only at the hands of his own people, but from his Sovereign across the waters.",46
220,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Who is this distinguished person?,47
221,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,It is not the honourable member.  himself.,47
222,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,He really requires no defence. ,47
223,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Jus t to get the tickle oufc of the ears of my honourable friendsI propose now, metaphorically speaking, fco accompany the Minister of External Affairs to the Northern Territory. The honourable gentleman is shortly to place before the House a complete outline of the policy of this party with regard to it . No one, I think, can be particularly proud of what the State of South Australia or either party in the Commonwealth has done in respect of the Northern Territory. In it we have one of Australia's toughest problems, and one which we ought to be able to face entirely free from any party feeling. Thafc tremendous Territory, containing approximately 520,000 square miles of country, has tremendous possibilities. We have looming in front of us a new phase of the stock industry, and if I were in State politics, even in Victoria, today, I would seek to hang my hat on the thir d wing of settlement-that of stock farming. I have unlimifced confidence in the future of stock raising in Australia.  go to the Northern Territory.",47
224,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"TJnde r certain conditions I should be prepared to go fco the Northern Territory. I feel that through the Northern Territory this Parliament can. offer to Australia, in cooperation with the States, a stimulus in regard to stock production that it is quite time was given. At present Australia ranks practically second amongst the nations of the world in the export of their surplus stock, the Argentine leading the way. The States, for the most part, have i i i their closer settlement propositions pinned their f a it h to the wheat growing areas, fruit-growing, and market gardening. The most valuable adjunct to farming in this country today is stock raising.",47
225,Mr SHARPE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Hav e you any suggestion for increasing the number of our stock?,47
226,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I have, and will give it in good time. Australia will have seriously to consider in the near future the question of preventing the export of proved females for a short period, and also of preventing the spaying of stock. We are unable now to cope with the demand upon Australia from abroad.",47
227,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"What would you do with the old, big-framed cow? The best thing to do would he to spay her.",47
228,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I would fatten her off. A cow that has spent a period of usefulness would not be classed amongst the proved females that I mentioned. The present movement seems to be in the direction of an open door for surplus stock for the world's meat and beef supply. As Austi'alia has a tremendous extent of country and a small population, it naturally follows that for many years to come it will be capable of supplying a surplus of stock. The following ' reasons impel me to pay special attention at the present time to the question of stock raising in the Commonwealth: The extent of our country, our climate, the favourable conditions under which stock can be raised and fattened, and our comparative freedom from disease. Those who watch developments abroad with regard to diseases amongst stock, will find that the foot and mouth disease is one of the great outstanding questions, and is shortly to occupy the time of the International Veterinary Congress which is to sit in London. Other advantages are the richness of our pastures and the cheapness of our lands. While we can do a great deal in the Northern Territory, the big broad proposition of stock farming is important to the States as well as the Commonwealth; and if through our National Parliament we can assist to give a stimulus to stock raising, we shall be doing a great deal more service to the community than by haggling over the question of another ""bob"" a day. Australia has emerged from a year during which, for all her great staple exports, such as wool, beef, mutton, and dairy produce, there has been an illimitable and constantly-increasing market. all those commodities that we rely upon for home consumption, such as hay, oats, chaff, and barley, we have no market. A great part of our country, particuport larly in the coastal areas, is capable of producing prolific fodder crops. There is a limited consumption, and we have over-reached it during the present year. At the same time, we have an illimitable market for fat stock, and are unable at present to supply the demand. In fact, the position in this country is such that it becomes very hard for our own people to get supplies at a reasonable price. TJnder these conditions, our object should be so to organize as to take advantage of the huge prices ruling across the waters for our stock, and to consume within our borders, for fattening stock, the hundreds of thousands of tons of produce which today is stored up waiting for a market. This waste produce could thus go to make beef, wool, and butter for export. Instead of doing that, with the residue coming back into Australian soil, the system seems to be to wait until some other part of Australia is stricken with drought. It is a sound economical proposition that this class of produce should be consumed in its year of production. Stock farming should be Mr Rodgers. made a huge movement from one end of Australia to the other. The country should be thoroughly organized from the north to the most extreme south, to take advantage of the beef and mutton raising and fattening in our own country. It is not a right economical condition, when this country is capable of producing millions of tons of produce, that the offal in the country goes to other nations, such as Sweden and Denmark, to produce some of the best dairy produce in the world, while our people pay practically twice the price in Australia for offal. The great question of stock raising should engage the serious attention of honourable members, instead of our haggling so much over the industrial situation.",47
229,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What is your proposition?,48
230,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is ih thorough agreement with that of the Minister of External Affairs. He takes the view that the Northern Territory must first be pioneered by stock breeders, who should For have placed at their disposal means of transport and water.. In my judgment, there is nothing that the land users of Australia require more today than transfacilities, water, and markets, although for beef and mutton illimitable markets offer in every part of the world.",48
231,Mr FALKINER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,What about labour?,48
232,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am glad the honourable member has raised the question. I hope that the development of this industry will mean the opening up of a uew channel for the absorption of Australian labour. If we can open up a profitable outlet for fresh labour we can attract hither more capital and more labour, until our population reaches forty or fifty millions, before we exhaust our possibilities in the way of employment. I trust the House will give a generous support to the proposal which the Minister of External Affairs has to lay before us for the development of the Northern Territory. I propose now to speak on the questions that came before the recent Conference of Premiers, dealing with them, in the order of importance; but, before referring to them, I feel it my duty to compliment the Prime Minister on the step he took in meeting the political leaders of the States, and the generous assistance he gave to permit something like reasonable conclusions being arrived at in connection with very grave issues. I take first the Murray waters question. It has already been mentioned in this debate, and the Prinie Minister himself referred to it. The honourable gentleman showed great courage in his settlement of that question, which has kept several of the States divided for many years. I hope that that settlement will not only lead to the improvement of the navigability of the Murray, but will enable sufficient water to be conserved to largely extend the irrigable areas along its banks, and thus increase settlement. The adoption of a uniform railway gauge is another big question that rightly occupied the attention of the big men who met at the Conference. Their frame of mind was very different from that of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who expressed doubts as to the fruitfulness of the Conference. It will augur badly for the future development of Australia if we take no heed of the opinions of the Premiers of the States on matters of this kind, and there is no co-operation between the Commonwealth and the State Governments. As to the Commonwealth Bank, I have never thrown cold water on that project. Credit is due to those who launched the institution, and my hope is that some day, in the very near future, the bank will be discharging national functions to the great advantage of the Australian people. Up to the present time, it is suffering from constipation; the result of want of succour, and the determinations of the Conference in regard to it were in the nature of giviiu? it bowels, so that motion may follow. With regard to the transference of the State debts to the Commonwealth, this Ministry has not shirked a big ancl thorny question. The Treasurer faced the Treasurers of the States, and I feel that the result will be that ultimately the management and control of the public debt of Australia will be in the hands of the Commonwealth. In regard to the Savings Banks, a sensible arrangement has at last been come to, and an unnecessary competitor for the savings of the people will disappear from the field. The Governments of the States set up institutions for the collection, management, and control of the savings of their people, and those savings were being employed in the development of the States in which they were earned when the Commonwealth Savings Bank came into existence and began to compete for them. The last of the big questions dealt with by the Conference was immigration. That will be an annually-recurring question, demanding the best co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. In my judgment, population is the national want, but to arrange to bring people here from abroad is rather a matter of difficulty, because, with the exception of the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory, the State Governments control all the land. Without generous and hearty co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States immigration will not be a success. It should be the part of the Commonwealth to bring people here, and the part of the States to make ready to receive them. The first duty encumbent on our statesmen is to provide for the employment of our own people, but the resources of Australia are sufficiently great to provide profitable employment for a population many times larger than that we have now. With regard to defence, I might say that from time to time many individual views have been put forward, among them those of the honourable members for Capricornia and Melbourne Ports, whose anti-military speeches were printed on a flaring red leaflet which circulated round the benches of this chamber. Surely if there is one question on which the Australian people have spoken finally it is defence. We have agreed that Australia must provide for her own defence. That was determined at the Imperial Conference of 1909, and the last Government, not only in this country, but abroad, received a. full measure of recognition for what they did in the establishment of the defence system. The time has passed for quarrelling as to who is responsible for that system. Both on the platform and here I have given credit to my opponents for the manner in which they handled the defence question. The last Minister of Defence faced it wholeheartedly, and, as subsequent events seem to show, notwithstanding the opposition of some of his colleagues.  Dosed the defence system, it would not be in existence today.",48
233,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I give the party all credit for its part. The first consideration in regard to defence must be efficiency. Recently there has arisen ai craze for economy. The honourable member for Bourke said the other night that if he had his way there would be no double dissolution, but the test Bills would, be passed to force this Government to face the big question of finance. The defence question is coupled with the nnancial one. Our national income is now ahout £21,000,000, and our defence commitments about £5,500,000, and likely to increase shortly to about £6,000,000. Our opponents declare that the naval and military expenditure of the country sliould be provided by direct taxation.",49
234,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Hear , hear! What does it come from?",50
235,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"What did it come from during the late Government's term of office? So far as direct taxation is concerned, we have at present only one tax, namely, the land tax. That tax, in the year of its greatest productivity, yielded not more than £1,400,000.",50
236,Mr LAIKD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Is the honourable member in favour of that tax?,50
237,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I have already declared my policy. If I had my way, I would allow the States to deal with the question of land taxation- I would abolish the Eederal land tax, but I would put something practical in its place. I would levy on the honourable member who interjected, on the late Prime Minister, the present Prime Minister, the late Minister of Defence, the present Minister of Defence, and on everybody else, for the defence of this Commonwealth. My policy in this connection is quite clear. Their object in imposing this form of direct taxation was to provide all the money that was required for the defence of Australia, but during the last year of the term of office of the Fisher Government the inoney collected from this source totalled only £1,400,000. During the same period our commitments for defence aggregated £5,500,000, and we paid from indirect taxation-throug h the Customs House-practicall y £4,000,000. To my mind, it does not rest with honourable members opposite to suggest that we should be roasted because the Government have not forecasted the way in which the financial position is to be met.",50
238,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,-Would the honourable member increase the taxation on kerosene and tea ?,50
239,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No ; I would put taxation on the honourable member.. I would make every member of this Parliament pay his fair share of the taxation of this Coninlonwealth. Unfortunately, at the present time the Imperial authorities and the Commonwealth appear to be out of line in regard to the question of the defence of the Pacific. I think there is a pressing necessity for an early Imperial Conference with the Dominions in regard to the policing of the Pacific. Since the last Conference was held, aerial craft have become a potent wing in the matter of defence. In my judgnient, aerial defence promises to occupy a foremost place in the warfare between nations in the future. There is one branch of our local Defence Forces which I am inclined to think has been rather overlooked- I refer to the horse and the rifle. The South African war may be said to have been finally settled by the horseman and his rifle. I hope that when the Estimates are presented for our consideration we shall find that generous provision has been made for the voluntary services which are rendered to Australia by its riflemen. These men make an annual sacrifice of at least £15 per head in order that they may be in a condition of preparedness to defend their country. Whilst everybody else seems to be wondering what they can get out of our defence system, these men are interested only in what they can put into it. Twice since I have been a member of this Parliament I have raised the question of horse-breeding for military purposes. Up to the present time we have done nothing in the direction of standardization in connection with the breeding of horses throughout the Commonwealth. The light horse industry is at a low ebb.",50
240,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The honourable member should make a note of the prices that are being realized.,50
241,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"In regard to the class of horses which are required for defence purposes, I say unhesitatingly that we need to introduce new blood. We have done nothing to develop the stamp of horses that is required for remounts, gunnel's, and chargers in this country. It is true that there is an indiscriminate kind of breeding going on, but that breeding is unprofitable, and, to a great extent, the horses produced are unsuitable for defence requirements. Surely it isright that we should do something in the direction of t y p if y in g the class of horses that are needed for defence purposes. stock-raiser throughout the country would then be in a position to raise one, two, three, or nipre horses of the requisite type. I am aware that a Committee was appointed ito investigate this question, and that that body recommended that a breeding farm should be established to raise the class of horses required. Personally, I am not in favour of the adoption of that course. I think that much better results would be achieved if everybody who wished to do so were encouraged to breed, if necessary, even one horse of the right stamp. A standard price should be fixed for their purchase. When we look at the prices that are paid by otlier nations for good sires, we must come to the conclusion that Australia has never yet paid a decent price for a sire. The German and French Governments pay up to £30,000 for a good sire for defence purposes, whereas any decent horse who proves himself in Australia is quickly bought by a foreign country.",50
242,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The honourable member should come to my electorate. show him that he is in error.,51
243,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The price at which light horses can be bought in Australia today is almost less than the cost of the service of the sire. I have practical knowledge of this matter, and it is high time that Parliament did something to raise an industry which is at such a low ebb. The prices ruling for this class of stock today, together with motor traffic, promise almost to utterly destroy the light-horse industry. Consequently, I hope that early steps will be taken in the direction I have indicated.",51
244,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Horse s are dearer now than ever they were.,51
245,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is a sample of the knowledge of my honourable friend. I come now to the storm-centre of Australian life-to the industrial question which honourable members opposite make the study of their lives. I think that this question occupies a pre-eminent position in their minds.,51
246,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Deservedl y so.,51
247,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Deservedl y so; if it be rightly handled. The great deciding questions, so far as the industrial situation is concerned, is the question of unionism, and the question of preference to unionists, a principle which our friends opposite seek to graft upon Australian life. I Each think that the best that could have been said for their case was said by the honourable member for Bendigo. That honourable member, in what we must all admit was a very thoughtful speech, and one of his first addresses in this House, put the case as well as I think it could be put for those who believe in the doctrine of preference to unionists. He said that the result of experience had proved that labour could be best controlled through unions, and, that being so, preference sbould be given to unionists in order to secure the better control of labour. My answer to that is that, if you cannot in duce workers to voluntarily enter unions, and if the majority of the workers of Australia at the present time are not members of unions, they should not be asked to bend the knee to the minority who are. ' If we follow the doctrine laid down by the honourable member for Bendigo to its logical conclusion, we shall find that it involves the subordination of justice to expediency. I will admit that there is a great deal of expediency in I would having men in unions, but if men do not desire to join them, why should we compel them to do so, or offer them a special bait to induce them to do so by laying down the doctrine that, unless they consent to join a union, their chance to secure employment shall be second to that of a member of a union? Each man has a right to his own convictions upon industrial as well as upon other questions. You might as well ask a man to surrender his religious convictions as ask him to surrender his political convictions. Our honourable friends opposite urge that, if a man does not believe in the principle of unionism, he must wait his turn for employment until all unionists have been supplied with employment. To g r a ft this system on to Australian life in conjunction with the day-labour system is to give the entire manipulation-and I use the word "" manipulation "" advisedly-of the industrial situation into the hands of the Political Labour party. The question of the cost of living is closely associated with the industrial question. There are two things in connection with the in dustrial situation which cannot operate at the same time. We cannot simultaneously increase the cost of production and lower the cost of living. Australia has rightly devoted a great deal of time to the i m provement of the conditions of the worker; but if we are to grapple with the question of the cost of living, we shall have to call a halt in one or other of these factors in the situation, and must do something tangible in the direction of reducing the cost of living. It is impossible to i crease wages and reduce the cost of production at the same time.",51
248,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The cost of production is cheaper today than it has ever previously been in the world's history.,52
249,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I do not agree with that statement. On the industrial question, our honourable friends opposite have committed themselves to a degree of Socialism. I have nothing to say against Socialism rightly applied, but I think it is high time that Australia was given a fair, open, and honest declaration as to how far our opponents agree with the doctrines of international Socialism. They should be game to let us know wliere they stand in this matter. I have said before, and I now repeat, that, in my humble judgment, our opponents have never been game to face the question of preference to unionists in their Conferences, and to establish it as a plank in their platform. We look in vain for it in their State or Federal platforms. The late Minister of Home Affairs is the man who practically forced upon the Federal Labour party the acceptance of the doctrine of preference to unionists, and I understand that he had a warm time in the Caucus over it .",52
250,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,We had preference to unionists thirty years ago.,52
251,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Then why do not my honourable friends opposite put it on their platform ? The honourable member for Bourke said the other night that, if they were all of his way of thinking, they would vote against preference to unionists.",52
252,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The honourable member should try to quote the honourable member for Bourke correctly.,52
253,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I now come to the matter of electoral reform. A Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the conduct of the last elections, and to make suggestions for electoral reform. So far, we have not had the report of the Commission; but I regret to say that an honourable, member of this House, and a member of the Royal Commission",52
254,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No w , be fair !",52
255,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"My lionorable friend will get it fairly. I regret that an honourable member of this House, and a member of the Royal Commission,- should have quoted in this chamber from the uncorn - rected proofs of the evidence given before the Commission.",52
256,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The Prime Minister did that.,52
257,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I know all about the Prime Minister.,52
258,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The Prime Minister was responsible for it .,52
259,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I know what the Prime Minister did , and it is for him , and not for me, to explain his action. I think that the report of the Royal Commission sliould have gone through the proper channel. It should have been presented to the Governor General, and every member of this House should have had it in hand before any quotations were made from it . It is an entirely different matter to quote from a newspaper report. On the subject of electoral reform, I think the time has arrived when honourable members on both sides might fairl y take the Democracy into their confidence, and give them the advantage of the principle of preferential voting. Honourable members"" of both parties rideinto this Chamber on that principle, and immediately they get here they discard it . If the principle of preferential voting is good enough for the selection of the candidates of a political party, it is good enough for the Australian Democracy. I declare emphatically that, in my opinion, the pre-selection of candidates under the party system is aprostitution of Democracy.",52
260,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Is that the reason it was adopted for the selection of your candidates for the Senate?,52
261,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"On this question, I do not _ desire to speak as a partisan. Australia was created a Democracy-for what reason? The conception of a Democracy is that there shall exist a condition of affairs under which the people may get a test or a count of heads on any great issue at any particular time. The original plan of those who created the Democracy of Australia, and gave equality of franchise, was that the maj o r it y might guide and direct the destinies of the country. But there has sprung up an acute party system, under which a section segregates itself, and then, by an attempt at democratic manipulation, by a well-trained and well-driven system, blocks and thwarts the community in any - endeavours to get an expression of the opinion of the majority. I hope that the time will not be long delayed when the Australian people will be given the opportunity of getting in the best possible way such an expression of opinion. No system is perfect, and the most effective method of getting the opinion of the Australian people is to be found in the principle of preferential voting. It is said by 'the opponents of this system that it - would make for disintegration in connection with organizations. I think that at the present moment there is an overorganization of political units in the - country. We are too highly organized.",52
262,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Spea k for your own p a r t y ; we are not.,53
263,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I mean that we 'are too highly organized with regard to the acute party system. The honourable member must admit that there are many questions raised by the Liberal party in the House which he would like to see find a place in the statute-book, but he is not .game to vote for the proposals. The reason is that he has delivered himself over body and soul, if I may use the term, to a system. Let us face the matter fair l y and squarely. Erom the opposite side of the chamber the other night we had a speech from one of Australia's most Drilliant men. I refer to the honourable member for West Sydney- a man who has a bit of good mental tissue, who can see things brightly, but who saw fit to - classify this party and refer to us as men who cannot see the light, and so forth . Imagine that brilliant man shackled and nobbled to the doctrine laid down by Mr . - J. 0. Watson, the ex-Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, the ex-leader of the Labour party, and today the most cen-tral figure in the Labour movement! ""Speaking of Labour's representation in - politics, Mr Watson laid down clearly that they did not want politicians, but - delegates. He said, and I remember his - clear wordsA movement that wanted parliamentarians to run it was not worthy of the name. Parliamentarians should not be their patrons. They "" should cease to look round for moneyed men to run for seats if they wanted men to obey their biddings and behests. We should pay every penny of a candidate's expenses, and refuse to allow a candidate to pay a penny. Until we got men to do that we would never get men to do what the Conference desired, and to obey o.ur biddings. Imagine that bright genius, the ex-Attorney-General, in the fetters of such a movement! It is high time that we put an end to this system, and gave Australians an opportunity of serving Australia, and not slavishly serving but one section filtered of the community. There is another matter I feel'it my duty to refer to, and it has been raised here more by taunt than by anything else, and that is the question of the Tariff. My hopes have not been realized in this regard. W it h the wisdom of the appointments to the"" Inter-State Commission I am in accord; with the . delegation to that body of the overhauling of the Tariff and the investigation of the' trade and commerce of the country I am perfectly in accord also. But I was hopeful that by a system of investigating what might be called associate or group interests, the House would long since have been in possession of sufficient material to deal with pressing matters by means of a Tariff. The Inter-State Commission is doing good work. Some of the disclosures Why? being made are valuable. It is well that Australia should be thoroughly posted on the long list of commodities with which the nation deals, with as much dependable and accurate informatio n as it is possible to gain. I recognise that no individual member of this Parliament is sufficiently well posted to be able to say exactly what measure of protection is necessary in order to set up and maintain sound industries.",53
264,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,When do you think the Commission will report?,53
265,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I have already asked here whether the House could do anything in the way of hurrying on the Commission in any direction,.and the answer given to me was that the House was not in a position to move the Commission so far as the T a r i ff was concerned. I regret it . I propose now to conclude my speech, and m y only disappointment is that the three honourable members cannot rise at one time and answer me.",53
266,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Gwydir) [8.50] There is one thing that we have reason to be proud of to-night, and that is that of the members opposite who are supposed to have some responsibility in this country, to owe some obligation to their electorates, and to be able to expound here what they propose to do during this session, one has at last risen in his place to endeavour to espouse the cause of the great Liberal movement. While I do not want to take up much time in dilating on his efforts, I do say that it is rather interesting to find that nearly every subject he took up he dropped as suddenly as he took it up, without leaving any material effect on the members of the House. He told us, first of all, that he intended to deal with the Northern Territory. What did he do? He entered into a discussion .with regard to cattle raising, and what did he say on that topic? He .said that the time had come when we must stop spaying cattle. He does not know that in the Northern Territory spaying is applicable to other females hesides those in the cattle family. should have been thoroughly seized of the fact that he would have to eradicate that inclination in the Territory before he could bring about the cure he proposed. He did not tell us that every available mile of country in the Territory that is capable of raising cattle is already monopolized by the cattle kings and their subordin a tes.",53
267,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Eort y square miles, some of them have,",54
268,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"TJie y measure the country in the Territory by hundreds of miles. When my honourable friend opposite spoke about expanding the great production of cattle and sheep he ought to have been able to show us where the opportunity lies for the expansion, and what is likely to be the result, but he merely satisfied himself by saying that the whole cure is to put a stop to the spaying of female cattle. That is very enlightening, and no doubt will be a tip for the men who are .trying to breed stock.",54
269,Mr FALKINER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Coul d we not stock up Scaddan's leases to start with?,54
270,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am not going to answer any tarradiddles from the honourable member. There was another matter with which the honourable member for Wannon dealt, and that . was the national bank. He welcomed the national bank, he supposed that some day it would be an institution which would"" be of advantage to Australia, but he said it suffered from a malady which I never knew a bank to suffer from before. He described the malady by a common term, which is used in relation to quack medicines, that is, "" constipation,"" brought about by obstruction. If he had recommended a remedy for thatmalady, and advised a course of pink pills, or bile beans, or something of that kind, one would have understood what he was referring to. But that is the kind of thing we get from this budding statesman who comes from a country district of Victoria to teach other people. The honourable member has another wonderful proposal for raising money to defray the expenses of this great Commonwealth. Heis not in favour of this Parliament retaining the power of land taxation. He would hand back the whole of that power to the States, and then he would put a tax on me and Ministers and ex-MinistersHe of this Parliament. Any intelligent person who knows how much those men have left to pay taxes with will understand how far the inoney so raised would go towards making good the deficiency which the present Government will have at the end of the financial year. Those honourable members do not possess between them as much as the Government gave away to Teesdale Smith as a present to show how thorough they are in their policy of kill ing day labour and introducing the contract system. Was there ever such an impotent effort made to discuss a great vital question of finance?",54
271,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Hav e you not enough brains to understand that I spoke of income tax?,54
272,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is always the habit of a man who has lost the power of concentration of thought to imagine that the other fellow is minus brains, and, consequently, the honourable member is trying to make out that the fault is with me, and not with him. Another matter to which the honourable member referred was preference to unionists, and he is wrath at the attitude of the Labour party in advocating that principle. The honourable member says that if this preference continues, Australia will be ruined; in other words, the policy upon which, for the last half century or. more, the great - organizations of labour bave built themselves up will, unless it is obviated or avoided, ruin tie country. My honourable friend did not refer, to the butchers; he - did not remind us that when there Avere two or three butchers who had independence enough to say they would give the people the meat they were hungering for, immediately they attempted to open their doors they were told by the master butchers, "" No . These people will have to starve, but you must do our bidding."" Never has a trade union done so much harm as the master butchers did, in order to show their domination over the minor suppliers in that trade. But honourable members, blind to the infirmities on their own side, are for ever casting reflections on trade unions and the Labour party. As an honourable member interjects, the master butchers worked, as we had an illustration of them working the other day when the scales of a master butcher were found to be l £ ounces out of balance in half a pound. That is the way they work points; they work a spring balance in order to get an extra penny out of every pound of meat they sell. If that is what the honourable member refers to, he may well say that the master butchers worked. The master butchers in Sydney went to work to assist themselves to greater profits. They bled the people to an alarming extent, and the meat they sold was more likely to produce indigestion than any meat sold in this countiy eitlier before or since. The honourable member for ""Wannon recommends a reduction in prices to bring about reduced - cost of living- a reduction of wages, he necessarily recommends.",54
273,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No , I did not.",55
274,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Ah ! Here is an - admission from a farmers' representative. I say the honourable member argued in order to lower the cost of living, it would be necessaiy to reduce the cost commodities ancl the wages paid to the producers, and he says, "" No, I did not."" So he is not prepared to reduce the wages of the man on the land, but he is pared to reduce the price of his comcorum, modity. And this is a representative of a farming district in Victoria! This an honourable member who knows so much that he is prepared to teach every on this side something about political - economy; yet he tells the producers to question. decrease the value of their product, but to continue increasing the rate of wages. Let me tell my honourable friend in all sincerity that the countries where wages are highest, and necessarily the prices for produce are highest, are the most prosperous countries in the world today. And they will ever be so, because there is a bigger margin left for the worker and a bigger margin for the producer. When I hear my honourable friend and the member for Riverina talking about what they are going to do with regard to restricting the increase of wages to the rural worker, I tell them that the best men they have had in this countiy are the men who have put wages up throughout all industries, because, as wages have gone up, so, in greater proportion, have the values of the stock and produce of the man on the land been raised. Those honourable members ought to go down on their knees to the organizers of labour for the work they have done to raise wages, and for the benefits that the producer enjoys they ought to bless the Labour movement. I have nothing further to say about my juvenile friend, the honourable member for Wannon. He will learn better by-and-by. A few more lessons like he is getting in this Parliament to-night will broaden his knowledge, ancl enable him to come to cominon-sense conclusions on questions of importance, before he attempts to lecture men who have been in this House for many years. I wish now to just deal casually with other speeches delivered by members on the Government side, and I desire, first, to refer to the honourable member for Riverina. There are men whom one feels it is necessary to call attention to.",55

276,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The parting in the of honourable member's hair is something like his policy-it is invisible. The honourable member thought it worth his while the other day to stand on the floor of the preHouse and lecture members about deabout the manner of conducting business, the waste of time, and the necesi3 sity for avoiding repetition in political speeches. Yet we never get anything but man repetition from the honourable member every time he speaks on any material Every time the honourable member rises is an occasion for repeating gates than dummies. what his family have done, how they got their wealth, and how they fatten sheep. "" I pay £11,500 in land tax,"" he says, which, if it means means that the honourable member has conLiberal trol of land worth half-a-million A man who, every time he placards us as to what his family are ing, as to the price they get for their sheep, and as to what wealth they are making, has no room to talk about repepassage tition on the part of other honourable members. The same remark applies the honourable member for Parkes, who makes it his business to come into the cliamber and sit awhile, waiting his portunity, and then, when the opportunity arises, get up and repeat over and over restore again those nauseous doctrines of his anent the policy and history of the Labour forward to their credit. party. He never makes a speech withtalk out using the same language every time, and without dealing out the same arguwho, ments every time, lecturing the Labour party, and saying that he, above all men, is able to define their policy and tell them century. the straight course to take. But last night I was rather surprised to hear the honourable member deviate a little. times even an honourable member opposite canuot resist telling the truth. So he compelled by his convictions to do for us party. what we are trying to do, that is, to prove that there has never been a bigger set bunglers of public affairs in than the men with whom he is associated can, dare not. on the Ministerial benches. But the honourable member, after telling us that his tors thought so. party had bungled public affairs; they had made inroads into the Liberal policy; that they had broken one of the Opposition ? tenets of the Liberal faith which is to call for tenders for public works, still sits the Government side; and, though ing all that they have done to the injury of the people of Australia, he humbly tells been in the House. us that he has to follow the bidding of Liberal Caucus.

We can see this by the loving way in which the honourable member for Parkes referred to the Treasurer, and by the destructive criticism he applied to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. Honourable members can see without spectacles the tendency of the mind that was at once trying to allay the popularity of one section of his party and to raise the popularity of another.

We heard the honourable member for Parkes yesterday talk about "" v u l g a r abuse,"" but that sanctified, supercilious, superior person is always talking about and some one else's deficiencies. He hapbe pened to be "" born with a silver spoon in The his mouth,"" or God knows what he would was have been today! As it is, he has not this made much advantage of the "" silver spoon""; and, consequently, he has little justice on his side when he looks down on those who have struggled from the ruck and tried to make use of their opportunities for the benefit of their country. However, let me give the honourable member for Wannon a few phrases used by his great leader, the present Prime Minister. The first I have here is, "" Y o u are an excellent judge of d i r t !

"" The Attorney-General evidently thinks that the people of Victoria have forgotten the coercion law he placed on the statute book of Victoria. That was worse than any coercion law passed by any civilized community in Christendom-worsee than any that has been passed even in the despotic country of Russia. This is the man to whom we are asked to trust the destinies of this great country-to trust the liberties of the people and the prospects and prosperity of the nation. In view of the Attorney-General's history, would the Opposition be justified in remaining silent? Would it be justified in uttering no protest or in failing to tear the mask from his face, so that the people may see that, instead of being the man he represents himself to be, he is in reality a coercionist who will never he able to wipe out the record that he made when Premier of Victoria. This great man has set himself up to tell us upon what questions we shall be sent to the country. We are to go before our masters, the electors, and to take their verdict-o n what? On a couple of cowardly and makeshift Bills which are really characteristic of the man. Remembering his experience of days gone Then by, the Attorney-General is too big a cur to bring down some tangible, effective measure of reform. He wants to secure power, and he hopes to come back with a majority of his party in this House as well as in the Senate, not to pass the Postal Restoration Bill , and that hollow mockery, the Government Preference Abolition Bill , but to put the political thumb-screw on the people, and to bring complimen- them to their knees as he did the people of this State some years ago. The honi n orable gentleman tells us that he is going to reintroduce tliese two Bills. The Government are not prepared to go on with the Electoral Bill which they originally introduced. They desire rather to obtain the verdict of the people under false pretences. A r e they ready to go on with the Electoral Bill under which they sought to undermine the secrecy of the ballot, and to take away at one fell swoop the liberties that we now enjoy? If the Attorney-General has the courage to put that measure on his electioneering platform, well and good. But is he prepared matter to do so ? Is he nrenared to tell the people straight out what he and his party want to do, and not what they pretend that they desire to do ? Is he prepared to say, "" We desire to rob the people of ; the secrecy of the ballot; to abolish Saturday as a polling day; to make every elector sign his name on the back of his ballot-paper, so that he may be marked out for penalties and punishments by the men for whom they have to work to obtain a living? "" The honourable gentleman by that Bill would have brought the men and women of this country under the ban of their employers. ""Under it employers would have been able to learn how every man and woman voted, and knowing that, to do that which was done in Australia in days gone by. Even with manhood suffrage a station-owner was able at one time to discover bow his hands voted, and although, perhaps, only a few voted against the principles favoured by him, the whole lot were sacked to make sure that no guilty one escaped. That has been done time and again, and the penalty has been paid by those who have fought for the principles of Labour. It is this that the Ministerial party wish to do today. The cloven hoof shows itself under the garb of their vaunted purity.

303,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Wonderful !,59
304,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The honourable member for Flinders began his address by referring to the famous contract which has been so largely under the limelight during this debate. He talked about the spreading of poison, and endeavoured to show that the Labour party, by their statements in regard to the contract for a section of the transcontinental railway, were trying to poison the minds of the people against the Liberal party. He declared that we had no justification for speaking of a side-door entrance to the Department. Nor were we justified* according to him, in referring to a secret conference between the Minister and his officers and the contractor. The Liberal party came into power to p u r if y politics; but they have not been able to place at our door any charge calculated to bring a blush to the faces of our supporters. of the type of honourable members opposite find themselves in a corner their only defence is to say, "" You're another."" [12] That is the attitude they have taken up during this debate, and they have sought so to escape from the nightmare of their own maladministration. The honourable member, for Flinders referred* to the question of the Teesdale Smith contract for only a few moments, and then dropped it . He dropped it more quickly than he is prepared to drop the Marconi retainer. He says that he does not know whether that retainer has been renewed, but that if it has been he is going to stick to it . He is prepared to stick to a retainer from a large company which has litigation with the Commonwealth, although as Attorney General he should be the chief law adviser and guide of the National Parliament, and ready to give the best of his intellect in defence of the interests of the Commonwealth. But what does he dothis man who talks about the blemishes on our party? He refuses to give up his retainer from the Marconi Company, and to do the work attaching to the onerous and responsible office now filled by him . Instead of giving up his retainer he sticks to it , and hands over the defence of Commonwealth interests in the Marconi litigation to an honourable colleague on whose shoulders the work should not be placed. He does not hesitate to do so, although he would refuse to appear with that honourable gentleman in the Courts of this country. The honourable member for Angas, who is now acting for the Attorney-General, so fa r as the Marconi litigation is concerned, is good enough to have transferred to him the duties which the Attorney-General himself should discharge in this respect, but he is not good enough to appear with the Attorney-General for a plaintiff or defendant in the Courts of Australia. The Attorney-General has just entered the chamber. It is not my fault that he has been absent. Ministers are not here often enough. The Attorney-General, I repeat, dropped this question of the Teesdale Smith contract like a hotpotato. Subtlety is one of his chief characteristics. Doubtless it carries h im ' through with his Court work, because the subtlety of the lawyer is like the subtlety of the devil. Not desiring that this strong-smelling contract shall be further discussed, he adroitly turns the discussion When men into another channel, and indulges in a bit of special pleading in respect of something that he is not prepared to explain. He told the people that the Labour party appealed to the electors on the last occasion by means of the referenda to give this Parliament power to protect the community under the wonderful and economic changes that are now.taking place. We are not today in the position in which our friends who framed the Constitution found themselves. days there were no trusts in existence; there was no great octopus getting its tentacles round the avenues of production and distribution. Since these economic changes have come about, since the whole face of industrialism changed, since the phases of production have been varied by the introduction of machinery, and the means of distribution have been improved by the organization of both land and sea carriage, the whole situation has been revolutionized. we to remain whero we were, or are we to advance with the necessities of the times ? Are we to say that the laws that were good before these great changes took place are good enough today ? The man who takes up that attitude is not true to his obligations as a Federal and does not understand his responsibilities to the people. We of the Labour party saw the necessity for increasing the powers of the Commonwealth so as to be able to protect, not only the producers, but the consumers, from the machinations of these gigantic trusts and combines, and we proposed to introduce laws to do so. The Attorney-General admitted the other night that he agreed with us on the main principles of our proposals in this direction. He seeks now to get away from that admission by a purely legal quibble, * which is only worthy of a man who has been brought up in a Law Court. says he could not vote for the principle that he believed in because it was not put in the language with which he would have chosen to clothe it! That is the type of men we have to deal with on the other side who say they believe in the referenda. He tells the people, Hansard, that, although he believes in the regulation of trusts and combines, the extension of the Federal power over trade and commerce, and the restriction of the powers of corporations, regarding all these as necessary for the well-being of the country, he could not vote with the Labour party because he was afraid they would not be able to administer those increased powers in a proper or intelligent way. Fancy a man believing in a prinMr Webster. ciple of that kind and refusing to give effect to his convictions because of the party that happened, for the time being, industrial to be the sponsor for those great reforms I That is the Attorney-General who isafraid to face the music to-night. He slinks away from this chamber when he In those is under discussion as only a man ashamed of his position would do. He goes to these wonderful hen conventions, the meetings of the Women's National and great other Leagues, and prates about what the Labour party are doing and not doing, has to try to mislead the electors regarding our attitude towards trusts and combines, and the referenda generally. In his high, cold, calculating-and , I would_ almost say, blood-curdling manner-h e puts these things before the people, and then, when Are he is called upon to defend himself here, he is not in this chamber to do it . He gets away because he is ashamed of his past, and, I believe, even more ashamed of his present. We should expect from the Prime Minister, at any rate, some definite pronouncement of policy when he legislator, rises to speak on a question of this character; but, during the 1 hour 35 minutes that he took to address the House, practically all he could say was, "" You slanderer; you slanderer; you slanderer!"" That was all that we could get from the man who is supposed to be the leading citizen of this great Commonwealth. Here is a gentleman who tries to defend himself against the charge of having only a few months ago in this House slandered the electors. It was stated in this House and in the press, without any reservation, that at the last election the people of Australia acted corruptly, and the inference He was that the Labour party was to be blamed for that. If was alleged that double voting was common, that thousands of votes were cast that should not have been cast, and that one person had voted nineteen times. But when an inquiry was forced on the party opposite, through and they were asked for the proofs of their statements, it was found that there was not an atom of truth in their slanders. The reports of the scrutineers show that if there had been any personation it was not the Labour party, but men associated with the party opposite, who were responsible. I looked through the returns for my electorate, and I found that in places where Labour had no scrutineer to protect its interests, and the polling booths were sufficiently close together for a man to go from one to another, double voting- I do not say personation - too k place. The Labour party could not be held responsible for that; the responsibility must lie with the party opposite aud their associates. Before we had adult suffrage and the secret ballot, the pages of history were stained with the records of the misdeeds of the party to which the honourable member for Flinders belongs. I refer to the malpractice at tions. Before the Labour party .came into existence, members of the Liberal party, the predecessors of the honourable member and his associates, were charged with wholesale personation, and committed to the gaols of the country for the offence. No one personates merely for fun, because personation renders an offender liable not merely to a fine, but to a term of imprisonment. An intelligent Labourite would not personate merely to give 'a candidate a vote, risking his liberty for no personal profit. Those who can bring about personation, if there is any, are the men with money to buy personation, the men who can make it worthwhile to personate, paying for the risk that is taken. The Labour party have no money for that kind of thing; the other side is the only party which can supply ammunition for that work. Yet the members of the party opposite, the Attorney-General among them, had the temerity, a few months ago, to heap abuse on the heads of the innocent electors of this country, charging them with corrupt conduct at the election. No greater slander was ever uttered about any people. One might have thought that when it had been proved, by the report of the scrutineers and by the report of the Select Committee of the Senate, that these statements were a lie and a slander, those responsible for them would apologize to the people whom they had insulted. They had not the manliness to do the right thing, and they stand condemned in the eyes of all self-respecting men. The Prime Minister had something to say about the Teesdale Smith contract. The matter has been, fairly well discussed, and I not say much about it. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs might have been expected to show that he had exercised the care and vigilance required of a responsible Minister, who proposes to change the policy of the country, and is intrusted with the spending of public money. But I never heard a more humiliating and abject speech than his, either in this or other Legislative Chambers. The Minister craved for mercy and for sympathy. What sympathy can you extend to a man who says that his reputation is dear to him, and tries to clear himself from the charges hurled against him by sheltering behind his officers, who cannot appear here to defend electhemselves? A Minister who does that plays a coward's part.",59
305,Colonel RYRIE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Assistant Minister said several times, I take the full T< responsibility.""",61
306,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He made that remark once or twice, but only that it should appear in print. Honourable members opposite always talk with two voices. The honourable member for Flinders rarely makes a speech which has not saving clauses, either at the beginning or at the end. Although he is credited with conciseness and definiteness, his speeches, read coolly, are found never to contain a definite announcement. All through his speech the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs said, ""Why do you blame me? Blame the officer whom you appointed."" The officer to whom he referred is the man who was in charge of the first survey of the route. He was appointed by a previous Government, and left as a legacy to the Labour Government. He exclaimed, "" Why did you allow this man to remain on the scene to tempt me and make me fall, so that I would be humiliated by accepting his advice? What could I do but act on the advice of my officer ? '' Now, there might be some excuse for the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs accepting the advice of his officer in regard to a matter of departmental routine, but there was absolutely no justification for him .sheltering himself behind that officer when dealing with a matter of public policy. Yet that is what the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs did. Let me come to the key of this shall question by inquiring: Who is to blame for what has happened? Who opened the door to it? Obviously the Minister who changed the policy which had been pursued from one of day labour to one of contract. If the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs had not departed from the policy of this country-in obedience to his masters, the Employers Union, who find the money with which his party fight at the general elections-this position could not have arisen. Had no contract been entered into, there could have been no mistake as to its terms. No matter how he may appeal for mercy, he is the Minister who reversed the policy that had hitherto been followed, and, therefore, he alone is responsible. Fancy the action of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs being defended by the Attorney-General! I would like to hear that honourable gentleman in a Court if he held a brief for the otlier side. I would like to see the brand of mercy that he would extend to little Willie. Would he have dealt with his action as gingerly and as tenderly as he did yesterdays Not he. He woiild have had little Willie in hobbles or in irons before one could say "" Jack Robinson."" Yet, in this House, he is prepared to uphold the conduct of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs in letting this contract under which the Commonwealth is being robbed-deliberately - plundered-of least £30,000. I say that under this contract the Government are making a present of £30,000 to a member of a privileged class. Had a Labour Government entered into a contract under which my honourable friends thought that a Labour supporter would net. the sum of £10,000, they would have set this House on fire with their denunciations, and there would not have heen enough black type in the newspaper offices to have broadcasted the news throughout Australia. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, without testing the character of the country which this section of the line will traverse, let a contract without tender at 7s. lOd. a yard for work which has been done by day labour on the same railway at from 2s. to 4s. per cubic yard. I repeat that rock cutting on this railway has been done by day labour for 4s. per cubic yard. When I say that I am referring to solid rock, and not to so-called "" silicate of sandstone,"" which is the description of the formation of this country which was given to the Minister by one of his officers. Now there is no such thing as silicate of sandstone. Silicate is sand, so that obviously there can be no silicate of sandstone. Any man who knows the ABC of geology knows that such a thing could exist only in the fevered mind of an over-worked officer Mr Webster. of the Commonwealth Service. It was perfectly within the power of the Minister to ascertain what had been the cost of excavating material from these cuttings by day labour. Earth cuttings, such as will have to be dealt with on this particular section of the line, have been done, and done well, by day labour at from Is. l i d . to 2s. 4d. per cubic yard. Yet the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, without inviting any tenders, accepted an offer by Mr Teesdale Smith, under which that gentleman is to be paid 4s. 6d. per cubic yard for removing the soft earth one and a half chains from the cuttings, and an additional 2 s. 6d. per cubic yard for depositing the material in an embankment which he must have formed under any circumstances, because he could not possibly have blown the material away. Not only is Mr Smith receiving a fabulous price for his. work, but the Government are actually paying him on the measurement of the material at deposited in the embankment, and not on the measurement of the excavation in the cuttings.",61
307,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I was not clear on that point before. I understand, however, that what the honourable member says is correct.",62
308,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"A yard of earth, when removed from a cutting, will measure one and a third yards in the loose state, whereas a yard of rock taken from a cutting will measure one and a half yards in the loose state. In their anxiety to "" down "" the day-labour system, which has done so much for the Commonwealth, the Government have landed themselves in the most smellful contract that has ever been entered into in this country. The Attorney-General tried to burk the question by dealing with some ancient matter which he dealt with before the last referenda. He talked by-andlarge upon matters which he was not able to define, and which he dared not give to the House, instead of dealing with this question, probably because he felt it was too strong for him to stand too near for too long a time. Let me show honourable members how the affairs of this Commonwealth are being run by the man behind whom the Honorary Minister has tried to shelter himself. I wish to show what his calculations in the past have been worth. In the early days of the history of this railway, lie estimated that the cost of rails and fastenings for 1,063 miles of this railway at Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta would amount to £1,012,000. The actual cost, at contract prices, is £1,431,523, or nearly £500,000 more than the estimate of this able and reliable officer upon whom the Honorary Minister depended. Dealing now with the cost of sleepers and ballast for the same mileage, the contracts already made for sleepers amount to £1,466,321. Mr Deane's estimate of the cost, vide his report of 20th September, 1 9 l i , was £1,038,000-show ing a difference of £428,321 beyond his estimate of the cost. If we take the cost of plate laying for 1,063 mile3, we shall find that Mr Deane's estimate of the costin his report of the 20th September, 1911, was £153,000, whilst the cost on Mr Deane's specification and schedule would amount to £526,986. He was out in .this estimate only to the extent of £373,986. It is marvellous how the Commonwealth has continued to exist at all under such men as this.' The cost of rolling-stock already purchased and to be purchased, as' per Mr Deane's information supplied to the Minister, is £441,436, and Mr Deane's estimate of the cost on the 20th September, 1911, was £315,000showing a difference of £126,436. Now, if we take the whole thing, we shall find that the total cost of rails and fastenings, sleepers and ballast, plate laying and rolling-stock, amount to £3,866,266; whilst Mr Deane's estimate on the 20th September, 1911, of the total cost was £2,518,000. It will be seen from these figures that this highly intelligent and experienced officer, who was discarded by one of the States because he was considered to be no longer up-to-date, stepped into this great spending Department, and submitted an estimate for this line, which will be exceeded by £1,348,266. This officer made an estimate of the cost of the railway, in order that it might be submitted to Parliament to induce, honourable members to vote for its construction. On his estimate, Parliament based its judgment and gave its vote, and yet we find, from the facts already before us, that the actual cost of the railway on present figures will be £1,348,266 more than the estimate of the cost made by the man who was in charge of the survey of the line, and who should have been able to calculate more nearly what the cost would amount to.",62
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Is the honourable member preparing estimates now?,63
310,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No ; I am trying to show the Prime Minister how blind he has been during the arrangement of these tenders and contracts. I am trying to shed a little light on the dark places of the administration of the Department over which he presides. I am trying to put the case before the people of this country in a way which they will understand. The excuse of the Honorary M in ister for the Teesdale Smith contract was that there were no other tenderers. B ut what do we find today? The Minister has had to produce a document, when it was demanded by honourable members on this side, who are the watchdogs of the people, ever on the alert for these smellf u l bones of the maladministration of the party opposite that are left lying about. When these watchdogs bark, Ministers run to the files of their Departments and unearth further information regarding these very questionable matters. I would ask the friends of the workers in this House what is the position? There was another contractor who approached the Minister on the 24th January, 1914, Thirteen days before the Government consulted with Mr Teesdale Smith personally, Mr Timms had already written to them that he had the necessary plant, in dicating the plant he had, close at hand, and his willingness to come into competition with any one else for the construction of this work which the Government were prepared to hand over to contractors to be done at nearly double the amount it had been shown to cost under day labour in sections of the line already completed. This is the Government that was go*ing to purify politics.",63
311,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,And to have no preference.,63
312,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Yes. ; and to have no preference. We heard the honourable member for Flinders dilating on the question of preference to unionists the other night. To listen to the honourable gentleman, one would suppose that no man, however good a tradesman he may be, has a right to claim protection for the sacrifices he has made to bring about the prosperity of his own industry. One would have thought that it was a crime for a man to claim preference such as the Attorney-General gets in his profession every day in his life. It is right for the members of the high legal profession, but not for the industrial workers of the country. When the honourable gentleman talks of preference to unionists, let the people look at this contract. Preference to contractors is the policy of the party on the other side. Preference to contractors is more of a religion to them than preference to unionists amongst the mass of the people. Their preference is for the benef it of the individual monopolist and money-grubber of the community. Did the Attorney-General, and the other members of the Government, give preference to Mr Teesdale Smith? Did they t u rn down the offer of Mr Timms which was made thirteen days before Mr . Teesdale Smith appeared on the scene? Why did not that offer come before the public ? Why was it not brought before the Minister ? Why did the Minister have no more discretion than to accept, blindfold, what was offered by a man whom he had a right to suspect ?",63
313,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Because he has no business capacity.,64
314,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"""Busines s capacity"" ! Heavens alive! Would any man in this country hand over the destinies of a great spending Department to a man who, in addition to his natural infirmities-for which I do not blame him, because no man should be blamed for what he is not responsible for-ha s never had any contact with business, who has never had any reason to fight out his way to an understanding of matters? A man who would think of doing that in a private capacity would be f it for a lunatic asylum, and nowhere else. Yet the Prime Minister handed over this great spending Departmentto an incubating politician.",64
315,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He is a rubber stamp, pure and simple.",64
316,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He is not even that, because he wants to rub out the stamp.",64
317,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"He is a blotting-pad, then.",64
318,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Mr Timms, a conto tractor, was will i ng to do the work. The Prime Minister knows that Mr Timms was approached for material and plant by Mr Teesdale Smith. Honourable members opposite talk to the Labour party about their management of the affairs this country, but they should look well do. at their own misdeeds up to now before they attempt to charge other persons with misdeeds. There is another matter which I wish to refer briefly, and that is the survey of this railway. Does the Minister know that there has been a contract for a considerable sum let. recently to private surveyors without competition ? Does he know that some surveyors have been put on to survey this line, although it was supposed to have been surveyed in the first place, at rates which were not open to competition, and which have never been divulged to the country? Does he know that nearly £17,000 has been paid to these men in the past?",64
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Are you aware that the previous Government let the contract for the survey of the north-south line right through to Lawrence and Chalmers, without having any check on them whatever?",64
320,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I am not aware of what they did.,64
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I am g i v in g . y ou information.,64
322,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Eve n if the honourable member does, that does not justif y the recent contract let for a re-survey.",64
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I am only pointing out that you have a very glass house.,64
324,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"A peculiar position about the re-survey is that even when the firm have re-surveyed the line they have been paid without the work being tested by those who authorized the payment, and the payment, too, had to be re-adjusted by officers of the Department.",64
325,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"They have not all been paid yet, I think.",64
326,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,They are paid.,64
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Every time we have followed in your tracks we have gone wrong.,64
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"You paid £2,000 for them doing nothing.",64
329,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is not a b it of use for Ministers to cackle in the way they do about what we did. They have answer for what they have done. At the last general election they had a chance to tell the electors what we did ; and, by Heavens, they did not forget to tell them, when no one was listening who could conof tradict them, as to something we did not",64
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,No !,64
331,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"That is absolutely a to fact, and is well known to the honourable member. Wben we look at this contract, we find that the only protection the Government had was in their power to impose a penalty on the contractor. What was the penalty? It was £5 a day. So that, if the contractor was three months behind with the work, he would have to pay a penalty of £390;' and if six months behind, a penalty of £780.",64
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"And £1,000 in addition.",65
333,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"No . The solicitors maintain that that could not be recovered. Already the Government have given the contractor an excuse to avoid the penalty. Is it not a fact that in the first agreement the Government undertook to give Mr Teesdale Smith a contract for 100,000 yards, not at one end only, but at the two ends, making a total of 200,000 yards?",65
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,No .,65
335,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is a fact, and, further, I tell the honourable member that 100,000 yards at each end is clearly stated in the contract. After they had given the contract for 200,000 yards, what happened? The Assistant Minister smelt a rat, as I told him the other day, and immediately, although he had sent over a paper to Mr Teesdale Smith to get his signature, so as to secure the man, who was in a hurry, and the Government were in a bigger hurry to tie up the thing, he wired to Captain Saunders to get the paper if he could, and not to show Mr. Smith a certain paper which was referred to in the message. Here is the telegramReferring to my wire 25th inst., instructing you to present Teesdale Smith's contract papers for liis signature, please bring the document with you to Melbourne. Leave by first available train. Do not show at present document to Smith. The reply of Captain Saunders readsYour telegram, I handed one copy agreement Smith, but have secured possession of same. Hence the Assistant Minister cut down the work to one-half because, before Mr. Teesdale Smith signed the document, Captain Saunders got hold of it and brought it back to the Minister. When the Minister realized the type of man he was dealing with, he cut down the contract to 100,000 yards at one end only. That is how it came about that the document, as signed by Mr Smith, was not signed on the 9th February, but was signed on the 18th April, after the work was commenced. It was signed after the Minister sent the telegram to Captain Saunders. How did Captain Saunders get the document ? Did he explain on his arrival here how he got back the document he gave to Mr Teesdale Smith to sign? The Minister ordered the officer to bring it back here by the first train, but he did not tell us how the officer got back the document which he had parted with to Mr Smith. I would not like to imply that he stole it, or to impute that he got Mr Smith to hand it over to him docilely and in a kindly way, because I know that Mr. Smith would not part with a document of this kind unless his name was on it. Then, how did Captain Saunders get back the paper? If Mr Smith would not part with the document without signing it , and the other man got it back before it was signed, I ask honourable members to use their own judgment as to how he did get it back. In order to escape the penalty of their misdeeds, the Government had to instruct the officer to do something different from that which they had instructed him to do in the first place. They desired to save their face with regard to the contract, which they realized would leave.them with a burden that they would be unable to carry to the people of this country. No transaction in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament has been so indelibly marked with incapacity, with ignorance, and with a want of knowledge of business affairs as has this contract, entered into hy the Liberal party. They will never get the penalty, because there are cuttings, and the Commonwealth Government have to make the waterways. Before they can make the waterways the contractor will be unable to proceed with the embankments, and, there being more than one culvert between the different embankments, he will claim that the whole thing has been voided by the Commonwealth not putting in the necessary waterways. Such is the case that stands to the credit of this purifying Ministry who declared that they would restore constitutional government.",65
336,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The honourable mem- ber's time has expired.,65
337,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"Brisbane) [10.26]. - I wish to refer briefly in the first place to two paragraphs in His Excellency's Speech, in which reference is made to impending retirement of our present vernor-General. I am sure every orable member in this House, I believe, every citizen of Australia, will reciprocate the remarks made Excellency, and re-echo the regrets he - expresses in regard to his departure Australia. My main reason for referring - to this is the publicity that has been igiven to, and the comments made upon, the remarks I uttered, in regard to His Excellency's resignation, at a meeting Ballarat, on the 18th March. I was then referring to the persistent statements had been made in reference to Lord man's retirement, and I protested against the use that had been made of His cellency's name, and the attempt to nore his discretion in the matter of ing a dissolution of Parliament. I as an illustration the method that been adopted in regard to yourself, sir. Honourable members will remember that I protested vigorously at the time against the use that the Government were making of the Speaker. The Prime Minister other members of the Government were glad going about the country and saying what the Speaker would do in given circiunDenman stances. The same thing happened in gard to His Excellency the Governorlast General, and, as I considered those statethe ments a gratuitous piece of advice to Excellency, if not an insult to his tion, I protested against them. I was fortified in my protest by remarks which appeared in certain newspapers. Rumours lowing paragraph:were current that His Excellency's retirement was not altogether due to the from reasons assigned. The Darling Downs Gazette of 27th January, 1914, in anvote nouncing His Excellency's retirement, used these wordsA Governor General was wanted who would be able to deal with the situation less pered by previous Ministerial associations. The Toowoomba Chronicle, of the same date- a journal which is owned by Mr Groom, the Minister of Trade Customs-publishe d the following rebut marks after a paragraph announcing His Excellency's resignation:Baron Denman was appointed Governorwhat .General in 1011. He has been principally markable for his sporting proclivities. tralians admire "" a sport,"" but it is not sufficient qualification for so responsible The British Government should select more perienced statesmen as Governors. Mr Finlayson. the I am sorry that the Minister of Trade Goand Customs is not here to either acknowhonledge or disclaim that comment, which as well as, appeared in his paper.",65
338,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Mr Groom does not by His own the Darling Downs Gazette.,66
339,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The last quotafrom tion is from the Toowoomba Chronicle. The Darling Downs Gazette was even more insulting, because it suggested that His Excellency was ""hampered by previous Ministerial associations."" I refer to at this matter to-night, because my attention has been directed to a report of a that banquet tendered to His Excellency in DenSydney, when His Excellency referred to the persistent rumours in regard to his Exresignation. I was delighted to seeigand I take this opportunity of expressing grantmy personal pleasure-that he then said used his relations with both Mr Cook and had Mr Fisher had been of the most happy character, and there was no justification for the rumours that were in circulation. My principal object in mentioning this matter was to justify my own remarks and on the public platform, and I am very that it is because of no difficulty with his Ministers that the resignation of Lord has been brought about. Neverretheless, I hope' that we have heard the of these remarks in regard to what Speaker will do and what the GoverHis nor-General will do. There is still an posiecho of them, for there appeared in the Argus of the 17th April, in the course of a reference to the present debate, the folThere is no possibility of any defection the Liberal ranks, so that in a full House the amendment will be defeated by the casting of the Speaker (Mr Elliot Johnson}. I think that for your own protection, sir, it is about time that action was taken to prevent the press, Ministers, or private hammembers saying what your actions will be. Mr EJNG O'MALLET - Nobod y takes largely any notice of the Argus. and - Mr FINLAYSON - That may be so, members have said the same thing, and they have no right to defame the Governor General or the Speaker by saying either will or will not do. The rere-mainder of the Speech, with the excepAustion of the last paragraph-whic h is pera haps one of the most important, because a post.it commends the Government to Divine exguidance, of which they are said to be much, in need, as we all are-is principally remarkable for its barrenness. In looking through the Speech I have been struck as much by its sins of omission as by its sins of commission. The statement of Liberal policy put before us at the opening of the last Parliament contained twenty items, and during that Parliament certain measures were brought in , but in this latest Speech a very comfortable way is found of neglecting the previous Ministerial statement of policy, ancl also of omitting all reference to the work of last session, with one exception. I have a' record of the work done last session, and it shows that there were two Appropriation Bills, five Supply Bills, and four' Supplementary Appropriation passed. The balance of the work done was largely formal. There were a few other measures carried, namely, the Norfolk Island Bill , the Pine Creek-Oodnadatta Railway Bill , and the'Excise T a r i ff (Sugar) Bill , which was merely to remedy an omission on the part of the Minister. In no other respect, was the work of last session at all commendable, and it is rendered worse, in comparison with previous records of Parliament, by the fact that so many important Bills which were brought up were eitlier dropped suddenly, or disappeared, or were allowed to lapse. Fbr instance, there was the A u d it Bill , of which so much was said and so much expected. The Treasurer seemed to attach particular importance to that measure, but it was laid aside after a certain amount of work had been done. could have got it through without any trouble.",66
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The Senate not pass it . Mr FINLAYSON"" - Why did the Government lay the Bill down simply because the Senate did not pass it? were looking for,trouble with the Senate, as they are now, and this was an oppor*tunity which they neglected to take. The Bill was lost because the Senate refused to r at if y .a clause, which I said then, and I say now, was quite out of place in that measure. The Australian Notes B i ll was also dropped. The Committee of Public Accounts Bill , a ' most important measure, calculated to be of considerable advantage to the country, was almost ignominiously left to look after itself in its passage through the Senate. ' Two [13] other Bills were badly treated. One was the - Bureau of Agriculture Bill . We assisted the Government to get this measure through this House, but it lapsed after reaching the second-reading stage in the Senate, yet it was introduced by men who posed as being anxious to help the farmers and conserve their interests. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill was in troduced by the Treasurer, but after the second-reading stage the Treasurer took fright , and the measure was allowed to lapse. Why have not the Government made some reference to these measures in the Governor-GeneraFs Speech ? They are quite ignored. The Speech seems to have been built up and dictated by the PreBills miers' Conference recently held in Melbourne. Note the hopeful tone of it , and how it is all in the f u t u r e : - "" P a r l i a ment should be given an early opportunity of considering the best means of expediting the despatch of urgent public business."" "" It is intended to make a f u r ther effort to pass ' certain Bill s ' in the short session now commencing."" ""The report of the Conference of Premiers . . will be submitted."" "" It is expected that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at "" regarding the question of the transfer of State debts. We are further told that, in respect to certain measures, action is to be taken "" at an early date "" to give effect to the agreements arrived at at the Premiers' Conference; that arrangements are to be made with the State Governments with regard They to the Commonwealth Bank; and that the question of the uniform railway gauge is to be referred to the Inter-State Commission. In regard to financing the raildid way gauge question Ministers are "" c o n fident '' that something can be done. In regard to co-operation in respect to immigration tliey ' ' hope ' ' to place a proposal They before us. In regard to the financial issues of the Commonwealth it is intended "" later in the y e a r "" to do something. In regard to the Tariff Ministers "" look forward with great hope."" And so on. This Governor General's Speech is particularly hopeful, and may be classed as an optimistic speech. All it proposes is something in the dim and distant future - as already said well during the course of this debate, not now, but later on it may be possible to do something. One wonders what reason exists for the present session. During the last two months or so we have been accustomed to hear all sorts of wild statements in regard to witnessed. the summoning of the House. We have been told that certain things must done. We have been advised from many platforms that it was absolutely necessary that the House should meet. The Prime Minister said at Cowra that the Governtheir ment could not stay on with any sense of dignity under present conditions, that they had held their own in the last sion, but it had been a pure battle wits, and only by the straining of the Standing Orders and such like methods .be sought. were they able to hold on at all. Sandringham the Prime Minister said I dare say we could keep on as we did session, but there is no honour, no usefulness,in a position such as that. The Attorney-General, on the February, in Melbourne, at the Lord Mayor's quarterly luncheon, saidHe for one would not enter upon another session with the parties in the state they were in at present. When the Government last year adopted the practice of applying the have chosen. closure, and the unusual expedient of shelving motions of censure, it was with the knowledge several that the position could not remain as it was, vernment are and that there must be a dissolution. When Councillor Gardiner interjected, "" Does that mean a double dissolution? the Attorney-General replied, "" Yes , certo tainly it does; the Government must rule or go out of office."" The honourable ber for Lilley, speaking to his constituents at Gympie, saidThe Federal Parliament would meet on the l'Stb April for the express purpose of causing a double dissolution. The Government Whip, speaking at M u r - ment. willumbah on the 7th February, saidThe Cook Government, when it took office, did so with the deliberate intention of appealing ing to the country, aud tliey had made their minds to create a double dissolution, which would come this year, but when he could not say. So this Parliament has been summoned for a special purpose, and yet the Prime Minister closed his speech by saying that an election? there would be no election until the rolls were ready. AH sorts of wild statements have been made with regard-to what was to be done. People in the country were invited to keep themselves quite ready the tragical events that were to happen after the opening of this Parliament. We were promised the clash of arms, and such a critical series of divisions as the Mr Finlayson. Federal Parliament had never previously We were induced to expect something more than usually exciting. be But our hopes have been doomed to disappointment. W it h the exception of the censure amendment found necessary and the attack on the .Government because of maladministration, the session has opened serenely and calmly. There has been comparatively little trouble, and we seshave had a most hopeful and optimistic of Governor General's Speech without any hint or suggestion that a dissolution is to Nothing but quiet prevails. At Evidently the Government still intend to strain the Standing Orders u n t i l the time last comes-no t now, but later on-whe n a dissolution will be brought about to suit themselves. They are quite right, but I am disappointed that after the Govern10th ment should have all the time been in viting the country to witness the spectacle they seem determined that it shall be arranged to suit themselves only in the presence of the spectators they themselves There need be no hesitation in repeating the statement made here times, that if the Goanxious for a trial of strength let them bring forward some proposition worth fighting about, "" - somethin g that would be an inducement the electors to devote their active in - % telligence-and the Opposition are will meming to accommodate them.

361,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I did not say the Minister did.,69
362,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Then why did the honourable member quote it?,69
363,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Because it fortified me in my impression in regard to the retirement of the Governor General.,69
364,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"But the honourable member spoke of my "" accepting or disclaiming"" it .",69
365,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Did the Minister of Trade and Customs feel it his duty to contradict the paragraph in the paper?,69

375,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I did not say it did.,70
376,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I have publicly expressed very different views.,70
377,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I hope the M in ister of Trade and Customs wil l not leave the chamber for a moment, because I have two matters to which I particularly desire to direct his attention. what the Prime Minister said in the final paragraph of his speech last ThursdayWitli a clean roll and effective electoral machinery, let us consult the people in all those matters, and ask them to give one side or the other a do finite mandate to do the people's will. We have a right to ask this, and the people have a right to give it to us.",70
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,That is quotation the honourable member made.,70
379,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,The Prime M in ister said there would be no election until the rolls are ready.,70
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Where does honourable member find that?,70
381,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The words used were, "" W it h a clean r o l l . """,70
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Yes .,70
383,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"What do those wordsmean ? As I said before, the note I took when the Prime Minister was speaking was, "" No election until the rolls are cleansed."" .",70
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"That is not in my speech, nor anything like it .",70
385,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,I Hansard.,70

389,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,Is the Prime Minister's copy different from mine? very remarkable if last year we should have two different copies of the and this year two different copies of Hansard.,70

Mr FINLAYSON - I will go back a little, and ask the Prime Minister if he has not made his position worse. He said last ThursdayI desire to see, at the earliest possible moment, an effective programme of electoral reform put through, so that we may get the definite opinion of the people, once and for all, on those matters on which we are not getting it today. Surely that means an election?",70

393,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"I am willing to admit that I am not so clever in the use of language, aud in the altering of my statements, as the Prime Minister is; but we can draw our own conclusion, namely, not the that the Prime Minister, in the closing part of his speech, expressed a desire for an early appeal to the electors, but declared that a clean roll and effective machinery should precede that appeal. The the insinuation, taking the lionorable gentleman's own language and argument, is that the rolls are now unclean.",70
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"It is not an insinuation, but a direct statement; and I say, here and now, that the rolls are dirty.",70
395,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,A man who makes that statement either does not know the facts or misrepresents them.,70

398,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA I,"The position has been explained by the electoral officers in such a satisfactory manner that I decline It is to take up time by repeating what Mr .
