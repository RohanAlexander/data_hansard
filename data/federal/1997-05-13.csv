0,NA,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"NA FIRST SESSION OF THE THIRTY-EIGHTH PARLIAMENT The House of Representatives, on 27 March Tuesday, 13 May 1997 at 2 p.m. Pursuant to on Tuesday, 13 May at 2 p.m. Tuesday, 13 May 1997",13
1,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA",13
2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I inform the House that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) will be absent from question time due to budget commitments and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) will answer questions on his behalf. MARONEY, Ms SUSIE",13
3,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence could I, at the commencement of this session, extend on behalf of the parliament and all of the people of Australia our very profound and sincere congratulations to Susie Maroney for her absolutely remarkable feat in being the first person to swim the Straits of Florida from Cuba to the United States. I sent a message to her this morning. I know the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) will share in full the congratulations that I convey. She finished the swim in 24 hours 31 minutes. The approximate distance of the swim was 145 kilometres. She has been swimming for up to six hours a day. It is a NA Hansard 1997 (FOURTH PERIOD) 1997, pursuant to resolution, adjourned to that resolution the House of Representatives met truly remarkable performance and a wonderful demonstration of the true Australian spirit.",13
4,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, also on indulgence, it was a delightful sight to see Susie Maroney make landfall this morning. She set herself additional tasks. Apparently she did not need to swim the last 10 kilometres in order to get the record, but she had the sort of spirit that kept her going. I am sure that all of the nation shares the enjoyment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this parliament. NA Labor Preferences",13
5,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would be aware that today I foIIowed up earlier statements by the national secretary of the Labor Party that Labor preferences at the next election would not be distributed to the One Nation party ahead of those for Liberal and National Party candidates. Will the Prime Minister now join with me and give the same undertaking with respect to the ALP on behalf of the coalition parties?,13
6,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. BHP: Newcastle,13
7,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in light of BHP's decision to end integrated steel making at its Newcastle steelworks at the end of 1999, resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs throughout Newcastle and the entire Hunter region, what response is the federal government considering to provide support and added assistance to the people of the Hunter? Prime Minister, as well, what considered response is the federal government contemplating for the people of the Hunter that provides real long term gains on the employment and investment fronts for the Hunter region and not just short-term bandaid solutions?",13
8,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Paterson, who of course represents in the parliament a significant part of the Hunter area and who, incidentally, was not afforded the courtesy of an invitation to the meeting addressed by the shadow minister for industry in Newcastle last week. He was not accorded the courtesy of an invitation. Mr Crean-He went!",14
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will come to that in a moment. The failure of the organisers of that meeting to pay the courtesy of inviting the local member, the member for Paterson, or Newcastle based Senator John Tierney to that meeting just demonstrates what an empty political exercise it really was. Can I say to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley that along with, I am sure, all other Australians the government deeply regrets that BHP will close its steel operations at Newcastle. I want to say to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley that we do not intend to abandon them. I have noticed over the last week, since announcement was made, this hypocritical posturing by the Labor Party. It reached its zenith when the member for Hotham, the spokesman on industry, had this to say-just listen to this: Had Labor still been in government, what was announced two weeks ago would not have happened. That is the greatest piece of nonsense! Mr Crean-That is right.",14
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not right. You know as well as I do that for a long time BHP had been considering winding down its steel operations in Newcastle, and you are being openly dishonest to the people of the Hunter Valley in pretending otherwise. It is typical of the opportunist stance that you take on industry policy. Of course, it passes very strange that the member for Hotham should make that statement, because the Premier of New South Wales had this to say on 29 April, the day after BHP made its announcement: It's got to be said that this is being done predominantly because of BHP's assessment of global factors. The member for Hotham knows that and the Leader of the Opposition knows that, yet they parade themselves around the country pretending that, if some alternative approach had perhaps been in vogue, then the outcome would have been different. Mr Kelvin Thomson-That's exactly right.",14
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You interject, 'That's exactly right.' The Leader of the Opposition quoted the national secretary of the Labor Party a moment ago. On 18 October last year the national secretary of the Labor Party made an extremely interesting speech. It was addressed to the South Australian conference of the Australian Labor Party. He had this to say-and I want all members to listen to this, particularly those who represent electorates in the Hunter Valley and particularly people who live in the Newcastle area who might be duped into believing that the member for Hotham has some new, alternative, better plan for looking after their future. The member for Hotham has been for 20 this years part of the problem that caused the Newcastle BHP plant to close down. You were part of the problem when you ran the trade union movement and you were a major part of the problem when you were a member of the Keating and Hawke ministries. So you are the last bloke who can come into this House and pretend that you have a solution. This is what Gary Gray had to say, and it really is worth listening to. This is very interesting. He said: As the logic of globalisation and competitionlisten to thisAs the logic of globalisation and competitionspoken like a true economic rationalistcomes to determine whether Western Mining, or BHP, or General Motors or Penfolds Wine put their money into South Australia, or Argentina or Indonesia ... No talk there about the Labor Party's alternative industry policy. No suggestion that if Labor were in office they would have such an attractive industry policy. The reality of the situation is that the forces that led to the closure of the BHP plant have been in the system for a very long time. Any attempt by the member for Hotham to blame the present government is completely dishonest and completely contemptible. But can I say to the member for Paterson that I had a meeting last week with the Premier of New South Wales regarding a proposal that he has put forward which would involve a contribution by the federal government, a contribution by the state government and also a contribution by BHP. Let me say in relation to that that the federal government has decided to commit some resources towards programs to deal with the particular problems that have arisen. We are not attracted to the proposal put by the New South Wales government. The proposal put by the New South Wales government is short term, it is gimmicky and it will not provide any long-term relief. What I intend to do is to be part of a joint committee with the New South Wales government to examine the alternatives. There is a period of two years before the major impact of the retrenchments will come into effect. I want to say to the people of the Hunter Valley that the resources that we commit will be equal to those promised by the New South Wales government, but we will do it in a way that is more effective. We are not going to embrace a knee-jerk solution. We also believe that BHP has a very significant respons-bility. BHP-although warning governments of both persuasions, as those on the front-bench well know, that steel making was not going to continue indefinitely at Newcastle-failed to give adequate notice of the particular date of the closure. Despite all the lofty rhetoric and all the gimmicks that are coming from those who sit opposite, they were part of the problem that caused the BHP closure. They were part of the problem for 20 years. Any attempt to try to shift it to us is absolute humbug and it will not wash with the battlers of Newcastle. BHP: Newcastle",14
12,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is thoroughly aware we confronted this problem and dealt with it and got the union movement there to agree to changes.,15
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.,15
14,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Prime Minister recall telling Neil Mitchell on 30 April last, 'Well, everybody has known for a long time that the very long-term future of steel making in Newcastle was, at the very least, under a cloud'? Prime Minister, since you knew for such a long time that the jobs of thousands of workers in Newcastle were under threat, what steps did you take to raise with BHP the future of their Newcastle operation and what action did the government take at that time to attempt to secure a continued steel making presence in Newcastle?",15
15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is that both sides of politics have known for years that steel making at BHP would not continue indefinitely, and don't you try to shift the blame. Small Business: Unfair Dismissals",15
16,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Earlier this year the government introduced the landmark workplace relations act to free up the industrial relations system. In addition, the Prime Minister's small business statement in March of this year contained a provision to ease the unfair dismissal laws. Could the Prime Minister inform the House whether all small business in Australia, including in my electorate of Griffith, will enjoy the benefits of these important reforms?",15
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer is that, in relation to people under federal awards, as a result of a decision that has been taken by the Labor Party today-and if that decision, as is likely, is supported by the Australian Democrats and by Senator Harradine-we are going to see more jobs destroyed than will be lost in Newcastle in two-years time. There is all this talk about Newcastle. Your decision to block that unfair dismissal proposal will cost thousands of jobs in small business. If you disagree with me, you ought to remember the criticism of the Premier of New South Wales, who at least speaks from the authority of elected office, of the unfair dismissal laws. What we proposed was a measure whereby any small business employing fewer than 15 people would be completely exempted the unfair dismissal laws in relation to people who had been employed for less than 12 months. What this did was to introduce a very effective level of flexibility, a very valuable on to say: incentive for small business to take on more staff. I want to say to those who sit opposite that this is the most anti-jobs decision you have taken in the 13 months you have in opposition. You stand up in this parliament and you talk about Newcastle. You stand up in this parliament and talk about job creation schemes. But you have an opportunity to support a measure that is going to create thousands of jobs in the small business sector and what do you do? You roll it over and you say no. But it is very instructive what the reaction to the federal government's announcement was. Let me share with the House the reaction of people to the announcement made by the federal government. This is what Mr Rob of Bastion of the Council of Small Business Organisations had to say on 24 March: The small business exemption from the unfair dismissal laws is obviously the jewel in the crown. That is the one that will actually create jobs and I am certain of it. In other words, you have the spokesman small business saying that our proposal would create jobs. Then, interestingly, the shadow minister for small business, the member for Cunningham, came along on 5 March. This is what he had to say, and it is very, very interesting: I suspect that there is a lot of political heat that might be generated against us should we take a negative view on this particular issue. Stephen, you were dead right. You were absolutely, 10 out of 10, 100 per cent right. Mr Martin-Is that right?",15
18,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. You were right on that. They should have listened to you. Didn't you have a very eloquent argument? - id Martin roll you, did he? I am sure he did, because he was there as the proxy for Jennie George. On 24 March, Jennie George saidlisten to the self-confidence of the born puppeteer: I am assuming that the Labor Party will do the right thing by the union movement, but not the from right thing by the unemployed. Of course the Labor Party will always do the right thing by the union movement, but never the right thing by the unemployed. She went I am assuming that the Labor Party will do the right thing and do what we are doing-opposing the extension of these unfair dismissal exemptions. been Really! She then went on to say: A Labor Party senator was heard to be endorsing it. Can I just make it very, very clear that the government will persevere with this particular decision. If it is voted down in the Senate, let every small business in Australia know, let every unemployed young person know, t-at the Australian Labor Party, the AustralIan Democrats and any Independent senator that supports the disallowance motion will be opposing job opportunities for young Australians. They will be voting against the interests small business. They will be voting to keep in place a measure that every observer of small business regards as anathema to the employment prospects of young Australians. Let it be understood that, in the very first question time of this new sitting, the great blow that the Labor Party has struck today in for favour of reducing unemployment is to undermine the capacity of small business to take on staff and to destroy the job prospects of thousands of young Australians. Yet they have the gall to lecture us about the loss of jobs at Newcastle. They are humbugs writ large. NA",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Before calling the Leader of the Opposition, I advise members that we have in the gallery this afternoon a former distinguished member and distinguished minister in this place, the Hon. Frank Crean. It is a delight to see you, sir. Welcome back. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA BHP: Newcastle",16
20,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I thought the unfair dismissal laws moved by them were perfection.",17
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.,17
22,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware that our briefings on Newcastle, when we were in office, included the fact that the HBI plant being established in Port Hedland in Western Australia was to supply in its second phase product to keep Newcastle in operation and that at the last enterprise bargaining arrangements, as far as we were aware, Newcastle was on offer for two new electric arc furnaces to ensure that it maintained the productivity rates that the work force had achieved for it? Does the Prime Minister recall telling Ray Martin on 30 April last: I am very sorry for the people of Newcastle. I to go to that city soon. I will go to Newcastle myself. It is, at this stage, all I can do. Prime Minister, why didn't you keep your promise to go to Newcastle to see first-hand the damage your inaction has caused? Is it because, like your industry minister, you had better things to do? Can you look the workers and families of Newcastle in the eye and tell them the truth, that your government is unable to deliver them hope or job security?",17
23,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The pathetic attempt of the Leader of the Opposition to get back into the unemployment argument falls to the ground against the background. If you are interested in reducing unemployment, you ought to support our unfair dismissal proposal. You have avery, very simple opportunity, but you will not take advantage of it. You can talk for as long as you like about Newcastle. You can carry on and profess your concern about Newcastle for as long as you like. Let me say to the people of Newcastle that the proposals that we will have will be realistic proposals. We do not promise a capacity to reverse the decision that has been taken by BHP any more than, if you had been in government, you would have acted any differently. You know from your own experience and it really demeans whatever residual respect the Leader of the Opposition may have in the Australian business community to pretend that, if you had still been in government, anything substantially different would have happened. You know it would not, and all of the Australian people know that nothing substantially different would have happened. It is a phoney exercise in falsely inflating the hopes and the expectations of the people of Newcastle to pretend otherwise. I will be visiting the people of Newcastle. When I go there, I will not be engaging in empty rhetoric. I will not be engaging in political point scoring against my opponent. I will be willing to talk to the union leadership. I will be willing to talk to the commercial and civic leaders. I will have some intelligent, pragmatic offers of assistance, not windy rhetoric built on political humbug. Small Business: Unfair Dismissals",17
24,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed hope to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister inform the House of the effect of the Queensland state government's decision to introduce changes to the unfair dismissal provisions mirroring the partial exemption for small business proposed by the federal government? How will small business in Townsville and throughout Queensland be affected by these changes? What will be the benefits of these changes? And will these changes lead to the arbitrary sacking of junior employees?,17
25,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the last part of the question, the answer is no. To the general question, the fact of the matter is that this measure is pro jobs. This is going to say to people who are employing people in Queensland that the government is going to put in place a system which is fair both to small business and to employees. The end result of that is a pro jobs growth policy for Queensland. I publicly compliment and applaud the initiative of the Queensland government with the support of the Independent, Liz Cunningham, in Queensland to ensure that this is the law in respect of unfair dismissals in Queensland. I also take the opportunity to commend publicly the initiative of the South Australian government which, likewise, is taking up the proposition initiated by the Prime Minister to introduce the same exemption in respect of small business. I compliment particularly Dean Brown and the Premier, John Olsen, for taking this up on behalf of small business. The effect in those two states alone provides a significant benefit to businesses which together employ something like 520,000 Australians. Unfortunately, the Labor Party have announced today that they are not prepared to support this measure. I must say, I am absolutely amazed. Let's remember the potted history of the unfair dismissal law. Before the 1996 election, Keating said that industrial relations would be the big issue for Labor during the 1996 election. As a result of the very strong opposition and concern in the small business community about unfair dismissal, Keating had to announce a review of Labor's unfair dismissal policy during the 1996 election campaign. In 1996, we introduced a remedial set of reforms to the unfair dismissal law. You opposed the sensible measures to clean up the mess that you had created and now, when we introduce a sensible measure, against the political advice of your own spokesperson for small business, you have today announced this policy. We already have exemptions in the unfair dismissal law. Even in the faulty, deficient, hopeless scheme that Labor had, they had exemptions for certain categories of employees. The idea of exemptions is nothing new. What we are proposing is consistent with the international standard. We are not alone on this. There are Germany, the UK, Italy-you name it. Many others with similar standards to us who also adopt international standards have exactly this exemption. In the overall, the changes that we have made in respect of unfair dismissal have been a tremendous boost already to small business. We have seen in the federal jurisdiction the introduction of a filing fee, we have a cost jurisdiction against vexatious applicants and we have seen across the board a 56 per cent drop in federal applications. All of that is a much better deal for small business. I say to the opposition: you will politically regret this decision. We do not intend to let up on this issue. If you do proceed with your intentions to disallow this regulation in the Senate, we will give favourable consideration to introducing legislation into this House. We are not going to let this issue go. The fact of the matter is that this is a fair deal for both employers and employees. We are doing this because, unlike you, we are interested in genuine measures that are going to help in the creation of jobs in this country and we are not going to let you forget it. Unemployment",17
26,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the government's unfair dismissal laws have been in practise for some months, are you aware that the ABS figures released today show 246,400 people on the long-term unemployment queue? This month saw the biggest single one-month jump in long-term unemployment since your government was elected. Regional ABS data shows 16,800 additional people in regional Australia joined the unemployment queues last month. Jobs and job security are Australia's No. 1 concern. What is the government doing to get the long-term unemployed back to work?",18
27,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a couple of comments to make in answer to the member for Batman. The first comment I have to make is that there is absolutely no connection between the figures that you referred to and the unfair dismissal proposals that came in-no connection at all. I will tell the member for Batman this: there is going to be a big connection between the long-term unemployed figure in a year's time and the decision you took this morning. That will be the connection. What you decided this morning was to condemn thousands more young Australians, in particular, to the unemployment scrap heap. When push comes to shove, you always do what Jennie says. In the same way, when you were running the ACTU and you ramped up unemployment to over 11 per cent, the biggest level since the Great Depression, it was your policies and your union movement as much as anything else that led to those policies. Of course, they were presided over by the minister who now sits at the front table as the Leader of the Opposition. One of the most outrageous propositions in Australian politics is the proposition that says, 'We were in power for 13 years and we left you with 81/2 per cent unemployment. You've been in power for 13 months. Why on earth haven't you fixed it in 13 months?' If you carefully listen tonight to the budget to be delivered by the Treasurer, a budget that will save and build for Australia's future, you will recognise that at long last there are a group of people in charge of the affairs of the economy of Australia who will lay the foundations for reduced unemployment over time. Airports: Long-term Leases",18
28,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Would the minister inform the House about the successful conclusion of the sale of long term leases for the operation of Melbourne, Perth and, most importantly the airport in my own electorate of Lilley, Brisbane? Minister, what are the benefits of the sale for Australian taxpayers and for the stakeholders in the airport?",19
29,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lilley for her question. I am pleased to inform the House today of the highly successful entering into contracts for the sale of the long-term leases for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports. The process was highly competitive and rigorous and the new operators will prove to be committed, innovative and capable. The total achieved from the three airports was $3.3 billion. Brisbane Airport Corporation Ltd paid $1.387 billion for the lease of Brisbane airport; Australian Pacific Airports Corporation paid $1.307 billion for the lease of Melbourne airport; and Airstralia Development Group paid $643 million for the lease of Perth airport. The government is pleased with these sale proceeds. Of course, I can assure the House that the benefit for the Australian taxpayer is that this government will not fund current expenditure with those proceeds; the proceeds will be used to retire debt. I also want to point out that the sale price, whilst it was a very important factor in the bid evaluation, was not the only criteria. Nonprice criteria included management capacity, financial strength, commitment to infrastructure development and certainty and clarity of bid. I note an interjection to comment on the comments of the Victorian Premier in respect of this sale. I noted with interest that, a week prior to the third bidder being announced, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, went on Melbourne radio and indicated that he had some concerns about the process. He indicated that he felt that there was a gross abuse of the system. It would appear that he was expressing concerns allegedly made by one of the unsuccessful consortia, the Macquarie Bank. I invited him to give me any evidence of where there was any breakdown in the process. I have not received any, and I do not expect to. After the process was completed, I received a letter from the Macquarie Bank which stated that the bank had absolute faith in the integrity of the process. I can further say that, at the end of all this, like all asset sales, the Australian National Audit Office will undertake scrutiny of the process. I have not the slightest doubt that it will come through in the most outstanding fashion. Further, I can say that the government will now proceed to sell the remaining FAC airports, with the exception of Sydney. The sale of the first phase-Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth-will take place on 1 July. BHP: Newcastle",19
30,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. In light of the Prime Minister's earlier answer about how long BHP's decision to close the Newcastle steelworks had been known, when precisely did BHP first inform you or your office of their planned announcement to close the steelworks at Newcastle, and when did you tell the Prime Minister of that decision?",19
31,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We now seem to be going into a series of other stunts. In fact, I was informed by BHP at 5 p.m. on the Monday preceding the announcement. Migration",20
32,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Has the minister seen claims that more than half the Australian population will be Asian within the next 50 years? Are these projections correct? Is it true that New Zealand is being used as a backdoor method of migration to Australia by large numbers of Asian-born people?,20
33,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In responding to this question, I would firstly like to make one thing very clear to the House, that is, this government is committed to an immigration program that is non-discriminatory in tenns of race, religion, ethnicity and country of origin. That policy is in no way negotiable. The claims on Asian population are just plain wrong and are obviously being propagated for reasons based on needlessly creating anxiety within the Australian community. The facts, from census and arrival and departure statistics, are that today 4.8 per of our population was born in Asia. Based upon the current migration patterns and natural population growth over the next 30 years, the Asian-born population will be around 7.5 per cent. Mr O'Keefe interjecting",20
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Burke!,20
35,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have been saying it for months. Mr O'Keefe-Why wouldn't the PM say it?,20
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Burke!,20
37,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1995-96,16,234 New Zealand citizens settled in Australia, and only 6.4 per cent, or 1,038, were Asian born. I think it can be seen from this that this clearly would not constitute in any way a swamping of Australia by Asians or a major change in Australia's population in demographic terms. For any migrant group to comprise more than 50 per cent of Australia's population in the next 40 years, we would need a huge migration program to achieve that outcome. I am advised by my department that, to achieve anything like the 53.6 per cent figure that has been suggested, Australia would need a migration program averaging many hundreds of thousands a year and one which was almost totally from one particular source, namely, Asia. Given the government is committed to a modest and non-discriminatory program, these scenarios are just fantasy. If we are going to have a debate on Australia's immigration program, it should be based upon fact and not unsubstantiated and un sourced guesswork. The information is readily available, and there is no excuse for anyone to be peddling myths. Every member of parliament was sent a copy of the publication Population flows, produced by my department. If they require any other information to debate these questions on the basis of information that is readily available, they need only to ask me. Let me say it again: every member received a copy of this publication. I personally addressed them to each member. The governcent ment has already implemented measures to restore public confidence in the immigration program. We will continue to ensure that we have a balanced program and one which brings benefits to Australia. Ministerial Code of Conduct",20
38,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his code of conduct, which states: Ministers should ensure that their conduct is defensible and should consult the Prime Minister when in doubt about the propriety of any course of action. Prime Minister, given your stated position on gambling and the unanimous public view that the industry minister's decision to snub the people of Newcastle-whilst sipping French champagne-was not defensible, did the minister consult you before he attended the casino opening and have you reprimanded him? If not, why not?",20
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham will remove that newspaper.,20
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Reith, you can be so lucky. Let me say this: my viewsMr Martin-You didn't go.",21
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I didn't go. I certainly didn't. My views on the fact that gambling in Australia has reached saturation point are very well known and, whenever I am invited to do so, I repeat my view. But, unlike some other political parties in this country, the Liberal Party of Australia is not an authoritarian outfit. We do not have a Prime Minister and a leader who goes around and keeps a little black book of personal conduct. My ministers do not need my permission to go to a casino, they do not need my permission to go onto a racetrack and they do not need my permission to do other things. Some of them quite like going on a racetrack, some of them might like going to the casino, some of them might like going to the football and many of them like all brands of football-they enjoy doing it. This is a ridiculous question. The member for Ryan, the minister for industry, will no doubt have an opportunity to make a contribution to the matter of public importance. But let me say that the Liberal Party's way is not to run a party whereby the members of the ministry need the permission and the say-so of the Prime Minister before they can go to a casino, a club, a racecourse or, indeed, any other respectable organisation.",21
42,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, over the last few days we have all been reading the alarming reports about the New South Wales government budget decision to implement a bed tax, commencing on 1 September. I ask the minister: what impact will the New South Wales government's bed tax have on the Australian tourism industry, what sectors does it affect and are there any exemptions?",21
43,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is another example of the Labor Party taxing a progressive industry, one of the best employers in Australia. Indeed, the new 10 per cent bed tax is a body blow to tourism and compares with the 1989 pilots strike. It is a blatant revenue raiser which discriminates against the tourism industry and, in particular, the accommodation sector. The taxation will have an overall effect of destroying jobs, destroying investment and affecting overall potential for tourist visitors for the Olympic year. The Carr government have not just targeted the wealthy tourists and businessmen who stay in five-star hotels; they have also targeted the ordiEary Australians who stay in two-star and three-star hotels, holiday units and private guesthouses. Let us not be fooled by the accusations of the government. They have not excluded guesthouses, they have not excluded the backpacker hotels and they have not excluded the high yield short-stay cruises. What they have done is to jeopardise the fastest growing industry in Australia and the best providers of jobs for young Australians. What they have done is to place at risk future investment in this industry. Just to demonstrate this, I quote from the ASX's tourism and leisure price index, which has dropped over 80 points since the 10 per cent bed tax came in. The New South Wales government will raise approximately $64 million by this action. It will be applied to consolidated revenue and to reducing their debt structure, not to promoting the tourist industry, which it should be doing. As a consequence of that lack of promotion for tourism in New South Wales and the extra tax which has been placed on it, the government should recant and reverse its position. Bed Tax BHP: Newcastle",21
44,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not a fact that you, as recently reported by Alan Woods, ducked a cabinet meeting in 1982 when you could have used that meeting to argue for and vote for a package to help secure the future of the Australian steel industry? Is it not also a fact that, when Labor came to office in 1983, it saved Newcastle and that, under Labor, BHP-as recently as 1995-had committed to keeping Newcastle steel making going and investing in new arc furnaces. Isn't your lack of leadership the reason they have changed their mind now? When will you come out of 15 years of hiding from the workers of Newcastle and actually develop a steel plan with commitment to them?",21
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can I say in reply to the member for Hotham that I have never ducked a cabinet meeting in my life. Mr Crean-Oh!,22
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham! Mr Crean-So you were there? How did you vote?,22
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham!,22
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I didn't in 1982 and I will not be ducking any cabinet meetings over the next 10 or 15 years either. Can I just make that very clear. I enjoy cabinet meetings immensely, and I am looking forward to years of cabinet meetings stretching into the future, as the coalition government which I am very proud to lead deals increasingly with the difficult problems that face the Australian community. But let us return to the alleged concern of the member for Hotham-and that is the people of Newcastle-and also, interestingly enough, this claim that the closure was something that was not within the general knowledge of either the government or the opposition before the announcement was made. It is very interesting that he should say that, because on 25 March 1997-that is less than three months ago-the member for Newcastle, Mr Allan Morris, asked me this question: My question is to the Prime Minister. Has his attention been drawn, firstly, to the remarks of Prescott of BHP concerning the 'unviability' of the Newcastle steelworksthese were public remarks made by Mr Prescottthreatening over 2Y2 thousand jobs ... The point I simply make is that any suggest.ion that the possibility of the closure at some time in the future of the steel miling activity at Newcastle was not within the knowledge of the Labor Party has been disproved by the member for Newcastle's own question. He was referring to public remarks. So all this humbug about how we knew it and you did not, coming on top of your behaviour over unfair dismissal laws, shows that in the l3 months you have been in opposition you have learnt nothing about the real needs of the battlers of Australia. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the press release from BHP of 1995 which details their commitment to keep steel making going. It is from 1995 when Labor was in office. Leave not granted. APEC Trade Ministers Conference",22
49,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House as to whether any progress was made on the liberalisation of trade at last week's APEC trade ministers conference in Montreal?,22
50,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and, if I may say so, for his enduring interest in foreign affairs and trade issues. As the member suggests, I did attend on behalf of the Australian government in place of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade the APEC trade ministers meeting in Montreal at the end of last week. The Australian government's objectives at the APEC ministers meeting were very much fulfilled. One of our key objectives was to ensure that there was an improvement in the individual action plans that the 18 member economies had put forward, and it was agreed at the APEC trade ministers meeting that improved individual action plans would be put forward to the August senior officials meeting so that, by the time the leaders meet at the end of the John year, those improved individual action plans can be presented to them. The second achievement of the meeting, which was an important achievement, was to agree to develop further sectoral initiatives for what you might call turbocharged trade liberalisation. The Australian government suggested that amongst the sectoral initiatives included should be initiatives in the area of energy-and I think there was good support for that-and also processed foods, nonferrous metals and one or two other sectors as well. In the end, it was decided that senior officials would give consideration to what sort of sectoral initiatives could be taken up. By the time the leaders meet in November of this year, it will be possible for the leaders to agree on work in particular sectors so that APEC does not just depend on the individual action plans but has accelerated areas of activity. We saw some of that last year with the information technology and basic telecommunications agreements, and I think we will get more progress this year in some other sectors. Thirdly, the Australian government has for some time, including under the previous government, promoted a concept called the APEC business travel card. Contrary to a report that appeared in a newspaper a day or two ago, the APEC business travel card is gradually being endorsed by an increasing number of economies. Already Australia, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea have adopted the APEC business travel card and a trial for that travel card is now beginning. It was indicated to us at the APEC meeting that Hong Kong would certainly be adopting the business travel card, and Chile and Thailand as well are looking at doing so. So, although it perhaps has not developed as fast as one might like, it is certainly developing and developing successfully. Finally, and I think this will be of interest to all members of the House, the Australian government promoted at the meeting an initiative, which really came from the Prime Minister at the time of the APEC leaders meeting, for APEC economies to promote the merits of trade liberalisation. It was agreed that senior officials would consider how this could be done. Two aspects of it, I think, are very important, and I made this point clear to the APEC trade ministers meeting. First of all, people around the APEC economies need to understand the direct benefits to them of trade liberalisation. But, secondly, people around the APEC economies need to understand that each of those 18 economies is going through this process of liberalisation. One of the most common reactions from APEC trade and foreign ministers during this meeting was that they heard from their own constituencies the cry, 'Why are we liberalising while no-one else is?' They all hear this from all of their constituencies. The fact is that all APEC members are going through this process of liberalisation and the problem is that there are, in each of those 18 economies, a few people who choose not to understand what liberalisation is taking place in the rest of the region. This project will help to explain that, even to the simplest of people who do not wish to understand the benefits of trade liberaIisation. The meeting was a great success. Australia's objectives were all fulfilled and I believe tkt APEC is developing very strongly and very successfully. Child-Care Centres: Film and Literature Classification",22
51,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Prime Minister confirm that his government's guidelines for child-care centres caution against telling the age old stories Cinderella, Rapunzel and Robin Hood? If so, will he ask the film classification board to introduce also a new category of film suitable for preschool viewing? Given possible offence to vertically challenged Australians, will he suggest that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs be given a restricted rating?",23
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to say to my friend and former colleague-and, I hope, perhaps one day future colleague-Allan Rocher, that he is one of the most honourable people I have been associated with in this parliament. The fact that he sits as an Independent at the present time is a matter of very great regret as far as I am concerned. Anyway, such is politics. He asks a very serious question, and I will endeavour to answer it. Can I say to the honourable member for Curtin that I will have a look at those guidelines. If there is anything in those guidelines remotely consistent with what the honourable member has said, I will be amazed but, more importantly, I will see that those guidelines are changed so that that kind of insane politically correct nonsense is not allowed to go on in this country. Higher Education Funding",23
53,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of claims that government reforms to the financing of higher education would result in an exodus of students from Australian universities? What do the latest university enrolment figures tell us about the veracity or otherwise of those claims?",23
54,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. During the parliamentary break, the Leader of the Opposition made the long expected decision to dump the former shadow minister for education, the member for Sydney. He was not much good in that portfolio, I suppose. He had asked, I think, five questions on higher education during his time in the portfolio. During that recess, the Leader of the Opposition appointed the member for Werriwa, a protege of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Unfortunately, the new shadow minister has got off to a very bad start. I recall that on 20 August last year the member for Werriwa said that battling families would have to face the prospect of a two-tiered higher education system in which in Australia 35,000 growth places would be lost to the sector. I have to say that, throughout the last four or five months when he has been moving in on the member for Sydney as the opposition spokesman on education, he has been one of those voices baying against the reforms that have been put in place by Senator Vanstone in the higher education sector. He has been spreading the notion that places are being restricted, that access is being restricted to students wanting to enter Australia's universities. Nothing could be further from the tIUth. Let me inform the opposition and the member for Werriwa that, on the most recent information available to the government, there has been an increase of almost 12,000 undergraduates in Australian !lniversities this year. Universities have overenrolled some 26,500 undergraduates. So much for restricted access to Australia's universities! Not only that, the total funding available to Australian universities has also increased over last year. Total Commonwealth operating grant funding for universities in 1997 was up $147 million. Indeed, the government estimates that the university sector is now deriving some $250 million more revenue from teaching activities this year than last year. Last year when the government brought down its reforms, it informed this parliament and the Australian people that its reforms would mean more university places and more funding for Australian universities by giving the universities the flexibility which your party, the Labor Party, consistently denied them. The fact is the government has delivered on that promise. Senator Vanstone's reforms, the government's reforms, have worked. There are more undergraduates in Australian universities today-12,000 more than there were last year-and total university resources are up. That is a very bad start for the new shadow minister for education. Steel Industry Workers: Jobsearch Assistance  directed to the Prime Minister and relates to the government's proposal to privatise the CES. I ask the Prime Minister: is it the case that, under this proposal, BHP workers made redundant will be refused access to free job search assistance? Prime Minister, does this not just add insult to injury caused by the government's refusal to act to secure their job security and the future of the steel making industry in Newcastle?",24
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will have to check the first part of the honourable member's question. I cannot tell you offhand. Mr Crean-It's your bill.,24
56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot, and I will not try to bluff my way though the answer. I will come back to the honourable member as soon as possible. As to the second part of the question, I think that it presupposes a capacity that has not been demonstrated by any government in Australia until now and is unlikely to be demonstrated by any government in the future. You are inviting the Australian people to believe that there were no job losses in heavy industrialised areas in the 13 years that you were in power. You are inviting the Australian people to forget the fact that BHP's operation in Port Kembla was reduced by something like two-thirds in the 13 years that you were office. You are inviting the Australian people to forget the significant downsizing that occurred in Newcastle before the recent announcement made by BHP. You are also inviting the people of the Hunter Valley to forget the fact that the actions of your state Labor comrades led my Mr Carr in the timber industry have cost directly and indirectly almost 2,500 jobs.  a point of order. My question was quite specific. It made no such invitations. It referred to the steel making industry, not to anything else.",24
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,25
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable gentleman asked a question that justifies an answer about job security, and I am asking you to ponder the job security of timber workers in New South Wales. I am asking you to ponder the job security of the timber workers in Gloucester, Bulahdelah, Stroud and Karuahall Hunter region towns. Some 2,000 to 2,500 jobs have been destroyed in those four towns because of the blindly, ideologically, progreen policy of Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales. We never hear any complaints from you when that is done. All you do is try to construct a lie to the people of Newcastle, and that lie is that in some way of order: I made no such allegation. I find that offensive.",25
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Resume your seat.  he does not know the subject, ought to sit down.",25
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Shortland! Resume your seat.,25
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not like being reminded that, when you were in office, thousands and thousands of Australians lost their jobs in the industrialised areas of Australia. You do not like being reminded that the Labor Premier of New South Wales has destroyed 2,500 jobs in the Hunter Valley in the timber industry. Like your leader and the member for Hotham, you are a humbug on the subject of unemployment. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: if the Prime Minister will not answer the question on whether BHP workers made redundant would have access to free job advice from the CES, can't the minister",25
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat.  order: I demand that the Prime Minister withdraw the words that he accused me of that is, the reference to me as a humbug. I am not a humbug. I find that remark extremely offensive. I asked a question in respect of the people of the Hunter whom I represent. I demand that it be withdrawn.",25
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The word 'humbug' is well within the province of debate within this chamber. There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Petrie. Small Business,25
64,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Small business in my electorate of Petrie has very much welcomed the small business statement, but many tell me that they are still doing it very tough. I know you have been out visiting small businessmen and women discussing the package of measures contained in the statement, which included a recent visit to my electorate of Petrie. It has now been two months since the government's small business statement was announced. Can you please outline to the House what the reaction of small business in Australia has been to the package of initiatives, and are there signs of a pick up in this very vital business sector?  Petrie for her question. As the member would know, I have visited many small businesses, particularly in Queensland and in the member's electorate. These small businesses have welcomed the government's initiativesparticularly, I might add, in the area of the capital gains tax. The capital gains tax provisions will soon flow through. Small businesses appreciate the flexibility to grow their businesses but, more particularly, they appreciate the opportunity for them to build-up their small businesses for a retirement nest egg. A husband and wife can sell their business capital gains tax free and, as of 1 July, what can flow to them will be $1 million. What small businesses are bitterly disappointed about particularly is the Labor Party's decision to block our unfair dismissal provisions. When meeting the small business community in Petrie, they told me that that was the greatest block to them employing young Australians. I might add that the shadow minister recently said that he suspected, 'A lot of political heat might be generated against us if we take a negative view on this particular provision.' You are quite right. The small business people want this provision. But the previous shadow minister, Senator Cook, in answering a question at a doorstop said that, before taking a position on this matter, he would consult the small business community. I would love to know who the small business people were he consulted who told him that they were quite happy to leave in place the unfair dismissal provisions that Labor put in place. In fact, the small business community wanted the unfair dismissal provisions stripped away-just as the Prime Minister has provided for small business in other ways, including the capital gains tax rollover, the small business innovation fund and the cutting of red tape and compliance. Small business has recognised that we have cleared the way. The initiatives are in place. Low inflation and low interest rates are locked in. They are now starting to see the benefit of that growth, the benefit of those initiatives, the benefit of the stripping away of the unfair dismissal provisions-the compliance provisions that we are stripping away and that you are voting against-and of course the benefit I)f the capital gains tax rollover. Confidence is returning to the consumer and small business markets, and it is about time the opposition stopped knocking small business. BHP: Newcastle",25
65,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister, and once again it relates to BHP's decision to wind down its Newcastle steelworks. Prime Minister, can you at least do something for Hunter residents by guaranteeing that no worker retrenched by BHP will be required to pay your superannuation surcharge simply because they might be in receipt of eligible termination payments or similar leave entitlements?",26
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before responding to that particular part of the question, can I say one other thing in relation to BHP in the Hunter Valley. Can I remind the House that overall employment in BHP Steel in 1982, which was the last full year of the Fraser government, was 54,000. By May 1996 it had fallen to 23,000. I think it is worthwhile, against the background of all ofMr Beazley interjecting",26
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can interject as much as you like. Once again, you have been revealed for the phoneys and the humbugs you are on this subject. In 1982 it was 54,000. By 1996 it had fallenMr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I asked a very specific question about wheth-r or not those workers made redundant at BHP would be forced to pay the superannuation surcharge. I asked the Prime Minister to guarantee that they will not.",26
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. The Prime Minister is addressing the question.,26
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It will be precisely the same as other workers in similar positions. Medicare Services,26
70,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. The minister would be aware of the favourable response to his recent announcement to continue the retention of Medicare services to needy rural areas. In this regard, I would be pleased for him to provide assurances as to the immediate future for the three Medicare offices in my electorate of Mallee at Horsham, Mildura and Swan Hill. This is a large region which covers 25 per cent of Victoria and in much need of these services. I also ask: when will he be in a position to advise even greater access to Medicare services through the access of pharmacies?",26
71,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can assure him that the three Medicare offices in his electorate are secure. The government has made a decision not to close any Medicare offices in rural areas, and we have done this after very strong representation from the rural members of the Liberal and National parties. In particular, I thank the member for Mallee for his representation on behalf of his constituents. One thing that was put to me continually by local members was that if you are going to close an office in a country town there is no prospect of the jobs being relocated within that town and that some country people have to travel very substantial distances to get to another Medicare office. What we are looking to do here is to diversify the way claims can be made. We have electronic data transfer and we have a greater portion of doctors bulk-billing. With the Medicare cash rebate being lost to Medicare offices from 1 January 1998, the volume of claims in Medicare offices is going down-so much so that one office that we are looking to close in metropolitan Australia was handling only 28 claims a day. Clearly, that is not justifiable. So the government has decided to close 43 Medicare offices in metropolitan areas. I make no apology for this. This is very simply a transfer of resources from the city to the country. It is very simply an attempt to make sure that all Australians have fair and reasonable access to Medicare claiming. I make no apology for trying to do something to assist people in rural Australia to have better access and to address the neglect that was a result of 13 years of Labor putting Medicare offices in Labor Party seats. The honourable member asked about pharmacy claiming. This has been trialled in the Townsville area. We have planned to roll out 400. A list of those locations is available. We are going to basically do it on the same basis that the isolated pharmacy allowance is paid. Every single cent we save from closing offices in the city will go to the country plus more. BHP: Newcastle",26
72,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What consideration is the government giving to the consequences of the closure of BHP at Newcastle for the hundreds of contracted workers who supply their labour to BHP but who are technically employed by various labour hire firms-that is over and above the 2,500? How will these workers receive any redundancy payments or other compensation for their loss of employment? What action does the government intend to help these workers and others in such a position in future redundancy situations?",27
73,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The arrangements between employers and subcontractors would obviously be a matter between the parties and would obviously be different from subcontractor to subcontractor. I would say, more generally, that it is incredible for the Labor Party to stand here and ask us questions about unemployment and people's prospects for employment in the future when you had the chance today to stand up and actually support a sensible measure that would give people a chance of a job in the future. Do not think we are going to sit back and take this hypocrisy from you people. The reality is that you created one of the greatest fiascos in industrial relations law in the history of this country. Last year you stood against every attempt we made to change it. You actually supported the crazy Brereton scheme that we were trying to knock off, and which we successfully did. Then today you announced that you will oppose a sensible extension of that remedy which was introduced last year. You have no credibilityabsolutely none. I tell you what, in your response to the budget tonight don't start talking to us about unemployment when you have this decision already announced. Environment",27
74,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Following your recent visit to central and northern Victoria for the opening of the Torrumbarry Weir on the Murray River, I am sure that you would be aware of many of the environmental problems, particularly in the Campaspe-Loddon region. What action does the government intend to take to address those environmental problems?",27
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly do remember my visit to Victoria to open the Torrumbarry Weir. It was a magnificent opportunity to visit a number of electorates including the electorate of Murray, so ably represented by its newly elected member. It also was an opportunity for me to remind the people of that part of Victoria at a very large gathering of its citizens of the long standing commitment of the coalition government to the resuscitation of the Murray-Darling Valley and the Murray-Darling system. The contribution that we will make through the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia will represent the greatest investment in Australia's environmental future. Can I say to the member for Cunningham, who grins opposite, 'If you are going to take a bit of heat on the unfair dismissal,' - which we promise you, you will-'you are also going to take a lot of heat on the fact that you voted against the greatest environmental investment in Australia's history,' because in every regional and rural electorate in Australia that I go to, I will remind them that when it comes to a choice between the Labor Party on the one hand and the Liberal and National parties on the other hand, there is no argument at all as to which of the two sides of politics will make the greatest investment in the environmental future of Australia. It passes comprehension that a party that pretends that it is concerned about Australia's environmental future would vote down an investment - of $1.2 billion in Australia's environmental future. In every regional electorate that I go to over the next 18 months I will remind people of that. And I know that all my colleagues behind me will remind the electors of those regions that, when the opportunity is there, the Labor Party votes against the environment and that, when the opportunity is there, the Labor Party votes against job creation. Whenever you get an issue that affects the mainstream of the Australian community, whenever you get an issue which is of concern to ordinary Australians-like job creation and the environmentyou can rely on the Labor Party to vote against a beneficial measure. Just as they voted against the environmental fund, so they voted against the unfair dismissal laws. Yes, the member for Cunningham is right, you will take a lot of political heat because you deserve it, because you are striking a blow against the young and against small business. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",28

77,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the minister claim to have been misrepresented?,28
78,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,28
79,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,28
80,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, in this morning's West Australian, I am quoted in an article by Mr Alan ThornhillMr Bevis-Did anybody correct that?",28
81,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"You might listen. You will find it is a bit less accurate than you think. On the discussion of the subject of China, he says that the Chinese Embassy in Canberra was interested in my remarks-and I presume he was talking about a Meet the Press interview on 27 April. He quoted me as saying: 'Concerns have been expressed about instability on the Korean Peninsula and problems about China', Mr MCLachlan said 'in that China might resort to force in certain circumstances, not the least in connection with Taiwan'. Mr Speaker, I said no such words. Those exact words were put to me in a question by Mr David Jenkins in that interview. I have spoken to Mr Thornhill this morning and he assures me that he will correct the matter in the West Australian. AUDITOR·GENERAL'S REPORTS",28

84,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question is in regard to the digressions of the Leader of the Opposition when asking questions during question time. It goes to standing order 81 and standing order 85, regarding digression and a member who persists with irrelevance. I refer you to House of Representatives Practice, second edition, page 296, where it refers to those who raise frivolous points of order. I believe that, at the end of the last session, you told this House that you were going to address the fact that this sort of may be disorderly. Given the fact that the Leader of the Opposition often has a babbling preamble to his questions, I ask that you rule on that matter.",29
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I alluded, during the closing days of the last session, to the fact that I would review during the break a number of points relevant to question time. We have a very significant occasion nationally tonight in the sense that the budget is being handed down at 7.30 p.m. I will be making a statement within the next few days to elaborate on how question time will run and will refer to other relevant points. Limro Cleaning Services",29
86,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I refer to previous concerns which I have raised in relation to the operation of Limro Cleaning Services in this building. Is it true that agreeprogram ment was reached before the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that the cleaners who work in this building are replaced when they are on leave? Is it also true pany has failed to implement this agreement? Does this mean fewer jobs for cleaners, more stress and pressure on the remaining cleaning staff and a reduced standard of cleaning? Has this led to a proposed strike by the cleaning staff from midnight tonight? Can you and the President take some measures to ensure that companies contracting to the parliament meet reasonable industrial relations standards in the treatment of their workers?",30
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Canberra for his question. The President and I are both concerned about this matter and I am advised that the staff of Limro Cleaning Services, the parliament's cleaning contractor, have voted to take industrial action for 24 hours from midnight tonight. The Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union has stated that this action is being taken primarily because the cleaning staff believe that Limro is failing to appropriately replace cleaners who are absent. Limro has advised that, in association with the Confederation of ACT Industry, ConfACT, it has addressed all outstanding issues and has lived up to its statutory and award obligations. Limro and Con fACT are actively seeking intervention by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for resolution of the matter today. In the event that there is to be industrial action, then essential hygiene services in the public and private areas of the parliament will be maintained by Limro's management. NA",30

92,Dr NELSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On the evening of 21 April 1997, Channel 9's A Current Affair ran a in which they alleged that a significant number of members of this House had not responded to mail from constituents within one month. I was one of those people that the com- who was named in that way. The facts of the matter are that two constituents who were asked by A Current Affair to write to me did so. The first did on 3 March. She sent the letter to an electorate address which had been vacated six months earlier. On 18 March she rang to find out where her letter was, at which time it became clear that it had gone to the wrong address. She faxed it through to our office and received a response and action upon her request 20 days later. The second constituent wrote on 4 March. He made a phone call to my office on the same day. He then received a letter on 11 March from my office, responding to all his inquiries. He wrote to me on 12 March thanking me for all the support and effort that we had put in for him. I wrote to him again on 25 March and to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on his behalf to deal with some secondary issues. All I can say is that I will be watching Frontline with renewed vigour.

93,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to secure the future of the steel industry in Newcastle. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",30
94,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's failure in Newcastle reflects a general failure. It is a failure on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give leadership, it is a failure to produce a steel plan and it is a failure to produce an industry policy. What we have is a government with no commitment, no compassion and, listening to the answers today from the Prime Minister, no comprehension as to the problem. The Prime Minister railed today on the basis of asserting that what happened with BHP's announcement a fortnight ago would have happened anyway. He challenged Labor to say how it would have been different. The fact of the matter is that as recently as 1995, when Labor was still in office, BHP recommitted to continuing the steelworks at Newcastle and also to implementing new arc furnace technology either before or thereafter-in other words, it was a commitment by BHP under Labor to keep steel going in Newcastle. We also have the circumstances where the Prime Minister wants to tell us about the 54,000 people employed in BHP in 1982 and the numbers now, but the simple fact is that, if they had been returned to power in 1983, BHP would have been out the door then. In 1983 BHP was threatening to close Newcastle, to close Whyalla and even threatening to close Port Kembla. So the 54,000 jobs would have gone to zero had Labor not been elected. With Labor being elected in 1983, we sought immediate talks with BHP. We developed the steel plan and we saved Newcastle. We saved Newcastle and we saved Whyalla. We not only saved them but we saw significant new investment into steel making in this country-investment in steel making and growth in steel exports. Steel exports Australia's No. 1 manufacturing export, so there is a demand for our product. We can be there and we can be competitive, but only if you have a government prepared to back the industry in this country. This is a government that will not do it. We had the circumstances in 1983 where Labor saved Newcastle. Had Labor been returned at the last election, we would have saved Newcastle on this occasion. Why? Because we would have held BHP to its commitment made in 1995-a commitment to keep steel making going in Newcastle. Is that the approach this government takes-this hands-off government, this rudderless government, this government that shows no leadership on anything that counts in this country and this government that is only ever forced to do anything in terms of jobs or industry when Labor pushes them to the barrier? Look at the example of the shipbuilding industry, where we had the minister time and time again getting up and saying, 'We are going to abolish the ships bounty; they don't need it.' Who was at the forefront of that campaign? It was Labor, and we got it restored. Mr Moore-Ha, hal",31
95,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister laughs. The minister would have had no capacity in his own right to get that policy up. He goes around oozing these words about how good he is for industry but cannot deliver a cracker. He can go and let off the crackers down at the casino instead of going to the Newcastle workers, but he cannot deliver a thing. Let me have a look at the Prime Minister's role in this regard because he is the one to blame. He is the one who has to assert leadership because of the incompetent Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, not having any ability to win an argument through the cabinet. We have John Howard, the Prime Minister of the country, oozing concern at the closure of Newcastle. This is what he had to say; this is his pathetic response the day after the Newcastle closure. He goes on Ray Martin's show and he says: I'm very sorry for the people of Newcastle. I hope are still to go to that city soon. I will go to Newcastle myself. He still has not been there. No appearance, your worship. He has not turned up, despite the fact that he has gone on Ray Martin's program to say he is going to go there. Ray Martin says: Is that enough for you to go and say you're The dissembling Prime Minister says: Well well look on its own it is at this stage can do Ray. It is the antithesis of good for me a day after the announcement without having been there, without having listened to people, without having been properly advised sort of off the top of my head make a whole of promises. I can't deliver miracles, I can't reverse BHP's decision ... This is the Prime Minister of the countryput hasn't got a clue, hasn't got a solution, hasn't got a suggestion except the comfort words 'I'll go', but they are still waiting. This is a Prime Minister acting true to Back in 1982, when BHP was threatening the Fraser government with closing its steelworks at Newcastle, John Howard, then Treasurer, was in hiding. We know at least Malcolm Fraser had a bit of commitment facturing industry in this country. He was a bit of a supporter of some intervention industry, but the Prime Minister was under pressure not to help BHP. He took the unhas usual step of insisting upon a vote in the cabinet-a vote of every member so he would not be left out on a limb. Who was absent? The present Prime Minister. The Prime Minister tells us today that was not absent. I would like him to check record or at least check with Mr Alan Woods, who has written this piece. But more to point: if he was there, how did he vote? I he voted against Newcastle because he voting against them now. He says that he has compassion for the workers of Newcastle, but he won't attend, won't lift a finger for them, won't do a thing. He hid then and he hiding now. He simply is not on the landscape so far as Newcastle is concerned. The Prime Minister also tells us that known for ages that this was going to happen. It makes the crime even worse. If he knew all that time, why didn'the lift a finger? didn'the actually get BHP to the table ask what we could do to secure the future of the steel industry in this country? BHP has invested in an arc furnace, but where has invested? It has invested in Ohio, USA. And why? Because Ohio, USA offered them free sorry? land, a tax holiday and a new road. The Newcastle arc furnace is in Ohio because this government has let it go there. This governall I ment is not committed to supporting the steel government making industry in this country. What about the Prime Minister's pathetic to press release on the day of the BHP anstring nouncement? The press release's final sentence-I think it can be divided into two; I think there is a bit of a typo, but these are the Prime Minister's words which were actually to print-says 'I refuse to promise anything' - that is, to the people of Newof castle-and then 'I cannot deliver to the families of Newcastle and the Hunter'. form. Why should this person be elected again? Why should a person who is not prepared to lift a finger and not prepared to do a thing to assist the families, the work force and the future of Newcastle be treated seriously into the manuany future election? We now come to his industry minister, who in is at the table-the man who has left this yawning gap in industry policy, the one who editorials around the country as well as the business community united around this country calling for an industry policy-the people that he refers to as 'village galahs'. I tell you what, Minister: there is a decent he flock, in plague proportions in your case, the heading to Canberra, but you would not know because you are either out to lunch or enthe sconced over in the Commonwealth Club. We bet know about the minister's discussion at the is Commonwealth Club with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about the future of the car industry. The discussion was, 'Let's let Mitsubishi go.' Again he is true to form because the other is day he said, 'Let's let Newcastle go.' They could not find the minister on the day of the announcement. Where was he? He was he has out to another long lunch. We know this minister likes long lunches. He was over at for The Tryst, this time supporting the private Why sector, not the Commonwealth Club. This and minister is about dinners at the Commonwealth Club, port and cigars, early retirement to bed-or at least not having to travel too it far. But this day he was at The Tryst for lunch. It is one of those places where you can sit outside and be seen. But the minister could not be found. At the end of the day he finally put out a press release in relation to BHP at Newcastle which said, 'It is regrettable but we cannot interfere in BHP's commercial decisions.' In other words, what matters is the share price, not the people. The only reason the share price matters to him is that he is into share trading. We know that this minister will sit by idly and not take any step to keep industry going. The message that I give to the workers and community of Newcastle is: keep the pressure up because this is a government that buckles under pressure. It buckled in relation to the ships bounty. It will bu.::kle in relation to the car industry because we will keep the pressure on and we will make sure that it puts pressure on to secure the future of the steel industry in this country. In adding to the disinterest being displayed by this remote dilettante sitting at the table, what does he do instead of accepting an invitation to address the steelworkers in Newcastle? He goes to the casino. And the Prime Minister thinks it was appropriate! Here we have 'Black Jack' Moore sprung at the casino sipping the Laurent Perrier. Do honourable members know what his excuse was when someone from Newcastle rang two days before to ask whether he was coming? He was told, 'No, the minister won't be there. He's got a very important meeting with the Victorian Premier on Thursday night.' The Victorian Premier was going to be at only one place that Thursday night. The minister says that he could not have caught a plane up to Newcastle because he had very important meetings. The last plane that he could have caught left Melbourne at 6 o'clock. But, of course, he was already onto his second glass of Laurent Perrier. This is the champagne sipping minister-no care, no responsibility. Why weren't you there? You are a disgrace. Here we have the minister flaunting it again. We have a Prime Minister who hideshe hid in 1982 and he is hiding today-but not this minister. He flaunts it. He could not care less and turns up at the casino to gamble or looks at the next price increase in BHP shares. The minister was caught out in Bligh Ventures in terms of breaching the Prime Minister's code of conduct. Remember when he said, 'No conflict of interest because it's involved in venture capita!'? But his own department says he has responsibility for venture capital in this country-strike 1. Second was Ralston, the private share trading company, and the specific reference to the fact that he trades in shares, disallowed by the Prime Minister's code of conduct. He says, 'I'm not in control of Bligh Ventures anymore,' despite the fact that he owns 90 per cent of the ordinary shares and 100 per cent of the redeemable preference shares. You fraud. Now there is the indefensible conduct of turning up at the casino. Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I require the accusation of 'fraud' to be withdrawn, in the absence of a substantive motion.",31
96,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw it. Mr Moore-- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask the honourable member to withdraw the accusation that I controlled Bligh Ventures. I never did.",33
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)There is no point of order. The honourable member for Hotham will return to the MPI.,33
98,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The person who got up-this remote dilettante, this person who thinks that everyone should own a unit trust in this country-should go and tell that to the steel workers of Newcastle; this person who spends lunch at The Tryst and dinner at the Commonwealth Club plotting and letting the plug go on Newcastle and the car industry of this country. This is a government that has not lifted a finger for the workers of Newcastle. This is a government that not only has not lifted a finger to save those people's jobs, but also is going to tax them on the way through with the new superannuation surcharge and is going to deny them access to CES assistance for placement. Labor would not have allowed this shameful set of circumstances to occur. Labor would have introduced another steel plan. In the way that we saved Newcastle in 1983, we would have saved it in 1997. There is one clear decision that ment should take, and that is to convene a mt""eting of the parties. Get BHP and other steel making companies interested in developing the industry here. We know that there is growth in demand for steel. We know that Australia has the raw materials, the technology, the skill base and the infrastructure. Why can't we have a minister with the wit to put it together? Because he is incompetent and he does not care. This is a minister that deserves to be condemned. He has breached his code of conduct on three counts and he is not prepared to lift a finger to save the workers of Newcastle. (Time expired)",33
99,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One thing I can say about this is that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) is not a patch on his father-and I am pleased to see you here, Frank. This was an appalling performance, a stunt ridden show in which he came up with not one proposal on the part of the ALP-just stunt after stunt. He is a completely discreditalready ed person in every respect. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made it clear in question time, the government is very concerned about the decision by BHP to scale down its steel operations in Newcastle. As the Prime Minister said, the government is committed to assisting those affected by the decision and to supporting the Hunter region. As the full impact of the decision will not occur for about two years, we have a short time in which to put together an effective package of support for those directly affected and for the Newcastle community. In the view of the government, this is very much more important and of much greater significance to the people of Newcastle than all the political stunts that have been staged by the member for Hotham. The government will be making use of the short window of opportunity to consult with the local community, to examine the options and to put together an effective and properly thought through package. We will not be engaging in political stunts. We will be taking a long-term perspective to benefit those directly affected and the whole local community. We will be working with the local community to deliver this govern- the most practical outcome. The meeting at Newcastle town hall held last Thursday night was nothing more than a weak political stunt orchestrated by the member for Hotham. As the Prime Minister said, the local member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) was not askedMr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I had nothing to do with the organisation of the meeting. It was not orchestrated by me and I ask him to withdraw it.",34
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,34
101,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the Prime Minister said, the local member for Paterson and Senator Tierney were not even given the courtesy of an invitation to attend. I was first informed of the meeting last Monday afternoon-the Monday before the Thursday-when it was faxed to my office late that afternoon. I had committed myself to several important engagements in Melbourne. These included, firstly, a breakfast appointment, a subsequent late meeting, attending the construction industry lunch and making a speech there and meeting the Premier-not at the casino, but at the Premier's office-between 2.30 and about 3.15. From 4 o'clock onwards I was at the launch of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory-now CSL Ltd-a privatised company which has done particularly well and is taking advantage of the government's new program, PUP, to invest over $14 million in further immunisation research and development. It is quite clear under those circumstances that it would have been totally impractical to get there. Regrettably, I was not given the option of an alternative time by the meeting's organisers. If I had, I would have been only too happy to consider the invitation. It was not physically possible for me to get from Melbourne to Newcastle after my last appointment on Thursday afternoon. The meeting was yet another stunt by the member for Hotham. It was not intended as a serious discussion of the issues surrounding the BHP announcement. Mr Crean-Yes it was.",34
102,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"-If it was, why did fewer than 200 people turn up? You used to be the ACTU president, and you drew fewer than 200 people. That is how serious it was. It was not intended to be a mechanism to allow the government to consult with the local community. The basic courtesies of such a meeting were not observed. It was intended to do nothing more than be a platform for the member for Hotham. Unlike the opposition, the government is actively pursuing the best options for those affected by the BHP decision. What is important is not political stunts but substance. The government will make it very clear that it is concerned by the closure of the steelworks in Newcastle. The government has a process in place which will deal with those issues at the available time. We will be consulting with the community. We will be examining their proposals and those presented by the member for Paterson and Senator Tierney. We will be asking the Prime Minister's major projects facilitator, Bob Mansfield, to investigate major projects in the region and we will be allowing Newcastle to make long-term plans for its own future. This is of much significance to the people of Newcastle, far more so than any stunt concocted by the member for Hotham. It has been interesting to watch the member for Hotham since the BHP announcement. As with other significant industry issues, what we have seen is lots of grandstanding-tonnes of it-plenty of colour and movement and nothing of substance. As with his approach to industry policy generally, the member for Hotham has plenty of stunts, but no substance. There is colour and movement, but no substance. What is his answer to the BHP closure? What would he have done in this regard? As we have heard today, the member for Hotham has another steel plan. Let us go straight to the heart of the sition. Is a new steel plan the answer to what he is proposing? If it is, what has BHP got to say about this? Is there anything the Commonwealth or state governments can do which can change their decision? Let me quote from their press conference last week. BHP said: We do not believe that there is anything we can envisage that the government can do to change the decisions that we have made. They are really decisions that address the fundamentals of the industry that we are in.",35
103,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,So you take their word-just anybody in Australia who comes along. You are going to force them,35
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The member for Denison will be forced to do something in a minute, if he does not be quiet.",35
105,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not think it could be clearer. What does the member for Hotham' s colleague, the Premier of New South Wales, believe? When asked about a package to try and change the BHP decision, he said: It's got to be said that this is being done predominantly because of BHP's assessment of global factors at work in steelmaking. The member for Hotham has no solution. He prefers to grandstand rather than to do the hard work required to develop the policies designed to make Australia an internationally competitive investment location. The problems of the steel industry, as with so many other industries, reflect the failure of the industry policy of the last government, of which the member for Hotham was a member. If Labor's policies were so great for the Australian industry, why has BHP made its decision in Newcastle? The so-called Button steel plan did nothing for Newcastle. The economic policies of the last government did nothing for Newcastle. The industry policy of the last government did nothing for Newcastle. The stunts of the member for Hotham do nothing for Newcastle. Yet, he has another steel plan for Newcastle. As the Premier of New South Wales said, international factors, not government policy, are the critical influences in retaining a viable steel industry. In this situation, the responsibility of the propogovernment is clear. It is to ensure that Australia is an internationally competitive investment location. It is to ensure we throw off the shackles and restraints imposed by 13 years of misdirected intervention under the Labor government, and it is to ensure we assist and encourage Australian industry to adapt and develop in an internationally petitive investment environment. It is clear that the policies of the Hawke and Keating governments did not do this. member for Hotham's latest so-called plan will not do it. Like the government of which he was a member, his so-called policies will again fail Australian industry. They will fail the steel industry and they will fail the people of Newcastle. Let me look briefly at the record of the Button plan, and this is very interesting. You should listen to the record of the Button plan. In the year prior to the plan, 4,000 jobs had been lost in the Newcastle steelworks. You we would have thought that the Newcastle area had in the past. would have been a priority of the previous government at that time. Much has been said about the importance of the Button steel plan to Newcastle. Since the end of 1982, the last year of Fraser government, BHP steel employment the Australia-wide has been reduced from 53,000 to only 30,000. In the year prior to the plan, 4,000 jobs had been lost at the Newcastle steelworks. You would have thought that Newcastle area would have been the priority for the previous government. Much has been said about the importance of the plan. The steel plan itself applied bounties to five different products. Only one of these was manufactured in Newcastle. Not only that, not one cent was ever paid over the life of the plan to Newcastle for the manufacture product. That stunned you. Not one cent was paid to Newcastle. This is the plan that you are talking about saving Newcastle. Not one cent was paid under the bounty system. Mr Crean-Do you understand Australian that industry at all?",35
106,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You do not, quite clearly. The bulk of the money paid under the bounty in fact went to Port Kembla and Port. During the negotiations of the steel plan, the previous government had been given a very clear indication of where BHP saw future. What did they do about it? Nothing. They did nothing. They did not get one cent from this much vaunted Button plan. Clearly, they saw some political opportunity in calming militant unions at Port Kembla and comassisting the campaign of Bob Chynoweth in Flinders as far more important than securing jobs in the Newcastle steelworks. Then, as The now, the Labor Party attempted to make political mileage out of Newcastle. What Newcastle really needed then was investment in new technology, and the previous government did nothing about that. The fact of the matter is that the Button steel plan failed Newcastle. Let me draw two quotes from the architect of the plan, John Button. He said: The bounty is not designed to make sure that the industry ticks over for another 20 years ... The steel plan is predicated on the assumption that will have a smaller steel industry than we have That was John Button when he launched the plan in the 1980s. Well, Button got his wish because, as a result of his government's lack of foresight, political objectives overrode the prudent investment and planning and now, if latest BHP objectives are carried through, Newcastle will have no steel industry by 1999. The steel plan was designed purely to overcome the political hurdles of the day. It the had no intention of delivering long-term outcomes for the Australian steel industry. Button's own words confirm that. His steel plan did nothing for Newcastle. Not one cent of the bounty went to Newcastle. Clearly, the last thing Newcastle needs is another steel plan. BHP have said that, the Premier of New South Wales recognised it, and the governof steel ment knows that. What Newcastle needs is a government which will not only help the people of Newcastle through the transition but also ensure there is a sustainable future as well. If the member for Hotham is truly concerned, he will end his pathetic political campaigns and get behind the government's plans for industry competitiveness, which includes supportto Western ing tonight's budget. The opposition has made a political game their out of the BHP announcement and it is backfiring on them. For example, the member for Hotham simply cannot make up his mind how he wants to approach this issue. In 1990, for example, the member for Hotham said of the Button plan: [It] was run for 5 years and then go out of existence on the basis that at the end of that time the industry in its own right would be on a solid footing for growth without any need for continued assistance. Mr Hawker-Who said that?",36
107,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Hotham, of his own plan. He continued: The plan finished in 1988 because it was so successful we did not need a subsequent plan. Now he says we need a second plan. In 1992 the member for Hotham, at the height of the Hunter Valley coal strikes, said: The Government is not going to step in and tell companies how to run their business ... What is the point in the Government keeping open a mine that does not ensure a continuing, efficient, petitive supply of product. In 1997, the member for Hotham said about the new plan: What it should do, is to sit down with the company and say, 'You are going to invest somewhere in steel diversification. That's him again. So we have gone from the plan that is wonderful, we never direct companies, to let's go back and divest it all over again-the full circle. There is no doubt about you! Mr Speaker, the opposition clearly do not know which issue they want to follow. They are proposing a steel plan which they know nothing about and which will do nothing for the industry or for Newcastle. As I have already said, neither BHP nor the New Sf'uth Wales government believe that government intervention could change BHP's direction. Unlike the opposition, the government is concerned about practical support for the people of Newcastle and internationally competiti ve policies for our industry. What every person who cares about Newcastle wants is a program which ensures a smooth transition for those wishing to relocate, reskill or retire and a program which builds upon growth and investment in the Hunter region. BHP have a comprehensive program in place to deal with the announcement. The government will be working with the company when necessary to ensure that the benefits of that program are maximised. This decision by BHP was becoming a possibility as far back as 1995. The previous government did nothing then and they have done nothing since to deliver a plan which benefits those affected by this decision. (Time expired)",37
108,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was a disgraceful performance. Let me correct the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). Let me tell you a few facts. You just said, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier, that at the end of 1982 BHP employed 54,000 people. Let me tell you, by May 1983 they employed 25,000 people. The works at Newthe castle had dropped from almost 12,000 in 1981 when John Howard was Treasurer to 6,500 by May 1983. The cabinet meeting that com- has been spoken about earlier was the one when BHP announced the retrenchment of 5,000 people in mid-1982. John Howard was Treasurer, but where was he? He was the same place he has been these last few weeks. Secondly, concerning the Button plan being a failure, let me tell the minister one part of the plan which he did not mention: the money to help diversify the steel regions totalled $100 million, of which $45 million in cash was given to the Newcastle-Hunter community to diversify, to get new industries and to broaden the economic base. Money went into T AFE, into improved training, into a whole range of activities which is why our economy is now much stronger-$45 million in 1983 dollars. We are supposed to be grateful now that the Prime Minister is going to lob up there with some lolly jar of $10 million in 1997 dollars-$45 million in 1983 dollars compared to $10 million now. For those so-called federalists opposite, is he doing it in conjunction with the states as we did in 1983? It was a combined exerciseall Commonwealth money, but the state helped to administer it. No. The Prime Minister has announced today that he, Mr Bob Baldwin and Senator Tierney will go out there handing out the cash, not via the New South Wales government, not as part of a three-tier government approach, not as a community based operation, but he will announce, as and when he sees fit, what particular bits he will give and to where. We are about to see the most blatant bit pork barrelling. Mind you, the barrel is tiny. You could not call it pork; it is more like tiny bit of bacon. That is the kind of nonsense we are getting from those opposite. Mr Crean-Is that what they mean by bringing home the bacon?",37
109,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, that is the shares bacon-the bit of rind that is left. We have known for some decades that the blast furby naces at Newcastle, as at WhyaUa of Kembla, have limited lives. Since 1983, BHP have been considering the future of Newcastle blast furnaces. That consideration took in a lot of opportunities and a lot choices. At one stage, there was a strong proposal for Corex, which we were briefed on as parliamentarians in 1991. That was not proceeded with but eventually on 30 June 1995, in a quite major statement, John to Prescott announced the commitment of half billion dollars to new steel technology Newcastle to be operational by 2002. That was to give us certainty. What we saw a fortnight ago was the reversal of that decision. Back in July last year, less than a year after the 1995 anpondence nouncement, BHP announced a review their steel division and what we have seen in that last nine months or so has been a series of leaks-who knows whether they are leaks, guesses, or whatever-which have caused speculation ever since. I think most of us pretty cynical that that was, in fact, delivered and it was a softening up process. Let me talk about the problem itself first. We are not simply talking about a loss of went on to say: jobs; we are talking about a 20 per cent cut to this nation's steel making capacity. We are talking about Australia being a net importer for of steel by the year 2000. We currently export about 130 million tonnes of iron ore a year worth about $40 a tonne. We currently export three million tonnes of steel, earning us billion in export earnings. By we will have reduced our net exports by 1.8 million tonnes of production. On 29 April, the biggest manufacturer in this country, with a capital base of $8 billion to $9 billion, said that they will be investing of in that capital base at a rate below the level of depreciation, which will lead to a signifia cant reduction of the capital base over time. They announced a reduction of 5,000 jobs across Australia. Effectively, they announced a worsening in our balance of payments of at least $1 billion. Two things happened after that: the investment market cheered and the went up; and the government said, 'It is none of our business.' Exports will worsen $1 billion and 5,000 jobs are to go-and and parts it is none of their business. Let us go back to that review of mid last the year. After that review was announced in budget week of August last year, as a member of of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology I raised with that committee the possibility of a parliamentary inquiry into steel to parallel BHP's review. The committee agreed that. On 11 October last year, the chairman a of the committee at the time, the member for in Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), a Liberal from Western Australia, wrote to the minister asking for a parliamentary inquiry. The minister has never answered. As far as I have been able to find, there has been no corresfrom the minister in response to that of request for a parliamentary inquiry. After the minister made it clear verbally, or his staff advised the committee, that we could not have an inquiry-his members wanted it but he refused-the shadow minister, the feel member for Hotham (Mr Crean), wrote to suggest the idea of a joint committee of parliamentarians. On 12 December, the minister wrote back saying, 'I am pleased that you are agreeable to a joint committee,' but With this in mind, I do not consider it is appropriate to task the committee with developing a plan steel making in Australia or, indeed, to formulate specific recommendations to the Government. He wants to have a committee look at steel, $1.5 but he does not want it to make any recomthe year 2000, mendations to him. Mr Crean-Well, we changed him on that; kept the pressure up.",38
110,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We kept the pressure up. On 20 December, the eve of Christmas, he finally wrote back and agreed to terms of reference under which we could make recommendations to the minister. It took from budget week in August to 20 December of last year, and it took the refusal of a parliamentary inquiry to the labyrinthine negotiations, to finally get the minister to agree to a committee of parliamentarians with no authority, with no resources and with very little capacity to actually look at steel. We have a national crisis on our hands. What is happening in Newcastle is a crisis, the dimensions of which cannot be underestimated. It involves cutting 2,500 direct jobs by the year 2000 and another 2,000 people who work on the site for contractors-equivalent to 800 full-time jobs. It involves a series of downstream industries which already have been told that their jobs are going. Last week I saw letters written to people saying, 'Your job will be going because BHP is a major customer.' We are talking about 8,000, 10,000 or 12,000 jobs altogether. It is a crisis for Newcastle which this government has ignored. It has fobbed it off, does not want to know about it and pretends that it had no role They are in government, for God's sake! Who runs this country? One single company is deciding iron ore policy and metal and steel policy, and our balance of payments policy for the next 20 or 30 years. One single company-and it does it by press release. Two years earlier it had advised the opposite. For 15 years, BHP has been wrong-every single year. Go back and look at every projection and every prediction: improve your performance, improve productivity and we will invest more. People have responded, accepted and trusted year after year. In 1995, despite the announced cut in jobs, we supported them because of their investment. A year later, they were wrong. They are wrong now. What they are doing now is a disaster for this country. We are being locked into a long term, low value adding iron ore export profile. Mr Crean-A quarry.",39
111,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Worse than a quarry-an empty quarry. A hole in the ground is left after you have quarried. While Brazil and South Africa are investing in more technology, increasing their steel and iron exports, and putting more and more into iron and steel making, we are doing the oppositewe are contracting. It is a disgrace to this country and to this government.",39
112,Mr BOB BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It gives me great pleasure to stand in this matter of public importance for the concerns of the people of the Hunter. Indeed, today in the audience and the gallery we have many members from the Hunter who have come to hear the budget to be laid down by this government-a budget which will enable the future of Newcastle to go ahead. Former President of the United States Thomas Jefferson once said, 'I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.' I can particularly relate that to the statements made by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the diatribe and carrying on in his speech, where, in particular, he said nothing about what he would do about the problem. Another steel plan? I remind people that absolutely no financial assistance from that steel plan came to Newcastle-no dollars in it. at all. All they delivered was rhetoric. The steel plan applied bounties to five different products, only one of which was made in Newcastle. But, over the life of that plan, not one cent was paid to Newcastle for the manufacture of that product. By far the bulk of the money went to Port Kembla and Western Port. Perhaps it was because of the quality of the representation of the people in those areas that they got more for their areas than we got in the Hunter. It is important, though, that we look at what BHP has done. We notice that the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has not been on his feet screaming about the industry decision, nor has the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Why? Because they have benefited from BHP's decision to relocate the steel making facility that came out of Newcastle in their electorates. Mr Hollis-We are in solidarity with Newcastle.",39
113,Mr BOB BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am glad you are in solidarity with Newcastle. Perhaps we should take the steel making out of Port Kembla and bring it to the Hunter and then see how much solidarity is then. But the reality is that it is not all doom and gloom as that grim reaper, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) would have us believe. The grim reaper talks about the sky falling in and is fully supported by his friend the member for Hotham who, as I said, has said absolutely nothing about what he would do other than put another steel plan together-a steel plan like the one that oversaw one of the greatest percentage job losses at BHP Newcastle in the entire time that he was in government. How vocal was the member for Newcastle in this period? We heard absolutely nothing from him. It was not until we came into government on 2 March that he tripped over on the way into his office, found the light switch, found there was a phone and a fax machine and started to play the media. He had been absolutely silent on the prospects of BHP and where it was going. But, again, we have heard the grim reaper-a name that suits him-talk about the negative future for BHP in Newcastle. Mr Allan Morris- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I take exception to the inferences made by the member for Paterson in terms of the way he is characterising me.",40
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not hear anything that would have attracted my attention. Earlier, I did hear him referring to somebody as the grim reaper of Newcastle; I did hear you refer to him as a traitor. But I did not hear anything else. Perhaps the honourable member will be temperate in his address, and I will listen more carefully.",40
115,Mr BOB BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will observe that, Mr Deputy Speaker. And, if the sensitivity of the Member for Newcastle is so fine, perhaps we should readjust our direction in the way that we face him in Newcastle. I suppose that the only reason the member for Hotham has been absolutely outspoken about the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) attending tourism functions such as the opening of the casino is the fact that he probably was not invited-and so he has decided to play out in the media the fact that, because they have delivered nothing for Victoria, he was not invited. What we need to consider is that now is the time to go ahead in the Hunter. I have had a lot of phone calls to my office from people who have said, 'Thank God BHP has finally made the decision.' When we talk about the 1995 release by BHP committing it to an electric arc furnace, the point that seems to be ignored here-the consideration that nobody raises when they keep expounding this-is that, if an electric arc furnace had gone in, there would have been downsizing in the company because the number of people required to operate that would have been a lot smaller than the number of people required to operate the fully integrated steel making facility. But do they raise that? No. If there was a genuine commitment by BHP in 1995 and if the member for Hotham and his team were so hot to trot and able to deliver, why did they not get contracts signed? Why were the contracts not in place then, so that they could not back out? The bottom line is, BHP has made a commercial decision. It is a decision that I do not like, that the people of the Hunter find hard to accept, but one that Bob Carr supported in his statement on 2GB on 29 April 1997, when he said: It has got to be said that this is being done predominantly because of BHP's assessment of global factors. It is nothing to do with politics. It is all to do with the steel industry and where its global position is. BHP have said that their export product was around 42 per cent of their volume. Because of global economic demands, that has been downsized to around 37 per cent. But, as I said, the steel making is going to areas such as Port Kembla and Whyalla. We have heard nothing about the people there. We have not heard them get up and scream, 'BHP, take it away from us and give it back to Newcastle.' No, not at all. Mr Hollis-They'll be on strike on Thursday, in solidarity.",40
116,Mr BOB BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you that the people of Whyalla have refused to go on strike. Why? Because they have got a direct benefit. Quite simply, BHP at Newcastle is going to expand slightly. They are going to concentrate their wire making facilities and they are also going to bring to Newcastle the rolling that was done at Geelong. That is not a lot of benefit, but at least it is something. If you listened to the member for Newcastle and the member for Hotham, you would consider that the whole of BHP was going to close in Newcastle, when it is only one facility that is going to close. Incidentally, one of the reasons they are winding back-and it is something that needs to be considered-is that they were presented with an option paper to clean up the site so that they could operate within environmental guidelines. Justifiably so, but it would cost them somewhere between $70 million and $100 million just to get going. The member for Newcastle was quite right when he said that he sought out a steel industry inquiry. That steel industry inquiry has been supported by both Senator Tierney and me, and by other members of both the coalition and the opposition. But that steel industry inquiry has taken a long time to get to its report. In December, the report began to be put together and, as the minister has quite rightly said, he wrote to the shadow minister, the member for Hotham, asking him to nominate people. The reason the report has taken so long is, quite simply, that it took the member for Hotham nearly three months to nominate people for that committee. Why did it take so long? Because he had absolutely no faith at all in the grim re-per. Why did he have no faith in the grim reaper? Because he knew that, over the previous 13 years, he could deliver no outcomes that were successful. BHP going out of Newcastle is sad, but there are a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of opportunities because we have things such as the advancement of Williamtown RAAF base. As the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) said in her recent visit to the Hunter-again playing down the grim reaper's attitude that the world was about to end and the sky was falling inRAAF base Williamtown has the opportunity to become a super base that will employ up to 5,000 people whose income will go through the electorate. At the moment, we have around $2 million a week of spending from the incomes of that RAAF base; with the expansion, that could go up to between $4 million and $5 million per week of income spent. Then we have the British Aerospace role there, injecting a billion dollars into the aviation industry by the construction of the Hawk leading fighters. Conflict is what it is always about. To sum up, this government is looking for the long term answers-not short-term shooting from the hip answers-that will hatch the egg from which the phoenix will rise from the ashes. Newcastle will go ahead. The people of the Hunter will not allow the area to die. For a long time BHP has not been the major employer in the Hunter. It is ranked at about number four or number five now and, when it has made its decision to go out finally, I am sure that other players and other industries will take over that role.",41
117,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think there was a grammatical error in the framing of the matter of public importance. I think it should refer to 'governments', not 'government', because it is quite clear that this problem has not just arisen. I believe that, with the Button steel plan, the Labor Party does have a moral advantage over the coalition, because the Button steel plan was a good plan, although it was somewhat curtailed by Keating. It is simply not true, as the government claims, that no money went into Newcastle. Substantial money did go in there, albeit indirectly. The problems for Newcastle probably started back in the 1970s when the World Bank advanced $700 million to establish a steel industry in Korea, to which I understand Australia contributed $50 million. That was a long-term loan at 4V2 per cent with no repayments for 10 years. It would be very nice to be giving that to our industry. BHP, the big Australian, referred to in my electorate as the 'Big Hairy Poofter', is not, in my view, a good corporate citizen. Its exploration dollar is moving offshore at an increasing rate and performance of BHP in oil and gas is bordering on criminal. It has put lives and the environment at risk in its management of the Griffin Venture, a matter on which I have put questions on notice and about which the government continues to be evasive. What could BHP have done? It would have helped, of course, if the government of the day had built the submarine at Newcastle, where it should have been built, but that would have necessitated building it from a proven British design. Instead, for largely political reasons, it was moved to Adelaide and an unproven Swedish submarine was chosen that has already cost a fortune and is, without a doubt, a lemon. The quoted price by the British to build that submarine-all six in Australia-was $3.1 billion. We signed the contract with Sweden at $4.2 billion. It has already gone through $6 billion. There is $3 billion there that could have been invested in the steel industry. BHP could have done a lot of things on its own account though. It is clear this thing has been happening over time and that BHP has not kept up the maintenance on its plant in Newcastle. In Australia there is a need for specialised steels. A lot of people do not realise that we import just about all the specialised steel that we need. Newcastle, with its expertise in steel, could have devel- attention. oped these specialised steels, something which the whole economy of this country requires. The last speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) talked about the new job opportunities and people talk blithely about this. The trouble for a lot of people working in this industry is that it is very specialised and people have a lifetime of skills in this industry and these skills are simply not transferable. We have seen the same nonsense talked about in Tasmania where blue-collar workers were told that their future lay in tourism. It is clear that tourism creates low paid, part-time jobs, and jobs for women-not jobs for blue-collar workers. We have an enormous demand in Australia for high tensile pipe for pipelines. We import basically all that pipe at the moment. That pipe could have been built with a little foresight in Newcastle, and the government would have been reprehensive, in my view, had it not supported that. Mr Hollis-And we also import stainless steel.",41
118,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is another case. We import a lot of stainless steel when we produce both the steel and the nickel in Australia. I believe that BHP has been very remiss in its research and development. BHP could have matched the downturn in Newcastle, if all else failed, to the growth in its Port Hedland facilities-there will be substantial growth in Hedland-but this is not to be and it will not occur. It must be understood that, in many cases, because their whole environment and their whole lives-all their assets-are involved in Newcastle, workers are not that transportable anyway. It has been said that only BHP shareholders are considered, that they are the criterion in this decision. That, I believe, is not true. The shareholders of BHP have benefited enormously from the stability provided by government. There is the security of BHP's many leases provided by the government. They have received grants from the government. The shareholders of BHP, like the company, have a responsibility to this nation and to the people of this nation. I think that governments should be bringing that strongly to their If the government developed an industry policy-and this goes as much for the previous government as it goes for this government-far more steel would have been used in the economy. There would have been a greater demand for steel and BHP would then have had far less reason to close down its operations. There is no doubt that, without a manufacturing industry policy, there will be no jobs for the future in Australia and no end to the current account deficit. We could have seen that much bigger market for the manufacturing industry guaranteeing and underwriting the jobs for the people of Newcastle. Unless we can reassert a manufacturing industry in Australia, there simply are going to be no jobs. What I want for the future of my kids is a high wage, high skill, high education country, and we are going backwards in all those factors. This is something that governments, today and past, have to accept responsibility for. But so does BHP. BHP has had enormous benefits from its position in Australia. It is highly regarded as the Big Australian. It is my fear that it has lost track of its responsibility-it certainly has no regard for where it came from-and I believe that the government should be jawboning it to make sure that it does recognise its responsibilities to this nation and to the people, particularly of Newcastle, who have made fortunes for the company in the past. It is simply nonsense to say that we cannot be competitive. Of course we can be competitive with the world. In many areas we are. But if in the final analysis it boils down to wages, if we all have equal technology across the world, and we are not competitive just because of wages, then we in this country must reject that. I simply do not want my kids working for Filipino or Korean wages. It is not the future I want for my kids, and nor should it be the future envisaged for the children of Australia by any government of any persuasion. I say once more: it is a case of the failure of governments, not just this government, although this government is the government today and has the responsibility now. From what the government has said so far, it seems very clear to me that the government has no intention to do anything about re-establishing a manufacturing industry. It will be very interesting to read in the budget tonight whether that is the case. I suspect we are going to see further contractions in R&D and, therefore, further lead in the saddle of manufacturing in this country.",42

121,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"In 1897 and 1898, Australians from all the colonies, except Queensland, gathered in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne to hold a constitutional convention that led Australia down the historic path to Federation. The founding fathers did so in a spirit which, despite the many divisions that existed in their respective home colonies, had at its core the belief that they were involved in the task of nation building, of shaping the form that a new Australian federation would take. It was a task they took on regardless of their personal views as to whether the Australian colonies should take the final step towards nationhood. A century later, this government has no such vision, no such spirit. It has designed a process for constitutional reform based on fear. It is a process that is designed to pull Australians apart, not one which is designed to bring them together. It is a process that will entrench division rather than promote the consensus the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims he wants. Rather than embrace and consider change in an open and constructive way, this government and, in particular, this Prime Minister have been dragged to adopting a process for constitutional reform that is and has been all about avoiding the very reform that is sought. It is a process designed to alienate Australians from both the process and the outcome. It is designed to minimise their involvement so that this government can disregard and discredit the genuine desire that Australians have to resolve this issue. It seeks to take from the hands· of ordinary Australians the decision they most want to make themselves--that is, whether we as Australians have a right to aspire to the highest office in the land, whether we want to become a republic. There is no denying that the people's convention is not the Labor Party's preferred means for achieving the republic. We believe that the best way to do this is to put the decision straight into the hands of the Australian people through an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, via a referendum. Realistically, however, the people's convention is the only option that we who unequivocally support the republic have if Australia is to make the change that we believe is both important and inevitable. That is why the Labor Party supports the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill and supports the people's convention. But our support is not unconditional. We will be seeking to make changes to this bill both here and in the Senate which will make the convention fairer, more democratic and reflective of community opinion. They are changes that the government will ignore at its peril for we will not take part in a process that is ultimately designed to destroy the very idea we strive for. If the decision Australians make whether to become a republic or not is to be judged as fair dinkum, it is critical that the process to get us there is fair dinkum too. That is where our concerns about this bill begin. You only have to look at recent political history to see why this bill is before us in its present form. What has brought it here? Why is it our last best hope? It is no secret that in 1994 the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, was in a pickle. The coalition looked like losing the next federal election, and one of the factors creating doubt in the electorate's mind was the inability of the coalition to resolve its internal squabbling over the republic. When the current Prime Minister, a renowned monarchist, inherited the leadership, the idea of a people's convention served him well as a means to neutralise the politically damaging issue the republic had become. But he did not embrace the idea of a people's convention because he wanted to embrace the discussion of constitutional reform. No, once again, it was a means of avoiding the destructive, internal party infighting and the damaging political effect of this issue both to him personally and to the coalition as a whole. As a result, the whole idea of a people's convention has been poisoned since its inception. It has been contrived in fear and timidity, not in hope and vision. Rather than a means for considered deliberation of constitutional reform, it has always been a means for the coalition to avoid making a decision on this issue. When earlier this year the Prime Minister decided to push ahead with the conventionto keep his election commitment-it was once again not because he was prepared to consider change but rather because he feared what would happen if he was seen to be resisting that change. It is fear that has motivated the government's policy on this issue from the beginning. Unlike the founding fathers a century ago, who embraced the processes of change that led the nation to Federation, this Prime Minister fears change. He refuses to lead. This bill is weak and sneaky. It reeks of the Prime Minister's fear of tackling the republic head-on. This is nowhere more evident than in the Prime Minister's second reading speech. In a speech where he could have outlined his clear vision for Australia's future, our destiny, our place in the world, what did he do? What does he always do when the issue is big? He equivocated. Only in two paragraphs of his speech-the first and the last-did he describe the nature of the choice to be put before the people's convention and, even then, only in a formal way. He devoted three paragraphs to discuss the reluctance of both him and his government to change our constitutional framework. In the remaining 18 paragraphs-yes, 18 paragraphs; 78 per cent of his speech for the statisticians amongst you-he described in mind-numbing detail such amazing relevancies as whether the ballot papers would be bar-coded, the size of the ballot paper and whether appeal processes under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 would apply. This is the extent of the leadership and vision of our Prime Minister. No-one expected the Gettysburg Address, least of all from this Prime Minister, but the Australian people both expected and deserved something better than this. This lack of leadership and vision manifests itself in every clause of this bill. The whole thing is designed to leave the government with a way out-regardless of the result of the ballot to elect delegates to the convention, regardless of the result of the convention's deliberations, regardless of the will of the Australian people. How? Firstly, because the bill is undemocratic. It is a dangerous experiment in voluntary voting which seeks to disempower millions of ordinary Australians by ensuring that as few of them as possible express their view on this important issue. Secondly, because the government sought to defy convention. It has sought to rig the appointed delegates to the convention, especially the parliamentary delegates, to favour the coalition. In doing so, it seeks to prevent consensus-the test the Prime Minister himself has laid down for determining the convention's success. Finally, because the government has failed to set up a framework through which the convention can undertake its deliberation on the issue of the republic. The Labor Party could just walk away from this weak and sneaky bill. We could throw up our hands and forget all about our desire to see Australia become a republic. But we cannot. This ideal is too important to us and to all those who believe in the republic. Accordingly, we will move to amend this bill to make it both workable and fair. We will give the Australian people every opportunity to send a loud and clear message to the Prime Minister that, if he is not going to lead on this issue, then he should get out of their way. We will do this by moving amendments that empower ordinary Australians. That will help them to express their opinion on this issue. That will make the process fair. We will treat this convention with the seriousness that it deserves. As for the voluntary postal ballot, the first indication of the government's contempt for the Australian people over this issue is its decision to have a voluntary postal ballot to elect delegates to the convention. If a voluntary postal ballot is held, it will be the first time a Commonwealth election, plebiscite or referendum will have been determined by this means. The government claims to support this approach because of the cost. The government is currently arguing that a voluntary postal ballot will cost approximately $40 million, compared with $49 million for a compulsory attendance ballot. This cost differential is still the subject of considerable dispute, with the final cost of a compulsory attendance ballot likely to be considerably less than the amount claimed and the cost of a voluntary voting ballot likely to be considerably more. In any case, the cost of democracy has never been an issue and should not be one now. The government has also argued that Australians should not be compelled to vote at a ballot for a convention that is not binding. Yet the convention will be binding to the extent that its recommendations will form the model of the republic that will ultimately be put to the people at a referendum. Furthermore, voluntary postal voting sits uncomfortably with the Prime Minister's commitment to consult all Australians at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. How can we truly describe this as the people's convention unless all Australians have participated in the process? Under a voluntary postal ballot not all Australians will. The Australian Electoral Commission has admitted that up to two million Australians change their address each year. Since this ballot will be held 18 months from the last federal election, up to three million people may not receive a ballot paper simply because they have not notified the commission of their change of address. Further, material about the ballot will only be available in writing and in English. This is likely to disenfranchise many of those Australians who are blind, the frail aged, the illiterate or those whose English language skills are not of a sufficiently high standard. 'For all of us' has become 'for some of us'white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. Most of these persons are currently assisted through their attendance at polling booths or the use of mobile polling booths. A postal ballot will also not be distributed to approximately 200,000 Australians who are likely to be overseas at the time of the ballot. Many of those Australians would otherwise vote at an overseas polling booth. A voluntary vote is also likely to be used by those within the government, such as Senator Minchin, to support their ultimate desire to see voluntary voting introduced at federal elections. Recent opinion polls show that 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory voting. The history of voluntary voting postal ballots in this country, which have only been used for local council and trade union elections, is not good. Recent experience in both Victoria and South Australia is testament to that. At best, the experience of voluntary postal ballots shows that only 60 to 70 per cent of Australians are likely to vote. The more usual figure is a 30 to 40 per cent turnout. This will be used by some to discredit any message sent by the electorate through its preference for pro-republican or monarchist candidates. For example, if the opinion polls are right and 60 per cent of those 60 per cent of Australians who do vote, vote for prorepublican candidates, then the monarchists will be able to claim, as I predict they will, that only 36 per cent of the total Australian population supports the republic. On this basis, they will go on to adduce that there is no clear consensus in favour of a republic. An example of this behaviour has already been demonstrated by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), a monarchist, who stated in the most recent addition of the Adelaide Review: Even if republican candidates win two-thirds of the vote in the election for delegates . . . that still leaves the Convention 'do you want a Republic?' vote at about 88 to 64 which is hardly a consensus or even a particularly overwhelming majority for change. In a government that is willing to claim a consensus in the Senate for major changes that affect the lives of citizens every day on the back of one vote, such a view of consensus rings very hollow. However, the very dynamic of a voluntary ballot is flawed. It encourages political opponents to spend time drumming up support amongst their own supporters rather than amongst the general community-particularly those who are yet to make up their minds. If the Prime Minister is serious about building a consensus across the Australian people either for or against the republic, then it is these middle of the road swinging voters who must be convinced to vote one way or the other. It is this very dynamic that is at work in our compulsory parliamentary elections. It is what determines who wins and loses government. If it is good enough to decide such transitory yet important issues as that, then why does the government not believe that a decision about the future of our constitutional arrangements is just as important? The simple reason is that they do not. From the first day the republic became an important issue in Australian politics, the coalition and this Prime Minister have sought to deny its importance, to pretend it is not there. But just like certain other issues of moment, it just will not go away. Until this government and this Prime Minister are willing to show leadership on this issue, they will be plagued by their inability to express a vision of our future which is consonant with the desires of the Australian people. Undoubtedly, some opposite will claim that the only reason the Labor Party opposes voluntary voting is our fear of the practical political consequences. In this case, that is simply not true. The opinion polls on the republic have consistently shown that if a voluntary ballot were to be held more republicans would vote and therefore more republicans would win than if a compulsory attendance ballot were held. Our position is, as it has always been, principled-and it is a position that is in accord with the wishes of the Australian people. Accordingly, the Labor Party will be moving amendments to this bill both here and in the Senate to require the holding of a compulsory attendance ballot. I now tum to the voting system adopted by the government for the ballot. The government has adopted a Senate style voting system which will have both above and below the line voting. However, in a number of respects, the ballot paper will be quite different from that which is ordinarily used at Senate elections. For example, group candidates will only be represented on the ballot paper by the name of the first candidate in the group and a short name requested by the group. The names of the remainder of the candidates within that group will not appear on the ballot paper at all. Instead, voters will have to refer to an accompanying booklet and their names crossreferenced to a number on the ballot paper that will have to be numbered if a voter wishes to vote below the line. Admittedly, based on past experience in the Senate, 95 per cent of Australians will not choose to vote below the line. However, to feather the democratic right of ordinary Australians through this mechanism is just ridiculous. In its second submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill, the Australian Electoral Commission tried to argue that this method of voting should not prove too difficult for too many Australians. They said of the process: This process is in fact quite similar to that across Australia every week, without difficulty, by thousands of punters, who use a form guide to determine the number of the horses etc. on which they want to bet, and who thereafter transcribe those numbers onto betting slips. Whilst I would not want to deny the seriousness with which many Australians place their bets, the suggestion that an election for a convention to discuss serious constitutional issues should be likened to a bet on the Dapto dogs is insulting. It also ignores the very real difficulty that many thousands of ordinary Australians have when they go down to the TAB for their one big bet of the year on Melbourne Cup day. Changes such as those described above have been introduced only to confuse voters and to make it more difficult for them to properly record their preferences for candidates either at this election of delegates for the people's convention or the next time they vote for the Senate. To ensure that as many Australians as possible vote in the manner they choose, we should be adopting the voting system with which Australians are most familiar. The Senate ballot system provides the perfect model. The government will no doubt argue that a Senate style ballot paper is more expensive. Well, I hate to tell the government this, but democracy costs money. If you want Australians to cast the best, most informed vote they can, then you should adopt the system that we are all most familiar with. Anything less is only likely to lead to confusion and uncertainty in the minds of voters. Some voters will give up in frustration and others will cast ballots that do not have the effect they intend. In both cases the democratic will of the people is undermined and that, surely, is in no-one's interest--or is it? It is because we want every Australian's vote to count-no matter whom they vote for-that the Labor Party will move amendments to regularise the voting system to accord with that used for the Senate. In relation to appointed delegates, the bill does not deal with the appointment of delegates to the people's convention. Despite the fact that they will make up half the convention and thus will be highly influential in its pursued deliberations, we only have the Prime Minister's word that appointments will occur in the manner which he described in his second reading speech. If Australians are going to put their decision about the form a republic should take into the hands of the convention, then they are entitled to know who will be appointed to the convention and that those appointed will be fairly chosen. The government has announced that there will be 76 appointed delegates to the convention, 40 of whom will be drawn from parliamentary representatives, and the remaining 36 from the general community. Of the 40 parliamentary delegates, 20 will be drawn from the Commonwealth parliament, with each state sending three representatives and the territories sending one each. In the case of the federal parliament, the government has indicated that it intends to have 12 delegates drawn from the coalition, six from the Labor Party, one from the Australian Democrats and one drawn at random from amongst the Independents and minor parties. In the case of the state parliaments, the government will appoint the relevant state Premier, the relevant Leader of the Opposition and one additional person nominated by the relevant Premier. In the case of the territories, only the Chief Minister will attend. This position unduly advantages government parties and, as a result of the current political make-up of the Australian parliaments, the coalition. In total, this method will deliver 25 coalition delegates, 13 from the Labor Party and two members from minor parties or the Independents. This position breaches the precedent established in the previous constitutional convention held from 1973 to 1985 under the auspices of both the federal Labor and coalition governments. That convention saw equal representation from all parliamentary delegations of government and nongovernment members. That precedent recognised that the discussion of constitutional reform should not be beholden to the transitory fortunes of political parties. In the particular case of the ACT, I also note that the Liberal Chief Minister, Mrs Kate Carnell, has been critical of the government's failure to allow Labor's Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitecross, to be represented at the convention. Our amendments will rectify this. So why the grab for votes? Once again, it is because the coalition wants to control the agenda of the convention. It is not interested in cross-party consensus; rather, it is interested in ensuring that pro-monarchist forces within the coalition are overrepresented in comparison with support for the republic amongst the general community. Accordingly, Labor will be moving amendments to the bill to provide for fair representation at the convention as follows: from the federal parliament there will be 16 representatives, with eight to be appointed by the Prime Minister, six to be appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, one to be appointed by the Leader of the Australian Democrats and one to be drawn at random from amongst the remaining members and senators; from the state parliaments two representatives will be appointed by respective premiers and two will be appointed by the respective leaders of the opposition; and from the territory parliaments the representatives will be the respective chief ministers and leaders of the opposition. As this measure would otherwise decrease the level of community representation at the convention-and that is not the Labor Party's desire-we will also move an amendment to increase the number of appointed delegates to 80. This will ensure that there are still 36 delegates appointed from the wider community. Naturally, this will result in an increase in the number of elected delegates to ensure that half the delegates are elected and half are appointed. Accordingly, we propose that the number of elected representatives per state be divided as follows: New South Wales, 22; Victoria, 17; Queensland, 14; Western Australia, nine; South Australia, eight; Tasmania, six; Australian Capital Territory, two; and the Northern Territory, two--a total of 80. The state by state breakdown of these elected delegates has been calculated using the same formula applied by the government. However, the Labor Party is willing to negotiate with the government on the final mix. The community representatives to the convention are currently to be appointed by the government. The fact that the government failed to notify the community that they could selfnominate to be considered for appointment only confirms widespread concern that the government may stack the convention. To remove these fears, the Labor Party will be moving amendments to ensure the appointment process is handed over to a joint select committee of the parliament, made up of an equal number of government and non-government members who will approve by a two-thirds majority the persons to be appointed as community representatives to the convention. The joint select committee will also be commissioned to draw up preliminary rules and procedures for the convention, although these rules will be capable of amendment by the convention once it begins sitting. I tum to the issue of an independent chair. Labor believes that the convention process will be assisted by the appointment of independent non-voting chair. The Leader the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already back. written to the Prime Minister making this suggestion and advancing Sir Anthony Mason, former Chief Justice of the High Court, possible nominee. Sir Anthony is an outstandThis ing Australian whose long service on the bench has done enormous credit both to and to the nation. He has consistently demonMinister strated himself to be fair in his dealings all sides of politics, and his candidacy should have no problem drawing support from all sides of politics. Naturally, the appointment of the independent chair would need to be confirmed by the joint parliamentary commitp.m.)-I tee. The creation of this position is reflected in Labor's amendments to the bill. Despite its many and glaring faults, this and the convention can be salvaged. Labor's amendments will ensure that all Australians get a genuine say in the process of constitutions-the tional reform, that the convention is genuinely representative of the diverse views of our people and that it is - n in a fair and open manner. Unlike its predecessors a century this convention will reflect the great variety and diversity of the peoples of our nation. Women, young Australians, people English backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will all have the tunity to participate. The convention provides our nation with an opportunity to embrace the consideration of change and to welcome the challenge it presents. Let us stop fearing what change bring. Give us a genuine opportunity Australians from right across our country and from all walks of life to discuss both fairly and openly a change that is fundamental to our sense of national identity. Only then will Australians feel that they have a system of government that truly represents them in terms of their history, the reality of their daily lives and their vision for the future. All that we ask is that Australians be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to decide. We in the Labor Party are confident that, given the opportunity, Australians will choose to become a republic. We are prepared to offer Australians that choice, confident in our an own sense of Australia's past, present and of future. We cannot go back. We should not go This is not the 1890s; this is the 1990s. We are about to celebrate the centenary of Federation-the centenary of our nation. We as a are about to commence a new millennium. is an opportunity that is too good to be missed, too good to be sullied and too good him to be given up by a mean-spirited Prime who wallows in the past and who is with reflective of the past. He is in a position where he said that he would govern for all Australians. He should step back and allow the debate to continue. (Time expired)",44
122,Mr HOCKEY,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"North Sydney) (4.56 wish to discuss the importance to the people of Australia of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. The concept bill of a people's convention is not new to Australia. During the 1890s three conventions were held. It was at the first of these convenNational Australasian Convention in 1891-that our constitution was drafted. At the Bathurst People's Federal Convention in 1896 the draft of our constitution was reago, viewed. From 1897 to 1898 the Australasian Federal Convention was convened, and it was here that the concept for an Australian federfrom nonation was resolved. Our most recent constitutional convention opporwas held over a number of years from 1973 to 1985. This convention identified areas of the constitution requiring change and referred these areas to standing committees for investigation and report. Four recommended changes may were put to a referendum in 1977 and three for of these changes were passed. The constitutional convention in this bill is of vital importance to the future direction of Australia. This convention is the first real meeting that truly represents the men and women of Australia. It will not be a forum in which to litmus test community support for any particular political agenda. Instead, it will be a forum for Australians, elected by Australians, whose task it will be to begin the final steps in our evolution as an independent nation. Integral to this independence is the question of whether or not the British monarch should be removed as Australia's head of state. The very existence of an unelected head of state whose title is hereditary is complete anathema to the Australian concept of a fair go for everyone. Presently our Governor General may be appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. But he or she still represents the British monarch. As Professor P.H. Lane rightly points out, 'The monarch is only a shadow over a de facto republic. The Governor General is a de facto president appointed by an elected Prime Minister and answerable to this Prime Minister, almost invariably acting on his advice.' However, the inescapable fact is that our head of state remains the Queen of England and her successors, irrespective of the limited nature of her influence in Australia. This very fact, in my opinion, is an affront to the fundamental concepts of liberalism. No-one deserves the right to be my-indeed, Australia's-sovereign by virtue of birth right alone. Essentially, the concept of hereditary title is incongruous with Australian beliefs that it is possible that any Australian can one day lead this country, whatever his or her background may be. The Australian constitution of today, when all relevant High Court interpretations are taken into account, is almost unrecognisable from its first draft. However, proponents of the constitution often recite in its defence the phrase 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Apart from being a trite mantra that supports mediocrity, this seriously misrepresents the true status of our constitution. It is a piece of British legislation that is more suited to the 1890s. It is antiquated and parts of it are unworkable. Evidence of this fact can be drawn from the number of cases dealing with constitutional issues before the High Court. Since 1903, a period covering just under 100 years, there have been 1,019 cases before the court dealing with an interpretation of the constitution. Contrast this with the fact that since 1790, which is a period of some 200 years, there have been 853 cases where constitutional matters have been considered before the US Supreme Court and, unlike that court, our High Court cases are not decisions related to what could be called the 'teething years' in the history of the constitution. In fact, the High Court is still required to gauge the intent of our founding fathers on matters of fundamental national importance such as taxation and external affairs. The number of cases heard in the High Court dealing with constitutional issues serves to illustrate the fact that our constitution is not a living document. This is supported by the fact that the High Court has had to introduce a broad construction of the constitution in order to make it applicable to changes that have concerned Australia. Ultimately, the judges of the High Court have sought to expand constitutional powers by simply divining the intent of our founding fathers. These are the same founding fathers who, when drafting the constitution, would have had no concept of international human rights, Aboriginal reconciliation, ecologically sustainable development and other issues, including the importance of telecommunications for the future of Australia. It is fair to say that the Statute of Westminster 1931 and the Australia Act 1986 have transformed the constitutional relationship between Britain and Australia. This severing of legal ties with Britain not only gave Australia the impetus to seek a new sphere of influence in Asia but also paved the way for a divergence between Australian and British laws. Under British law, our head of state in Australia cannot succeed if he or she is any religion other than Protestant. In addition, males enjoy succession in preference to females. Both of these concepts are at odds with the Australian laws protecting equal opportunity and ironically section 116 of the constitution, which states: ... no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office ... under the Commonwealth. More importantly, they are at odds with the spirit, diversity and fundamental beliefs of the Australian people. Some might argue that it is merely a matter of modernising the constitution to reflect the changes that have taken place in Australia since its inception rather than changing our head of state. But to effect this revamp would be tantamount to a rewrite. Indeed, to use the constitution as it stands today as the basis for a minimalist republican constitution would require over 70 changes. One area where constitutional change may be required is in relation to the reserve powers. The reserve powers held by the Governor General are uncodified and therefore discretionary, and convention dictates that they should be exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister. However, the potential exists for these powers to be exercised contrary to this advice, as occurred in 1975. A number of republican constitutions, such as that of the Irish Free State in 1922, have codified the reserve powers. It is therefore preposterous to argue that keeping these reserve powers unwritten and subject to only the dictates of convention will ensure that the constitution remains fluid. These unwritten laws are too rarely used to support this argument. Perhaps the most cogent argument for ensuring that these laws are written down is that it then becomes possible for judicial review of actions to take place. There are usually four arguments propounded in support of reserve powers, each as insupportable as the next. Firstly, it is argued that reserve powers are required to deal with a government which acts illegally. Apart from the existing judicial review procedures, a republican head could be given the authority to deal with such a government should the illegality go too far and, should the republican head act illegally, he or she could be impeached according to a written code. Secondly, the situation might arise where no party has the majority in the House of Representatives, resulting in a voting deadlock. There are obviously only two ways to deal with this situation; namely, political accommodation, where a matter is resolved through negotiation or mediation to remove the deadlock or, failing this, by dissolving the parliament and calling a general election. Thirdly, parliament may be acting unconstitutionally. In Ireland, if the President is convinced that a bill is unconstitutional, after consultation with the Council of State the bill can be sent to the Supreme Court for a constitutional test. If the court decides that the bill is constitutional, the President can sign it. This procedure could in fact make extensive and costly constitutional litigation in our own High Court a thing of the past. Fourthly, what constitutional options are available when the Senate is blocking supply? The founding fathers did anticipate a situation where a contradiction might exist between the Senate and the House of Representatives and allowed for a joint sitting of the parliament. Only once, in 1975, has the opposition used its majority in the Senate to force a government out of office. We have seen many instances where the opposition parties control the Senate, but there has never been the corresponding demand for a role in government formation. The solution lies in an amendment to the constitution to say that the government must have the confidence of the House of Representatives and that the Senate must not use its power to overthrow the government by blocking supply required for, in the words of Alan J. Ward, 'the ordinary annual services of government'. With the exception of Italy, this standard is the minimum standard recognised in every bicameral parliamentary system in the Western world. I find it patronising and a little insulting to think that lurking in the shadows and corridors of parliament are these unqualified, unwritten powers which can be swung into action by a person elected by noone to reprimand the popularly elected Australian representatives. A further argument used against constitutional change is that it will lead to political instability. Our current head of state is not the source of our nation's political stability. This stability is derived from the inherent political culture of our nation, and this is a culture which has embraced the tenets of modem liberalism, specifically the recognition of the inalienable rights of the individual, a belief in parliamentary democracy, a commitment to improve our society through reform, and the equality of opportunity for all our citizens. It has often been said that a republic in Australia is inevitable. This may be so, but a republic will not come on its own. It requires impetus and it requires discussion in every quarter of our land. This bill before the House today is the first step in deciding whether or not Australia should become a republic. The constitutional convention itself will be an important opportunity for reaching broad agreement on suitable changes to the Australian constitution which may be acceptable to the Australian people at a subsequent referendum. Opposition to the constitutional convention has centred on its supposed superfluous nature. Critics have demanded a plebiscite on the singular issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic. This simple approach perhaps overlooks the inherent scepticism of Australians to wholesale change, as evidenced by the reluctance of the Australian people to permit change to the constitution. In fact only eight from 42 proposals for reform of the constitution have been accepted by Australians since 1901. The make-up of the convention is also relevant. Half of the delegates will be appointed and half of the delegates will be elected and 10 per cent of the convention will be made up of young Australians aged between 18 and 25. These citizens will assist in the drafting of questions to be put to the Australian people, hopefully in a later referendum. This convention will serve to promote discussion in the community about the future constitutional direction of our nation. Half of the delegates will be chosen as representatives from the varied make-up of the Australian community. The other half will be appointed by the government and will include parliamentarians, community leaders and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Voting of course is not compulsory in this election. However, interest in a republic is already aroused and the convention will open up the discussion in the wider community and will lead ultimately to the question of whether Australia does or does not become a republic. Prior to the first conventions at the end of the last century which led to our Federation, Sir Henry Parkes had great difficulty in encouraging the states to come to the table and to talk about the future. The states were preoccupied with dealing with the Great Depression of the 1890s. It was only as the effects of the depression began to wane that the states decided to tum their attention to a possible federation. One hundred years laterand ironically the circumstances are not so different-the issue of a republic is at the forefront of constitutional debate across the country-in parliaments, in the media and in the homes of many Australians. We therefore once again have the opportunity as a nation to shape our constitutional future. This issue is not about attacking existing structures. Our current system of government essentially works well. This is more about changing the symbols of our nation. An Australian republic should not be construed as an attack on Her Majesty the Queen. In fact I think there is great merit in her retaining the title of Queen of Australia for the rest of her life only, notwithstanding that Australia may have become a republic. This debate is about changing our current head of state from a respected person who is the ruling monarch of a distant land to an Australian-one of us, a leader from our own land.",50
123,Mrs CROSIO,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"This debate is not about whether or not Australia should become a republic. It is not about whether or not we should have as our head of state a member of the British royal family. It is not even about whether or not the current arrangements we have in place in regard to our head of state are suitable to this nation's needs as a modem, outgoing, industrialised Western nation. It is none of these things. Today's debate is about brass tacks. It is about the mechanics of how best we go about deciding for ourselves once and for all whether or not we want to become a republic. It is not a question of why; on the contrary, it is one of how. The difference between the main parties on this question is clear and has been for some time. Labor's plan, as unveiled by the former Prime Minister, was to offer the people of Australia a direct choice on the matter, right at the beginning of the whole decision making process. A national plebiscite was to be held which asked one question, 'Do you want an Australian head of state?' If the answer came back with a majority yes vote, then the number of proposals for adjusting the constitution would then be discussed, decided upon and then put to the people in a referendum as a final step towards becoming a republicvery simple. The coalition's plan, which we have now seen unfold over the last year and a half, is a decidedly more complex, more cumbersome and less democratic arrangement. It is an arrangement-conceived out of political desperation, born of political opportunismwhich is seriously and fundamentally flawed. The people's convention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was dreamt up by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) when he was opposition leader in an attempt to bridge the deep divisions which exist in the coalition over the republic. Their plan was never designed solely for providing Australians with the most coherent framework possible to begin the decision making process surrounding the republic. For the current leader of the coalition, the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, the people's convention holds other attractions, more personal attractions. He sees it as an opportunity to embroil the whole issue in political controversy and animosity. He hopes that, if it degenerates into a political squabble, the convention will give the appearance of division in the community on the republic and create among ordinary Australians a level of distaste for the whole debate. For the Prime Minister, such distaste and frustration is just one step away from a vote rejecting a republic in any future referendum; yet flawed as the plan may be, devious as it may be, it is what we are left with at this moment. Although we will not be standing in the way of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill, we will seek to amend it. Despite the inevitability of the bill's passage-we can all count in this House-we cannot stand and watch its serious failings pass without a fight. We will not let that happen, for one important reason. While this bill's passage may be guaranteed, the processes which it seeks to set into motion, the debate that it seeks to promote, the direction that it seeks to provide for the nation in the future are not so safely assured. There is a real danger that the failings of the convention which this bill seeks to set in place will taint-even cripple-the credibility of the entire republic decision making process. For this to happen would be a great tragedy. Australia's future identity depends on this process being as straightforward and as politically unbiased and untainted as possible. Unfortunately, this is so far not what the Australian people are getting. It is not a case of those on this side of the House simply pushing the republican barrow, crying sour grapes and complaining, 'The government has organised things to stymie the republican push.' It is a matter of arguing, 'The government has organised things so badly, so incoherently, for its own selfish reasons, that the Australian people will not be provided with the clearest and most transparent framework possible in which to debate these issues and to make up their minds.' During this whole process, the members of the coalition, including the Prime Minister, have repeatedly made the point that their people's convention carried on the same traditions of the federation conventions of the 1890s. It is a spurious argument and it needs to be exposed for that. For a start, the conventions of 1890s were made up of individuals united by a common purpose. Despite their differences of opinion and politics, they were all proponents of the one cause: Federation. The Prime Minister's convention, peppered as it will be with republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, will enjoy none of this unity of purpose. Let me quote Helen Irving, the Australian author recognised nationally for her expertise in Federation history. Ms Irving said of the conventions organised in the 1890s: One of the distinctive things about this convention which ... makes it different from the model that John Howard has in mind, is that people went there, the delegates went there, committed to the principle of Federation. They went looking for a way to bring about a nation that was based on a federal principle. Will these people participating in the Prime Minister's convention all be proponents of a republic and concerned only with the best means of achieving this aim? Of course they will not. We talk about the fathers of our constitution having the powers to compromise and agree on a set of very difficult questions. They were able to compromise because they knew that, despite their differences, they had a common goal in mind. I defy anyone to tell me that we are going to see the Lloyd Waddys and the Malcolm Turnbulls of this world jumping into bed in a spirit of compromise engendered by the convention. It just will not happen. Mr MCDougall-Ha, hal",53
124,Mrs CROSIO,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Well may the government members laugh, because they do know that it will not happen. We saw a perfect example of this last night. One had only to tune into last night's news and there we saw the launch of Alf Garland's Monarchist League ticket for the convention election. The speeches made by Brigadier Garland and his fellow candidates were full of unyielding spite and confrontation. They said the battle against the forces of republicanism would be more serious than the battle against Hitler. This is the type of people we are going to have sit around here in Canberra. Will these people arrive at the convention seeking a common path for the good of Australia? Not likely. Of course, if the Australian people had been offered a national plebiscite on an Australian head of state before any convention took place, it would be quite a different story. If the Australian people had been offered a national plebiscite on an Australian head of state and a yes vote had eventuated, those attending the convention would be doing so having been given a clear direction by the Australian people on which to base their discussions. Clearly, the Prime Minister's convention is not like the federation conventions of the previous century in this respect. It differs in other ways as well. The conventions of the 1890s carried authority. They were initiating bodies. The decisions they made, the proposals they put forward, were the final propositions to be put to the Australian people. We had no constitution then. We had no parliament federally and there was no Commonwealth. We now have a constitution. We nCN have a parliament federally. Our federal parliament is the only initiating body which covers the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister's convention cannot determine the questions to be put to the people in a referendum. Under our constitution, this is the responsibility of this parliament, so any convention held today can only exist in an advisory capacity. It provides advice to the Prime Minister, advice which he can tamper with, bend or just simply reject and throw out of hand. This is an important point and people have to be told that. The federation conventions of the 1890s were not like the Prime Minister's convention: simply an exercise in. social debate. They were so much more than that. The Prime Minister's convention is nothing more than a pale and shrivelled imitation of the original convention. He knows it and so do his government members. Seen without the initiating powers of the federation conventions, seen from the fact that its participants will not be attending united by a common goal, it begins to look alarmingly like the Prime Minister is extremely happy to spend $40 million of the taxpayers' money on 152 people arguing with each other here in the Commonwealth for 10 days. The people of Australia think it is ridiculous to the extreme. It is a well-known fact that the majority of Australians do not rank the republic as the No. 1 issue facing this country at this very moment. But it would be wrong to say that the same majority do not have a view on it. Not only do they have a view but also they are ready to express that view in the ballot box. Australians have been talking about a republic for the last 20 years and with even greater interest over the last five or six. The maJonty of them already know where they stand on the issue. Even for those who have not considered the question in any great detail, do those in favour of a convention seriously believe that the amount of debate generated by having an indicative plebiscite on an Australian head of state would not crystallise the matter for them? Australians see the people's convention not only as a gigantic waste of money but also as an unnecessary irritant. They are deeply cynical about politicians and the intellectual elite gas bagging at the best of times, but watching $40 million of their money being frittered away on a spectacle of 152 men and women banging their heads together in Old Parliament House will be for them a source of complete and utter frustration. Australians expect to be consulted on whether they want a republic and, if so, the constitutional changes required to best bring it about. But the majority of Australians also feel they have already chosen their representatives to draw up the changes to the constitution on which they are to vote, should they decide they want an Australian as their head of state, and those representatives-148 of them, here in this parliament-were decided at the last ballot. As I said, there are 148 of us-76 in the other place-and we are all very well paid for our trouble. Why do we need to spend $40 million of the Australian taxpayers' money on giving 152 people the privilege of supplanting us and this institution? This is what the Australian people are saying and I, for one, agree wholeheartedly with them. It is also a view shared by many distinguished Australians from both sides of the political divide. What did that very distinguished former Governor General Sir Zelman Cowen have to say about the issue of the people's convention? He said: I don't really understand why we want pre-federation conventions. And this: We've got books full of proposals that have come from ... constitutional conventions, constitutional commissions or the like, which have considered change to our Constitution, and those books are virtually mouldering. And what about this on the convention: I think that if you do it that way you're going to make it very difficult to make progress. And, heaven forbid, Jeff Kennett! I know we on this side of the House are not known for quoting the Premier of Victoria to support our arguments, but what did he have to say on the Prime Minister's people's convention? He said that the convention will only express the 'personal views' of those participating. He also said: They may argue they represent a greater number of people, but finally this is going to be decided by each and every one of us. A convention to me is just another committee. What else did the Premier of Victoria have to say: There's not much point calling out 400 people out of a community of 18 million, sitting them down and saying, 'Now, what do you think about it?' Of course, the Victorian Premier made this comment before the government settled on its numbers for the convention. Mr Kennett obviously credited his party colleagues with a little bit more generosity when it came to choosing how many people could participate. The fact that the Australian people are so wary of the convention is extremely concerning. The question of a republic is intrinsically about them and for them. It affects our whole identity, as we see ourselves and as the rest of the world sees us. For Australians to be so dismissive of the convention, something which the government has chosen to make a major part of the republic decision making process, is, quite frankly, to me very alanning. Professor Geoffrey Blainey, another man we on this side of the House are not known for quoting at length, made this point in relation to the people's convention: The convention has got to really have the respect of the great majority of Australians. If it's a convention that's selected on the formula that really isn't representing all ranges of Australian opinion, then the public isn't going to take too much notice of the findings of that people's convention. And, of course, it does not have the respect and it is not going to represent all ranges of Australian opinion. Half of its members are to be appointed by the government and half of them are to be elected by who knows how many Australians in a popularity contest akin to the Logie awards-to paraphrase the Leader of the Opposition. The parliamentary delegates appointed by the government may represent the parliamentary balance, but they do not represent the voting balance. Areas like the ACT have been robbed of equality of representation. The list goes on. The most populated state, which I represent-New South Wales-has lost some of their delegates. Each point is an example of how deeply flawed this whole process is. Blind Freddy-yes, even the Prime Minister-should be able to see that the people's convention is a weak and problematic alternative to the streamlined, consultative approach outlined by us, Labor, in government. So why does he persist with it? This is where we uncover the subtext of the whole sorry mess. Having the Australian people lose respect for the process is what the Prime Minister has always wanted. Granted, he has never hid his preference for a constitutional monarchy and he really has hidden his true reasons for pushing for the people's convention. The following quote reveals, I believe, how much confidence the Prime Minister has in his convention, how much he truly believes in the ideals it represents and the public debate it supposedly seeks to promote. This is what he had to say to Alex Mitchell in the Sun-Herald on 25 June 1995. Of course, his comments then were attributed to 'a very senior Liberal figure', but we all know it was Mr Howard. This is what he said about a people's convention and on the republic: We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue the party political agenda and the election agenda. With the people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party wouldn't have to say or do anything about the republic. It would effectively bury the issue for as long as we want. That is why we have this bill before the House today. This is where the Prime Minister's heart really lies. Hence the bar codes, the checks on street addresses and the signed declaration voters will have to make saying they are who they say they are. Hence the expense, the wildly circuitous route he has now embarked all of us upon. All of these are just trimmings to make Australians scratch their heads and say, 'Why the hell are we bothering?' If we had a Prime Minister who genuinely wanted to present Australians with a clear and unambiguous decision making process on the republic, he would not hobble either side of the debate. Does the Prime Minister not trust Australians to make the right decision on this matter? Does he not trust their judgment on what system is best for them? Apparently not, and anyone who reads the bill before the House now will agree with me. If he really cared about the process, he would address himself to the fact that, at best, his convention will be an expensive diversion or an irrelevance. At worse, rather than clearly presenting both sides of the debate for the people to consider, it will spew forth a lot of hot air, smoke and political point scoringdisplays which, as we know from our own experiences, the majority of Australians just cannot and will not abide. The amendments being put forward by us in opposition must be picked up if we are to make the best of a bad lot. At the very least, it may help us avoid some of the confusion and animosity which is going to develop over the people's convention. Such controversy is destined to taint the whole republic decision making process for a great many Australians and it will, by that, diminish us as a nation. The fact that, at present, the Prime Minister of this country is not only allowing this to happen but also crossing his fingers and hoping to hell it does happen is an indictment of the kind of national leader we have and, more particularly, of this bill being put foroff ward by the government before this parliament today. Again I appeal for common sense to prevail in this debate. They are sensible amendments. We have said that we do not have the numbers to stop the bill, but more importantly at least consider the process in which this country must go about deciding on a republic. We must have proper debate, but more importantly it must be done after proper consultation with the people. To say that this postal vote really is going to go to all of the people, their own evidence tells them, through their estimates committees in the Senate, that some two million people move addresses between each election. It has even been estimated that nearly three million people have moved over the last 16 months and that all could be denied the right of even a postal vote because the Electoral Commission does not have the expertise or the wherewithal to have that right vote go to that right person. How can anyone tell me that, when they receive that vote in the mail, which is supposed to be a secret ballot, they are not going to sit down and talk? What are we going to do about those who cannot understand enough English? Are we going to deny them the right of a say in the future of this country? I think the amendments must get up for these reasons. (Time expired).",55
125,Mr TONY SMITH,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The contributions that have been made so far in this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill really highlight the division that exists across all political daries on the wider issue of a republic. I do not approach this bill with any great enthusiasm, I must concede. I do not think that what Russell Ward described in his book as the Australian legend will come to fruition with the vehicle of this sort of legislation. If anything, in the 20 years since I read that book, Australia has moved away from the notion of an Australian legend more than it has at any other time in its history. As I noted in my maiden speech, the Americanisation of our culture concerns me. If the movement to a republic, which is being championed by a number of people who firmly believe that it will assist Australia to grow up, will assist in the process of the Australianisation of our culture, rather than Americanisation of our culture, then I would be firmly in favour of it. However, I really do not see that happening. Perhaps I am a cynic. It seems that, more than ever, the movement right throughout our culture-through sport, attitude, political correctness-is all a product of Americanisation. Unfortunately, it has permeated so much of our Australian way of life. The prospect that becoming a republic will somehow or other be the be-all and endall of Australia's growth as a nation is somewhat naive, if I can say so with respect to those who hold that view. I believe somewhat cynically-perhaps it might be said cynically anyway-that this sort of money ought best be spent on our foreign aid budget than on a process such as this. Having said that, I understand that an election commitment was made and this is a realisation of that commitment. But I am sure that the people in the Hom of Africa, the Aboriginal communities in our society and other places might well scratch their heads if we sat down and explained this to them. The main purpose of the bill is to establish the process for the election of 76 delegates to the constitutional convention in December of this year. The salient features of that election process are that it is voluntary, of a Senate style and conducted by secret postal ballot. Of course, the legislation does not deal with the agenda for the convention. Just what is going boun- to happen at the convention has obviously excited quite a bit of debate. The legislation does not deal with that, of course, but with the delegate election process only. It is clear, however, that the key questions for examination by the convention are should Australia become a republic and, if so, which republican model should be put to the electorate? Before commenting on the republican side of it a little bit more widely than I already have, I should make a couple of comments. The election process would cost about $35.6 million. That is the estimate made by the Electoral Commission, but approximately $40 million might be a more realistic assessment, as was mentioned by the previous speaker. However, an attendance ballot would cost at an least $55 million. So I suppose the financial impact of the postal ballot can be defended on that basis alone. Of course, voting for the delegates is not compulsory. This is entirely appropriate, in my view, in the circumstances because the convention will not have decision making powers. It is perhaps interesting to note that what may well be a reasonable barometer of public interest in the republic debate will be the voter turnout itself. I will be very interested to see what sort of voter turnout will emerge on that aspect. In the election campaign and since I think that, of the thousands of people I have spoken to and communicated with, I have had only two people in my electorate speak to me about Australia becoming a republic. Likewise, I suspect that members in similar electorates to mine may well have had a response of that nature. I say that with due respect to my colleague and friend the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), who sits beside me and takes a different view of the matter. The degree of support and interest in his electorate is of a larger magnitude. The government is committed to unity and not division. So, if there is to be constitutional change, it must be achieved through a process that unites rather than a process that divides the community. The constitutional convention process is a high form of community consultation, and it will facilitate the ventilation of a disparate array of views. That is quite clear, as has already been mentioned and as already appears in some of the statements of honourable members who have spoken. There will be differences of opinion, but that does not mean that ultimately there will be division arising out of it. Far better that the wide range of opinions that I am sure will emerge at the convention are ventilated and aired in the community. Of course, 106 years ago the first National Australasian Convention met in Sydney. That was on 2 March 1891. The purpose of that convention was 'to consider and report upon an adequate scheme for a federal constitution'. There were seven delegates from each Australian colony and three from New Zealand, although the New Zealanders were bystanders. They never took federation with the Australian colonies seriously. The 1891 convention was the brainchild of Sir Henry Parkes, an English immigrant, whom Alfred Deakin was to describe as 'a large-brained self-educated Titan'. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you will appreciate, as I do, that good things sometimes come in large sizes. At the commencement of the convention, Sir Henry Parkes put to the delegates a number of resolutions relating to the proposed federation of the colonies but qualified his submission thus-and it is an important quote which I will extract in to to: I do not submit them as I submit a resolution embodying some principle upon which I have strong convictions in the Parliament of this country; but I submit them as a groundwork on which a debate may be raised on the whole question with which we have to deal, and I submit them with the expectation that they will be freely and unfearingly discussed, amended, negatived, dealt with in whatever way the Convention pleases. That is an important principle, in my view, when considering how this convention should proceed. If the repUblican issue is freely and unfearingly discussed, amended, negatived and dealt with in whatever way the delegates to the 1997 convention choose, it will be ultimately a process that many would consider worthwhile. There will be differences of opinion, naturally, but it is the spirit in which one enters into that sort of convention which is important. However, as I said earlier, my main reservation in the republican debate is whether it will lead ultimately to an Australia which is merely a mirror image of the USA. As I said in my maiden speech-and I repeat-I do not favour Australia becoming the 51 st state of the Union, nor do I want a US style republic for Australia. Australia will remain a constitutional monarchy, if the people of Australia so determine. An Australian republic is not a fait accompli. It is also important to remember the magnificent contribution--during almost all of my life-of Queen Elizabeth II, a person whom I hold in enormous esteem. It is nothing to the point to say that she is an English monarch who has occupied that seat by virtue of the hereditary monarchy. We are talking about a person who has brought great credit to an enormously difficult office. Throughout her lengthy reign, she has given us a quiet stability. She has not been undermined by the gutter press and has maintained her dignity throughout. She has been a benign, apolitical influence. If Australia is to be a republic, we need a president who displays these same qualities. Can we expect to get that from an elected individual? Are we more likely to get it from someone like Queen Elizabeth II? We know we have got it from her; it is clear. When I look at appointees to represent herparticularly those that have emerged in recent times-I question sometimes whether those appointees are the sorts of people who bring the unity that is needed to this country. It is very important for the appointed head of state to be apolitical and not to embark upon areas which will bring the Australian community into some form of division. That is why he or she-presently he-has to be so careful to behave in that office in a way that will not bring the office into disrepute. It is the same in relation to people like judges as well. But that is another issue. It is so important, in my view, to be totally divorced from politics. I would hate to see a situation where a third arm of government emerged with a president running around the countryside issuing statements on various matters, unfortunately in conflict with--or seen to be in conflict with-the government of the day and causing division in the community. It is important that he does not do that because, ultimately, and I suppose in the case of the present system-my honourable friend from North Sydney touched on thisthe Governor General may have a role in exercising the reserve powers. It has been said by others, not only in this debate but in other places, that those powers should be codified. As someone who lived through the 1975 situation, I tremble at the thought of codification of the reserve powers. In my view, in that very delicate situation at that time, the Governor General acted quite appropriately. He was put in an intolerable situation by the government of the day and he was made to make a decision. Indeed, I argued at the time that the then Prime Minister deliberately put the Governor General in that position because the Prime Minister knew that he could not win an election unless he got a sympathy vote of some sort. The Prime Minister knew that his course of action would lead to his dismissal. Those who lived through it will remember the enormous tide of support that rose for Gough during that period. On its face, it seemed overwhelming initially. The Governor General at that time gave the people of Australia an opportunity to decide the issue. When people came to vote, we saw the result. So I have grave reservations about codification of reserve powers. This is a very complicated subject and one that probably does not really touch upon the debate in hand. I do not really wish to trespass into those areas except to say that I do have grave doubts about codification. I also wonder about this question of remoteness. I do not want to sound like an apologist for the monarchy. I want to be persuaded that there is something better than we have got-it is as simple as that-and that it will foster an Australian image, the development of an Australian identity. I remain unconvinced at the moment, but I am open to change on the issue. I really wonder, when one talks about the remoteness of the Crown, what has happened to the process in this country over the last 20 years in particular. I presume governments have decided not to have the Queen come here to visit. Once upon a time the Queen came here and opened the parliament regularly. She came to open various buildings and those sorts of things. That inspired interest in the monarchy and it inspired the monarch to be closer to the people than she seems to be at the moment. But we do not have that now. Is that part of the process? It is something that has happened over time. We have said that she is remote, but she is made to be remote by the government of the day. Canberra politicians are said to be remote from the community because they are down here. Public servants in Canberra are claimed to be remote because they are not out there in the community. It is getting out there in the community that brings it all together. John Howard, the Prime Minister, is going to travel soon to parts of Australia to discuss certain matters about native title-to explain things, to not look to be remote, to try to ensure that the consultative process is Australia-wide and to involve people in that-yet we say that the Crown is remote because she is sitting in England. But we do not bring her out here any more. It is an odd sort of thing. If we have her, why don't we bring her out here? If we do not want her, of course we do not have to have her. But why don't we recognise that, as Queen of Australia, she should be part of such significant events as the Olympic Games opening and the opening of parliament? But we do not want to do that for some reason. We had the President of the United States walk in here, though, and give a speech to the parliament. Why not the Queen of Australia? At the end of the day I quote Sir Daryl Dawson, who recently retired from the High Court. He said: Our Commonwealth was not born of rebellion, war or foreign threat. It was born of the labours of those who had the inspiration to see what the future might hold and the determination to press it. I believe and sincerely hope that the delegates to the convention are moved by wisdom and vision. People will be put up for election who may not necessarily have the same vision I have or the next person has. Let us hope that the convention will have sufficient representation and that people of goodwill, representing a wide variety of views across greater. the country, will be brought together. very fact of bringing them together and ventilating all those views will achieve somefirst thing.

Bill presented by Mr Costello, and first time. Second Reading",61
127,Mr COSTELLO,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In last year's Budget, delivered less than nine months ago, this Government laid out a plan to tum around Australia's finances and secure our future. Our country had been on a losing strategy-a path of deficit and debt to the next century. So we took that problem-not one of our making-we faced it and we determined to fix it. You can't fix years of neglect overnight. But our Government laid out its strategy and got on with the job. Tonight I can report we have made very significant progress. And tonight I announce measures to consolidate and extend that progress, measures which can secure our objective to put the Commoncivil wealth budget into surplus in this our first term of Government. Our consolidated meastowards ures turned around a $10.3 billion Labor deficit and layout a path to a $1.6 billion Coalition surplus over three years. Whilst the former Government was running up deficit and debt our prospects were getting that bleaker. Our future choices were getting narrower and harder. But paying our way, and then reducing our debt, means our prospects are getting brighter and our opportunities The In the forthcoming year the Commonwealth has no borrowing requirement. In fact for the time in nearly a decade, this year the Commonwealth will not run up debt. In the coming financial year we will repay it. We will repay over $5 billion of Keating Labor debt. The Government's one third Telstra privatisa7.30 p.m. tion is not being done to balance the books. from establishing the Natural Heritage Trust that money is going to retire debt. That money will free future Australians from debt the debt servicing costs that threatened to From the time we came to office to the year read a 2000-01 the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will have on current forecasts. Mr Speaker, for the second time in a row, I announce that this will be done with no in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rate, no lift in the petrol excise. In fact, for the second Budget in a row, tonight I will announce tax reductions. The Government's programme of budget repair is being accomplished on the expenditure side. From our coming to office to the tum of the decade, underlying outlays are projected to fall from 27 per cent of GDP to just under 23 per cent. This year's Budget papers provide unprecedented information on our fiscal strategy and economic outlook. It is the first Budget to be prepared in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. When enacted, that Charter will require all future governments to match the standards of integrity in financial reporting that we are setting today. The specific measures I am announcing tonight are directed to: helping families; boosting small business; creating jobs; and encouraging saving. NA Mr Speaker, increasing savings will bring important economic benefits for Australia. It will reduce our reliance on foreign debt. With more saving we can finance more of our investment to grow the economy faster and produce jobs. Higher savings will raise the speed limits to growth that have held us back over the past decade. I have outlined the way in which the Government will move from borrowing to saving in the first term of the Howard Government. And now is the time to encourage individuals to save as well. Tonight I announce the Government's plan to reduce the tax on saving. Every Australian will be eligible for a 15 per cent tax rebate on their savings. The measure will be introduced in two stages with a 7.5 per cent rebate from 1 July 1998 and the full rebate from 1 July 1999. The rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings however derived. For example, the rebate would apply to the whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at 5 per cent. Alternatively, the rebate can be claimed in respect of any payment of personal contributions into superannuation up to $3,000. A person who pays $3,000 into superannuation will get a $450 tax rebate. The 15 per cent rebate applies to the marginal tax rate. For a person on the 20 per cent tax rate it will mean the income they put into superannuation is taxed at just 5 per cent. Mr Speaker, the savings rebate will benefit around 6 million taxpayers. The bulk of the benefit will flow to individuals with taxable income under $40,000. It will benefit current savers and encourage new savings. It is a significant encouragement to save in the form of superannuation, but it also provides assistance for individuals who are saving for other life cycle purposes such as education, health care, housing, and retirement. The savings rebate takes the place of Labor's L-A-W tax cuts which were never paid. This brings to an end that tawdry episode. Other Labor schemes to deduct contributions from take home pay and make Government payments into superannuation couldn't have worked. And they were discriminatory-to one class of saving (superannuation)-and to one part of society (those in the workforce). The Coalition approach is universal-{)pen to all Australians and all types of saving. In particular, older Australians who have saved for their retirement are brought in from the cold. They are given the chance to take up the savings rebate. It will equally benefit individuals who have used their savings to build up a business and subsequently derive a return from that business. The savings rebate is estimated to cost $350 million in 1998-99 and $1.4 billion in 19992000. This measure will provide a saving of $1 billion against the forward estimates in that year over the cost of the previous proposals for Government superannuation payments. NA NA The Government is also announcing tonight a number of other major measures to improve the operation of our superannuation and retirement income system. These are designed to promote savings, choice, and incentive. Superannuation Preservation Arrangements Mr Speaker, the Government considers it important to ensure that savings through superannuation are directed to their intended purpose-providing income in retirement. It is for this reason that superannuation is given concessional tax treatment. We have therefore decided to introduce a number of improvements to the preservation arrangements. The preservation rules will be amended from 1 July 1999 to ensure that all future superannuation contributions, including personal contributions, and earnings, will be preserved until preservation age, except in limited circumstances. Benefits which are unpreserved at that date will remain so. As indicated prior to the election, the Government will proceed with a phased increase in the preservation age from 55 to 60 by the year 2025. This proposal was first announced by the former Government in 1992. For someone born before July 1960 the preservation age will remain at 55 years, while for someone born after 30 June 1964 the preservation age will be 60. Increasing the preservation age to 60 will reduce the gap between the preservation age and the qualifying age for the age pension. People retiring prior to age 60 will still be able to access their benefits in the form of a non-commutable life pension or lifetime annuity. These preservation reforms will have a very positive effect on national saving and, ultimately, a positive impact on the cost of social security. Choice in Superannuation Mr Speaker, the Government is also committed to giving Australians more choice and control over their superannuation savings. From 1 July 1998, employees will be given choice as to which Fund or Retirement Savings Account their superannuation contributions are paid to. They can make their sa' :ng work !' (rdel' foc them as providers compete to enhance their performance. It will give employees the power to protect their savings by taking them out of non-performing funds. A Fair Safety Net Mr Speaker, this Government has introduced legislation to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. We are the first Government to ever do so. And tonight's budget includes this commitment as a specific budget outlay for the very first time. This underlines the Government's commitment to maintain the income of age pensioners. Deferred Pension Bonus Plan The Government has also decided to introduce a new opportunity for older Australians. From July 1998 people of Age or Service Pension age will become eligible for a pension bonus if they choose to defer their pension and continue in gainful employment for at least 25 hours per week. The Government will pay a bonus of 9.4 per cent of basic pension entitlement for each year of pension deferral, up to a maximum of five years. The bonus will be paid as a lump sum on pension take-up. A maximum bonus of $21,251 for a single person and $35,450 for a couple will be payable to those who have chosed to delay retirement for 5 years and have been granted pension at the maximum rate. The bonus will be tax exempt. NA Mr Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, the Government is turning the budget deficit to surplus while meeting high priority spending needs. It is able to do so by reordering spending priorities and targeting programmes more efficiently. Families In last year's Budget. I announced the Family Tax Initiative, which has already begun to provide significant assistance for low and middle income families. I also announced a rebate of $450 on the cost of private health insurance which will become available for families in seven weeks time on 1 July. Our commitment to families does not end there. There are many families across Australia where carers make considerable sacrifices to look after elderly relatives or children with disabilities. To further assist such families, the rate of Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit will be aligned with the Child Disability Allowance from 1 July 1998. This will increase the rate of benefit payable by over 25 per cent and will provide carers who provide home-based rather than nursing home care with an extra $16.60 per fortnight at current rates. In addition, eligibility for the Carer Payment for personal care of a severely disabled person will be extended to those caring for children under the age of 16 with profound disabilities, from 1 July 1998. A full time carer will be eligible for a payment of up to $347.80 per fortnight at current rates. From 1 July 1998, new child disability tables will be introduced to provide a more objective basis for assessing the eligibility of applicants for the Child Disability Allowance. New claimants will be assessed against these tables and a Health Care Card will be provided for children with a chronic illness who do not qualify for the Allowance on the basis of the new tables. Additional funding of $54 million over four years is to be provided under the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement for additional accommodation support for people with disabilities. The measure will allow at least 500 additional families to access personal care and accommodation support for a person with severe or profound disabilities. Rural and Regional Australia Mr Speaker, the Government strongly values the contribution made by rural and regional Australia. We recognise the exceptionally difficult time it has endured over the past decade. Rural families make great sacrifices ta send their children away for tertiary education. From 1 July access to AUSTUDY will be improved for families who have two or more children away for study. The deduction under the income test for a second and any subsequent child will be doubled to allow more families more access to AUSTUDY. In the second half of 1997, the Government will announce a comprehensive rural policy package of $200 million over four years to replace the ineffective Rural Adjustment Scheme. In addition, I announce tonight the provision of an additional $76 million over the next four years to increase our quarantine capacity and improve our quarantine service. A 'best practice' quarantine service is of critical importance to the Australian economy, particularly our rural sector, with disease incursions having potential costs of billions of dollars. Quarantine is also vital to human health and the natural environment. The Environment Mr Speaker, tonight's budget includes the $1.25 billion set aside to fund the Natural Heritage Trust over six years. The Government was opposed tooth and nail by the Opposition and minor parties in establishing this, the largest restoration programme for Australia's greatest natural asset-the environment. We have succeeded. The programme to restore our rivers, our vegetation, our land will be of special benefit to rural and regional Australia. A separate statement covering these programmes is being released by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, tonight. Making Government More Efficient Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget will deliver significant savings in the cost of delivering Government programmes. In 1998-99 savings measures amount to around $l.75 billion. The Government has recently announced the Defence Reform Programme to carry out and add to the findings of the Defence Efficiency Review. The review identified ways we can enhance our defence capability. The Government will not reduce defence expenditure; we will get better defence capability by modernisation, enhanced training and reallocation of resources. The Government has decided that its information technology infrastructure will be put out to competitive tendering, which is to be completed by the end of 1998-99. This is expected to lead to substantial annual savings of around $100 million in future years. Pharmaceutical Benefits Over the past year the Government has taken a number of steps to ensure the sustainability of the health system. Measures to combat un stainable growth in pharmaceutical benefits expenditure will be introduced in 1997-98. The practice of price premiums will be extended beyond individual brands of drugs which have identical chemical make-up to groups of medicines which have a similar clinical effect. This will build upon the generic pricing policy introduced by the previous Government in 1990. From February 1 1998, there will be a base price determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for a number of therapeutic groups containing very similar drugs. No patient need pay more. A patient who chooses a brand more expensive than the base price will pay the difference. Based on experience with pricing of alternative brands, price differences are expected to settle in a narrow range of about $2 per prescription. This measure is expected to result in savings of around $560 million over four years. The Government has also decided to delete from the Schedule a number of drugs used to treat less serious medical conditions, most of which can be obtained without a prescription, resulting in an estimated $112 million in savings over the next four years. A National Prescriber Service will be established to help doctors improve the way they prescribe medicines. Around $22 million will be provided for this service over the next four years although this measure is expected to yield savings of around $24 million over the period through better and more appropriate prescribing. Childcare The Government remains committed to the provision of assistance to low and middle income families so that they can obtain affordable child care and parents can participate in the workforce should they choose to do so. Planning benchmarks will be adopted to influence new long day child care centres to locate in the areas of greatest need, and the number of additional new private child care places which will be eligible for Childcare Assistance will be 7,000 per annum in 1998 and 1999. There will be a 20 hour per week limit on access to Childcare Assistance where parents use childcare for non-work purposes. This measure will ensure Childcare Assistance is used for its primary goal: facilitating workforce participation by parents. There will be appropriate exemptions for families in crisis situations. Without these measures, Childcare Assistance would not remain viable in the longer term. It will still remain one of the fastest growing areas of expenditure in the budget. Public Housing The Commonwealth will provide $975 million for public housing under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement in the coming year. Efficiencies in public housing reform will yield savings of $50 million per year. New Initiatives Mr Speaker, this Government will not let down those genuinely requiring income support. We will guarantee a decent safety net for those who require it. And, where possible, we will provide the opportunity for those on income support to give something back to the community. This budget funds up to 10,000 places in 70 pjlot projects to Work for the Dole. In the pilot phase, priority will be given to young people aged 18-24 years who have been unemployed for at least six months. Projects will involve two to two and a half six hour days per week. This initiative will give young unemployed people the chance to add to their experience and develop their work ethic through participation in projects which will be of lasting value to the community. Projects will be focused on regions with the highest levels of youth unemployment. There will be an emphasis on non-metropolitan areas in selecting suitable projects. The Government has allocated an additional $21 million over two years to fund these places from late this year. Federation Fund Mr Speaker, in four years time, our nation will celebrate its centenary-lOO years since federation. Naturally, it will be a time for remembering and marking our achievements. Tonight I announce the establishment of a new fund-the Federation Fund-to comprise $1 billion to fund projects of national signifiIn cance as part of the centenary activities. It will fully fund projects, augment existing funding, or contribute on a matching basis with other governments and the private sector. The projects are to be well advanced but not necessarily completed by the Centenary of Federation in 2001 and will be selected on the basis that they will generate jobs in the construction phase and make a significant and ongoing contribution to Australia and the Australian economy. There will be a geographic spread of projects around Australia. Projects will be selected by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with State and Territory Governments. The National Museum of Australia will be one of the projects. Funding will commence in 1998-99 and it is expected to conclude in 2001-2002. NA This Budget continues the Government's commitment to reducing tax compliance costs for small business. In March this year, the Prime Minister announced the Government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. That response included a number of taxation measures designed to assist small business. It built on measures to free small business from capital gains tax on rollover of assets or business. It provides a record keeping exemption available to up to half of small businesses paying fringe benefits tax. Tonight, I am pleased to announce changes to withholding tax arrangements to further reduce tax compliance costs for small business and reduce the frequency of transactions between business and the Australian Taxation Office. From 1 July 1998, businesses with an annual tax withholding obligation of $25,000 or less, under the Pay-As-You-Earn, Prescribed Payments and Reportable Payments systems, will have the option to remit these payments on a quarterly, rather than a monthly, basis. This measure will allow in excess of 300,000 small businesses the opportunity to defer the reinittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998-99. addition, and in step with commercial trends, payments by large withholders (that is, those with annual an withholding obligation in excess of $1 million) are to be made earlier and by electronic means. The revenue bring forward from this change will offset the revenue deferral costs associated with the new arrangements for small business and provide a one-off gain in 1998-99. I am announcing tonight a range of further measures to enhance tax system integrity. These are not measures to increase revenue but are designed to guard against the potential erosion of revenue in the future. For example, I am announcing measures to protect the integrity of the company tax imputation system, to deal with dividend streaming and franking credit trading. I am also announcing tonight the Government has responded to submissions from small business and will ensure legislation dealing wi th the use of trust losses does not affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group. However, it is now clear that the taxation of trusts must be considered more generally and the Government will release a discussion paper on this issue later this year setting out issues and possible ways of approaching them. The Government will monitor taxation developments as they arise and will take whatever action is appropriate to preserve the integrity of the tax system, including the option of acting before the next budget. NA Mr Speaker, this year's Budget is forecasting excellent economic prospects. Economic growth is expected to strengthen to 3% per cent in 1997-98. Underlying inflation is expected to remain low at only 2 per cent through the year to June 1998. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 8 per cent over the course of 1997-98 as employment growth accelerates. The stronger outlook for 1997-98 reflects stronger private consumption, the recovery in the housing sector and continued strong business investment. Business investment is expected to rise by around 8 per cent following exceptional growth in 1996-97. Despite the expected pick-up in activity and stronger investment, the current account deficit should increase only slightly as a share of GDP. That, in part, reflects the positive effect of the increase in public saving from Commonwealth debt reduction. Nevertheless, at around 4 per cent of GDP the current account deficit remains high, underscoring the need for the further savings outlined in this Budget. NA Mr Speaker, the Budget. I have brought down tonight takes us further down the path which :-vill build a future of opportunity for Australbill Ia. It continues and consolidates the strategy begun last year to turn around the finances of the Commonwealth. It puts in place choice and incentives. It provides consistency and certainty for business. With reform of the Australian economy, these policies will lift the pace of economic growth and create job opportunities. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned.

132,Mr SPEAKER,DETAILED INFORMATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) (a) The Committee Office restructure effected last year resulted in the following changes to the Committee Office establishment: a reduction by five in the number of committee secretaries (Senior Parliamentary Officer Grade B); an increase of one senior research officer (Senior Parliamentary Officer Grade C); a reduction of one research officer position (Parliamentary Officer Class 6); an increase by five in the number of entry level research officer positions (Parliamentary Officer Class 4); an upward reclassification of ten administrative support positions (Parliamentary Officer Class 3); and a reduction of seventeen lower level administrative support positions (Parliamentary Officer Class 2). (b) As a consequence of the restructuring, a number of Committee Office staff accepted voluntary redundancies: five officers at the Senior Parliamentary Officer Grade B level; one officer at the Parliamentary Officer Class 6 level; and six officers at the Parliamentary Officer Class 2 level. (2) The details of the classifications of the staff affected by redundancy were as follows: Committee Secretary-Senior Parliamentary Officer Grade B-salary scale as at 7 March 1996 $56,846-60,877 per annum; Research Officer-Parliamentary Officer Class 6-salary scale as at 7 March 1996 $40,61846,658 per annum; and Administrative Support Officer-Parliamentary Officer Class 2-salary scale as at 7 March 1996 $26,560-29,453 per annum. (3) Voluntary redundancy packages for Australian Public Service staff are governed by the conditions specified in the General Employment Conditions A ward 1995 and the relevant superannuation legislation. There are three major components: a range of superannuation options from a total lump sum to total pension depending on the circumstances of the individual; a severance benefit equal to two weeks salary for each completed years of service plus pro rata for completed months subject to a minimum of four weeks salary, a maximum of 48 weeks salary and a payment in lieu of notice arrangement; and payment in lieu for unused annual leave and long service leave. For reasons of privacy, details of the redundancy packages paid to individual officers cannot be released. (4) The - otal cost of the severance benefits for the twelve staff made redundant was $438,627 and the cost of the payments in lieu for unused annual leave and long service leave was $313,800.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Motorcycles: Headlamps (Question No. 220) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) Does Australian Design Rule (ADR) 19.01 require motorcycle head lamps to light automatically when the ignition is turned. (2) When will ADR 19.01 be revoked. (3) What preconditions must be fulfilled before revocation can occur. (4) Has he, his staff or an officer of his Department made a statement to the media, State governments, industry or user groups regarding the ADR since 10 March 1996: if so, in each case, (a) what statement was made, (b) who made it, (c) to whom was it made and (d) when was it made. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) See answer to (3). (3) On Monday 18 November 1996, I signed the legal determination to abolish the mandatory requirement for daytime lights for new motorcycles. (4) Yes. On 15 April 1996, my Land Transport Adviser made the following statements to motorcycle industry and user group representatives at a meeting of the Motorcycle Safety Consultative Committee (MSCC): The Minister is committed to reviewing ADR 19/01. The Government's main concerns about the Design Rule are that it affects only new bikes and that it gives riders no discretion to switch off their lights on safety grounds. The Minister would not rush into repealing an ADR that may have a road safety benefit and would therefore need to be presented with all the facts before making a final decision. An external review of the effectiveness of the Design Rule would be undertaken within the next few months. Alternatives to the Australian Design Rule would be considered. NA On September 7, after considering the results of the two evaluation studies commissioned by FORS, I issued a media statement indicating that the mandatory daytime lights requirement for new motorcycles would be abolished. I also announced that the Federal Government would work closely with motorcycle rider organisations to develop a range of policies to improve rider safety. The Motorcycle Safety Consultative Committee met on 23 September. At that meeting, FORS senior staff consulted with motorcycle industry and user group representatives about plans for implementing the removal of the daytime lights requirement. At a meeting of the Transport Agency Chief Executives' Committee held on 1 October 1996, my Department advised their State and Territory counterparts about the proposed change. On 18 November 1996, I issued a media release announcing that I had signed the necessary legal determination to end compulsory daytime lights on 1 January 1997. I also wrote to all State and Territory Ministers for Transport, and the Chairman of the National Road Transport Commission, advising them of my decision. Jandakot Airport: Training Flights (Question No. 777) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 19 September 1996: 1) How many training flights (a) were conducted from Jandakot Airport in each year since 1991 and (b) will be conducted from Jandakot for each year to 2006. 2) Are statistics maintained on the number of training flights from Jandakot involving practice in take offs and landings; if so, how many have been conducted since 1991. 3) What action has been taken or is in train to transfer training flights from Jandakot to an alternative airport. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistical data is not kept in the form requested. The following data sourced from Airservices Australia represents the closest answers which can be obtained from the available information. (a) JANDAKOT AIRPORT MOVEMENTS (Aircraft Movements) 0700 to 2000 hours daily (during Jandakot Tower hours of operation) Estimated Training Flight Movements (Based on an estimated 90% of total movements and includes circuit training operations, operations in Danger Area 193 and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) training flights arriving/departing) 1991-265,336 1992-248,733 Year 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Average annual growth rate per annum is currently forecast to be 2%. (2) Circuit Training Operations-involving practice take offs and landings (Data based on Airservices Australia estimates of circuit training operations as percentage of total movements and calculated by adding all movements on runways 06R and 24L and two-thirds of movements on runways 12 and 30 during 1995) 1991-203,424 1992-190,695 1993-211,945 1994-242,438 1995-271,663 1996-262,580 (3) The State Government has been studying options to establish a long term general aviation airport to relieve Jandakot and further serve the area north of Perth. Airservices advises that the State Government has also announced the formation of a new committee which will examine among other aviation training issues the decentralisation pilot training. Airservices Australia is also aware that a new operation has commenced east of Perth at Merridin. A significant proportion of China Southern Airlines initial training has been transferred to that location. Optus and Telstra Cabling (Question No. 793) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 8 October 1996: 1993-276,449 1994-316,224 1995-354,343 1996-342,496 Note that an aircraft movement can be either a take-off or landing. (b) The latest training flight forecasts for Jandakot Airport are: (Based on an estimated 90% of total movements and includes circuit training operations, operations in Danger Area 193 and Instrument Flight Rules (lFR) training flights arriving/departing) Movements Year Movements 349,346 2002 385,706 356,333 2003 393,420 363,460 2004 401,288 370,728 2005 409,314 378,143 2006 417,500 (l) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to widespread anxiety and concern being expressed by communities throughout Australia regarding the rollout being undertaken by both Optus and Telstra. (2) Is this a duplication of telecommunications infrastructure that is both inefficient and a waste. (3) Is it a fact that in Europe and North America cable television services are delivered predominantly by underground rather than aerial cable; if so, is the Government ignoring best practice and encouraging 21st century services to be delivered through 19th century infrastructure. (4) Will the Minister urgently review the strategy of allowing the optical fibre and coaxial cable rollouts. (5) Have municipalities around Australia called for the Prime Minister to convene a national round table discussion of the telecommunications carriers, representatives of power companies and State and local governments to develop a national program of to relocate existing overhead cables underground; if so, will the Minister support the call. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) Yes. The Government is very aware of community concerns about the environmental impact of telecommunications facilities roll out by the carriers. The Government has taken legislative action to address these concerns. (2) Network deployment decisions (what to build and when and where to build it) are matters for the commercial judgement of the carriers and their associates. Additional infrastructure investment will not occur unless there is an expectation of user demand for the additional capacity, and a commercial judgement about the need for a carrier to control its own facilities rather than simply interconnect with those of - nc-hcr carrier. It should nut be assumed that competing telecommunications facilities necessarily duplicate each other. The rapid changes in technology and customer demands that characterise the telecommunications industry provide significant incentives for carriers and service providers to continually explore new and differentiated product applications, and therefore different (but in some cases superficially similar) forms of infrastructure. Facilities based competition (under which each carrier builds its own facilities to carry at least some part of its services) has been central to the development of open telecommunications in most countries. In Australia, in the case of telephony, has delivered lower prices for consumers, greater investment in equipment and a wider range of choices of services for consumers. (3) No. I am advised by my Department that, on the basis of available information, cable television services in Europe and North America are provided by a range of technologies, including aerial and underground cabling, wireless transmission and satellite transmission. (4) Upon coming to power, the Government reviewed the rules governing the manner in which telecommunications networks are rolled out. On 1 January 1997, following the review, the Government introduced a package of measures which ensures community access to new telecommunication services are preserved. The package includes: - a tighter Telecommunications National Code; - a Land Access Code; and - legislation to subject the carriers to State and Territory planning and environment laws from 1 July 1997. The purpose of the Telecommunications National Code is to set out uniform rules for the installation and maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure. The Land Access Code establishes uniform national requirements that carriers must observe when entering land to carry out activities. It also sets ?ut the rights of land owners and occupiers in relation to such activity. The two Codes will operate from 1 January until 30 June 1997 and are subordinate instruments under - he Teleco-munications Act 1991. This legislation IS the baSIS upon which the carriers have made substantial investment commitments of many billions of dollars, in good faith, since its introduction in 1991. A new Telecommunications Bill 1996 was recently introduced into Parliament. If passed, from 1 July 1997 carriers' rollout of infrastructure will generally be subject to State and Territory planning and environment laws. Depending on what the applicable State or Territory law says, a particular telecommunications facility will need planning approval from either a State or local Government body. There will be only three limited exceptions to this rule. Under these arrangements broadband cable will not be deployed aerially without the agreement of the relevant State or local authority. (5) Yes. Mayor David Plumrldge, President of the ALGA wrote to the Prime Minister on 25 September 1996 requesting that the PM chair a 'round-table' conference of representatives from Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and the ALGA. The letter proposed that the objectives of the conference would be to seek 'commitments from Government to underground it telecommunications cables wherever possible in the short term, and to deVelop a program for the undergrounding of all aerial infrastructure in the longer term'. The Government supports a forum to examine these issues. On 3 December 1996 the Minister for Communications and the Arts announced that the Government would be convening a Working Group to consider issues 'relating to moving existing utility and communications cabling underground.' The Working Group will comprise participants from Commonwealth, Statefferritory governments, communications carriers, and peak bodies representing local government, business, consumer and utility providers. The Minister expects to be in a position to announce the composition of the Group shortly. The initial meeting of the Working Group will be scheduled as soon as practicable after that. UNESCO Convention on Technical and Vocational Education (Question No. 959) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: Have the Australian and New Zealand Governments consulted on the ratification of the 1989 UNESCO Convention on Technical and Vocational Education; if so (a) on what occasions (b) in what manner and (c) with what outcome. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No, the Australian and New Zealand Governments have not to date consulted on the ratification of the 1989 UNESCO convention on Technical and Vocational Education. 'Phoenix' Companies (Question No. 999) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to claims made on the A Current Affair television program on 8 November 1996 that only about 4% of failed or resurrected ""phoenix"" companies are investigated. (2) What criteria are used to determine whether an investigation occurs. (3) Is the size of the loss, the frequency with which they occur or reports from the receiver or liquidator taken into account. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However, I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission CASC') is not aware of the source of the statistic quoted. (2) The ASC receives thousands of complaints each year. Due to the often highly complex and costly nature of corporate investigations, it is not possible for the ASC to formally investigate all reported matters. To allocate investigative priorities, the ASC has developed guidelines for assessing complaints. Those guidelines are flexible and are formulated to allow for independent consideration and assessment of every matter drawn to the ASC's attention. Judgments are made on the basis of a comprehensive range of factors. I am advised that the ASC will generally allocate resources to investigate matters on the basis of factors including whether: the matter involves repeated contraventions, continuing misconduct or the risk of continuing misconduct; the matter involves fraud or dishonesty; substantial loss or damage has been or may be caused as a result of the contravention; there is a reasonable prospect that a term of imprisonment, fine, penalty, banning order, order for compensation or damages, or other preserving or remedial order will be granted or imposed by the court; enforcement action would be expected to change inappropriate market or corporate behaviour or have high general deterrence value; and enforcement action would clarify an issue of general importance to the interpretation or application of the Corporations Law. I am further advised that where a matter, on its merits, meets the ASC's criteria for resourcing, the ASC may decide not to pursue an investigation because of practical factors including: the age of the matter and relevant statutory time limits; a lack of admissible, substantial and reliable evidence; or the fact that other remedies or possible action is being or may be pursued by others, which provide an adequate response to the conduct. (3) The size of the losses involved and the frequency with which they occur are two of the many factors which are relevant to the ASC's decision to investigate a matter. Neither of these factors are determinative or considered in isolation. Reports from receivers and liquidators are also taken into account by the ASC in determining whether to formally investigate a matter. All reports received by the ASC are individually assessed against the criteria. Apart from prompting an investigation, adverse liquidators' reports may also lead to the disqualification of a person from managing a corporation if that person has been a director of the corporation. Seaview Airlines Inquiry: Costs (Question No. 1046)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 December 1996: (1) What was the total cost incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the appointment and conduct of the Commission of Inquiry into the Seaview Airlines disaster carried out by Mr J. Staunton. (2) In relation to the inquiry, what were the total (a) legal costs met by the Commonwealth in respect of each of the parties involved, (b) sums paid to each of the participating legal firms and (c) costs of a non-legal nature. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total cost incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the appointment and conduct of the Commission of Inquiry into the Seaview Airlines disaster carried out by Mr J. Staunton was as follows: 1994/95 Financial Year 1995/96 Financial Year 1996/97 Financial Year NA These figures include an allocation for the instructing solicitors at the Commission. The Commission of Inquiry commenced on 25 October 1994 and ceased on 30 September 1996. (2) For the inquiry, the total (a) legal costs met by the Commonwealth in respect of each of the parties involved, were: Attorney-General's Department The Attorney-General has advised as follows in respect of question on notice 1046(2) in relation to his portfolio responsibilities to provide financial assistance to persons appearing before Commissions of Inquiry: There exists a long-standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys-General, to treat applicaProfessional legal fees Disbursements NA Airservices Australia No monies were incurred by the Commonwealth in respect of representation of Airservices Australia. Civil Aviation Safety Authority No monies were incurred by the Commonwealth in respect of representation of Civil Aviation Safety Authority. (b) sums paid to each of the participating legal firms Attorney-General's Department Please see the response to question 2(a). Airservices Australia When the Commission of Inquiry was established, the Civil Aviation Authority, including the former regulatory arm, the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation, was still in existence. In July 1995, by virtue of regulation 14 of the Civil Name of Firm Coors Chambers Westgarth $2,931,977 .00 $3,812,887.62 $1,340,336.77 $8,085,201.39 tions for financial assistance in confidence. This practice extends to neither confirming nor denying that particular applications have been received and accords with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. Consequently it would not be appropriate to provide details in relation to any individual applications for assistance for legal representation before the Commission. A total amount of $4.07 million was spent in providing legal assistance for parties appearing before the Inquiry. Department of Transport and Regional Development The Department of Transport and Regional Development incurred legal costs as follows: $270,702.94 $14,979.29 $285,682.23 Aviation Legislation (Transi tional Provisions) Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1995, No. 227 of 1995), Airservices Australia then had the financial responsibility for providing legal representation with respect to the Commission of Inquiry for: (a) the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) (b) Members of the Board of CASA (c) the Director and staff of CASA (d) Former members of the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) (e) Former Chief Executive Officers and Employees of the CAA (f) Airservices Australia (Airservices) (g) Members of the Board of Airservices and (h) Chief Executive Officers and Employees of Airservices.

Seaview Airlines Inquiry: Evidence (Question No. 1047)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 December 1996: Will information and evidence gathered by the Commission of Inquiry into the Seaview Airlines disaster be available to other parties for use in civil and other proceedings; if not, why not. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commission of Inquiry was conducted under the Royal Com!llissions Act 1902 and produced a report of 980 pages detailing the information and evidence collected. The report has now been published. The Commission's records are under the control of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. They are subject to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 1983 and to normal discovery procedures as part of the litigation process. Some evidence and information collected by the Commission is subject to confidentiality orders made by the Commission. I understand that the New South Wales State Coroner, Mr Derrick Hand, who is to hold an inquest under section 22 of the Coroners Act (NSW), has been provided a copy of the information and evidence gathered by the Commission of Inquiry, as was previously agreed by the Commissioner at the beginning of the Inquiry. Austudy: Primary Producers (Question No. 1152) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) How many student children of primary producers were receiving Austudy before the Actual Means Test was implemented. (2) How many student children of primary producers are receiving Austudy following the implementation of the Actual Means Test. (3) How many (a) students in total and (b) student children of primary producers have been excluded from receiving Austudy due to the Actual Means Test. (4) What is the total sum paid to student children of primary producers receiving Austudy. (5) What sum has been saved by student children of primary producers being denied Austudy due to the Actual Means Test. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Prior to 1996 there was no requirement for Austudy applicants to state whether they were primary producers or not. This information was collected for the first time in 1996, but only in respect of new Austudy applicants applying for assistance as dependent students. The following statistics relate to this sub-set of Austudy applicants only, and cover the period 1 January to 30 November 1996. The data required to answer to this question were not collected prior to 1996 when the Actual Means Test was introduced. (2) For 1996 continuing students were not asked if their parents were primary producers. Therefore, no data are available on how many student children of primary producers received Austudy from 1995 and again in 1996. Some 4800 student children of primary producers who applied for Austudy for the first time in 1996 received Austudy. (3) In total, some 12 500 students were excluded from receiving Austudy in 1996 due to the introduction of the Actual Means Test. Of these, some 1 100 were student children of primary producers who applied for Austudy for the first time in 1996. (4) Between 1 January and 30 November 1996 Austudy assistance totalling some $13.2m was paid in respect of the 4 800 student children of primary producers (as described in the answer to (2». (5) Precise data are not available to answer this question. However, it is estimated that, but for the introduction of the Actual Means Test, the 1 100 student children of primary producers described in the answer to (3) would have been paid Austudy benefits of some $3m in 1996. Defence Reserves: Civilian Employment Protection (Question No. 1158) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) What proposals are being considered to protect the Reserve's interests during call-out and collective training which will guarantee a return to employment. (2) Is financial compensation for employers being considered; if so, what are the details. (3) What legislation is required to meet the Government's policy of protecting Reservist's civilian employment. (4) What programs are planned to encourage and facilitate greater participation and involvement of private sector employers in support of Reservists. (5) Is the Government considering the removal of tax exemptions from payments to Reservists. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) Employment protection is a major issue, with interests of Reservists, their employers, and the ADF to be taken into account. The matter also needs to be placed within the context of the Government's wider industrial relations reforms. While the Government is considering the issue of employment protection for Reservists, given the stage of these considerations, I am unable to provide the details the honourable member seeks. Any decisions on this issue will be taken after broad consultation with those concerned. (Question No. 1160) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Is he able to say whether the USA applies a (a) 21 cents per kilogram duty on imports of Australian wool finer than 32 microns, (b) 6.9 cents per kilogram duty on imports of Australian wool tops, plus 5.6%, (c) 6.9 cents per kilogram duty on imports of Australian worsted yarn, plus 8.4%, (d) 34% duty on imports of Australian worsted fabrics and (e) 47.6 cents per kilogram duty on imports of men's wool suits, plus 20.6%. (2) Is he also able to say what duties have applied to Australian woollen products imported into the USA since 1987. (3) What is the estimated lost export income caused as a consequence of USA tariffs and duties. Table 1 Article Description Greasy Wool Scoured Wool Carbonised Wool Wool Tops Combed Wool Yarn Woven fabrics of wool: - Valued < $1.26/lb - Valued> $1.26 but < I $2.00/Ib - Valued> $2.00 but < $9.00/Ib - Valued> $9.00/lb Men's Wool Suits (4) What action is he taking with respect to US duties on woollen imports. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the 1997 Harmonised Tariff Schedule of the United States, the US applies a duty of: (a) 20.4 cents per kilogram on imports of greasy wool of less than 34 micron; 22.5 cents per kilogram on scoured wool of less than 34 micron; 26.6 cents per kilogram on carbonised wool of less than 34 micron, (b) 6.6 cents per kilogram on imports of Australian wool tops, plus 5.3 %, Tariffs (c) 8.1 per cent on combed wool yarn (worsted yarn), (d) 32.8 % on woven fabrics of combed wool (worsted fabrics) containing greater than or equal to 85% wool and a duty of 34 cents per kilogram plus 34.1 % for woven fabrics of combed wool mixed mainly with man-made fibres, (e) 65.7 cents per kilogram on imports of men's wool suits plus 17 %. (2) Duties applied to the specified Australian woollen products imported into the USA from 1987 to 1997 are provided in tables 1 and 2 below. The figures in the tabIes are taken from the various editions of the Harmonised Tariff Schedule of the United States and its predecessor (1987-1989). A conversion to micron has been made. For the period 1987 through 1992, the applied tariff on greasy, scoured and carbonised wool was zero due to a temporary duty suspension. 1987-89 Rates of Duty 10 centsllb clean 11 centsllb clean 13 centsllb clean 3.5 cents/lb + 6.25% 9% 18.5 cents/lb + 54.5% 87 centsllb 24 centsllb + 38% 6 cents/lb + 33.8% 35 centsllb + 20% Table 2 Article Description Greasy Wool: > 38 micron <38 but> 36 micron < 36 but >34 micron < 34 micron Scoured Wool: > 38 micron < 38 but> 36 micron < 36 but> 34 micron < 34 micron Carbonised Wool: > 38 micron < 38 but> 36 micron < 36 but> 34 micron < than 34 micron Wool Tops Combed Wool Yarn Woven Fabrics of Combed Wool: Containing> 85% wool Mixed mainly with man-made fibres Men's Wool Suits (3) There are no recent estimates of lost export income as a consequence of USA tariffs and duties. A study on the cost of US apparel protection arrangements to Australian wool growers was conducted in 1991 by ABARE and published in the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly, Vol 3, No 1, March 1991. The study concluded that if the US eliminated its apparel protection (i.e. tariffs and quotas), the estimated net returns to Australian wool growers over twenty years could be $450 million (in 1991 dollars). There are no quotas imposed by the US on imports of Australian wool or woollen textiles and clothing. However quotas are still imposed on imports of textiles and clothing from certain deVeloping countries, many of which are among Australia's best customers for wool. These quotas reduce demand for Australian wool by reducing US textile and apparel import demand from other countries which import Australian wool. The United States is committed to phasing out import quotas on textiles and clothing products by 2004. In the implementation of these commitments, a majority of wool products are in the latter stages of the phasing out period. (4) The Government is strongly pressing its concerns over market access for wool and woollen products into the US on a number of fronts. 1997 1996 1995 1990-94 Rates of Duty Rates of Duty Rates of Duty Rates of Duty in cents/kg in cents/kg in cents/kg in cents/kg clean clean clean clean 0 0 0 5.5 0 0 0 6.6 0 0 0 22 20.4 20.9 21.4 22 0 0 0 6.6 0 0 0 8.8 0 0 0 24.3 22.5 23.1 23.7 24.3 0 0 0 8.8 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 28.7 26.6 27.3 28 28.7 6.6 + 5.3% 6.9 + 5.6% 7.3 + 5.9% 7.7 + 6.25% 8.1% 8.4% 8.7% 9% 32.8% 33.9% 35% 36.1% 34 + 34.1% 38.8 + 35.4% 43.6 + 36.7% 48.5 + 38% 65.7 + 17% 69.5 + 18% 73.4 + 19% 77.2 +20% Australia has repeatedly raised in its bilateral consultations with the United States the high tariffs facing our wool exports. Wool was identified in the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement released in February 1997 as one of the key sectoral priorities for Government efforts in the US market over the next two years and the issue will be on the agenda of the next officials consultations on agriculture planned for the second half of this year. On the multilateral front, Australia will be promoting efforts to liberalise wool tariffs in the next round of multilateral agriculture negotiations scheduled for 1999. Australia is taking a leading role in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in pressing for comprehensive negotiations on industrial tariffs, including tariffs on textiles and clothing. Once these negotiations are joined by member countries, Australia will be seeking to direct attention to the tariff and non-tariff barriers restricting the trade of woollen textiles and clothing in all countries, including the USA. Multilateral agricultural negotiations under the Uruguay Round delivered some cuts in the tariffs on both greasy and semiprocessed wool as well as on wool yarns and we are beginning to see the benefits of this. As one of the Uruguay Round outcomes, the US is cutting the tariffs on a range of woollen products including on greasy fine wool by 15 per cent, on combed wool in fragments by 52 per cent, on wool tops by 50 per cent, and on wool yarn by 33 per cent over the implementation period to the year 2000. Tariffs on wool fabric will also be reduced by an average of 18% over this period, and those on finished garments generally reduced by between 12 and 22%. Another outcome of the Uruguay Round is the phasing out by the end of 2004 of quota restrictions on textiles and clothing under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) and integration of this sector into World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. This will have an indirect benefit for Australian wool exports to developing countries, some of which are among our major customers for Australian wool. In the long term, these countries will have greater access to the US and other markets. The proposed timetable, however, discriminates against wool as the US has decided to integrate the majority of wool products in the last stage of the phasing out period. Australia will continue to urge the US to reconsider its phase-out timetable. At the December 1996 WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore, I emphasised the disadvantages faced by wool exporters due to trade restrictions on woollen textiles and clothing. I urged WTO members, including the USA, to fully implement their Uruguay Round obligations. The Ministerial Declaration of the 1996 Singapore WTO Conference highlighted the importance of woollen products for developing countriesour export customers for wool. The issue has also been raised by Australia in the context of the WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism which reviewed US trade policy in November 1996. The Government is also looking at the North American Free Agreement (NAFTA) which in 1994 established a free trade area encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico, as another opportunity for Commonwealth Funding and Student Load Institution EFTSU $('000) Central Queensland 4,190 49,287 Uni Griffith University 11,410 116,269 James Cook Univer- 5,610 64,823 sity Queensland Uni of 16,305 162,603 Tech University of 18,950 220,208 Queensland increasing indirect exports of Australian wool into the US market in the form of textiles and garments manufactured in Mexico. Bilateral trade negotiations between Australia and Mexico in 1995 resulted in Mexico eliminating its 10% tariff on scoured wool and wool tops. This development has significantly improved the prospects for increased processed wool exports to service Mexico's growing wool textile industry which under NAFT A has increasingly liberal access to the US market (for wool textiles and apparel). Following further bilateral trade talks in 1996, Mexico eliminated its 10% tariff on wool noils (wool removed during combing) and waste. These developments will mean a significant boost to Australia's wool exports to Mexico and will benefit the industry as a whole. Tertiary Institutions, Queensland: Student Places (Question No. 1166) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training upon notice, on 4 February 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 981 (Hansard, 13 December 1996, page 8128) concerning the number of full time equivalent student places, is he able to provide a comparative table of the Commonwealth funding provided for in the 1995-96 Budget and the 1996-97 Budget showing the number of full time equivalent student places for each University in Queensland from 1993 to 1998, as provided for in each of those Budgets. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following table shows the number of full time equivalent student·(EFTSU) places and Commonwealth funding provided for universities in Queensland from 1993 to 1996. 1993-1996 in Queensland Institutions. 1993 1994 1995 1996 EFTSU $('000) EFTSU $('000) EFTSU $('000) 4,725 48,299 4,985 51,343 5,470 56,822 12,730 135,718 13,310 135,752 14,105 143,278 6,275 68,497 6,525 72,017 6,910 76,760 18,065 178,728 18,670 184,302 19,430 191,557 19,370 235,233 19,680 248,967 20,195 255,483 Institution EFfSU Uni of South 5,865 Queensland Total 62,330 661,298 Notes: operating grants include Research . figures for 1993 include funding provided through 1994 capital funding has been rolled The measures announced in the 1996 Budget affected onwards.

International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Core Labour Standards (Question No. 1223) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Did fonnal or infonnal discussions occur concerning the role of the Australian Government in the ILO and the issue of core labour standards during, or as a result of, discussions at the World Trade Organisation conference in Singapore in December 1996; if so, what were those discussions. (2) Did he give fonnal or infonnal undertakings as a result of those discussions to review the role of the Australian Government in the ILO, the importance of core labour standards and the way in which those standards should be implemented; if so, what undertakings did he give.

(5) Was there correspondence between the US and Australian Governments on these issues; if so, will he provide copies. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is a follows: (1) Yes. The discussions related to maintaining strongly our position on trade and labour standards within the existing ILO resources. (2) No. (3) A continuation by our ILO delegation of existing activities in accordance with Government policy. (4) (a) In April 1996 the United States Government made representations to Australia concerning the possibility of Australia standing for re-election to the ILO Governing Body for the 1996-1999 term. However, the Government had already decided not to stand, in accordance with a policy commitment to playa more circumspect role in the ILO in order to achieve budgetary savings. The United States has not commented since being advised that Australia would not reverse its decision not to stand for re-election. (b) Australia independently formed the view that trade and labour standards was not an appropriate subject for the World Trade Organisation. As it happened, the vast majority of other WTO members arrived at a similar view. It was therefore not a question of Australia supporting the views of ASEAN or any other countries on this subject. The United States was in favour of a work program on trade and labour standards in the WTO and made this known to us, both multilaterally and bilaterally. (5) Yes. There has been some correspondence with the United States (and other countries) on these issues, outlining positions taken, as you would expect on matters concerning international organisations such as the WTO and ILO. Australia developed its positions taking into account all the relevant issues, and I do not see any need to provide a copy of this correspondence. Universities: Enrolment Data (Question No. 1227) Mr Cadman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: Is the Minister able to say how many (a) students and (b) overseas students are enrolled for 1997 iIi the faculties of (i) medicine, (ii) dentistry, (iii) NA AT 31 MARCH 1996: ALL STUDENTS University Medicine Australian Defence Force Academy Australian Maritime College Australian National University Avondale College Central Queensland University Charles Sturt University Curtin University of Technology Deakin University Edith Cowan University Flinders University Griffith University James Cook University of North Queensland La Trobe University Macquarie University science, (iv) electronics, (v) law and (vi) engineering in each Australian university. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: My Department does not collect enrolment data for universities classified by ""faculties"". However data are available for university courses being undertaken, coded to their predominant ""field of study"". The most recent year for which the data of interest are available is 1996. At 31 March 1996 the numbers of all university students undertaking courses classified to the fields of study of relevance to the question are as follows: medicine 10,028; dentistry 1,400; science 27,900; law 16,503 and engineering 47,028. In the classification used in my Department's statistics collection there is no ""electronics"" field of study as such. However, the number of all university students undertaking courses classified to the fields of study of electronic engineering, computer engineering and electrical engineering was 13,281. This last number is a component within the number given for engineering. Corresponding data for overseas students in universities are as follows: medicine 1,121; dentistry 148; science 974; law 461; engineering 5,545 and for electronic engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering 1,827. The numbers of such students in each university in 1996 are shown in the attached tables.

Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In 1996 the number of Austudy and Abstudy beneficiaries in the requested postcodes were as follows: Postcode 2145 2161 2163 2164 2165 2176 (2) Data are not available on the number of households that have as their primary source of income a person on either Austudy or Abstudy. This type of information is not collected for Austudy or Abstudy purposes. Marriage Act (Question No. 1245) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the AttomeyGeneral and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 5 February 1997: (1) How many persons under the age of eighteen years have been married in each year since 1991. (2) How many of those persons referred to in part (1) sought approval from a magistrate, as required by the Marriage Act. (3) Will the marriages of those persons under 18 years of age who did not receive permission from a magistrate be recognised by law; if not, (a) why not, (b) what are the consequences, and (c) what action can be taken to validate the marriages without the need for further weddings. (4) Was a campaign conducted to inform religious organisations, priests, marriage celebrants and others of the 1991 change to eighteen years for the marriageable age for females; if so, (a) what were the details, (b) to whom was it addressed, and (c) what did it cost. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am unable to answer this question fully. According to information provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of persons under the age of eighteen years that have been married, Australia-wide, in each year from 1991 to 1995 are 1991-688; 1992-233; 1993231; 1994-183; 1995-182. The Bureau has indicated that it is unable to provide figures for 1996 or 1997 at this time. The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry in each State and Territory has provided limited information on the number of persons under the age of eighteen years that have been married in 1996 and 1997. The available information is: Austudy Abstudy TOTAL 1 587 38 1 625 860 19 879 538 12 550 727 10 737 1 763 21 1 784 1993 38 2031 South Australia-1996-9; 1997-1 (to 14 February 1997) Northern Territory; Approximately 2 during the past 12 months Australian Capital Territory-Nil for 1996 Victoria Records available do not capture this type of data. Western Australia-1996-9 Queensland Records available do not capture this type of data. New South Wales Records available do not capture this type of data. Tasmania-1992--4; 1993--4; 1994-3; 19952. (2) I am unable to answer this question fully. The record keeping methods and practices of the Court Administration Authorities for the States vary considerably and as a consequence only limited information is available. Applications made in NSW and Victoria are counted as civil matters but not separately categorised as Marriage Act matters let alone R 12 matters In the other States and Territories the position is: South Australia 199 I-Present 40 applications5 refusedl2 withdrawnl1 pending Northern Territory Only data from January 1995 is available because collection of earlier data would require a manual search of some 60,000 files. 1995 3 applications-no information provided on refused applications 1996 4 applications1 refused 1997 1 application1 refused.

The information provided by Queensland is: 1991-28 February 128 applications107 approved-21 refused or withdrawn. Tasmania; 19921997-11 applications-l refused. (3) Unauthorised marriages will not be recognised. (3) (a) Subsection 23B(1) of the Marriage Act 1961 provides, at paragraph (e), that a marriage is void where ""either of the parties is not of marriageable age."" Where a person is not of marriageable age, unless the marriage has been authorised by a Judge or magistrate the marriage is not valid. (3) (b) There are a number of possible consequences if there are any marriages of under 18 year olds which were conducted without authorisation from a Judge or magistrate. The first is that if parties to such a marriage wish to be validly married they will have to go through a second form of ceremony of marriage that meets the requirements of the Act. Their registered date of marriage will be the date of the second ceremony. Further, any child born to the couple after the void marriage ceremony but prior to any second ceremony will have dates of birth prior to the registered marriage date. This does not pose a problem for legitimacy of the children or succession rights upon the death of either parent because all States and Territories have enacted Status of Children legislation except Western Australia which has amended specific statutes in order to abolish the principal disabilities that illegitimate children would otherwise suffer. There are also legitimation provisions contained in Part VI of the Marriage Act. The succession rights of children born to a couple whose marriage is void and who do not later enter into a valid marriage are protected by the Status of Children legislation and the Western Australian Acts. (3) (c) There is no action that can fairly be taken to retrospectively validate any marriages which are void on the basis that the parties were not of marriageable age at the time of the purported marriage ceremony. To take such action would not be fair to those couples who sought the requisite approval and were refused. (4) A campaign was conducted to inform registered denominations and authorised marriage celebrants of the change, from 16 to 18 years, to the marriageable age for females in 1991. (a) & (b) Authorised celebrants, appointed by the Commonwealth (civil celebrants and ministers of the smaller churches) were informed by the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services of the Attorney General's Department in July 1991, prior to the amendment of the Marriage Act in respect of marriageable age taking effect as from 1 August 1991. The Department did not contact the clergy of the recognised denominations directly but their nominating authorities received a letter in July 1991 notifying them of the amendments and asking them to notify the authorised celebrants in their organisations. The Department became aware that some nominating authorities may not have advised their organisation's marriage celebrants of the amendments and on 23 October 1991 again wrote to the nominating authorities requesting that they so inform their members. In addition, all authorised marriage celebrants are provided with a copy of the Handbook for Marriage Celebrants. Marriage celebrants belonging to a nominating authority have access to a copy of the Handbook. The Handbook clearly sets out the marriageable age requirements, and indeed all other requirements. The Handbook also contains a copy of the Marriage Act and the Marriage Regulations. (c) The cost of the campaign to inform marriage celebrants and nominating authorities of the changes to the marriageable age for females is not able to be separately identified in the normal administrative costs of the Department. Two separate letters were sent to all nominating authorities, who numbered over 200 at that time, and one letter was sent to the authorised celebrants, approximately 2300 of whom were appointed at that time. Austudy Office, Blacktown, NSW (Question No. 1268) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 6 February 1997: (1) Does the Blacktown Austudy office in the electoral division of Greenway, close every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon; if so, is this necessitated by staff shortages requiring remaining staff to process claims. (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the inconvenience the closures are causing to clients. (3) What steps are being taken to ensure the office has sufficient staff to remain open during normal office hours. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Blacktown Austudy Office is open 8:30am to 4:30pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and 8:30am to 2:00pm on Tuesday and Thursday, a total of 35 hours. The opening hours of DEETY A offices (Commonwealth Employment Service and Student Assistance Centres) are determined by local office Managers in accordance with a national agreement which provides flexibility in responding to local demand. (2) We hope that clients will not be greatly inconvenienced, as opening hours are advertised. Phone answering messages also advise the office's opening hours. Member's of Parliament and student advisers have access to senior staff at all times, including during closure times, for urgent matters. (3) The closures are not related to staff shortages. The average number of staff at Blacktown in each of the last 2 years has been approximately 40. Parliamentary Entitlements: Private Use (Question No. 1269) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: Are there laws, regulations or guidelines which would prevent a Member of Parliament from using his or her electorate or parliamentary office space, staff and Commonwealth owned and supplied office equipment and stationery to operate, or assist in the operation of, a private business enterprise; if so, what are those laws, regulations or guidelines. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: An electorate office, together with equipment and facilities necessary to operate the office, is provided to each member under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 (Section 4(1) and item 7 of Part 1 of Schedule 1). Item 4 of the Schedule is the authority for the provision of personalised letterhead stationery for members. The Act does not prescribe the purpose but the long standing convention is that the office and associated facilities (including stationery) are for use by the member for parliamentary and electorate business. This has been reflected in the handbook of Senators and Members Entitlements issued under this Government and the previous Government. By determination No 198412 under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 electorate staff are "". . .employed to assist the member to carry out duties as a member of Parliament"". Oakleigh Centre Industries: Funding (Question No. 1273) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) Does the Government provide funding for the Oakleigh, Vic., centre for intellectually disabled citizens; if so, has funding been reduced in the 1996-97 financial year; if so, by what sum. (2) Will the Government fund the centre in future. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government funds Oakleigh Centre Industries at Warrigal Road, Oakleigh to provide supported employment for people with a disability. Funding for the 1996-97 financial year is $641,301. As part of the Government's strategy to reduce the Budget deficit, the 3 per cent efficiency measure announced in the 1996-97 Budget was applied to Commonwealth funded disability services, including Oakleigh Centre Industries. However, this measure only took effect from 1 November 1996 with the implementation of new funding agreements for disability services. As a result of the efficiency measure funding to Oakleigh Centre Industries decreased by $3,735 from the 1995-96 financial year. (2) It is envisaged that funding will continue in 1997-98. Sydney 2000 Olympic Games: Increased Air Traffic (Question No. 1279) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) Further to his question No.621 (Hansard, 28 October 1996, page 5970), concerning the maintenance of the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) in the period immediately preceding, during and immediately after the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, has his attention been drawn to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 29 January 1997 where the Executive Chairman of Ansett Airlines is reported to have said that Sydney may need to tweak the curfew at KSA to cope with the additional air traffic during the Games. (2) Will airlines breaching the curfew at KSA during the Olympic Games be prosecuted. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Government is committed to retaining the curfew at Sydney Airport and will not lift the curfew to cope with additional traffic during the Olympic Games. (2) The curfew is enshrined in legislation through the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995. That legislation imposes penalties for curfew breaches. Decisions to prosecute breaches of the Sydney Airport Curfew Act are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is the intention that evidence of alleged breaches of the Act during the Olympic Games will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the same manner as would be the case at any other time. Green Corps Scheme: Participants (Question No. 1284) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on IO February 1997: (1) How many persons in each State and Territory have participated in the Government's Green Corps Scheme. (2) How many of those participants were (a) employed and (b) unemployed immediately prior to entering the scheme. State No of Participants NSW 40 (38) VIC 40 QLD 40 (38) SA 30 (28) WA 30 (20) TAS 30 ACT 10 NT 20 (19) TOTAL 240 (223) Note: Figures in brackets represent Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (Question No. 1291) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: (1) What are the largest aircraft that land on runway 34R116L at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) Could the runway be extended to accommodate large jumbo jets; if so, (a) what extensions would be necessary and (b) what impediments are there to proceeding with extensions. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Runway 16U34R is 2438m long and was designed and built to cater primarily for domestic sized aircraft such as B767s and B737s, although in terms of width and physical separation standards, it meets the requirements for B747 operations. The declared landing distance available is 1920m for Runway 16L, and 2400m for Runway 34R, which means it is suitable for landings by B747 aircraft in some circumstances. There have been a small (3) How many of those participants who were unemployed immediately prior to entering the scheme had been unemployed for a period of six months or more. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1-3) When asked to respond to the question ""What were you doing immediately prior to commencing a Green Corps placement"" 223 of the participants answered as follows. Data for the remaining 17 participants is not available. Unemployed for more than six Employed Not Employed months 18 20 8 23 17 7 15 23 6 16 12 5 16 4 0 15 15 10 1 9 2 9 10 4 113 110 42 the number of respondents. number of landings by these aircraft types since the runway opened. (2) Runway 16U34R can already accommodate large jumbo jets in some circumstances. (a)To permit unrestricted operations by B747 aircraft, would require a runway length of some 3500-3900m depending on variables such as aircraft weight etc. For example, Runway 16RJ34L is 3962m long, which permits long haul departures from Sydney to the US west coast. (b)There would be a number of impediments to extending Runway 16U34R and its associated Runway ,strip, which would require extensive survey data before an accurate assessment could be provided. However, to the north the runway is relatively close to the existing major roads of Foreshore Road and General Holmes Drive. To the south east, lies the main shipping channel associated with Port Botany. Sinker Robot Project (Question No. 1303) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the higher education section of the Australian on 5 February 1997 headlined ""Uni throws students hook with a new line"". (2) Is the Minister able to say in which department of Sydney University was the robot called the Sinker designed and built. (3) Was funding provided by the Government to design and build the Sinker; if so, what are the details. (4) Is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of the cost of each Sinker unit. (5) How many staff and students were involved in the design and building of the Sinker. (6) What was the purpose of designing and building the Sinker. (7) Who approved the decision to pursue the project. (8) Is the Minister able to say whether private institutions were involved; if so, (a) who and (b) what sum was contributed to the project by those institutions. (9) Were investigations undertaken prior to the planning, design and building of the Sinker to determine the availability of similar products on the market, both within Australia and overseas; if so, what information was acquired; if not, why not. (10) Did the participants in the Sinker project discuss the project with organisations already involved in the manufacture of similar projects; if so, (a) with whom and (b) what did the discussions involve; if not, why not. (11) What commercial action is Sydney University now taking with regards to the Sinker project. (12) Were parts used in the Sinker imported; if so, (a) how many, (b) which parts and (c) why. (13) Is the Sinker project continuing with a view to improving on the present product; if so, (a) why, (b) what funding will be required and (c) who will fund it. (14) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to other private projects pursuing the same goals as the Sinker project; if so, does the Minister propose that publicly funded institutions pursue commercial manufacturing markets where there is already active private participation. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) During the 1997 Grants cycle over 3000 applications for research funding were received of which I approved 640. The specific Sinker project to which the Honourable Member refers, was not one of these funded research proposals. However, allied projects in the field of robotic and vehicle automation, such as autonomous excavation and enhanced operator-aided quay-cranes, with commercial applications in primary and other industries have been funded by the Commonwealth for the same group of researchers from the University of Sydney. (2) The robot was designed and built in the Graduate School of Engineering at the University of Sydney. (3) No funding was specifically provided by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs for the research and development of this project. Professor Durrant-Whyte has received funding for other research proposals in related fields of vehicle automation such as autonomous excavation, but not specifically for the Sinker project. (4) Costing details are a matter for University and Industry and it would therefore be inappropriate to discuss the details in this place. Many research and development projects are commercialin-confidence and as such the details should remain confidential. (5) Professor Durrant-Whyte, Professor of Mechatronics at the University of Sydney, has informed me that a total of eight staff were utilised in the design and building of the Sinker robot including one PhD student and six undergraduates as well as himself. (6) The Sinker robot has many applications across various fields within primary industries, these include the areas of Agriculture, Fishing and Mining, as well as having practical uses in other areas such as defence and the environment. (7) Universities are autonomous bodies with full responsibility for decisions concerning the strategic management of research and development and the funding of projects that they consider to have viable applications. I suggest that questions relating to internal management should more appropriately be directed to the University. (8) As previously stated this project has commercial applications and needs to be treated as such. It would therefore be inappropriate to discuss confidential details such as private agency involvement and the provision of funding by such agencies. (9) Yes. As part of an undergraduate thesis entitled ""The Commercialisation of an Underwater Vehicle"", the products of some 20 existing suppliers were evaluated against results of surveying some 10 potential end-user requirements. The final design draws on these surveys. (10) Yes. (a) Organisations included Tokyo University, Monterey Bay Research Institute, Tech-2000, Hunter Underwater Systems, Hydrobotics Engineering, Deep Ocean Engineering, Inter Mares, Imetrix, ROV Technologies, J.W. Fishers, Hydrovision, ISE Engineering, Slingsby Engineering, Sonusub, Subsea Engineering, Titan Cove and Perry Tritech. (b) Main discussions were on performance, computing, sensing and cost. End user discussions were held with companies in offshore oil and gas, Fisheries, Coastal and Inland Civil Works, National Defence, Law Enforcement, Ocean Research, Marine Transport (ships and harbour), Marine recreation and environmental monitoring. A comprehensive marketing analysis was performed providing information on performance requirements, reliability levels, cost-effective pricing and market size. (11) As a matter of priority the University of Sydney does not have any plans for commercial action at this time, although another institution has indicated its interest in purchasing one of the Sinker vehicles. The primary interest of Professor Durrant-Whyte's group is in mine and port automation which have substantially more immediate commercial possibilities than sub-sea robots and are heavily Industry funded. (12) Certain parts of the Sinker were imported. (a) & (b) These included five Thrusters as a consequence of best price; various sensors; inertials and cameras as a consequence of availability. All computing, electronic and mechanical requirements were manufactured locally. (13) The Sinker project will continue in the future. (a) Work will be continued on sonar-aided navigation to increase autonomy, development and demonstration of applications in sub-sea structure exploration and environmental monitoring. (b)&(c) The research group have an institutional grant of $13,000 for purchase of sonar equipment. Remaining funding will be met from overheads on other contracts. The University is discussing funded work with DSTO Salisbury for minecounter measures and with a group of Prawn farmers in Queensland. They also intend to approach the Barrier Reef authority to do some trial work on the reef. (14) As previously stated Universities are autonomous institutions responsible for the strategic management of research and development funding received from private sources. The decision to pursue commercial manufacturing markets as a by-product of this research is an internal matter for the University. Avalon Airport: Foxerco and Fresh Food Airfreight Facility (Question No. 1306) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice on 12 February 1997: Has he or his Department held discussions with Foxerco in relation to the establishment of a fresh food airfreight facility at Avalon Airport; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) did the discussions take place before or after September 1996. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I. I have not held formal discussions and cannot recall any informal discussions with Foxerco in relation to the establishment of a fresh food airfreight facility at Avalon airport and am unaware of any contact between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Foxerco. I am however advised that discussions have taken place between Austrade and Foxerco on the subject of the Avalon project. (a) The purpose of the discussions was to determine whether Austrade could assist with the development of markets for the products to be shipped through the airport. (b) The discussions took place after September 1996. 2. I have had some discussions with other interested parties in relation to airfreight generally and the Avalon facility specifically, of a broad nature. In saying this I am not aware of all the linkages between various syndicates including Foxerco, past and present. Avalon Airport: Lease Tenderers (Question No. 1309) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) By what process was one of the tenderers for the long term lease of Avalon Airport, Westgate Holdings, informed, on 23 December 1996, that the lease process had been concluded. (2) Did he prepare a statement on 23 December 1996 claiming that Foxerco's offer had been rejected because it was not sufficiently commercial. (3) How did he or his Department subsequently determine with Foxerco what constituted a sufficiently commercial offer. (4 ) Were other tenderers offered an opportunity to make a sufficiently commercial offer; if not, why not. (5) Did the Australian Government Solicitor provide advice on re-opening negotiations with the preferred bidder; if so, will he provide details of that advice. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Office of Asset Sales (OAS) prepared a letter addressed to the Managing Director of the Westgate Holding Group, stating that the Commonwealth had been unable to agree to terms with the preferred bidder, Foxerco, that the current sale process had been concluded and that the Government would not be undertaking negotiations with other bidders. The letter was prepared against the contingency that the Commonwealth would be unable to agree to terms with Foxerco. The letter was forwarded in error, for which OAS wrote to Westgate on 7 January 1997 to apologise. (2) As with the letter, a draft media statement was prepared against the contingency that the Commonwealth would be unable to agree to terms with Foxerco. (3) I considered the terms proposed by Foxerco in its offer of 3 December 1996 to be inadequate. When advised of my view on 23 December 1996, Foxerco requested-and I agreed-to keep negotiations open. Negotiations between OAS and Foxerco re-commenced early in January 1997 at which time Foxerco made a revised offer which was acceptable to the Government. Foxerco paid the Commonwealth $1.5m for the shares in AAG plus a base rent of $ 150,000 per annum (indexed by CPI after the end of the first year) associated with the long-term lease (50 years plus a 49 year option) of the Airport. The Commonwealth will also receive a commercial proportion of future revenue growth generated at Avalon Airport This represents some $1 1m in net present value terms (over 20 years) based on current revenue projections and is an acceptable economic return on these assets for the Commonwealth. This was confirmed by written advice to the Government from the Government's independent business advisers (KPMG Corporate Finance) The sale and long-term lease meets the Government's primary objectives of maximising proceeds for the taxpayer, maintaining Avalon as an operational airport, maximising the prospects of viable commercial development at Avalon and the Geelong community generally in terms of employment and bringing new industry players to the region. (4) Yes. Short-listed parties, which included Westgate and Foxerco, were provided with sufficient opportunity to make a commercial offer. They were invited to submit initial expressions of interest by 25 January 1996; conditional indicative offers by 17 June 1996; and after undertaking detailed due diligence, final offers by 24 July 1996. On 24 September 1996, the Government announced that Foxerco had been selected to enter into contract negotiations. (5) Yes, however the content of the Commonwealth's legal advice is confidential and will not be released. The nature of that advice confirmed the Commonwealth's authority to undertake negotiations with Foxerco during January 1997. Kelvin Grove, Brisbane (Question No. 1310) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) Will the site currently occupied by 7th Brigade at Kelvin Grove in Brisbane be vacated; if so, when. (2) Does his Department propose to retain the site; if so, for what purpose. (3) If his Department proposes to dispose of the site, (a) how and (b) will the local community be involved in the disposal process; if so, how; if not, why not. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. It is anticipated that the site will be vacated by 30 June 1998. (2) No. The site will not be retained by Defence. (3) Although Defence is yet to develop a specific disposal strategy, any such strategy will involve wide consultation with key stakeholders, relevant authorities and members of the local community. RAAF Base Townsville: Budget Reductions (Question No. 1311) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: (1) Was RAAF Base Townsville's operational budget cut in 1996-97; if so, (a) why and (b) what impact are the cuts having on RAAF operations out of Townsville. (2) Are Townsville's RAAF personnel being flown to other RAAF bases for medical treatment; if so, to which bases and for what medical procedures. (3) Are other Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel being flown from Townsville to other Defence bases for medical treatment; if so, (a) from which ADF units, (b) to which bases are they being flown and (c) for what medical procedures; if not, why not. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) In the 1996-97 Budget, the Government announced new capability initiatives to be sourced in part from Defence Running Cost Reductions (DRCR). With increased pressure on running costs throughout the Air Force Program, operational support allocations have been reduced, including funding for the provision of health services to RAAF Townsville and other RAAF bases. (b) The thrust of DRCR was that there should be no impact on operations. RAAF Townsville has met all operational commitments. (2) Yes, to No.3 RAAF Hospital Richmond; for health care and medical procedures that are not available locally. (3) Yes. (a) Army personnel assigned to Townsville units. (b) 2nd Field Hospital at Enoggera which has been designated to provide such a facility. (c) Extensive and/or specialist treatment and prolonged recuperation.

(2)Which firms were awarded individual consultancies. (3) What was the (a) value and (b) broad nature of each consultancy. (4) What was the duration of each consultancy which has been completed. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A total of 102 consultancies valued at $5000 or more have been let by the Department of Defence from 1 April 1996 to 28 February 1997. This compares with 318 consultancies in financial year 1994/95 valued at $12,532,670 and 335 consultancies in financial year 1995/96 valued at $10,610,318. (2) (3) (a) and (b), and (4).

The current scale of fees for registration as a migration agent is set out in the table below. (2) (a) Yes. There is no provision in the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Act 1992 (the Act) to refund registration fees. (2)(b) The fees levied for registration as a migration agent were set at the time the Migration Agents Registration Scheme (the Scheme) was established in September 1992 and are increased in line with the formula set out in section 6 of the Act. Registration fees have not been calculated according to costs for processing individual registration applications. Rather the Scheme has been designed to operate on a full cost recovery basis. Thus registration fees have been determined on the basis of the total cost of administering the Scheme, including registrations and a complaints investigation/determination mechanism, as well as funding grants to assist voluntary agencies to provide free immigration advice. (3) It would be necessary to amend the legislation to allow refunds of application levies for registration and renewal of registration as a migration agent. The Government has now decided that the migration advice industry will move to self regulation.

(2) Has his attention been drawn to Coalition statements that (a) operations involving quarrying are identical to those involved in open cut mining and (b) there is no reason why some extractive industries should be provided with diesel fuel rebates and others excluded. (3) If so, will the Government end inequities in the diesel fuel rebate eligibility provisions in respect of quarries and open cut mining operations.  member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes, I am aware of statements made by Coalition party members in Parliamentary debates on previous amendments to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. (3) The previous Government amended the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, effective from 1 July 1995, to make it clear that quarrying was not New legislation will be prepared to enable a two year period of statutory self regulation from March 1998 in which regulatory power will be delegated to the industry association, the Migration Institute of Australia. In developing the new arrangements, the matter of refund of fees will need to be considered by the Migration Institute of Australia. FEE Nil $110 or fewer per registration period $110 $540 than 5 cases per registration period $1,080 eligible for the rebate. The present Government Operations does not propose to amend the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to include quarrying. Lithium Battery Explosion (Question No. 1340) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 February 1997: Was there a lithium battery explosion from an army field radio at Simpson Army Barracks in Yallambie, WA; if so, (a) is his Department investigating the cause and (b) will the report be available for public comment and, if so, when; if not, why not. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There was a lithium battery explosion at Simpson Barracks, Watsonia near Yallambie, Victoria (not Yallambie, WA) on 4 February 1997. The incident occurred while a manpack radio, with battery attached and fitted into a backpack carrying harness, was being prepared for a forthcoming exercise. The battery exploded after the radio had completed a transmission and was about to be turned off. While there was some fragmentation of the battery, this was completely contained in the backpack. There were no persons injured; however, seven soldiers were taken to the local hospital as a precaution but released without the need for treatment. (a) The cause of the explosion is being investigated by the Army's Maintenance Engineering Agency with the assistance of Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems, the Australian company which assembles these batteries using imported lithium sulphur dioxide cells. As a precaution, a safety instruction has been issued to all users of this battery suspending the use of batteries manufactured prior to 1994. (b) The Maintenance Engineering Agency's report will not be made available for public comment as it is not a matter of general public concern. The report will be available to ADF organisations and personnel concerned with the management and use of batteries, and to the manufacturers of the battery and the cells. Prime Minister: Official Entertainment (Question No. 1342) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 February 1997: (1) Does the Commonwealth provide the Prime Minister with a budget to cover the costs of providing official entertainment; if so, what sum was allocated for the Prime Minister's official entertainment expenses in the Budget in (a) 199394, (b) 1994-95, (c) 1995-96 and (d) 1996-97. (2) If the Commonwealth does not provide the budget referred to in part (1), (a) from what source is official prime ministerial entertainment funded and (b) is there a limit to the sum the Prime Minister can spend in providing official entertainment. (3) What sum has he spent on providing official entertainment since 2 March 1996. (4) What sum has he spent on providing official entertainment at (a) the Lodge and (b) Kirribilli House since 2 March 1996. (5) Can the funds allocated to a Prime Minister for his or her use in conducting official entertainment also be utilised by either the spouse or children of a Prime Minister to provide entertainment; if so, (a) is use restricted to providing entertainment within the grounds of the Lodge or Kirribilli House and (b) are there other restrictions. (6) From what source does the spouse of a Prime Minister obtain funds to provide official entertainment. (7) Is there a limit to the sum the spouse of a Prime Minister can spend in providing official entertainment.",69
133,Mr HOWARD,CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (a,b,c&d) Not applicable. (2) (a) Official Prime Ministerial entertainment is funded from the running costs of either the Prime Minister's Office, the Official Establishments Programme or other relevant programme. (b) No, other than overall budgetary constraints.

Vietnam Veterans: Electoral Division of Canning (Question No. 1354) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 26 February 1997: Is he able to say how many Vietnam Veterans live in the electoral division of Canning. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As part of the project which involved the establishment of the Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans the postcode for 47,772 of the 53,006 (90.1%) of the living male military Vietnam Veterans (source Australia Electoral Roll-April 1995) is known. There were 351 of the 47,772 Vietnam Veterans resident in the electoral division of Canning. Notes: 1. There were 10 female military veterans resident in Western Australia. To respect privacy considerations this number has not been broken down to smaller regions; and 2. The latest available postcode to electoral division concordance was used to convert this information to electoral divisions (this is based on the boundaries used in the March 1996 Federal election). The use of the concordance is necessary as some postcodes cross electoral division boundaries. Videotaping at Overseas Embassies (Question No. 1358) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 February 1997: Do Australian embassies have cameras which videotape proceedings within the embassies; if so, does the Australian Embassy in Beirut have a camera which videotapes proceedings within the embassy. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department does not comment on the protective security measures it may have in place within its embassies. Telstra Staff: Electoral Division of (Question No. 1364) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 614 (Hansard, 18 November 1996, page 7037), have there been Telstra staff reductions in the electoral division of Barton since the date of the Minister's answer. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra advises that its staff records indicate there has been an increase in its staff numbers in Barton to 258 as at 20 February 1997, compared to 230 as at 31 October 1996. Optus Broadband Cable Network: Telstra Cable Conduits (Question No. 1365) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (I) Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 218 (Hansard, 9 September 1996, page 3800) concerning overhead cabling by Optus, what has been the result of investigations on the nature and extent of co-operative funding arrangements for undergrounding of power cabling and possible ways in which telecommunications carriers might participate in those arrangements. (2) What has been, or is being, done to tighten consultation requirements under the revised telecommunications national code and land access code following AUSTEL's report on the draft codes released for public comment in July 1996. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) After consultation with State and Territory Ministers, the Federal Government decided to form the 'Putting Cabling Underground Working Group.' The working group will be established to consider the following issues relating to moving existing utility and communications cabling underground: How and where existing aerial cabling can be moved underground, including assessment criteria; what measure of co-location of electricity and communications cabling is possible in underground ducting; Barton the cost of moving existing aerial cabling underground.; who should share the costs of moving existing aerial cabling underground; timeframes for moving existing aerial cabling underground; and the process to ensure cabling is moved on an equitable and nationwide basis. The two telecommunications carriers currently deploying aerial cabling, Telstra and Optus. will be represented on the working group along with Staterrerritory and local governments; electricity carriers and other utility providers; peak business groups; and representatives of other specific peakbody interest groups such as the National Trust and A TUG. Further more, both Telstra and Optus have that committed finance to fund the working group. (2) On 1 January 1997 the revised Telecommunications National Code and the new Land Access Code came into effect. The consultation requirements of the Telecommunications National Code 1996 differ from those of the previous National Code which was in place from 30 June 1994-31 December 1996. The following additional requirements are mandatory under the 1996 Code: the impact of particular facilities has been formulated into a matrix of high, medium and low impact proposals, which is used to trigger the ability of relevant authorities to require public notification and consultation procedures and against which the information requirements are now codified; prima facie presumption that carriers must comply (clause 12(1» with recommendations by relevant authorities unless the criteria in clause 12(2» are met. There was no such presumption under the previous Code. the information required to be given by carriers to relevant authorities has been codified and expanded. This is set out in clause 16 and schedule 2 of the 1996 Code; and examples of information now mandatory include items such as estimated field strength of electromagnetic energy and alternative sites considered for mobile telephone base station towers; relevant State and Territory (usually local government) authorities have a range of new powers in relation to proposals to install broadband aerial cabling and these will inevitably involve consultation; the information required in carriers' Corporate Environmental Plans has been increased; relevant authorities can require the public to be notified of certain medium impact proposals relevant authorities can require the public to be notified and consulted on proposals of high impact. Such notification and/or consultation was not mandatory under the previous Code and was at the discretion of the carrier if requested by relevant authorities; the manner of public notification and consultation is outlined in the new Code and must include the name and telephone number of a contact person representing the carrier which may be contacted about the proposal; the information requirements for cation are mandatory, being related to the impact of the proposed facility; notification of / consultation with the Nature Conservation Director in particular circumstances, in addition to the Environment Secretary and Heritage Chairperson and the role of these persons has been expanded; areas where the potential environmental impact of activities would trigger automatic notificaate tion of the Environment Secretary have been expanded; Under the Land Access Code, carriers must provide written notice to the owner or occupier o(the land at least 30 business days before commencing the construction of facilities. The notice must specify: The activity that the carrier proposes to undertake; the proposed location of any facility that the carrier proposes to install; the first business day of the week that the carrier expects to commence work; and the date on which the carrier expects to finish work; A notice must also include an assessment of the likely effect on the land of the proposed work. Where a carrier determines that there is likely to any disturbance or damage to the land, the notice must outline measures to minimise any such disturbance or damage. This is should minimise any damage before work commences. There are also provisions in the Land Access Code, (to be outlined in the notice), for a land owner or occupier to object to the proposal of a carrier. Should an objection occur, the carrier must make reasonable efforts to contact the objector within 7 business days to discuss the objection and consult on resolution of the objection. Should the consultation period fail to produce a resolution, the objector may request the carrier to refer the matter to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO), if the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the TIO. Nuclear Fuel Rods (Question No. 1369) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 219 (Hansard, 21 August 1996, page 3499), when will storage facilities for spent nuclear rods be fully utilised at Lucas Heights, NSW. (2) Are other storage sites in Australia being public notifiinvestigated; if so, where. (3) Is it a fact that in many household insurance policies, holders are specifically not insured against loss or damage resulting from or caused by radioactivity, or the use, existence or escape of any nuclear fuel, nuclear material or nuclear waste or action of nuclear fission. (4) Will he request ANSTO to hold prior discussions with the Member for Barton and the approprilocal government authorities in the event that it might be necessary to move nuclear material through the electoral division of Barton. (5) Will the Government undertake to indemnify those citizens whose property is not protected by their insurance policies against nuclear leakage and spill in the event of it being necessary to move nuclear material through the electoral division of Barton. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In the absence of any action to reduce the holdings of research reactor spent fuel at Lucas Heights, the storage facilities would reach capacity in the second half of 1998. The Government is determined that this position will not occur and is currently considering all the options available to it. (2) No. There is no investigation for other storage sites for spent fuel rods in Australia. (3) I understand from inquiries made of the insurance industry by my officers that it has been established practice for many years for household insurance policies issued by insurance companies in Australia to include a long list of general exclusions. Loss or damage from radioactivity is indeed excluded along with others such as flood, sea or high water, landslide, vermin, rodents, and search and seizure. (4) No. It is not necessary for me to request ANSTO to hold prior discussions with the Member for Barton and the appropriate local government authorities because ANSTO does this as a matter of course in the event that it is necessary to move nuclear material. Mr MCClelland is well aware that ANSTO undertakes to inform all local areas on or near the transport route. For the last shipment of spent fuel rods to Dounreay in 1996, ANSTO briefed Mr Stephen Much MP, Federal Member for Cook, Mrs Danna Vale MP, Federal Member for Hughes, and Mr Robert MCClelland MP, Federal Member for Barton as well as the Sutherland Shire Council (through the ANSTOISutherland Shire Council Liaison Forum). Information letters were also sent to the following councils: Botany Bay City; Kogarah Municipal; Hurstville City; Rockdale City; and Sutherland Shire. Mr MCClelland was also given full details at that time of the nuclear liability coverage that would apply to the shipment. (5) Previous movements of nuclear material have been covered by suitable insurance policies. To the extent that any loss or damage arising from the movement of nuclear material was not covered by commercial insurance, claims for compensation could be pursued under common law. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Noise Insulation (Question No. 1376) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 100 (Hansard, 29 May 1996, page 1810) and his receipt of the report of Airservices Australia on the future operating plan of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, when will he be assessing, and making a public announcement on, additional areas in the electoral division of Barton to be included in the noise amelioration program. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Airservices Australia report on the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney Airport and Associated Airspace was released 5 February 1997 for public comment. Any changes to the arrangements for assistance under the Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration Program will be determined after the Government has finalised its consideration of the Airservices Australia report, including an assessment of the implications for the areas of eligibility. Commonwealth Land and Buildings: Electoral Division of Barton (Question No. 1380) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 February 1997 (1) Further to his answer to question No. 106 (Hansard, 18 June 1996, page 2174), what land and buildings in the electoral division of Barton does the Government hold on a leasehold or other basis. (2) What is the cost to the Commonwealth of those leases or other arrangements. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) There are no Commonwealth leaseholds or other arrangements in the electoral division of Barton administered by my Department. Native Flora and Fauna: Destruction by Feral Animals (Question No. 1386) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Is the Minister able to say to what extent the destruction of Australian native fauna and flora can be attributed to feral animal activity. (2) What information does the Government have on the overall effect of feral animal activity in Australia. (3) Will the Minister initiate a feral animal inquiry by the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and Arts to establish recommendations for the protection of native fauna and flora from destruction by feral animals. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The decline in abundance of many species of native fauna and flora is due to a range of factors including the impact of feral animals. While a number of studies have indicated the impacts of individual species of feral animals on some native species there are no comprehensive figures available which would enable the allocation of total impacts of individual species of feral animals on all native species, nor the separate allocation of declines in individual native species to the lar feral animals which may have an impact on them. There is clear evidence, however, that feral predators such as the feral cat and European fox have caused the decline and extinction of native animals on islands. They also have been shown to prevent the re-introduction of native species on mainland Australia. Feral herbivores are known to compete with native animals and cause land degradation. The capacity to measure impacts is complicated by the extent of land use changes since European settlement. Thus the difference in some extinction rates may be attributable to changes and differences in habitat rather than indicating that there is a direct cause and effect. For example, the introduction of rabbits had three effects. Firstly, rabbits competed with native animals for food, especially during drought. Secondly, they displaced certain burrowing marsupials. Thirdly, the spread of rabbits has provided a ready food source for introduced predators, thereby contributing to the maintenance of high densities of such predators. The Government has allocated $16 million over five years to the National Feral Animal Control Strategy, which will address feral animal issues by: - developing best practice guidelines for the control of selected feral animals; - filling key knowledge gaps in pest management; - developing and implementing threat abatement plans for key feral animals; and '. identifying invasive species with the potential to become threats to the environment (2) A substantial number of reviews and research papers have been published on this issue. In 199596, Environment Australia published overviews of the impact of feral cats, feral and managed honeybees, and salmonids on native species. Proposals have been sought for the conduct of further overviews to increase our knowledge of the impact of other invasive species on the environment. These include: - European red fox; - feral rabbit; - feral goats; - feral pigs; - buffalo; - introduced rodents; and - introduced birds (3) No. Protection of native fauna and flora from the impacts of invasive species is already being particuadequately addressed through the Endangered Species Program, the National Weeds Strategy and the National Feral Animal Control Strategy. Telstra: Employees and Contractors (Question No. 1388) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: How many persons were (a) employed or (b) contracted by Telstra in the electoral divisions of (i) Fisher, (ii) Fairfax, (iii) Wide Bay and (iv) Longman (A) on 1 January 1996, (B) in 1990 and (C) in 1983. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra advises that its staff reporting systems are set up to service its internal reporting requirements and it is unable to provide the requested information for the years 1983 and 1990 and 1996, but can provide information for 1997. In addition, Telstra advises that its records for contract staff do not allow a break up of numbers on a geographical basis.

(3) What steps has the Government taken to progress trials and use of biological controls to combat rubber vine infestations. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Queensland Department of Natural Resources estimates that Rubber vine densely infests over 700,000 hectares of tropical and subtropical Queensland between the 400 and 1400 millimetre isohyets but is present across 34.6 million hectares. The major infestations are in the catchments of the Gulf rivers (from the Mitchell to the Northern Territory border), Burdekin River and lower Fitzroy River. Scattered infestations occur in the Lake Eyre and Murray-Darling Catchments and coastal rivers south of Rockhampton. Rubber vine has the potential to spread to the Northern Territory, tropical regions of Western Australia and other parts of Queensland. (2) To this point in the 1996-97 financial year no Commonwealth funding has been applied to the National Weeds Strategy to address Rubber vine. A National Weeds Strategy Executive Committee comprising State and Commonwealth representatives from agriculture, environment and forestry interests has recently been formed to oversight implementation of the National Weeds Strategy. One of the first tasks of this Committee has been to review the existing strategy for Rubber vine as a precursor to seeking funding support to implement elements of the Strategy.

Regulation 80 provided, in part, that it was not necessary for a member of a rifle club under or by reason of any law of a State or Territory to obtain or have any licence or permission for the use of rifles and other firearms on rifle ranges and for the possession, use and carriage by a member of a rifle club of such rifles and other firearms as were approved for use on the rifle range. The regulation applied to members of rifle clubs formed or deemed to have been formed under the Regulations. The regulation only operated to provide an exemption from licence or permit requirements under State or Territory law. It did not provide an exemption in relation to weapons which were prohibited under State or Territory law. (2) The Australian Rifle Club Regulations, including regulation 80, were repealed by Statutory Rules 1997, No.4, with effect 12 February 1997. (3) No. (4) None. The Ready Reserve is being disbanded. (5) This matter is not within my portfolio responsibilities. However, as indicated above, regulation 80 did not provide any exemption in relation to weapons which were prohibited under State or Territory law. Veterans' Review Board (Question No. 1572) Mr Martin asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 March 1997: (1) Did he reject the nominee of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the Principal Member of the Veterans' Review Board. (2) Is he able to say whether the nominee referred to in part (1) had been interviewed by three senior public servants and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. (3) Has the position been (a) readvertised and earmarked by him for a prominent member of the NSW Liberal Party. (4) Did he write to his ministerial colleagues on 29 November 1996 stating that the Government should explore ways by which it could direct statutory authorities in their duties; if so, is the action referred to in part (1) an example.",139
137,Mr HOWARD,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(4) Cabinet agreed to the appointment of a new Principal Member of the Veterans' Review Board being recommended to the Governor General. I do not propose to provide details of appointment processes. 'Millennium Crisis' (Question No. 1614) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 26 March 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to claims frequently made in some technical literature overseas of a ""millennium crisis"" in long standing, large scale computer systems in which transition to double zero on I January 2000 may be machine read as a fault in the system and cause a breakdown or some other failure. (2) Is he seeking appropriate advice on the subject, if so, what is the source of the advice. (3) Has he had consultations on this matter with CSIRO, universities or banks; if so, (a) which institutions, (b) what advice was received and (c) what action was taken. (4) Has he had discussions with other Ministers whose Depattments have very large scale computer systems, including the Minister for Defence, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. (5) If a problem exists, what is the estimated cost of the rectification of the systems to (a) government and (b) the private sector. (6) If there is no problem, will he make a public statement in the House of Representatives. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes. I have received briefings from the Chief Government Information Officer from the Office of Government Information Technology (OGIT), who first brought this issue to the attention of all Commonwealth agencies in May 1996. Year 2000 compliance plans are currently being lodged with (b) OGIT. OGIT keeps me informed and is in constant liaison with the US and UK governments, industry associations, the Reserve Bank and other major banks, suppliers and Year 2000 service providers I have had discussions with a senior official from one of the major banks and with the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser. OGIT has formed a Commonwealth-State Committee which will be reporting to the On-Line Government Council. The Committee aims to assist agencies to resolve the Year 2000 date issue on a whole of Government basis and avoid duplication between State and Commonwealth activities. The Council considered this issue at its recent inaugural meeting. Arrangements are in hand to form a peak body of industry associations and government representatives to keep me advised and to ensure progress is sufficiently rapid across all sectors. (3) I have not held discussions on this issue directly with CSIRO or the universities. OGIT has been contacted by a number of financial institutions. Advice to date indicates that the finance industry is well aware of the Year 2000 problem and corrective action has been or will be taken in good time. Other large private sector businesses also appear to be moving on this issue but there may be insufficient awareness by smaller enterprises. Accordingly, I addressed the National Small Business Forum in November 1996, provided an article to the National Small Business Newsletter and have issued several media statements on this topic. (4) I have not had direct discussions with other Ministers but have overseen consultations at the departmental level. Those departments have been asked to submit compliance plans to OGIT. The Minister for Finance has been kept informed by OGIT. (5) The cost for the Commonwealth and the State govemments has not been established, neither has a figure been established for the private sector. However, according to Gartner Research, the cost is somewhere between $300 billion and $600 billion worldwide. If this is correct, the cost to Australian business and government could be between $3 billion and $6 billion. (6) There is a problem. It is being taken seriously by government and the private sector and my Department will continue working to raise awareness of the issues across all industry sectors whenever possible. Dementia Counselling Mr Andren asked the Minister for Family Services, without notice, on 25 February 1997: (1) are you aware that the Mid Plan report on the National Action Plan for Dementia Care noted the vital importance of dementia counselling services, largely developed through State Alzheimer's associations. (2) Are you aware that the report detailed the significant advantages of co-locating such counsellors with the Aged Care Assessment Teams. (3) If you are aware of this, why is the Government withdrawing funding for the five rural counsellors in New South Wales, including Orange and Dubbo, and expecting such services to be mainstreamed through the Home and Community Care service, which is under-resourced and underskilled, to carry out such a vital service for the increasing number of home based rural dementia patients. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows (1) and (2) I am aware of the report and the Department of Health and Family Services has been working with the Reference Group in response to the proposed actions. (3) The Counselling services are an initiative of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care. The Government recognises that the needs of people with dementia and their carers will not cease when the Action Plan ends. In order to assist the Government in its consideration of how the needs of people with dementia and their carers can continue to be met in the future I have invited members of the Reference Group for the National Action Plan for Dementia Care to give me their views on the next steps for dementia care in Australia. I will consider their recommendations and the outcomes of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care in due course. Implications for Home and Community Care Program services will be assessed as part of these considerations. In the meantime the Aged Care Structural Reform Package announced in the August 1996 Budget includes measures to improve the care of people with dementia. The measure to introduce a single classification system and assessment instrument across the residential care sector from 1 July 1997 will ensure that residents will be funded according to their care needs no matter where they are. The development of this new instrument will take proper account of both the physical and mental frailty of residents and match this to an appropriate level of funding. Consistent with and complementary to the Reform Package is the National Carer Action Plan which aims to improve support for carers, including carers of PeoPle with dementia. It is clearly evident that adequate training and appropriate buildings and environment are critical to the appropriate care of people with dementia. The Government believes that if the objective of good quality dementia care is to be achieved fully, this care must come primarily from mainstream care systems. The August 1996 Budget measures are designed to achieve this.",142
