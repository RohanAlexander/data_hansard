2,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NATIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997, together with the National Transmission . Network (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997, implement the government's decision announced in the last budget to sell the National Transmission Network. In the election we announced that we would increase the national broadcasters' responsibility for transmission of their programs. These bills provide the ABC and SBS with a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers. The ABC and SBS have been seeking such a relationship for many years. The sale of the transmission network will provide a range of benefits. The ABC and SBS, and other network users, will finally operate in a purchaser-provider relationship with service suppliers. Transferring this operational activity to the private sector will produce the scope for greater client focus and responsiveness that flows from normal commercial practice. In addition, it sets the for a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market, particularly with the introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting. Sale proceeds will be used to further reduce the public debt. In agreeing to sell the network, the government recognised the importance of safeguarding important broadcasting policy objectives. We have made it clear that the maintenance of existing ABC and SBS coverage and service quality, particularly for regional and remote communities, is a prerequisite. In addition, we will ensure that existing community service obligations will be preserved, including those for network users such as Radio for the Print Handicapped, remote commercial satellite broadcasting services, self-help retransmission groups and emergency service operators. In the medium term, we recognise that there is likely to remain limited competition in the transmission services market, especially outside major metropolitan centres. Against this background, these bills balance the desire to maximise the benefits of establishing commercial synergies with the need for competitive safeguards to protect the government's broadcasting and social policy objectives. The network will be transferred to one or more national transmission companies which will have agreed contracts with the ABC and SBS spelling out transmission requirements. These companies will be sold to the network purchaser, or purchasers, with the contracts in place. A compact with the ABC and SBS will spell out the government's transmission coverage and quality expectations-in return for full funding of the costs of the broadcasters' five year transmission contracts. The onus will therefore be on the ABC, SBS and other users to ensure that adequate and appropriate transmission services are obtained to meet their needs. The bills provide a regulatory framework to underpin these contractual arrangements. It is necessary to ensure the continuity of contractual arrangements in the event of onsale of the network, and to safeguard against the transfer of assets necessary for the conscene tinuation of ABC, SBS, Radio for the Print Handicapped services and emergency services. Accordingly, this bill contains provisions requiring ministerial approval before transfer of any assets associated with these 'nominated services'. This requirement will enable the minister to ensure that the proposed transferee adopts the conditions of the previous contracts with the ABC, SBS, and Radio for the Print Handicapped operators in relation to their core performance obligations. The provision will also allow an assessment of the likely commercial or financial viability of the proposed transferee to further safeguard the continued provision of national broadcasting services. The legislation also provides for an access regime similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry for the benefit of certain nominated customers. The access regime will guard against any imbalance in negotiating power, which could have led to essential transmission services and facilities not being available, or only being available monopoly prices. The access regime will: guarantee access to transmission services for the ABC, SBS and the Radio for the Print Handicapped operators, and will guarantee access to existing Network sites and towers for groups such as community broadcasters, self-help retransmission groups, remote commercial satellite broadcasters and emergency services, as well as the ABC, SBS and Radio for the Print Handicapped. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the terms and conditions to apply, they will have recourse to the ACCC to arbitrate the matter. This combination of contractual and legislanational tive provisions will balance the likely market power of new network owners to ensure continued access by national broadcasters and other nominated users on reasonable terms and conditions. Commercial users of the network will have recourse to standard fair trading legal safeguards, including those under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The new arrangements also require a number of technical changes to other portfolio legislation. The National Transmission Network (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997, which I am about to introduce, amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to allow the broadcasters to deal directly transmission service providers, and to enable the ABC and SBS to maintain control over the Radiocommunications spectrum used to broadcast their services. The ABC and SBS will also be able to establish their own transmission services. This power, together with the ability of the broadcasters to purchase future requirements from other providers, will provide commercial leverage and introduce contestability into the market. The ABC and SBS will report to the parliament, through their annual reports, on any significant changes in transmission coverage or quality of national broadcasting services. The ABC and SBS will be responsible for at dealing with any complaints from the public about reception quality. In the unlikely event that a suitable and timely response is not provided by the broadcasters, and a substantial problem appears to exist in relation to changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the option of directing the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to investigate the matter. With this contractual and legislative package, the ABC and SBS will at last have a direct commercial relationship with the provider of their transmission services and a degree of flexibility in determining how best to meet their future transmission needs. At the same time, the Australian public can be confident that coverage and signal quality for broadcasting services will be protected. In addition, self-help groups, emergency service operators, and remote commercial satellite service providers will be protected by the access regime. Capped charges in contracts or supplementary funding will ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged. The National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997also contains some technical requirements to facilitate the sale. These include provisions to ensure, if necessary, that ownership of fixtures can be separated from ownership of the land on which they are located. Some transmission facilities have been built on non-Commonwealth land and the power to 'sever' the fixtures from the land is needed to with make it clear that the Commonwealth is the owner of network assets. This bill also ensures that the new network owner will not be subject to state and territory planning and environmental laws for facilities existing or under development at the time of the sale. Of course, a new owner will be subject to all planning and environmental requirements for new facilities or substantial changes to existing ones. Sale proceeds are expected to return to the budget in 1998-99 as an offset to outlays. The government has agreed that total outll!-Ys for transmission services after the sale will be contained within current forward estimates. No additional resources are required for the negligible financial impact of administering the regulatory arrangements contained in these bills. These bills will allow the timely completion of the sale of the transmission network. As promised, the government will deliver the benefits of a more commercial transmission environment and give the national broadcasters the direct responsibility for transmission of their programs which they have sought for a very long time. I can certainly testify to that. At the same time, the bills will provide adjourned. the safeguards necessary to preserve the government's national broadcasting and other social policy objectives. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA NETWORK SALE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NA TIONAL TRANSMISSION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 supplements the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997, in putting in place arrangements to effect the government's decision to sell the National Transmission Network. This bill amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 to make it clear that both the ABC andSBS have the power to produce, transmit and arrange for the transmission of programs. It requires both organisations to provide details in their annual reports of significant changes in transmission coverage of national broadcasting services. Where a substantial problem appears to exist in relation to changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the power to direct the Australian Broadcasting Authority, ABA, to conduct an investigation into the matter. Minor amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 will facilitate ABC and SBS control of the radiocommunications spectrum used to broadcast their services. The bill will have no financial impact. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House.

4,Mr GRIFFIN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"It is some 19Y2 hours since I commenced this speech prior to question time yesterday. A range of other activities in the House, such as consideration of the native title legislation, has led to my making a short speech but over a very long period. Nonetheless, the Public Service Bill, which I rise to speak on today, is a very major reform. But, as I mentioned yesterday, it is a major reform which has some serious question marks over it. There are elements of this bill which I think will not have the desired effect, and there are circumstances around which the operation of the Public Service, as it currently has worked for many years, could be severely compromised. A range of amendments are foreshadowed by the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), which I think do try to address those concerns and ensure that those consequences-that to some may be unintended and to some intended-of the changes proposed by the government can be ameliorated. As I mentioned yesterday, the Public Accounts Committee, of which I am deputy chair, considered this matter in a report and made a number of suggestions of changes to the government. As I understand it, they have practically all been accepted. In some respects, the government has even gone further than we recommended. I commend the government for that. As I also said yesterday, there was a tense atmosphere during the production of that report, given the intensely controversial nature of aspects of the legislation, but members of the committee from both sides of the House worked constructively together to produce a report with unanimous recommendations. The decision was taken that it would be better to agree to disagree on some of the issues of the bill rather than to have a minority report. Having said that, one issue which came through clearly which the then chair of the committee and now Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), I and others spoke about when this report was tabled was a concern we have on not only this matter but also other matters in recent times regarding the moving of legislation to the Public Accounts Committee for consideration. By putting time lines on it which suits its program and are required for its legislative program, the government has created a situation where the committee is not having enough time to properly consider matters. The report was a good report, but we were quite rushed in the consideration of it. There was a range of issues which I think we could have gone into in more detail but, given the time lines we had, that was not possible. We also had a continuing situation in that committee of a lack of resources which made it very unfair for the secretariat of the committee and also committee members to ensure a proper consideration of legislation. A number of bills in recent times have been referred by the government to the committee. I do not disagree with that as an approach-I think it is a sensible thing to do-but when you use the committee system in order to ensure that legislation is scrutinised you must, by definition, if you are serious about it, ensure that the committee has the time to properly consider legislation and also the resources so that it can ensure that its deliberations are effective and timely. A number of issues are raised, as I mentioned, about this legislation. I would like to go through a few concerns that the opposition has regarding the detail of the legislation. For example, the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads and these will not be subject to public scrutiny. That in itself raises some questions regarding the operation of the system as it currently stands and what those adjustments will mean. It is true, and I am the first to admit, that the situation with agency heads-departmental secretaries-has changed significantly over the last 15 years. We now do not have permanent life tenure but long term contract periods. There are regulations-some sameness, if you like-about remuneration and also scales and schedules that are worked off. The situation here could well lead to massive differences in pay for incredibly similar jobs and to circumstances where the issue of remuneration and other conditions will not be subject to public scrutiny. That has been a very important aspect of Public Service operation in this country since the tum of the century. In addition to that, agency heads will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary and conditions for agency employees. They will have the power to revoke and amend determinations which give effect to conditions of service which have been negotiated and agreed between the government and APS employees. The concern here is quite obvious. I suspect we will see a situation where people will be doing the same job in different departments within the service being paid vastly different wages and conditions. I do not think that in itself is fair or equitable. There are also concerns about a system which is not only fair and reasonable but also seen to be fair and reasonable. I think there are some real concerns here as to how this system will now operate. Senior Executive Service officers will not even have recourse to the· unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Again, there are issues here around the question of natural justice; there are issues here around the conditions of employment. I know that some would argue that, at that level, any employee ought to be judged entirely on their merit, but merit in itself is a difficult term terms of definition and it can mean many things to many different people. I suspect that when you are talking about merit with respect to an employer with their employee the question of merit will be judged not necessarilyon entirely meritorious conditions. When you remove someone's right to recourse on issues such as unfair dismissal, you raise questions of natural justice and also of instituto tional fairness. In addition, a vast range of responsibilities will be devolved to agency heads which will result in increased differentiation, competition and rivalry between departments and much duplication of administrative procedures. This goes back to the issue of how, when you, if you like, move down the line and devolve, that devolution will work. In something as large as the Public Service in which, in many respects, similar jobs are being done in similar areas across many different departments, there could be unnecessary duplication which could lead to us not having an effective operation of the service. The impact of all of these things will be the cessation of the APS as a career service. Because there has been a range of senior people and, in the more junior ranks, people who have been in departments or in the service for 20, 30 or 40 years, that has been an advantage in the past in building up a corpqrate memory-an understanding of how an organisation works and a build-up of experience. In some respects, it is no different to what happens with an experienced fitter and turner or someone who is experienced in the retail trade area. The skills they gain over time just by doing the job are a necessary and valued aspect of their work performance. Experience is often a key consideration for employers in the private sector. As people move in and out of the APSand I for one think there should be an element of that-the danger is that over time that corporate memory will be lost and that institutional understanding, which is a crucial part of the way the service works, will be jeopardised in a very serious manner. The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all of in the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. We also have some real concerns about that. Mobility rights, such as those of APS employees who are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, can be removed after a 12-month transitional period, thus limiting the movement of staff between the Public Service and Parliament House and the benefits both institutions which have flowed from this movement. It is not all one way on this question of corporate memory. There is now scope for mobility to occur in related fields. There is a view from the government that mobility in some respects will increase through this legislation, but I think the results may be quite different when we get to the actual operation of this system. This legislation does raise some general concerns about what this government's attitude is to the Public Service. What does the government see as the role of the Public Service in the operation of government? The government has talked about the need for greater efficiency; the government has talked about the need for a merit based approach. For example, APS values are inserted in the legislation as a basis for reviewing, considering and working through the operation of the service. I think that in itself is a good idea, but going for that approach under a piece of legislation which in effect removes a lot of the fundamental underpinning of the circumstances and the rights of Public Service employees will in itself create some real difficulties. One of the witnesses who appeared before the JCPA was Sir Lenox Hewitt. He is a former distinguished public servant, a man who has served successive governments over many years. His concerns on some of these issues were concerns that many of us on this side of the House certainly identified with and some of his concerns were also taken up by some members of the government in their report consideration. His main concern, basically put, was on the question of frank and fearless advice. In the past it has often been said that public servants need to be in a situation where they feel they can say what needs to be said-however unpalatable and however unwanted, as it can be on occasions-to their minister and to their senior officials in order to make sure that good governance is served by that frank, fearless and open advice. There was much debate within the committee and amongst witnesses about whether the changes proposed will interfere the operation of that frank and fearless advice. On that issue we agreed to disagree, but I think there were real concerns raised. What we suspect and I firmly believe will occur under this legislation is that the removal of things like contract periods-which is what we did when we were in government-as against lifetime tenure will create a situation where senior officials, who may be at loggerheads with their political masters, could be put in a position where, if they give advice that they think is right and true in the circumBill stances, they may be signing their death warrant in an employment sense. And that is a real issue. It is an issue which I do not think has been clearly addressed in this bill and which the government has dismissed as being not an issue. Certainly in some of the evidence we took at the committee, although I agree not all of the evidence, the situation was that a number of people were extremely concerned about how that will work. The problem with such a far-reaching reform is that, for all its good intentions-although I worry about the motives of some involved in its drafting and operation-I believe it will have very different conclusions in terms of the operation of the public sector. In those circumstances, I think that the foreshadowed opposition amendments ought be supported because they give a basis for maintaining what we see as being the key aspects and strengths of our Public Service: that frank and fearless advice, that corporate memory and that capacity to be able to serve political masters of whatever persuasion on the basis of the decisions of the Australian people. I think there is a danger associated with the approach being taken by the government where we will have a more politicised public service that will, to an extent, be compromised in terms of the directions and the positions that it takes. That will not be good for governance within this country. That is what we have to understand about these bills and about the role of Public Service. We are here from year to year, some longer than others and many longer than me. At the end of the day, the operation of government is essentially relying upon the role, the skills and the expertise of the Public Service as it serves all of us. What really worries me about this legislation is that this proposed reform to the Australian Public Service will lead to a situation where that role will be severely compromised. I commend the foreshadowed amendments to the House and I hope that the government will see the sense of the actions proposed.",15
5,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Watson) (9.59 a.m.)Some people would think the Public Service 1997 and cognate bills are rather dry and unnecessary. Many people would say that public servants are like lawyers in that the more of them you find at the bottom of the ocean, the more progress you make. But I am not one of the people who holds to that view. I think that public servants in this country are probably more able than most of their private sector counterparts. They are certainly paid less and nowadays, unfortunately, they are also undervalued. Anyone who has read the remarks in the newspapers today and yesterday on the passing of two great public servants, Nugget Coombs and Fred Gruen, would appreciate that there is a great need in this country for people in the Public Service who see public service as being a very worthwhile role to have in their lives. While this legislation simplify some of the provisions that govern the employment of people both in the Public Service and in the parliamentary service, it will also ensure that you are less likely people of the stature of Nugget Coombs and Fred Gruen. This bill will certainly mean that the role for people who might want to give frank and fearless advice is certainly disappearing from the Public Service. The Parliamentary Service Bill will for the first time provide a separate employment framework for people who work in the parliamentary departments and, except where it is considered necessary to distinguish responsibility to the parliament from the Australian Public Service's responsibility to government, the Parliamentary Service Bill is, by and large, a mirror of the Public Service Bill. The differences are meant to reflect the special needs of the houses and of the five departments that service them. Since the Public Service Bill was first introduced into the parliament, there have been developments which have impacted on the legislation, but the basic thrust and the intent of the legislation remain the same. Two parliamentary committees, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, have reported on the public service bills and have mentioned in their reports the Parliamentary Service legislation. The task for both of these committees was not easy, as my colleague the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) has just mentioned. He is the Deputy Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and knows the issues that the committee faced. Because of the fluidity of the situation and the timing constraints, those committees were not required to look at the proposed legislation in as much depth as they could have. At the same time, they were looking at it in the knowledge that changes would probably be made as a result of their findings. They did not have the benefit of the knowledge of the detailed regulations or subordinate legislation which would support this bill because those regulations and subordinate legislation were still being drafted and negotiated. Both committees were somewhat will unhappy with the legislation in that the goalposts were either shifting or being changed while they were making their report. But they did their respective jobs as best they to see could and, in the circumstances, we have significantly benefited from their views. The Public Accounts Committee made 20 recommendations for change, and I understand that the government is going to adopt 19 of those. These changes to the bill will also be reflected in the Parliamentary Service Bill, but basically both committees have accepted that the bills are a genuine attempt to give a contemporary legislative basis for employment and management practices in the Australian Public Service and in the Parliamentary Service. To my mind the committees may not have gone as far as they could have in that they do not seem to have seriously questioned the philosophy behind the legislation. They have said that they see these pieces of legislation as making for contemporary legislation, though I think they may have missed the boat a bit in their reports in not looking at some of the underlying things that are involved in this legislation. The Democrats did a little bit in the dissenting report to the Senate committee, where they expressed real concerns about what is happening in the Public Service. They said that there was a need to substantially amend the legislation that is before us today. I do not think people should think these are just cosmetic changes to make a bill that is easier to read, a bill that people can say is a 1990s contractual arrangement. There are very significant changes that are being made in the ethos of public employment that are reflected in these bills because what the government is doing is creating a captive Public Service, which will certainly be under the thumb of the government. As far as the Parliamentary Service is concerned, one should need to be very careful to see that a similar culture and ethos do not occur. The legislation is less complicated and easier to read. This is taken to be a great selling point by the government. It is very commendable to have an easily understood piece of legislation, but it should not be achieved at the cost of an effective and an appropriate Public Service. As I said earlier, I do not think you would see a Nugget Coombs rise in the Public Service if it faced the constraints that are put on it by this bill. The government should be looking not to see enemies within the Public Service, as they are doing now, but to see the Public Service as an instrument that is part of the administration of Australia. The public sector should not work in the same way that a company works, where the loyalty is to the goal of the company and the CEO of the company and in getting the bottom line out for the company. That is not the way the Australian Public Service should work; that is not the way that the administrative organs of government should work. There is a lot to be said for the corporate memory that we have in the Public Service. There is a lot to be said for that depth of knowledge which is necessary because, while ministers of the time think they are the most important persons in the land, ministers come and go. So there is a need for that continuity which has been provided by the Public Service in this country. There is no doubt that the drive of the current government is to see that they have a cowed and subdued public sector. I think we saw some of that occur under the government that I was a member of. I do not think that was a good thing then and I do not think it is a good thing now. A small subdued Public Service will be a logical result of the government's policies, and that is not something which is to the benefit of Australia. The government is happy to extol the virtues of the private sector, but it is not so willing to see any worth in its own public sector. The parliament itself will not be insulated from those policies and effects. The Parliamentary Service, which affects all of us who work in this place, is in many ways a microcosm of what remains of the Public Service. We are all experiencing the results of the government's enthusiasm for outsourcing work at any cost here in this building. We have seen arrangements that the government has made with the abolition of the parliamentary travel offices, the use of Comcars and things like that. People out in the public might say that reducing the perks-as the newspapers would say---.:available to members of parliament is a good and terrific thing to do. But when you find that, in the pursuit of the ideology of outsourcing, the government puts a lot of inefficiencies into the way the parliament itself works, then that is a pretty stupid proposition to be working from. We have also seen the first of these ideas of slash and burn moving into other parts of the Parliamentary Service. At the beginning of this term, the government decided that they wanted to cut the amount of money available to the parliamentary departments and the expenditure of the parliamentary departments, and we saw an attack on the committee system. Governments in this country have been trying to attack the parliamentary comgreat mittee system for a long while because they know that the parliamentary committee system is one way that ministers can get put under a bit more scrutiny than the standing orders allow people to do here at question time. We have seen in the House of Representatives, for instance, that the number of staff available to committees has been reduced. We have also seen, most importantly, the level of that staff reduced. The reality of that is that committees now do not have either the intellectual capacity or the time capacity to do the types of reports that they did before. I think that is a very bad thing. We in this House strove for a long time to build up the House of Representatives committee system to be an organisation that would look at, and report fearlessly on, things that the government was doing. We have seen in one series of cuts at the beginning of this term years and years of that effort cut back. Government members might say, 'That's good. That gets rid of a lot of dead wood. It gets rid of this and it gets rid of that.' But government that is running unchecked is in the end a government which will cause the government members to lose their seats. People on both sides of this House should realise that, unless there are constraints upon governments, unless there are checks and balances and unless there is an ability to scrutinise the activities of government, governments will become reckless, and reckless governments are probably the greatest threat there is to government members themselves. The Australian people have shown that they will not support reckless governments and they will tip their parliamentary minions out if they are part of reckless governments. We have seen those cuts made and I do not think they are a good thing. Those cuts are the sorts of things which will arise out of these changes that are being made to the Public Service and to the Parliamentary Service. We have also seen in these changes a concentration of further power in the hands of the Prime Minister and those peak agencies in the Public Service itself. Ministers, the Prime Minister and the Public Service Commission will have a stranglehold on the way the service works. The Public Service Commissioner is hardly an independent arbiter now, given the nature of that person's appointment. The secretary to the Prime Minister's department will have a far bigger say, specifically in the choosing of secretaries to agencies, than he had before. But, more importantly, we are seeing this attempt to tum the Public Service into a reflection of what is out there in private enterprise. Agency heads will have a far greater power over their employees and the APS will become less of a career servicepeople were trained to be broad ranging generalists who could move from one department to another-and more of a service where people will concentrate on climbing the ladder within their own particular agency. I think this will make for a more insular Public Service and it will make for a Public Service which will have people dancing to the drum of the agency's secretary. We have seen recently other things occur, such as performance pay, that allow coercive influence of the a department heads and this piece of legislation adds to that. I do not think that is a good thing for the Public Service. These wide-ranging changes also will get reflected in the parliamentary departments in that we have seen changes, for instance, to the tenure of people in the parliamentary departments. I have always held the view that there should not be much difference in the conditions and the responsibilities of people in the parliamentary departments compared to the Public Service. If we continue to say that what happens here is different, then we will get special deals and nepotism arising in the small departments that you have here. One of the things this legislation does is to once again make special cases. When I was the head of some of the parliamentary departments, I could never see any reason for the heads of some of those departments to have different conditions to the heads of other agencies. In this legislation we are making some rather peculiar exceptions in that, in the attempt of the government and the parliament to hammer out some compromise with the Clerk of the Senate, we have now got a provision in this legislation which provides that the clerks of the parliamentary departments-not the heads of all the parliamentary departments, just the two clerks; and I do not know why we are continuing to say that some people who head up the parliamentary departments are more worthy than others-will be appointed for a 10-year non-renewable contract. I think that is an absurd proposition. It is the sort of absurd proposition that we see developed because people looked for a compromise in a silly piece of legislation. There should not have been a compromise. The position should have been that we swept away the past and that the heads of the parliamentary departments, be they the clerks or the secretaries to the other three departments, are on the same tenure as each other and that tenure should not be any different from the heads of Public Service agencies. Instead, in an attempt to satisfy the Clerk of the Senate, people have slushed around and found what happens to the Auditor-General, so they have said, 'We'll give the clerk a 1O-year nonrenewable term.' It would be awful if we then found someone in the parliamentary departments who was pretty clever and in their 30s. What would we do with these people after that? It strikes me that, if the people who are running the parliamentary departments are good at their job, to have a five-year renewable contract would be sensible, because if they are good at their job they would get reappointed and if they are not good at their job they would not get reappointed. In the original draft of this bill-I am not sure whether it was changed; we were trying to check up on this this morning-there were provisions for removal but incompetence was not one of those provisions. So you can have a 1O-year contract, be incompetent and still keep your job, but if you are terribly competent and in your 30s or 40s you can have the job for 10 years and then you will go somewhere.",18
6,Mr CADMAN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,Where?,22
7,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) says, but where? In this attempt to cobble together some stupid compromise, I believe we have come up with the worse of all worlds. I cannot see any reason why the heads of the parliamentary departments should not all be treated as equals and I cannot see any reason why this legislation continues to perpetrate the division that some in this place are more worthy than others. It is a nonsense, and it is a nonsense that we should not have continued with. People who have wanted to continue the nonsense have, in the compromise they have arrived at, hurt themselves and, I think, have done something that will damage the institution in the long run. Like the curate's egg, there are some good things and some bad things in this legislation. To have a piece of legislation that is contemporary is good, but the thrust behind this legislation, which will destroy a lot of the professionalism in the Public Service and will ensure that the public servants become more susceptible to kowtowing to the Prime Minister and to ministers, is not in the long run to the benefit of public administration in this country and is not to the benefit of taxpayers who, after all, pay our way in this place and in the public sector.",22
8,Mr MARTIN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Obviously I have an interest in the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 stemming not only from my role as a member of the federal parliament for nearly 13 years-the anniversary falls on 1 December of this year-but also, like the previous speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), from having occupied the position of Speaker in the House of Representatives between 1993 and 1996. That role gave me, as it gave my friend the member for Watson, a unique opportunity to see the way in which this building operates, the way in which departments which are part of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia operate and interact with each other and a unique chance-at least we believe so-to contribute. It is therefore with some interest that I read not only the second reading speech but also the legislation which was introduced into this place by the Speaker and is before us today for debate. There are a number of issues which I would like to touch upon briefly. The first is the fact that, irrespective of what system in a bureaucratic sense is put in place, there is a unique contribution made by the people who work within the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia for the greater good of this institution, stemming from the clerk through to the people who-perhaps by virtue of comparison, using height-work in the basement. All of them in this place contribute mightily to the functioning of the parliament. They do so because of a sense of pride in what they do and also because of a sense of commitment which people working in this parliament enjoy. That is why, to some extent, it is important to disaggregate some of the roles ascribed to people by this legislation and the manner in which people are to be appointed to different roles, particularly at the top, and the way in which that opportunity for presiding officers to play a legitimate role in this building will not be diminished. Much has been said about the issue of appointments of clerks and secretaries within the structure of the parliamentary departments. I can well remember sitting down in somewhat animated discussion-and, for those who know the former clerk, to be animated it must have been an interesting issue to become involved with--on the way in which the clerks of the parliament, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, were seen in the public sector sense to be inferior to Public Service heads of department. That was reflected not only in a monetary sense but also in the roles which they perceived to play and the manner in which they administered this building. As I have said, there is a uniqueness about the parliament, and the way in which it is administered requires people to step back a touch from what is considered to be the regular Public Service. In those discussions with Lyn Barlin-and these were statistics that could never be disputed-we talked about the fact that Lyn, and now the present clerk, Ian Harris, controls the destinies of people in the Department of the House of Representatives. In many cases, they are many times greater destinies than some of the other government departments. Some of those departments have now disappeared; nevertheless they were still out there, and other parts of the bureaucracy are still out there now. Their total numbers vary from 40 to 60 personnel in some areas, up to 120 personnel in others-they are just figures off the top of my head-but in the House of Representatives, just as there is in the Senate, there is a sizeable work force for which the clerks have responsibility, yet for some reason there was this non-recognition that they were actually heads of departments in the pure Public Service sense. Lyn and I-and Ian Harris too-used to become involved in some discussions about how we might change that perception. There were contributions and submissions made to remuneration tribunals and other organisations to try to get that recognition factor changed. From time to time we were marginally successful, but at the end of the day there was still some resistance from Public Service mandarins who thought, 'No, those people up on the hill-that's the Parliament of Australia. It's not really Public Service, is it?' I beg to differ. I would tend to think that this is the purest form of public service and that the people who work within this building deliver that purest form of public service. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that this legislation is before us today which sets out some of those very real and very necessary changes. I am mindful of what the member for Watson said in his comments about the broader Public Service concept and so on. We do not want to diminish that role and make it unattractive for people wishing to enter the Public Service so that they think there is not a career path structure for them. I would certainly support his words of caution in that respect. In regard to some of the appointments that are contained within this legislation-I am referring specifically to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate and also to secretaries, other than clerks, to parliamentary departments-there is a difference of approach yet again. For example, the legislation proposes that the clerks in both places be appointed for a non-renewable period of 10 years but that secretaries be appointed for five-year terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries to executive departments and with the possibility of reappointment. When this legislation came before us for consideration, I said within our party room and within the shadow ministry that, if we were going to go the whole hog, maybe that anomalous situation that is still here needed to be redressed if we were to get an absolute recognition of the role that the clerks play, of the very significant stature that that position has and of the very real administrative role that that position has-just as it does whether you happen to be the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Secretary to the Department of Defence or the secretary to any other department. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you well know, because you take a great interest in these matters, there is a financial implication in all of this. The public administration of moneys on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia is probably more under scrutiny in this building than anywhere else. The member for Watson referred to some of that scrutiny recently in respect of travel arrangements. There is no doubt that that is the case. There is no doubt that that scrutiny requirement on members of parliament is much tougher. People like the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Clerk of the Senate and the secretaries to the other parliamentary departments provide guidance to members of parliament to carry out their duties as members of parliament. So they have administrative and accountability responsibilities. At the end of the day we came down on the side of supporting this legislation, but again I do not raise it simply because I am concerned about either clerk being singled out. I think the present government was endeavouring to do that with the Clerk of the Senate and to suggest that perhaps a shorter tenure was necessary. I am simply raising it because I believe we need to equate the clerks' positions in this parliament with the highest levels of the Public Service, with the mandarins in the Public Service, because the work that they do is well and truly equated in that respect. There are a couple of other issues that I want to touch upon as well in respect of this legislation. The first goes to the concept of a code of conduct. This bill contains a statement of parliamentary service values and a code of conduct, which I think is quite reasonable and quite rare. It is interesting that these Public Service values that are contained in the legislation and the Parliamentary Service code of conduct go through issues associated with what employees in this organisation should contribute and the sorts of values that they should uphold. I am mindful that in the course of the last parliament the then President of the Senate, former Senator Beahan, and I were involved in an exercise in trying to develop a similar set of values or a code of conduct for members and senators and also for ministers. I can well recall at the time that, when we sat down to try to devise that concept of what ministers, members and senators should hold as core values, it became a very interesting task. It was a difficult task because people did not want to define values as tightly as would require codification of penalties and those sorts of issues, but at the same time it tried to set core values for members of parliament and the conservation of the use of resources that they are given. At the end of the day it is the taxpayers who provide the wherewithal for us to do our jobs as members and senators. It is the taxpayers, through the appropriations system of the budget, that allow us as members and senators to write to our constituents, to get telephone calls from them, to travel to see them, to embark upon policy determinations and to look at ways in which we as members of parliament might work up those platforms and policies that we want to put in place. We should be ever mindful that there is that real responsibility on us to do that in a sense which is both responsible and accountable. I have maintained all along that about 95 per cent to 98 per. cent of all members and senators probably do that. There may be one or two who have brought us all into disrepute by not doing that. In time, people will be judged according to what is mentioned in the media, in particular, about those sorts of individuals. They will also be judged by their peers. But it is important that the Parliamentary Service code of conduct and values outlined here are things that members of parliament also from time to time reflect on. The other issue is the directions given by Presiding Officers and secretaries to staff under their direct control. Obviously, if you are the boss in a management sense and you give directions, you expect those directions to be carried out. Those directions are often put in place after extensive consultation. I know that the clerks and the secretaries of the other departments here on Capital Hill do that. Therefore, I think the role and responsibility of defining this as something that can continue happen is justifiable in the circumstances and is very appropriate in ensuring that people who work within this building are given clear directions and that policy statements are put out to give them some guidance in that respect but that at the same time the clerks and the secretaries can give those directions when necessary. Based on the complaints about the catering arrangements that I have been getting from people around this place, it would be good if some of those directions could be exercised now. It is a sad fact that some of my staff and other staff on the Labor Party side-and I do not think it is just on the Labor Party sidehave complained of becoming ill as a result of some of the catering arrangements in this buildingMr Truss interjecting",22
9,Mr MARTIN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"I wonder if this is a plot that has been hatched within the government ranks to do something about the already depleted opposition! In a very serious sense, I hope that those that administer this building take on board those sorts of concerns. That is a legitimate concern and a legitimate role for secretaries and clerks of this building to look at-and, might I say, for the Presiding Officers, because, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the end of the day it is the two Presiding Officers that have ultimate responsibility for the running of this building and the parliamentary departments which are within the building. Those sorts of issues need to be addressed. To conclude, the legislation, which goes to the very heart of how parliamentary services in this building are delivered to members and senators and the occupants of the building, is a very important piece of legislation. It is one which will need to be reviewed from time to time. It will need to be kept under constant review by the Presiding Officers. I know that they will do that. I am sure that, if anomalies subsequently emerge as a result of this, we may see a need to come back and implement some other 2. Spirits; Beverages containing distilled alcohol (A) Brandy (C) Fruit Brandy (D) Whisky (F) Rum (0) Liqueurs changes. From our side-and personaIIy, as someone who has taken a great deal of interest in the running of this place-I would like to think that we will see a smoother, better operating set of parliamentary departments here on Capital Hill and that, under the guidance of both Mr Speaker and Madam President, those arrangements will see a very smooth functioning section of the Public Service. That should be recognised more widely within the broader Public Service because, as I said at the beginning, at the end of the day it is departments like the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate which give the wherewithal for other departments to operate, because we pass the laws. Debate (on motion by Mrs Johnston) adjourned. NA (No.1) 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed from 28 August. Senate's amendments(I) Clause 2, page 2 (after line 4), at the end of the clause, add: (5) Items lA, 4A and 4B of Schedule I commence on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent. (2) Schedule I, page 3 (after line 5), after item 1, insert: lA Schedule Insert: Standard PS means Food Standard P5 in the Australian Food Standards Code, 1992. (3) Schedule 1, page 6 (before line 1), after item 4, insert: 4A Item 2 of the Schedule Repeal the item, substitute: $31.59 per litre of distilled alcohol $36.99 per litre of distilled alcohol $36.99 per litre of distilled alcohol $36.99 per litre of distilled alcohol $36.99 per litre of distilled alcohol a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. On 7 June 1996, the AAT determined that the production of sub zero with such a low alcohol content by volume could not be described as spirituous and therefore was not excisable under subitem 2H. The decision was based on what the AAT considered is commonly regarded as the definition of spirit in the community, which is a strong alcoholic liquor, usually containing not less than 37 per cent alcohol by volume. The matter is still subject to appeal to the full Federal Court. The bill in its original form sought to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921, in effect to maintain the status quo with the legislation. The Senate amendments seek to impose the beer rate of excise on any product in the National Food Authority standard P5. The effects of these amendments will be twofold on alcoholic beverages in the P5 category with an alcoholic content of less than five per cent. The rate of excise on spirit based pre-mixed drinks in the P5 category will fall from $36.99 per litre of alcohol to $15.89 per litre of alcohol and, for the first time, excise will be imposed on other alcoholic products in the P5 category not currently subject to excise. It is apparently the intention of the Senate amendments to reduce the disparity in the taxation of alcoholic products by reducing the excise payable on highly taxed spirit based products and imposing, for the first time, excise on currently excise free beverages. The government remains of the view that the bill as originally introduced should not be amended.",25
10,Mr MARTIN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Yesterday in the Main Committee in the debate on Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 I told the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) that we would welcome the opportunity to have discussions with and get the point of view of the customs minister-I was referring to the three customs ministers, including himself, who have occupied that position in the last seven months since I have been the shadow minister-on issues arising from that portfolio responsibility. Regrettably, Minister, this is one of those times when I have to say that we are bitterly disappointed about what has happened. It is not through any fault of your own; rather it is the fault of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for failing to provide co stings on the effect that this particular amendment is likely to have. Clearly this is an issue which will guide the way in which the opposition will deal with this matter. I should say at the outset that the opposition will not support the government on this issue at this stage. I point out to the minister that for a number of reasons we support the amendment that was moved in the Senate. Many of these reasons are outlined in the dissenting report by Senator Jacinta Collins and go to issues which I will elaborate on in a minute. The simple facts are this: the government has delayed debate on this bill for almost three months, and like us, I am sure, has been lobbied heavily by various interest groups about this particular Senate amendment. As I understand it, some of those lobbyists are disappointed because they have not been able to get to see relevant ministers to put a point of view to them. In this lobbying exercise, information about the claims of potential revenue loss and the impact that this might have on the government's bottom line has not been forthcoming. Certainly we have not been provided by the government with any costings. We have tried to get those costings-we wanted to get some sort of detailing of the financial impact of the Senate amendmentbut nothing has come forward. We understand, having been in government for a period of time, that when there is a delay in something like this it is generally because a department, probably Treasury, has its hands all over it and is playing delaying tactics because they have not done the costings which normally would be required. We would like to get a detailed costing from Treasury to clarify the exact revenue implications, assuming the changes in prices will lead changes in the volume of sales. There is an assumption in a lot of the information we have been given that those sales volumes will be exactly the same. Some of the lobbyists are arguing, 'No, that will not be the case. If you equate spirituous beverages along with beer, you're going to find that there will be a switching between the products.' What has to be taken into consideration in this debate is the preference of consumers. People are eligible to go into pubs only when they are 18. Amongst 18-year-olds up to, say, 24-year-olds these days there is a preference for spirit based drinks. They like mixed drinks; they like Jim Beam and all the rest of it in preference to beer. This is one of the issues that the major beer producers are concerned about. They are worried that, if an additional price advantage is given, their production, their sales and, therefore, their profitability will be affected. That is a legitiwhich mate concern. We are not convinced-nor could we be convinced-of the merits of the arguments in this particular matter because we have not been provided with the costings that Treasury should have done for the government. Accordingly, we believe it is only fair that we reserve our right to deliberate further on the issue of changing the taxation levels on alcoholic beverages pending costings from Treasury. There are a couple of other issues that I want to raise in this respect. Firstly, keeping in mind the absence of Treasury costings, the opposition recognises that the Senate amendments that have been moved strongly adhere to the government's own taxation philosophy of cutting off emerging loopholes, broadening the base and lowering the rate, making taxation appear to be fairer and more equitable for all Australians. So, if you were a consumer, you would probably think you were getting a reasonable deal. (Extension of time granted) As a consequence, an argument could be sustained that making it fairer and equitable for all Australians will achieve an underlying government objective. But in that argument we need to see one or two hooks. Currently, ready to drink alcoholic beverages are taxed at the same rate as spirits regardless of the alcoholic content of the drink in question. Whether the beverage is four per cent alcohol or 25 per cent alcohol, it is taxed at the same rate. Spirits are currently taxed at approximately twice the rate as is beer. We see this as fundamentally unfair. The Senate amendments to the bill will allow the tax on ready to drink alcoholic beverages to be the same as on beer, providing the alcoholic content is less than five per cent. I know that a number of beer manufacturers will argue that in that case people would simply start a manufacturing process to get under that five per cent level and attract a cheaper tax rate and a cheaper excise rate as well. They will argue that this is a way of getting around that particular issue. Again, this is a problem that Treasury needs to look at and discuss with your department to see whether we can come up with a situation will alleviate those sorts of concerns. Of course, as ready to drink beverages compete in the same market as beer, making the taxation levels equal will be a lot fairer for them, according to some in the industry at least. Competitive pricing regimes for the same class of alcoholic beverage will also give Australian consumers more choice. A favourable taxation regime for less alcohol in ready to drink beverages will inevitably lead to a general lowering of the level of alcohol in those beverages. This could very well have positive social outcomes in view of the number of times domestic violence is related to alcohol-and a very famous case involving a footballer in this town recently indicates that. So the lowering of the alcohol level could have very positive social outcomes. Lowering the amount of alcohol in beverages will lead to less alcohol in people's bodies and have a positive effect on the long term health of Australians. Encouraging the alcoholic beverage industry to lower alcohol levels can only be a step in the right direction. We recognise that that is the fact. We recognise that that really is an issue that needs to be addressed. The opposition believes it is the federal government's responsibility to structure the taxation regime to encourage the alcoholic beverage industry to lower the level of alcohol present in the drinks on the market. Accordingly, we believe that the Senate amendment which is aimed at doing that is a step in the right direction. I go back to where I started and indicate that, in the absence of a view about the way in which the taxation regime as proposed here in this legislation and knocking off the Senate amendment will impact on the industry from a costings point of view, we reserve our right in respect of this total matter. At this stage the opposition is predisposed towards supporting the amendment that was moved in the Senate. But we believe that both the minister at the table, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, and also the Treasurer need to address that absolute issue about the implications for the industry in a revenue sense, the implications for the government in a revenue sense and the costs associated with this proposal because, as I said, there is an absolute absence of them. At the end of the day the simple fact is that something that has been hidden away for three months and is suddenly brought back now is of concern. The lobbyists from both sides-those that are in the spirits industry and those that are in the beer industry that have been going around and trying to talk to people on both sides of the parliament-are a touch confused about this. They are a bit annoyed as well that this has been brought on now when they are still trying to see ministers to put a point of view and it is here before parliament today. I am sure they will take that up individually with the government. It is not up to the opposition to get them out of a problem that they have with this government. It is not up to us to save their bacon. It is up to them to take their fight direct to this government to argue a case with them. I can recall one of these lobbyistswhose name will remain confidential--came to see me and I said, 'Have you spoken to the government and the government ministers?' They said, 'Oh, no. Should we?' I said, 'Well, they're the government. We're the opposition. But by all means go and talk to the government ministers and put a point of view to them. It is their legislation that they are introducing. So go and have a chat to them.' I hope they have taken that seriously on board. I indicate again that we are predisposed to support the amendments. (Time expired)",27
11,Mr TRUSS,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I will not respond at any length to the comments by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Maitin). I can assure him that even though I have been minister for only a very short time the various lobbying interests have already found their way to my door. I have had the privilege of meeting people from all sides of this argument. I have listened to the social and the economic arguments, and the government has decided to proceed with its original proposal. It is very difficult to cost, as I am sure the honourable member for Cunningham would acknowledge-he referred to it in fact in his remarks-the revenue implications with any degree of reliability in relation to these proposals, because it would require some degree of assessment as to how much substitution is going to occur, how much there is alteration of formulae and how many products might have their alcohol level adjusted slightly to take account of whatever excise regime is put in place for the future. So even with the best will in the world it will not be possible to deliver accurate costing estimates. It is clear that there will be revenue loss to the government from changes, the and it may well be that some of that revenue loss-which does run to tens of millions of dollars-would be offset by changes to formulations and the fact that some new products would become excisable under the Senate amendments. But, after having considered those matters, the government wishes to proceed with the bill as it stands and to reject the Senate amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Truss) agreed to: That Mr Brough, Mrs Johnston and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate.",29
12,Mr TRUSS,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (l0.50 a.m.)-The committee has worked very quickly. On behalf of committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate. I present the reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe Senate amendments seek to impose the beer rate of excise to any product in the National Authority Standard P5. The House of Representathoroughly tives considers that the effect of this amendment will be twofold on alcoholic beverages in the category with an alcoholic content of less than per cent: (1) the rate of excise on spirit based pre-mixed drinks in the P5 category per litre of alcohol to $15.89 per litre of alcohol; and (2) for the first time, excise will be imposed other alcoholic products in the P5 category currently subject to excise. The House of Representatives considers that it the intention of the Senate amendment to reduce the disparity in the taxation of alcoholic products by reducing the excise payable on highly taxed spirit based products and impose for the first excise on currently excise free beverages. The House of Representatives remains of the view that the Bill as originally introduced is necessary as a result of a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which may have of removing excise from previously excisable products. The intention of the original Bill was to the status quo in relation to the excise status alcoholic beverages, by ensuring they continue to be taxed according to their alcoholic base. Motion (by Mr Truss) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted. PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 Cognate bills: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) AMENDMENT BILL ent NA NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) Second Reading Debate resumed.",29
13,Mr HATTON,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Blaxland) (10.52 a.m.)This Howard coalition government is petty, mean and vindictive. In almost all of its actions and in almost every piece of legislation before this House, this Howard coalition Food government is callous, mean-spirited and ideological. This government P5 shelters behind its electoral mandate, the 5 product of conning the electorate about its real intentions, and the electorates inadvertence as to the coalition's real nature and will fall from $36.99 intent. This government continues to assert its mandate and behaves like a schoolyard bully on seeking craven submission from anyone who not criticises it or its policies. We will not cop that on this side of the House. We will critiis cise and condemn an inept, bullying, brutal ising government, and it deserves to cop it in spades, and nowhere more so than with this time legislation, which attacks the core of the Public Service-and that is its ability to provide independent, objective advice to the government rather than the partisan, lickspittle, sycophantic advice that this coalition had the effect thinks is appropriate. Just yesterday, we heard of the passing of one of the great public servants that this land maintain has produced, Nugget Coombs. Nugget of Coombs knew a lot about serving the public, the parliament and the government and he knew that if you were not innovative, inventive and thoughtful and if you were not willing to push forward fresh advice, based on sound reason, you would not be doing your job and you should not be in the game. What did a man who served seven prime ministers strike during the Menzies years? What was the attitude of the Menzies government to economic affairs? It was a bit differto the Howard attitude. Nugget Coombs 1997 recalled later how Sir Robert Menzies once told him: 1997 I'm not interested in economics. I get bored listening to people talking about it but there are times when, as Prime Minister, I should know about it. If you feel the economic situation is of a kind I should know about, ring me up and I'll come BILL 1997 and talk about it. The Menzies years of idling ad-hocracy in economic and other affairs were not to be that of the Fraser period which, in fact, again was a period of idling ad-hocracy, according to the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who had great difficulty because he saw those years as the lost years for the Liberals. This Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, knows-in fact has said quite recently in May of 1996--that the Public Service should provide frank, independent, fearless and honest advice. Treasurers or prime ministers do not necessarily have to take that advice. We note that when the Public Service advised him, the then Treasurer, in 1983 that he should cough up and admit that the budget deficit was in the order of $9.6 billion he favoured his own guess rather than the figures coming out of Treasury. He guessed that $4.6 billion was a pretty good number to put up to people and, right at the end of the campaign, a couple of days before the election in March 1983, he finally said that it might be about $6 billion. This Prime Minister does not believe that you actually have to take the advice of public servants, but he has been under pressure in the past as Treasurer when they have provided him with very direct advice that he should be truthful and open with the public and the parliament. That put him under a great deal of pressure. There are a number of key areas that we in the Labor Party feel are most disturbing about this set of legislation. Firstly, this legislation will, by its very nature, erode the independence of the Public Service. It will no longer be the Public Service; it will become the government service operating at the government of the day's whim and behest. It will inexorably become a politically partisan service. Secondly, there will be no public scrutiny of appointments, wages and conditions of agency heads and these will in turn not be subject to public scrutiny but a mere casual glance and gaze of government ministers. We know how deficient that can be based on the experience of the past 19 months. Thirdly, those agency heads will be able to hire, fire and determine pay and conditions for employees. At the same time, the staff of those agencies will also lose their unfair dismissal rights under the Workplace Relations Act. Fourthly, there will be competition, differentiation and rivalry between departments and agencies, with a corresponding increase in and duplication of the administration of these departments. This will mean that the Public Service will no longer be a broadly integrated career service, with the consequential loss of all the institutional memory that goes with that, but a separated, fragmented and disjointed cabal of competing interests. Fifthly, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed. This is to be replaced with in-house procedures in each' agency. This will, more than likely, lead to more litigation because employees will have no method for internal review of decisions about their employment. The last and most important point for this House to note is that this bill will fundamentally weaken the parliament in a number of ways. The most important of these is that this bill will dramatically reduce the ability of the parliament to scrutinise the executive and the Public Service that supports that executive. These sentiments in fact were shared by Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, in his evidence to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Report No. 353 states: These sentiments were shared by Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, who submitted that the Bill proposed a 'new model' of public service and that if enacted the Bill will establish a service which 'belongs body and soul, to the ministers of the day'. The report goes on to state: This, he argued, could have significant consequences for the relationship between the APS and the Parliament and for the capacity of the Parliament to scrutinise the Executive. Currently the public service is still a valuable source of independent advice to the Parliament, with many public servants recognising that they have a duty to assist the Parliament by cooperating with parliamentary inquiries and by answering frankly and freely questions put to them in the course of parliamentary inquiries. Mr Evans contends that the employment regime proposed in the Bill will make it difficult for public servants to fulfil this responsibility and that Members of Parliament are increasingly likely to be confronted with ministers and their (dismissible) employees 'all singing the same well-orchestrated song'. It is no wonder they want to give him the flick because this is frank and fearless advice, and it is not welcome advice either for Dr Kemp, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, nor the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, who in fact initiated this process in November 1996. The opposition does not dispute the need for simplification of the 1922 act. What it does object to is the bastardisation of the Public Service by a delusional government. A public service is exactly that-a public service. The APS is there to provide the government with independent advice that is in the national interest. This coalition government thinks that the APS should be but a mere plaything of the government of the day. This partisan government of the moment has accused the previous Labor government of politicising the Australian Public Service. It is ludicrous to be accused of politicising the Public Service because Labor had the temerity to take advice from the Public Service, which had the experience and understanding of the functions of federal government and its services. We sought sensible, balanced, authoritative and knowledgeable advice from the specialists in the Public Service. We did not ask for bootlickers or yes-men to tell us what we wanted to hear. We asked for prudent, thoughtful and rounded advice that reflected the needs of the nation. The Public Service is not there to serve private interests, or party interests, or business interests, or special interests, or sectional interests. The Public Service is there to serve the public and the national interest. It is this coalition government that is trying to politicise the Public Service and tum it into yet another faction of the Liberal Party. Why else would they want to remove the ability of the parliament and the public to scrutinise a range of Public Service employment issues? The Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 353 on this piece of legislation received a large number of submissions. It was the dramatic proposed changes to Public Service employment conditions that raised the most concern. The JCPA also reviewed this legislation in their report, Towards a best practice public service. The government always has a majority on committees, and so the committee was loaded up to give a green light to this legislation and congratulate the coalition government for a job well done. But coalition members could not ignore the evidence placed before it. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee held a round table discussion on Towards a best practice public service earlier this year. In that discussion, they had 18 very well qualified people from a broad range of groups discuss changes to the Public Service. It is interesting to read some of the comments made in relation to this legislation. Mr Jack Waterford, the Editor of the Canberra Times, made these comments: We have spent the better part of two decades making what have been, by and large, very good reforms to financial administration, to the mechanisms of accountability-half of which we now seem to want to. throw out the window-and to reorganising functions and so on. Those have· generally been good changes. But we have neglected the prudent management of the greatest single asset the Commonwealth has-the brains, the talents, the idealism and enthusiasm of its work force. I have to say that the neglect is often most pronounced amongst many of the apostles of the other reforms, who add to their own lack of skills in managing people an often voiced and very dispiriting disparagement of the very idea of public service and the notion that being a public servant is somehow mediocre and second rate. Mr Waterford also commented on one of the key concerns that has been raised by this legislation, the possibility that the Public Service could become a place where nepotism is widespread. I again quote him: ... the essential requirement of the old system was that positions had to be advertised, and that the best of those who applied should be chosen. I do not think there is anything wrong with that. I do think there is a very significant risk that a system in which senior managers are free to pick people without advertisement creates a real risk of creating organisations full of clones and crones of the prevailing management-perhaps not appointed nepotistically, or with direct patronage, but picked from the core of people who the boss already knows, whom he or she regards as thinking rather like himself or herself. Luckily, we have those processes where brave and fearless advice, even from outside the Public Service, can in fact be given to parliamentary committees. Government ministers in fact travel the world paying lip-service to transparency in government and independent advice. They even criticise other governments in ministerial briefing papers for not getting transparent and impartial advice. Yet, with one piece of legislation out of the four in this cognate debate, they will be showing just how hollow and hypocritical those words are. This coalition government is trying to destroy the independence of the Public Service and the transparency of government with two pieces of legislation. The first is the main one I have been discussing here today, the public employment bill, and the second in the cognate debate is the Public Service Bill 1997. We cannot separate these pieces of legislation when it comes to the debate in this House. These two pieces of legislation are a two-pronged attack on the Public Service. Therefore, we are dealing with them in this cognate debate. They are of a pieceinterlocking sets in the jigsaw put together by a government that is cognitively challenged. This is dumb stuff, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER really dumb stuff. The JCPA inquiry looked into both of these pieces of legislation together, and they could not ignore the many voices that expressed concerns raised by the legislation's removal of the transparency of the executive and those that advise them. I quote from page 23 of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts: The Committee considers that downgrading the status of annual report requirements for Commonwealth departments is a retrograde step... Annual reports are key accountability documents. It is through annual reports to Parliament that agencies account for their past year's financial results and program performance... It is not adequate that the annual report guidelines be prepared at the tion of executive agencies after consultation with the Parliament. .. A desire to achieve a streamlined Act is not sufficient reason to change the current arrangements. The committee's comments are dead accurate. This is a government that talks about transparency but trades in opaqueness and obfuscation. This is a government that wants to bury internal criticism and advice and one that wants to inter departmental conduct, accountability and program performance in a very deep and inaccessible funeral vault. The Australian National Audit Office, Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, and others told the JCPA that there was a need for the independent setting of conditions and remuneration of the senior Public Service, and the committee agreed. Mr Max Moore-Wilton did not. But then members of this coalition government and their senior staff, with their born to rule mentality, do not believe that the parliament and the public have a right to question their remuneration or decisions. The report recommended in recommendation 17: The aggregate remuneration of agency heads and the Public Service Commissioner should continue to be open to public scrutiny and published in the annual financial statements of Commonwealth agencies. I am glad to see that yesterday the minister, in dealing with these matters, indicated that most of the recommendations of report No. 353 would be taken up. I will be exceedingly interested to see just how those recommendations are taken up and how fully they are implemented because they provide some balance to these pieces of legislation, which are so utterly imbalanced. This government, armed with its big canaryyellow ideological compendium-the Maoists had the little red book; this is a bit bigger, a big yellow book-waved frantically and enthusiastically by the throng over the other side, except for those who have not read it, do not want anyone to offer considered independent advice. They accused the Public Service for years of being a hothouse of socialists who were anti-Liberal. That would be news for Sir Lenox Hewitt, who was the head of the Australian Public Service and discre- served under a few coalition governments. Sir Lenox was one of the most strident critics of this legislation. He told the inquiry that the removal of the 'sine qua non of a career' was a threat to independent advice. The strength of the Public Service for Sir Lenox was its independence, and I quote his strong evidence: . . . the intention to change, indeed to destroy, Australian Public Service and to convert it into series of appointments at pleasure-at the whim, the case of secretaries of the Prime Minister; case of agency heads, of the minister . . . me is a fundamental change in the service that established ... what we are dealing with here, too, is not the dismissal; it is the threat hanging You will destroy frank, fearless, you are party to this proposal of the executive. No more accurate or damning advice could have been proffered by the former head of the Australian Public Service. This legislation imperils the very existence of the Australian Public Service as Sir Lenox and we have known it. This parliament should not be party to the gutting of an institution dedicated to a noble ideal-serving the public rather than mere political masters. Why is it that every time we have a controshadow versial piece of legislation before this House that deals with government service we have to go back and have a look at the big yellow book, the National Commission of Audit? Since June 1996, it seems that government policy has been predetermined by this trite ideological document. In fact, this coalition government absolutely predetermined what the NCA would recommend. That is why it is so trite and so utterly ideological. Whether is transport, infrastructure, the aged or indusderogatory trial relations, this document and its contents are put forward as the coalition's panacea for the nation's ills. However, I am afraid that cure might be more painful and more deadly than the disease. Here are some of the key recommendations in regard to this legislation at hand: remuneration, inefficiency, termination procedures, more flexible employment arrangements, and so on. It is no surprise that the key recomkind mendations that the NCA puts up are the key points in this legislation. Why bother having a government or ministers to do the job if are going to gut the Public Service? (Time expired)",30
14,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"I rise to support the very thoughtful to go. and well-informed remarks of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton) and to make a few, not too extensive, observations of my own concerning the Public Service Bill the 1997 and its impact on public service. At the a risk of sounding like a dinosaur, I am somein one who joined the Public Service after I left in the university, someone who is attracted to That to traditional models of public service, and was someone who is uncomfortable with some of over. the changes that we have seen and are seeing honest advice if in our Public Service. It is regrettable, I think, that from the other side of politics that you find the concept of public service and the idea of public servants being treated as objects of abuse. Indeed the term 'public servant' is used from the government benches occasionally as a term of abuse. a Just a few days ago the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Nairn) came into the House during the adjournment debate and said, 'Look at all the opposition frontbenchers or ministers,' and he ran through their previous occupations. He was very keen to note that a number of opposition frontbenchers have trade union backgrounds, but he noted that the others were public servants. Cries of derision came from the government benches that people should have been public servants before entering the parliament. It strikes me as ironic that members of the government should regard 'public servant' as it a term of abuse or use 'public service' in a way because, in a sense, why are they here if they think the Public Service is inappropriate? It is indeed a large part of what the we endeavour to do as members of parliament-serve the public. I know it is fashionable to criticise politicians and public servants but, nevertheless, it seems to me that at the bottom of it all we do very important work. I can remember an address by Ralph Nader some 20 years or so ago saying that the best of life is a life lived in public service. That always seemed to me to be pretty accurate. When I was leaving university and you thinking about what I could do with my life, the idea of being able to serve the public through a variety of ways in the Commonwealth Public Service was a very good way I think it should continue to be the case that when young people leave school or university they should be able to look at public service through the Commonwealth or the states as being a very positive career. It does strike me that a lot of the changes in this bill, and indeed a lot of the other changes that have been made to public service arrangements, have not had that sort of effect, and that is regrettable. I note that this is not a black and white picture in that everything in the past is good and everything that is coming forward now is bad. Most of us are familiar with Yes, Minister. It is a very entertaining TV program but it does say a lot of truths about manipulation of public policy by public servants, and I certainly do not advocate or support that in any way, shape or form. It is also the case that, if tenure is absolute and it is impossible to dismiss someone for non-performance, you do get into a pattern of long lunches, makework, non-performance and so on. We do not want to see that. At the other end of the spectrum, I also want to express the view that job insecurity does not help people, does not help the nation and does not make our lives better. If we want to change the Public Service so that it becomes a place where there is no job security and everybody is on short-term contracts and can be dismissed at the whim of ministers or senior public servants, then that certainly does not improve their lives, does not, in my view, improve the quality of government and does not improve the quality of decision making. As the member for Blaxland pointed out, this does not help the nation to make decisions when we do not get advice from our public servants made without fear and without favour. My background is from Victoria. I saw what happened to the Victorian Public Service after the change of government in 1992. Essentially, Premier Kennett and the incoming Liberal government governed without the Public Service at all. So for a number of months we had all the decisions being made by consultants and the like according to some secret blueprint while public servants sat in their offices not knowing whether they were going to have a job tomorrow and not being given any work to do today. They were not trusted by the incoming government and they were not asked to do anything at all. It was an alarming model of government. It has continued through the last five years so that there is a fundamental corruption about the Victorian decision making process. I use that word advisedly, because indeed the heads of each department are appointed by the Premier, not by their own ministers, and report directly to the Premier, and he is certainly not above going beyond them and speaking to middle level public servants in the Victorian Public Service. They are not able to give advice without fear or favour; they do as they are told. It is not a model for good government. It is against a background where the Victorian government has also squashed any alternative sources of advice. We have seen in Victoria the Equal Opportunity Commissioner being sacked, freedom of information being limited and, more recently, the Auditor-General having his department taken away from him and his capacity to decide what areas need to be audited or not· removed from him. If he wants to talk about the casino, it is, 'No, thank you. We don't want you to talk about the casino.' In all those sorts of areas, we have seen the removal of independent sources of authority and power taken from Victoria and all power being centralised in the hands of the Premier. I think that that is not a very satisfactory development at all. I would not want to see us going down this path with the Public Service Bill before the House. The member for Blaxland pointed out the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which was a very significant report, and raised a number of important concerns about the changes that the government is proposing here. Essentially, that committee was saying that you have to beware of changes which turn the Public Service into government service, changes which destroy the Public Service as a career service, that we ought be concerned about the erosion of quality advice to government and the politicisation of that advice, and that we ought be concerned about the destruction of Public Service cohesion and the loss of Public Service values. I have to say that, in my 18 months or so as a federal MP, it has struck me that the Commonwealth Public Service remains very much more professional than the Victorian Public Service has become. I certainly would not want to see it change in that direction. The committee has been proposing quite a number of amendments to the Public Service Bill to ensure that we have remuneration of secretaries and agency heads fully open to public scrutiny, thereby reducing the chance of secret deals. I think it is most unsatisfactory to have salaries or salary packages kept secret. We also believe Public Service advice ought to be frank, comprehensive and accurate, not simply timely, and that we need to continue to recognise that the Public Service has to be accountable not only to government but also to parliament and the public. One of the concerns that was highlighted by many of the witnesses who came before that committee was the absence of an independent and binding appeal mechanism for public sector employees. The Public Service Commissioner's credentials as an independent arbiter were rightly questioned by that committee. When we look at the evidence before that committee, what it suggested was that there were problems with the abolition of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the existing appeal rights, that the government ought to maintain independent, binding appeal mechanisms in relation to selection, misconduct, inefficiency and grievances, and that, in the area of career service, the bill not prescribe any category of employment. That creates problems in a career service where permanent employment is the norm. We ought to have temporary or fixed term employment used only in very clearly defined circumstances and there-ought to be a clause on categories of employment included in the general employment conditions award. In the area of unfair dismissals, any process leading to termination of employment ought to be open and fair. The idea that there is a potential remedy for unfair dismissal under the Workplace Relations Act is not good enough. We need to have a process leading to termination being properly codified on a service-wide basis. We ought not to have the potential for employment conditions to be diminished simply by administrative action. Employment conditions should also not be reduced through changes in the structure of departments and agencies; they ought to be matters of service-wide concern and servicewide application. Representations were made for the definition of 'merit' to continue to be enshrined in the legislation and not simply left as a matter to be determined from time to time by the Public Service Commissioner. We also had submissions seeking protection for employees against arbitrary transfer. I think that is an important matter, because it is clear that if employees are subject to arbitrary transfer, then that is likely to limit the frank and fearless advice on which good government depends. Against that background, we see the prospect that these bills could cause the destruction of a cohesive Australian Public Service and could cause a significant loss of corporate memory over time as the notion of a career service is rapidly destroyed. Once again, this is something that has happened in the Victorian Public Service, where there has been a wholesale loss of corporate memory. Those people who worked for Melbourne Water, for example, are simply no longer there. That has had very adverse effects on good government. There is concern that these bills will result in reduced accountability and transparency in Public Service administration; in reduced does mobility between federal government agencies, and between those agencies and the parliament; and in reduced emphasis on a whole-of-government approach that will see increased ministerial involvement in APS employment matters and increased litigation on APS employment matters-all of those things being most undesirable. What we really need is a continuing focus on avenues for review and appeals which contribute to the embodiment of the APS principles of honesty, impartiality and integrity. These things serve as a check on parochial and potentially corrupt decision making. They also serve to ensure that staff are accorded natural justice in decisions which impact upon their employment in the Australian Public Service. The Public Service has long had quite substantial appeal mechanisms in relation to promotions, transfers and the like. There is doubt that, from time to time, those appeal mechanisms were used excessively; but, equally, there is no doubt that, when people were making staff selection and promotion decisions, they were mindful that these appeal and review mechanisms were in place. If you take out those appeal and review mechanisms, then you open up avenues for improper selection decisions to be made and for people to rort staff promotions and the like, knowing that there is no avenue of appeal and that they are not likely to be caught out. We are concerned about changes which would do away with those appeal mechanisms. I would also express some concern about proposals which do away with a central selection process. If we are serious about having open community merit based access to Public Service employment, then you really do need to maintain base level recruitment through a central selection process supplemented by agency specific secondary selection criteria. Recently, we had a private employment agency quizzing applicants for jobs in the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency about their views on the Prime Minister's 'work for the dole' scheme. We would see that as quite improper to be quizzing applicants about that kind of thing. It raises serious concerns about what happens when you devolve or outsource the recruitment practices of the Australian Public Service. Base level recruitment in the APS ought to continue to be coordinated across the APS to ensure maintenance of a cohesive Public Service and to enable government priorities such as reducing youth unemployment to be satisfactorily addressed and to guard against patronage and favouritism. In the area of termination of employment, a single power to terminate employment without reference to any grounds or process is not good enough. We need to have grounds for employment separation included in regulations, awards or certified agreements. The grounds for employment separation ought to cover issues such as resignation, redundancy, invalidity, inefficiency, disciplinary dismissal, loss of qualifications, abandonment of employment, and so on. Similarly, in the area of no retirement, the ability to vary the retirement age through regulation is unacceptable. It is an important public policy issue that ought to be the subject of parliamentary debate. The final point I will make reference to concerns the issue of protection for whistleblowers. Clause 16 provides that 'a person performing in or for an Agency must not victimise, or discriminate against, an APS employee who has reported breaches of the Code of Conduct' to the commissioner or an agency head, or to their authorised representative. That is a long way short of the coalition's 1996 public administration policy, which states: In accordance with the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing, a Coalition Government will introduce legislation to facilitate disclosures of confidential information in the public interest and to ensure protection for those who choose to do so. What the government is putting forward in the bill clearly falls a long way short of that policy. Labor has proposed that there be a capacity for whistleblowers to make disclosures to the Ombudsman. It is certainly my belief that we need to have appropriate mechanisms to protect whistleblowers. As many people in the House would be aware, all too often it is the whistleblower whose career suffers as a result of their indicating the wrongdoing of others-whether it be in the Public Service or in the private sector-rather than the actual wrongdoer. That is entirely inappropriate. If we are serious about making sure that we do not find corruption in the Public Service or elsewhere, then there ought to be proper protection for whistleblowers. While clause 16 represents a new provision, it seems to me that we ought to be looking at going further by way of providing proper protection for whistleblowers. Having outlined those concerns to the House, it is the intention of the opposition to move a number of amendments designed to improve the operation and the workability of this bill. I would ask honourable members to support those amendments.",34
15,Mr OCONNOR,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Corio) (11.29 a.m.)The Public Service Bill 1997 and the accompanying bills that are now being debated before the House are important pieces of legislation because they do set the framework in which the Australian Public Service will develop and operate over the next decade. These bills will influence greatly the culture of that Public Service, its efficiency and its ability to serve governments of whatever political persuasion in a fearless and impartial way and in the national interest. In past years Australia has been blessed with a very professional and impartial Public Service. So when a package of legislation comes before the parliament which seeks to fundamentally change the way in which that Public Service operates then, in the national interest, it should come under the great scrutiny of this chamber and the parliament. At the end of the day, an efficient Public Service means that you have an efficient and competent government. It is really the impartial and fearless advice coming from the Public Service that sets a bottom line for governments as far as their own competence and their own efficiency are concerned. When we view this package of bills before the House, there are some very real concerns that what is being proposed by the government may well have unintended consequences that might compromise that impartiality and efficiency which have been the hallmarks of the Australian Public Service to this point in our history. Over the last decade the Australian Public Service has gone through a period of rapid transformation, and that transformation took place under the aegis of governments of Labor persuasion. We make no apologies for that because I think the Australian public required governments to examine the operating efficiencies of the public sector and to seek, where they could, to get greater value out of the taxpayers' dollars, both in the programs that were being put before the Australian people and in the administration of those particular programs. I think those reforms that we introduced when in government were done with a degree of sensitivity and with an eye to maintaining that impartiality and fearless advice that comes from our federal Public Service. Although there were criticisms at the time of attempts to politicise the Public Service-and that came from the then opposition-I do not think the cries that came at that particular time are going to be anywhere near the public concern that is going to be expressed about the package of reforms that are now before the Australian parliament. We have a national Public Service which is acknowledged to be one of the best in the world. It is a technologically advanced service which employs sophisticated management systems, and it is a very professional service which has won the admiration of not only people in this country but others throughout the world. As Australia mourns the passing of one of its great public servants and great public figures, one is left to wonder and to muse whether, under the structures that are being proposed in this legislation, we will ever see public servants of the stature of Nugget Coombs emerge in Australian public life. Before any government contemplates reform of the federal Public Service, it must have some real understanding and appreciation of the special nature of employment in this sector. I do not think it is widely understood in the Australian community that there are different imperatives that exist in public sector employment compared with private sector employment. If the government does not appreciate these factors, it runs· a very grave risk in any reform program of compromising and even destroying some very important features of that Public Service. Governments must appreciate that public sector employees operate in a quite different environment to many private sector employees. They are certainly bound by different political constrains and the ethical base on which they must operate is very different also. What concerns me in this particular set of legislation is the way in which it greatly enhances the power of the Prime Minister over appointments to the top echelons of the Public Service. I think this is a concern that is being echoed throughout the length and breadth of the Australian community. Under this legislation, the Prime Minister will have the power to appoint departmental secretaries and to decide on their remuneration and conditions of employment. Baldly stated-and I do not think we ought to walk away from this particular fact-this will enable a governquite ment in power to politicise the Public Service far more than any previous government has had the ability to do so. I think it would be a tragedy for this coundeny try if governments were to walk down that road. One thing that has always prevented governments from walking down that road is a different set of arrangements which govern the appointment of public sector employees, especially those in the top echelons. We in government made certain changes to the way in which those in the top echelons were appointed, but this particular legislation further than anything that we did in office. concentrates enormous power in the hands of the Prime Minister and the secretary to his department over those particular appointments. At a time when government in Western societies and industrialised societies is extremely complex and at a time when governments need fearless and impartial advice, the people who are going to be giving that advice are going to be beholden to the government and to the Prime Minister to a greater extent than they ever have been in the past. I think that is a regrettable development. The consequence of what is being proposed will be that the Public Service will simply become the captive of the government of the day, and the frank and fearless advice that has flowed to ministers from that Public Service will be severely diminished. I do not propose to go into great detail on the legislation because that has already been canvassed by previous speakers in this debate, but in my concluding remarks I wish to pay tribute to the public sector employees in my electorate. In recent times they have borne a very heavy burden. That burden has been in the form of the restructuring of their departments, the introduction of new systems and new technologies, and significant downsizing in key regional departments where the workload has actually increased. I refer there to the old Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security. Those public servants in my electorate have diligently performed their duties in the face of adverse circumstance where they have had to cope with an increasing task with reduced numbers. One might say that this is a process that has occurred elsewhere throughout the Australian economy. I do not that, but I want to on the floor of this House today acknowledge the contribution of our public servants in Geelong and the Barwon region to the life of our community and to the delivery of very important services to residents in my electorate. There has been a general public perception, which has been built up over time, that public goes servants do not add value to their communiIt ties. Certainly in an economic sense their salaries make a very important contribution to the economic activity of my particular region and to many small businesses in my electorate. But more importantly-and we get away from the pure economic side of having a strong public sector presence in a regional economy-the services that are provided to residents by a professional Public Service are greatly appreciated by that community. On behalf of the Geelong community I want to put on the public record our thanks to those public sector employees for their contribution to our community. They have in the past been the subject of some ridicule. They have in the past been the subject of unfair criticism. I want to address that criticism in this debate today and say to those public servants that do we appreciate the contribution that you have made to our community. Under this legislation, the federal Public Service as we know it will be changed forever. Our concern when governments make these changes is that they do make them for the better and that they clearly understand the ramifications of what they are proposing. I am not convinced that the government fully understands the implications of this set of bills. I do not deny that the public sector must be subject to an ongoing process of reform and I do not deny that there are elements of this legislation where the government has attempted to come to grips with real reform issues, but there are substantial concerns with this legislation in that these bills will change fundamentally the way the Public Service operates in this country and we are not able to predict the positive outcomes that will flow from these pieces of legislation. I will be supporting the amendments that the opposition is proposing. They are proposed in good faith-not to wreck this piece of legislation but to improve it. That is the job that oppositions are entrusted to do in our parliamentary system and that is the basis on which these amendments will be put on the floor of this chamber and in the other place. The object of the amendments is to improve these pieces of legislation, not to wreck them. I hope the government will look at those amendments, take them on board and see that they can, in its own judgment, improve the legislation before the House.",38
16,Dr KEMP,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (11.42 a.m.)-by leave-This package of public service bills that the government has put before the House has been widely recognised as some of the great pieces of public employment legislation in the world. I know it has already attracted international attention. certainly attracted very favourable comment from expert commentators in Australia. The government is very proud of this package of legislation. This legislation reflects wide consultation by the government. It embodies the results of that consultation which has taken place across the chamber and with various voices in the community. The government believes that, as amended, as it will be by the amendments which I propose to move in the detailed consideration of the bill, the bill will then embody the agreement and consensus that exists on those matters across politics. A number of comments made by opposition speakers on this debate are disappointing to the government because we do not believe those comments do reflect the level of agreement that there is on this legislation. The opposition is proposing to move a number of detailed amendments to the legislation. I regret the fact that such a very large number of detailed amendments is being proposed by the opposition. I suspect the opposition has received the amendments in the post from the ACTIJ. I would like not to believe that they reflect the considered views of the opposition on this matter. The government is not going to accept the opposition amendments. We believe that the bill, as amended by the government in the course of this debate, will be an appropriate bill to provide a future framework for the Public Service. The government greatly values the Public Service. From Federation, the Australian Public Service was initiated by this side of politics. The very extensive tenure of the government benches, which this side of politics has had since Federation, and the way in which it has dealt with the Public Service refutes absolutely any suggestion that the coalition does not value the role of the Public Service as a fundamental institution in this society. The legislation that we put before the House will guarantee an apolitical Public Service which is there as a fundamental institution of Australian democracy and available to any government in the future. We believe that this legislation will provide It has successive Australian governments with a professional and impartial Public Service that will serve the interests of the people of this country. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",40

In the interests of saving time, and as I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, on the pessimistic assumption that these amendments will not pass the House, I therefore am not going to take a lot of time duplicating the debate which will take place in the Senate. Therefore, I have moved the amendments as circulated en bloc. These amendments seek to remedy the defects to which I drew attention in my speech on the second reading. In brief, these amendments seek to impose limits, we think reasonable limits, on the powers of agency heads and, in particular, seek to prevent them from taking action which would diminish any provision of an award or a certified agreement. The amendments also seek to ensure that advice is sought from the Remuneration Tribunal on the salary packages of agen-y heads and that these remain open to pubhc scrutiny. The amendments would ensure that members of the SES continue to have recourse to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations (and Other Legislation) Act. In the interests of fairness, the amendments will extend some of the obligations placed on APS employees to APS empl-yer-. !he amendments will enshrine the ment pnnclple in legislation. They will expand the APS values and strengthen protection of equal employment opportunity for disad-antaged groups. They will maintain a ment .based selection process for entry-level recrUitment into the APS and prevent the casualisation of the· APS work force. They will maintain the APS as a career service. They will ensure that executive agencies are fully justified and meet the same accountability requirements as departments and will provide age-c- heads with better protection from capnclOus or unfair dismissal. I acknowledge, as I did in the second reading debate, that the government has taken heed of some of the criticisms of its legislation which emerged during the examination of the bills by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The opposition welcomes those responses and, in particular, the positive response to the majority of the committee's recommendations. We also welcome the government's somewhat belated acknowledgment of the need to maintain an independent body to review employment decisions relating to APS employees but, as I indicated yesterday, we remain concerned that we have yet to see what responsibilities the government proposes to give the commissioner. I do not want to read too much into it, but I was a little concerned by such detail as was reflectsome ed in the nature of the minister's speech yesterday in the second reading d-bate. But we will wait until we see the detail. We are not prepared to sign off on a blank cheq-e, and we urge the government to provIde parliament with the draft regulations relating to the commissioner's powers before the bill is debated in the Senate. The Public Service Bill 1997 and the accompanying bills in this package are unacceptable to the opposition in their current form. If amended in the ways we propose, we believe they will achieve the objective of simplification without underrn-ning. the traditional values, ethos and professlOnahsm of the APS. For that reason, and in the interests of brevity, I commend these amendments to the House.",40
18,Dr KEMP,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Trai.ni-g and Y - uth Affairs and Minister Asslstmg the Pnme Minister for the Public Service) (11.50 a.m.)-The government welcomes the indications from the opposition that it supports reforms to remove the restrictions that bind the Public Service up in red tape and prevent it from operating efficiently. Unfortunately, in the amendments currently before the House I can find no indication that the opposition has really understood the need for that reform or really appreciates just what will be n-cessary if that reform is to become a realIty. Too many of the amendments that have been put forward really do no more than attempt to reintroduce the rigidities and inefficiencies that are the cause of the current problems. The opposition seeks to regulate and prescribe, to control from the centre and to ensure that whatever flexibilities we are attempting to provide to agency heads are removed or thwarted. These amendments will reimpose a rigid, mandated, service-wide set of outcomes that simply do not provide the capacity for agencies to tailor their operations to the needs of the clients they serve. In the course of the debate, there has been talk of the need for recognition of the foundations for a career service. The government totally supports that, but I note that under the existing legislation 90 per cent of APS promotions take place within agencies. That is scar-ely repr-­ sentative or reflective of a mobIle PublIc Service, which the legislation before the House is intended to achieve. The opposition argues incorrectly that their amendments are designed to constrain the government from an agenda driven solely by a hatred of public employment. That comment was made in the debate, and let me reiterate the point I made in my summing .uP speech that this is absolute nonsense. ThIs government values deeply the contribution of the APS to the functioning of Australian democracy. No government in this .country - a? function without a highly profeSSIOnal, apolItical Public Service, a Public Service with levels of expertise which are at least equal to-and one would hope exceed-those available elsewhere in the community and a Public Service with the assurance that it has the bipartisan support of all sides of this parliament. I can assure the - arliament and the opposition that our agenda IS to make sure that a career Public Service continues, together with the ethos that supports it-a professional and impartial Public Service that our best young Australians will want to join because it offers them an exciting and a motivating career working in the national interest. Unfortunately, the opposition's proposed amendments would only frustrate the reforms by proposing changes such as not simply retaining but actually expanding the current anachronistic appeal system, which even the Merit Protection and Review Agency sees as needing to change. These amendments would reintroduce appeal rights for senior officers which the opposition themselves had removed in 1987. They will extend appeal rights to cover not only promotions but also appointments when we are trying. to break out of this grievance driven culture which the current regulations have given rise to. The amendments prescribe detailed and inflexible requirements for agency workplace diversity programs. These requirements impose a high level of process on agencies without in any way guaranteeing the delivery of better outcomes. I see in these amendments the dead hand of an outdated industrial relations agenda. I would like to make a comment to the opposition about the nature of this agenda: what really does guarantee security to public employees? There has been a view, a philos-­ phy, if you like, which has permeated deCIsions in industrial agreements over the years. (Time expired) Amendments negatived.",46

The government, like its predecessor, recognises the urgent need to overhaul the legislation under which public servants work. The government is committed to broadening and accelerating the process of Public Service reform which was begun in the 1980s-a process of reform which we acknowledge was initiated by the previous government. That process of reform was in response to very clearly defined national needs. It is also a process of reform which I believe was urged on the previous government-as it has been on our government-by many leaders within the Public Service itself who recognise that they want to break out of the process driven, rule-governed culture which undermines leadership and management in agencies and which so frustrates many line public servants, including those public servants responsible for dealing with the public. Alan Kohler, a writer for the Melbourne Age, says of the bill before the House: It is one of the great pieces of government employee relations legislation-simple, clear and powerful He goes on to say that it offers an opportunity to tackle public sector reform in 'the most radical, most beautifully simple way yet'. As I have said, it has attracted international attention. The amendments that the govern the ment has now proposed on the advice of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which brought down a bipartisan, agreed report-,-and I congratulate the committee on its workend strengthen the bill without undermining in any way the fundamental integrity of the legislation. Many of the speakers from both sides of the House acknowledged-and we welcome that acknowledgment-that these amendments improve the bill. I would like to clarify that there is already a requirement to report aggregate salaries, including those of agency heads. This reporting requirement will continue. The amendments put by the government strengthen the bill in a number of ways. They extend the values by making it clear that the government wants an apolitical, impartial Public Service able to offer frank and fearless the advice. No government-and this is the final answer to the criticisms made by those on the other side of the House-can possibly benefit from having a process for appointing its advisers which does not secure to that government the best possible advice. A government which establishes a process which leads to secondor third-rate advice, which provides inducements to its advisers not to give it their frank and fearless advice, is a government which in the end is damaging its own future. Consequently, the legislation that we have put forward, building on the legislation of the previous government, we believe strengthens the apolitical character of the Public Service and the incentives for senior public servants io provide governments with the best possible advice. Through the amendments we are now proposing, the bill strengthens the role of the Public Service Commissioner to review, investigate and report. The amendments provide for an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, which I think is the best possible indication of the desire of this government to achieve wide support for this legislation throughout the Public Service. The amendments ensure that the remuneration of secretaries and agency heads is made public, and the amendments include a definition of 'merit' in the primary legislation. These and other amendments will ensure that we have a devolved public service, where leadership is possible, maintaining traditional values and subject to improved accountability. I commend the amendments to the House.",47
20,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"The opposition will be supporting the government's amendments to the Public Service Bill 1997. Our own amendments have already been defeated and, in some instances, we were seeking to amend the same clauses that the government is seeking to amend. We would, by definition, have preferred our own amendments, but they have already been put and defeated, so we will· be supporting the government's amendments as improvements. We acknowledge that these amendments, in large part, respond to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As I have indicated before, we welcome that. But, as we placed on the record in our response to the tabling of the JCPA's report on the Public Service bills, the committee's recommendations, valuable as they were, went only part of the way towards meeting the concerns that were raised by the vast majority of witnesses who appeared before the committee. Our own amendments, which we will be pursuing vigorously in the Senate, seek to respond fully to those concerns. I will now deal with some of the government's amendments in a little bit of detail. We support amendments Nos 1,2 and 3. We had an amendment to the same section as government amendment No.4, and we will pursue that one in the Senate. With regard to amendment No.5, we have no objection to the amendment but, on the face of it, we do not quite understand why the government thinks it is necessary. Either now or subsequently, could the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Dr Kemp) give some explanation of why that amendment is being put forward? It is not that we actually have a problem with it-we will be supporting itbut its rationale is not immediately obvious to us. I do not wish to comment on amendments Nos 6 and 7. Our amendment No. 31 dealt with the same matter as government amendment No.8, but we accept that amendment No. 8 is a marginal improvement on the clause as it stands. We will be pursuing our amendment in the Senate. I have no further comment on Nos 9 and 10 today. We would appreciate an explanation of the rationale for amendment No. 11. We will be supporting it at this stage as we understand it, but an explanation would be appreciated. I will come back to No. 12, because that is the one which I want to make the most comments on. We support Nos 13 and 16. Amendments Nos 14 and 15 we support on the basis that our amendments to those same clauses have already been defeated. I particularly draw the minister's attention to our position with regard to amendment No. 12. I have commented on this a couple of times and sought his response on it, but I have not as yet received one. This is the amendment which provides for the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, which we regard as a very positive development. We were disappointed that it was not in the original bill. We are pleased that it is now in the government's amendments. However, it leaves the vital issue of the functions of the Merit Protection Commissioner to as yet unseen regulations. I am seeking an assurance from the minister that the draft regulations will be provided to the non-government parties in the Senate prior to the debate on the legislation in that chamber. Our support for this amendment will depend on the content of those draft regulations. Our support in the Senate will depend on having those regulations available and on our assessment of their content. There is still potential for those regulations to be so inadequate as to render the clause insufficient to meet our concerns. But, for the moment, in the House we welcome the fact that it is a step in the direction of independent merit protection and, therefore, we welcome it, we are supporting it, but I seek that assurance from the minister.",50
21,Dr KEMP,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (12.05 p.m.)-Amendments Nos 5 and 8 to the Public Service Bill 1997 that the shadow minister referred to were recommended as a result of the consideration of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and responded to evidence given before that committee. Amendment No. 11 is necessary to ensure that changes in the classification rules can be picked up and that the commissioner's directions can embody those, rather than being frozen to the classification rules time. Those are the only points I want to make. Mr MCMullan-What about the regulations? Will we get them before the Senate deals with the bill?",51
22,Dr KEMP,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"We will certainly seek to get those to you.  to respond to a few of the remarks on the Public Service Bill 1997 made by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Dr Kemp) on the penultimate occasion that he spoke. Firstly, he referred to the APS as an appeal driven Public Service. I am probably one of the few members of the parliament who has actually sat on a Public Service appeals board. I assure the minister that, although it is some time since I fulfilled that function, not all promotions were appealed. I would be interested in any statistics he has. A very small minority of appeals were ever upheld. However, like any system of justice, it is important that we are concerned about that minority. Clearly, in my experience of the appeals board's operation, it was only when the appeals board was overwhelmingly convinced of an error in selection that a decision was made. The other comment of the minister's that I thought was very interesting was about the advising role of the Public Service. A very small minority of public servants are actually involved in the advising role. However, I concur with the minister that it is ultimately to the longer term detriment of any government if it is in receipt of poor advice. Given that there were changes to the contracts of permanent heads under the previous Labor government and given the rock solid notion of our system of government where there is a neutral Public Service-public servants are able with loyalty and dedication to serve governments of different political flavours-that made a break. I think it is a very dangerous practice for members of governments to seek to select people because they are his or her person in the bureaucracy, believing that they will somehow give better at a particular quality advice. I sincerely believe that the loyalty of the service at all levels is commendable. At the top levels of the Public Service there is a degree of professionalism. One of the most amazing things about our democracy is that, although at the last election there was a huge change in numbers as far as the government and this parliament were concerned, the Public Service was ready on day one to faithfully implement the policies of the incoming government. The minister outlined the impartiality he sees in the Public Service. I would be very grateful if he would explain why the Department of Administrative Services was abolished. There has been some media speculation that because the department advised the minister about strengthening members' accountability for their entitlements-that advice, regrettably, was ignored at the timethis was punishment. If that is the case it is pretty poor administration, but I am the first to acknowledge that Labor certainly did not leave all departments intact in its period of government. In terms of public servants advising, I reiterate that very few public servants are actually involved in a policy role. Overwhelmingly, public servants are involved in delivering to the coalface, as they say, the programs that governments have enacted and see as very important. I would be disappointed if, with successive changes of government, the incoming government had the ability to appoint to the Public Service their own particular flavour of advisers. Governments do have undisputed authority in this area in the selection of ministerial staff. It is not only the quality of ministerial staff which is a key factor; another key factor is the ability of ministers and their staff to establish healthy working relationships with departments.

23,Mr MCMULLAN,PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2: (\) Clauses 6 and 7, page 9 (line 21) to page 10 (line 23), omit the clauses, substitute: 6 Rights of firstand second-tier persons Firstand second-tier persons retain the rights conferred on them by the old Act, except for rights to reassessment for reintegraperiod tion or reappointment. (2) Clause 9, page II (lines 6 to 12), omit subclauses (2) and (3), substitute: (2) A continued determination may be amended or revoked by the Agency Head in the same way as if it had actually been made under section 24 of the new Act, provided that no provision of the determination is diminished or revoked unless that provision is rated in an award or certified agreement. (3) Unless it is sooner revoked, a continued determination (including any amendments made by an Agency Head under section 24 of the new Act) ceases to be in force on .the third anniversary of the commencing time. There will be a number of opposition amendments to the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 which will flow from the amendments we moved to the parent bill. We will be moving these amendments in the Senate, and I advise the House and, through it, other members and interested people, that we will circulate those amendments to other parties well in advance of that debate. Our examination of the consequential amendments has been delayed by the need to examine the very substantial and, I might say, voluminous government amendments to this bill which were circulated on Monday. There are, however, two amend1997 ments which do not fall into the purely consequential category, that is, amendments Nos 1 and 2 circulated in my name. The first of these amendments is to clauses 6 and 70n pages 9 and 10 of the bill. The amendment is designed to grandfather the rights currently conferred on firstand second-tier persons by the old act, with the exception of the right to reassessment for reintegration or reappointment which has largely fallen into abeyance in recent years. In particular, the most significant of the rights which this amendment deals with are the so called mobility rights: the rights of current and former public servants who are in public employment other than Public Service departments to return to employment in the Public Service. This bill provides for APS employees to retain their current mobility only for a transiall tional period. It does appear that the government is going to extend that transitional from that originally proposed, and that is welcome. But after that transitional period, such rights will become a matter of discretion for the head of the agency to which the relevant employee is attached. The opposition considers that the government's proposals on mobility amount to a retrospective removal of an important condiincorpotion of employment. Mobility rights have been an important consideration for many APS employees in deciding to accept offers of alternative employment. For example, many former employees of the Department of Veterans' Affairs would only have agreed to move to the privatised veterans' hospitals on the condition which was promised them that they had a right of return to the APS. Similarly, it is of immediate concern to me in my capacity as member for Canberra that it may well be the case-and before this matter gets to the Senate I will do some more research, because it is a matter I have been looking at only more recently-that many current employees of the ACT government would have made decisions about their employment with the territory government on the basis that they retained rights of return to APS. I know that initially that was the case. If nothing has occurred in the intervening period, then this would have a retrospective impact on the rights of those people, which is a cause of concern to me and will be a cause of concern to them. But we will have time to consider that in more detail in the Senate. The principle of the retrospective removal is that which we are most concerned about. It will have its particular impact in different circumstances on different individuals, and that will need more teasing out in the Senate debate. We are particularly concerned about the impact of the removal of mobility rights for people employed by ministers and opposition office holders under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. The opposition takes the view that governments and the Public Service have both benefited from the frequent movement of people between Parliament House and government departments. Parliament benefits from the knowledge of the bureaucracy that departmental officers bring with them, and departments benefit from the knowledge of the political, parliamentary and legislative processes that such people take back with them. The benefits far outweigh the slight inconvenience to Public Service managers caused by the uncertainty as to when former employees might seek to return. We believe this cross-fertilisation is actually good for our system of government and that it is something that should be encouraged rather than discouraged. It is something that should continue to receive easy and facilitated implementation rather than having obstacles put in the way. Therefore, I am concerned about these changes. It is that principle that led the previous government to initiate the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act in 1984. The mechanism for encouraging such cross-fertilisation is the preservation of mobility rights during the term of the so-called MOPS employment. (l!-xtensian oj time granted) Removal of these rights will discourage such movement, and I think that not just the parliament but the Public Service as a whole, the operation of government, will be the worse for it. I am sure the ministers and other office the holders here in the chamber would share my experience in six years as either parliamentary secretary or minister in which I gained tremendous value from drawing on the people who came out of the Public Service. Many of them went back into their departments during a three-year period and have gone on to discharge effective public service back in their former departments or in other departments, enhanced by their experience-not necessarily having learnt anything from me, I have to say-of being here in the parliament, being in the advisers' box, participating in those activities. I know this is not designed to stop that-and it will not stop it-but it will make it less convenient, comfortable and easy, and I think it is a mistake. I do not think it will achieve the purposes which the government is seeking. There is also an issue of natural justice here. Many MOPS employees have taken the decision to accept their current employment in Parliament House on the basis that they retain rights of return. Staffers know, particularly in the light of the recent changes to government ranks, that there is little security in political employment. Mobility rights compensate for this lack of security. I think there is going to be a problem in attracting the best people. It is a problem about the rights of those currently here, although the extension of the transition period seems to go some way to dealing with that aspect. If the government is determined to remove mobility rights, they should be removed only from APS employees who transfer to other eligible public employment after the entry into force of the new legislation in the prior knowledge that they will not have the right of return. Those who transferred on the basis that they enjoyed such rights should retain them. That is what our amendment No. 1 to clauses 6 and 7, which I have moved, is designed to achieve. I will be much more brief about the second amendment, the amendment to clause 9, which is designed to ensure that provisions of existing Public Service determinations which are given continuing force by this legislation can be diminished or revoked only if those same provisions are incorporated in an award or a certified agreement. The amendment also imposes a sunset period of three years on continuing determinations. This is consistent with amendments we have moved to the Public Service Bill 1997 which are designed to prevent agency heads from amending existing determinations covering conditions of employment in ways which diminish conditions which have been negotiated and agreed between employers and employees and incorporated in awards or certified agreements.",52
24,Dr KEMP,PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (12.21 p.m.)-The opposition proposes only two amendments to the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997. The first amendment seeks to extend indefinitely the firstand second-tier mobility rights of staff. The government has indicated that transitional arrangements will be available to staff exercising those rights, but our proposal will ensure that managers will be able to manage staffing with some certainty. This is really the principle which underlies a great deal of the bill-that if we are going to get the best out of the Public Service in terms of its leadership and in terms of the motivation and quality of the workplaces within departments, we have to move away from provisions which constantly create uncertainty for the managers of the government agencies. I was going to make a remark earlier about the desire for certainty and where certainty comes from in public employment. I will make that comment now so that it is on the record. There is a view that permeates the industrial relations culture in this country that certainty comes from specifying in greater detail what managers and agencies can do. The effect of this process over time is actually to undermine the institution. It destroys the capacity of managers to manage, it undermines leadership and, because the organisation becomes process driven, it undermines the quality of the work environment for those in the work environment and it increasingly inhibits the capacity of the institution to respond to the wider public and to its clients. While the effects of this process may only become clear over many years and decades, we have seen this in many institutions in this society. In the end, the pressure for change becomes absolutely irresistible. The reform that we are seeing across so many institutions in this economy is in many ways a response to the failure of this strategy to give security to people in our institutions. These days, Australia is in a highly competitive world. No-one in this world owes us a living. What gives us security is the excellence of our own performance. It is the quality of our institutions which, in the end, provides security in this country. It is the quality of Public Service agencies and the quality of leadership in those agencies which, in the end, gives maximum security to those leaders and to the people who staff the Public Service. That is the philosophy behind this bill. I believe that, in practice, this philosophy has been to a significant extent recognised on the other side of the House. It raises tensions for the opposition. On the one hand, they keep receiving advice from the ACTU that we must maintain this strategy of security through detailed regulation. On the other hand, they know, as the alternative leaders of this country, that they cannot offer the leadership they wish to when in government if this philosophy prevails. I appeal to the opposition that we have surely moved beyond that outdated philosophy and that they in government and we in government recognise the need for the kinds of reforms which are embodied in this legislation. Unfortunately, the amendments before the House do not recognise that change. They are an attempt to justify that out-of-date philosophy and the government does not support these amendments.  to make a couple of remarks on the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997. On the issue of mobility, it is absolutely vitaI-that we are able give public servants the opportunity to work in ministers' offices. When we look at the situation of ministers versus shadow ministers there is a degree of inequality in that, for example, DLOs are effectively on loan from the department to the minister and their subsequent return is not a problem-as the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) pointed out. I hope that the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), has not lost the experience of being in opposition. It is very important that an opposition-who compared to a government have a great inequality of resources at their disposal-also have the opportunity, should they choose, to have members of the APS working for them in an advisory role. Not only is it oppositions or government ministers who benefit from these arrangements but also the individual garners a degree of experience from the exercise. As the member for Canberra pointed out, it benefits that individual in their subsequent career. Whilst that is not prohibited under these arrangements, it is made more difficultparticularly if that public servant is working for a shadow minister. The government ought to take a second look at it. I was interested in the remarks the minister made about certainty. I do not think that certainty is the biggest problem in the Public Service. I can remember trying to deal with a problem in my electorate of people, who fall under his portfolio responsibility, who do not fit into Skillshare or any of the other available labour market programs and had a variety of problems. We actually got then Minister Baldwin to come out there. The people we needed there were from nine different departments, both federal and state. Probably the biggest challenge in the Public Service is the fact that so many programs are singular and program driven. Whereas, to effect a solution where there are cross-portfolio responsibilities and trying to coordinate those on the ground, back in electorates, is so difficult. Then you have federal, state and sometimes local government overlaps. The bill does not address these issues. I believe to the real challenge for the future is how you deliver programs that are not singular portfolio programs but are ones which have this federal-state overlap as well.

The amendments deal with consequential and transitional matters arising from the repeal of the Public Service Act. These amendments repeal and amend, as appropriate, a wide range of legislation in order to achieve a number of purposes: to reflect changes in staffing provision; to remove obsolete references; to remove references to certain rights in relation to leave; to reflect changes to remuneration and allowance provisions to superannuation legislation; to remove references to reciprocal mobility; to change terminology used in other legislation; to incorporate a range of technical and miscellaneous changes; to ensure an appropriate link to the new Australian Public Service legislation. These amendments reflect a great deal of hard work on the part of officers to track through consequences of this legislation on many other aspects of legislation. While there are quite a number of these placed before the House, I think the officers are to be commended for their diligence in undertaking the extraordinarily painstaking and detailed work that is reflected in the amendments that come before the House. These amendments also include additional matters that fall into the categories ly mentioned but which were omitted from the bill on its first presentation, just simply because of the ramifications, complexities and detail involved in them. I commend the amendments to the House.",55
26,Mr MCMULLAN,PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT,"It sounds very simple when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) says that there are only five amendments to the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997. Our problem is that there are 101 pages of detail in these amendments. I accept that many of them are veryDr Kemp--You haven't read them very carefully. Mr Martin-He has actually; that is your problem.",105
27,Mr MCMULLAN,PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT,"I read enough to find out that lots of them are just changes in nomenclature, which I am sure, after he has had a chance to read the whole thing, there will be no problem with. My colleague, the shadow minister responsible for public administration, is continuing to pore over them in substantial detail. These amendments are giving effect to provisions of the parent bill. We will be opposing the parent bill, so obviously, on that basis, we are not enthusiastic about the amending bill itself. But, apart from the amendments we have already moved, there is no particular sin in the amendments themselves as we have been able to divine at the moment. As I say, many of them are simply tidying up nomenclature, and I' understand why, in a big and complex drafting task, there are always those sorts of things we need to come in and fix up. There is always a tendency here to stand up and say that the need to read 10 1 pages of amendments shows how lousy the original job was. I can remember it being said about me in the past, and I suppose it is a pity that I am missing the opportunity to say it about someone else. Nevertheless, it always happens. We will formally be opposing these amendments because of our concern about the primary bill . itself, but the detailed consideration will be I previousfor the Senate. Amendments agreed to.",105

These amendments mirror those we moved to the Public Service Bill, and we will come to those which mirror those in the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill. Inasmuch as those amendments are applicable to the Parliamentary Service they do not raise new issues of principle; they are those same issues reflected in this necessarily separate bill to deal with servants of the parliament, so there is no need to expand on the questions of principle. They are the same issues, and they will be pursued in more detail when the Senate consideration comes forward.

As the shadow minister says, they mirror the amendments that were moved earlier to the Public Service Bill. I just simply make the point that, while the opposition does support the independence that is for the first time provided to the parliamentary departments, once again we see this apparent desire to tie up that independence in new layers of prescription and control. I believe this is unfortunate, and therefore the government will not be supporting the opposition amendments. Amendments negatived.",110

The government is pleased to hear that the opposition supports the proposed tenure arrangements for the clerks.

Obviously, as we are at this point in the debate, the opposition was not intending to move, and did not move, amendments to the Parliamentary Service (Consequential Amendments) Bill in the House, but in the Senate we will be moving amendments to reflect the amendments that we have moved to the principal bill. That is a process which is under way. We will circulate the amendments as soon as we can. There is no point in delaying in any way the proceedings of the bilI through this House for purpose of amendments to this bill, but we will be moving amendments in the Senate.

35,Mr MILES,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (12.43 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be disagreed to. I want to make some general comments and then I will go through each of the 10 particular amendments and make some specific comments to those amendments. At the conclusion of a speech given by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on II December 1996, he said: ... the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. It is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will change: the way in which elections are conducted; the way in which policies are implemented; the way in which future generations are brought into consideration in economic decision making; and our economic policy for the better. The situation now is that we have had 10 amendments proposed to us from the Senate. We believe the legislation, which we brought into the parliament, fulfils the changes which we believe will happen from this charter of budget honesty. I think all members are aware that this piece of legislation has been introduced due to the fact that at the last election the previous Labor government had been assuring Australians that the accounts were in balance. However, when we came into government there was a $10.5 billion deficit. As the Prime Treasurer said, we inherited this problem. It has become our responsibility to fix it and the mismanagement which the then government sought to hide. We believe that this bill will achieve that outcome. It is for those reasons that we are rejecting each and every one of the proposed amendments. Amendment No. I broadens the principles of sound fiscal management to include a whole range of aspects of Australian life, and they are listed in the amendment. This amendment is unnecessary as these issues are already, and we believe more appropriately, covered in clause 4 of the bill. That clause provides that fiscal policy should be directed to maintain the ongoing economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. In the amendments there is reference to full employment, overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia, maintenance of improvement of real wages and so on. We believe that clause 4 covers that, so it is unnecessary to have that clause amended. Amendment No.2 requires that this report be prepared annually. Clause 12 of the bill already requires that material threats to the fiscal outlook, quantified where feasible, be outlined in a statement of risks. This requirement would unnecessarily add to this statement. Secondly, the amendment also draws the attention of tax planners to weaknesses and the anomalies in tax legislation risking larger losses in revenue than would otherwise be the case. The timing for this statement is also difficult as loopholes would be identified at the same time as the budget, which really is the major point at which revenue decisions are generally made. To alert tax planners to some of the difficulties which governments face would not be very wise at all. Amendment No.3 requires an intergenerational report to be produced within three years instead of the five which is mentioned in the bill after the commencement of the act and thereafter within three years of the public release of the preceding report. It is not appropriate to require the release of reports at a greater frequency than five years as the assessments of the long-term sustainabiIity of policy are unlikely to change quickly. Assessments in an intergenerational report will be more affected by factors such as demographic change and Australia's long-term growth potential rather than short-term budgetary and economic developments. (Extension of time granted) Also, the bill only prescribes a minimum reporting frequency, and that does not prevent governments from releasing reports more frequently if appropriate. Amendment No. 4 requires responsible secretaries to jointly release a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report two years and nine months after the first sitting day of the House of Representatives following the previous election. If an election is called before then, a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report would be required within five days of the issuing of the writs for a general election. Our response to that sort of proposal is that, in the case where a report produced two years and nine months after the first sitting following an election, the amendment would allow economic and fiscal developments in the subsequent months prior to an election announcement to go unreported. This would be inconsistent with providing up-todate information on the economic and fiscal output to the electorate prior to an election. In the case where an earlier election is called, preparing a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report within five days of the issuing of writs is impractical. A minimum period of 10 days is required for a report to be produced. I think that is important in that there has to be some reality to legislation which is brought into this place and the requirements on governments. To do something within five days is really impractical. Even 10 days is going to push either side, whoever they might be, to do that task. That is the reason we are rejecting that clause, along with the other reason mentioned. Amendment No.5 requires ministers to not participate in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report other than to provide needed information. Briefly, the amendment is not necessary as the bill already requires that the Treasury and Finance secretaries must sign off on the report stating that it reflects the best professional judgment of officers of their department. Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8 and 9 will allow the possibility of the departments of Treasury and Finance costing unannounced policies for the government and opposition in the caretaker period prior to an election. I emphasise that it is unannounced policies. Further, the amendments allow for the making of requests for costings by the Leader of the Opposition to be authorised by the Prime Minister but that the details of the policies being costed need not be disclosed to the Prime Minister. They also provide that the details of policies which are the subject of a request by the Leader of the Opposition shall not be disclosed by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance to anyone not authorised by the Leader of the Opposition. The secretaries may decline to prepare costings under any request where they is consider that policy advice is being sought. We believe the amendments will result in the loss of transparency in the costing process and that that lack of transparency from the amendments is also inconsistent with clause 31 of the bill. This clause requires that all policy costings are made public by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance as soon as practicable before polling day. As requests for the costing of unannounced policies would be permitted, requests could made for a range of alternative policy options to be costed. This risks placing the departments of Treasury and Finance in the position of developing policy for the opposition inconsistent with the usual conventions. It could also add substantially to the workload of departments which could be required to cost a myriad of alternative options. The last amendment, amendment No. 10, requires that policy costings must indicate that assumptions have been used and explain any limitations on the methodology used. This amendment is unnecessary as costing guidelines issued by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance for the preparation of policy costings provided for in subclause 31 would detail such processes. So it is unnecessary and would be redundant to do so. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12.52 p.m.)-The opposition finds it very disappointing indeed that the government has taken the course just indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) of opposing all the amendments produced by the Senate to the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996. The opposition, outright to 10 highly reasonable, highly sensible, long debated, carefully debated amendments agreed to by the Senate, shows that this charter of budget honesty is not the brave and brilliant new contribution to integrity in government and enhanced quality of democracy that it is claimed to be by the government but is rather a straight-out political stunt. The government simply do not want to entrench a superior system of accountability with this legislation. They want to give the appearance of reform but they do not want to deliver its substance. And they certainly do not want to do anything that would operate even-handedly as between the government and opposition of the day and, in so doing, enhance the quality of democratic debate and accountability. The clearest demonstration of the points I have been making-there are many ways that I can make the points and I will on the way through-was the rejection by the government of our proposal in the Senate right at the outset that the charter be legally binding. The way it is drafted at the moment, the legislation is not enforceable at all through the courts. There are no penalties at all for non-compliance. We attempted in the Senate to make the charter enforceable. The government has refused to accept that position. The government itself in doing so has acknowledged that really the whole charter is optional. The notion of an optional charter of budget honesty, while entirely consistent with the optiondebate al approach to honesty that this government has adopted in its last two budgets, does make a farce of the government's rhetoric in this area. The second demonstration of our good faith in all of this-before we come to the actual amendments-was our proposal in the Senate for the budget documents to contain, among other things, an estimate of the effect of the budget measures on national savings. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has repeatedly taken other occasions to tell the House-I note again that he is absent from this debate as he so often is when matters of this kind are being debated in this place-that the overriding objective of budget policy is to increase the level of national savings. Surely, in legislation which purports to be designed to improve budget transparency, it is not unreasonable that the government be asked to attempt to quantify the effect of its budgets in achieving such a key objective. The government, however, succeeded in excluding this key measure that we are proposing from the legislation. Whereas previously it recruited Senator Harradine to defeat the earlier matter I referred to, on this occasion it recruited one of the Greens, Senator Margetts, who I think took the view that anything to do with saving transparency was a form of economic rationalism and therefore to be treated with the utmost suspicion as a result. But, whatever the reason, we lacked a majority on this particular amendment. The key point I am making about the government's response is simply this: what was the government afraid of in putting a provision of this kind into the legislation? We were perfectly happy to have information included in the budget documentation about what the estimated effect on savings would be. Why was the government opposed to such a fundamental proposition? What is the Treasurer afraid of? Why shouldn't the public be able to know what the effects of the budget are on national savings? Why shouldn't the Treasurer then be held accountable to whatever targets are included? Unless the government has answers to these questions, it really approaches this whole with no credibility at all. I invite the parliamentary secretary to give those answers now on this occasion, if he feels so minded to. But if he does not feel minded to, as he has just indicated, I will continue by now turning to the specific amendments before the House. The first amendment goes to the 'principles of sound fiscal management' so-called that are set out in part 3 of the bill. (Extension of granted) This amendment is fundamentally important in terms of the objectives of the government-we believe of any government. We believe that fiscal policy should be directed to worthwhile community goals not just accounting outcomes. Why do governments set fiscal objectives? They do so to ensure that broader objectives can be achieved. What we wanted to do with Senate amendment No. 1 was to add to the principles of sound fiscal management, as set out in clause 5, a minimum of two further paragraphs, which are very familiar because they are contained within the Reserve Bank legislation as to the obligations which the bank has to take into account in its role in relation to monetary policy. The amendment in question requires accordingly the government to have regard to, firstly, the achievement of. full employment in Australia and, secondly, the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. Those principles do add a humanising element to the principles of sound fiscal management rather than presenting fiscal management as wholly a matter of fixation on accounting bottom lines, which is the case with the present bill. Of course it is appropriate that a statement of principles of fiscal management recognise, address and require commitment to those accounting criteria. That is absolutely fine. We do not want to remove them. But it is also the case that they should recognise that the application of fiscal management techniques has a very real impact on the lives and welfare of people. For people's welfare to be enhanced and for their prosperity to increase, there has to be a focus on the achievement of full employment and there has to be a focus on the achievement of economic well-being. The pursuit of better employment outcomes should be a key priority of this government. It hardly needs me to point out on this occasion-but, nonetheless, I will do so-that that has not been the case, that the government's record in relation to employment has .been absolutely woeful and this does represenuhe biggest economic and social problem now confronting this country . We have not even time stayed still on the jobs front; we have gone backwards since this government came to office. There was the creation of an employment committee of cabinet to deal with this issue. That whole enterprise has been an utter and spectacular failure. What these amendments seek to do is simply, without labouring that point any longer, compel the government to focus on these key issues of national welfare, as they are obviously not doing at the moment, and to do so in a budgetary context, as they are obviously not doing at the moment. I frankly regard it is as unbelievable, and I think the community would regard it as unbelievable, that the government would not accept this amendment, because to do so indicates as clearly as anything possibly can that they simply do not support improved employment and national welfare outcomes; they do not see that as part of any government's budget or fiscal responsibility. The second amendment, which we would also very much want to see embraced and adopted, is also a very important one which we would hope would have the unanimous support of the members of this House. The integrity of the tax base is absolutely fundamental to the delivery of adequate public services. Taxes are obviously necessary to finance public services and these are most fairly raised when everyone able to contribute does in fact contribute in a fair and honestly administered system. Ensuring the integrity of the tax base is therefore crucial to ensuring that taxpayers are all paying their fair share. What amendment (2) does is simply require the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of any of these threats as a permanent and as an integral part of fiscal reporting. This is obviously an important proposal because it will allow the government, and especially the Treasurer, to be held accountable for the conduct of tax policy. There can be few duties of higher importance for the Treasurer than to maintain a fair tax system. As I have said, it is absolutely critical to that that the current tax be maintained. We are concerned to ensure that the concerns, as they evolve in the revenue authorities, are made public to enable scrutiny of the Treasurer's performance in his duty of protecting the public revenue. The tax commissioner can advise the Treasurer on matters that should be undertaken to maintain the tax base, but, as things stand at the moment and no doubt will remain, he has no power to force the Treasurer to act in the national interest. The discretion is all with the Treasurer to either accept or reject the advice of the tax office and the Treasury, all in comfortable secrecy. (Extension of time granted) That secrecy, of course, is what the Treasurer like the present one relies upon to act against the advice, solemnly and sincerely given on occasion, by his tax office and by his own department. There has been no clearer demonstration of the Tre;asurer acting in this way than in relation to the family trusts tax rort which the Treasurer has now allowed to continue, as a result of his initial announcement on 13 May this year, has now embraced in legislation which we were debating here last week and to which I have been referring ever since in question time. The continuation of an exemption for injections of income by non-beneficiaries in family trusts to enable them to, in effect, traffic in trust losses and pay no tax on income derived by them in completely separate circumstances from those relating to the trust itself is one of the more extraordinary and indefensible tax avoidance loopholes to have been left open in recent times. There is no public policy justification for There has been none articulated in this place. It is manifestly against the advice of the Treasury and the tax office. We know that, not least because advice on this issue was very squarely given to the previous Treasurer, Ralph Willis, in our government. There was no question of us allowing that particular exemption or loophole to continue. This government has chosen to do so. We can only speculate as to the reasons for it-that it is of manifest benefit to high wealth individuals in the community as a whole, that it is of manibase fest benefit to the up to 19 members of this government's front-bench who do in fact have family trusts. I mention that not in order to, again, make a meal of it in the context of the present debate, but to indicate how important it is that threats to the integrity of the tax system be openly identified, as part of a system of fiscal reporting of the kind that this legislation says it stands for, where all of this is open and transparent and where it is designed to improve the quality of public administration, and in particular fiscal administration, in this country. The amendment that the Senate proposed does not seek to alter the Treasurer's right to make tax policy on behalf of the government. What it does do is seek to ensure that material threats to the tax system, not least those created by the actions of the Treasurer himself, are codified in a systematic and public basis, so as to enable the performance of the Treasurer in dealing with these revenue threats to be much more openly and readily evaluated than is the case at the moment. Of course it is the case that future Treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of their revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their actions or their lack of actions, they will not be able to hide the nature of that advice and the fact that they are not complying with it from the Australian people. And if you are serious about budget honesty, that is exactly the kind of thing you ought to be prepared to put into this legislation. Clause 12 of schedule 1, as it is currently worded, only includes some references to the sorts of risks that may have a material effect it. on the fiscal outlook. There is a reference in very general terms. What is not there-and this is the nub of the argument for this amendment-is an explicit reference to particular threats posed to fiscal outcomes due to the integrity of the tax system coming under sustained attack. In the Senate, in opposing this measure, Senator Kemp made two particularly ludicrous claims which ought to be acknowledged on the public record. His first ludicrous claim was that the few pages of information that do now exist in the statement of risks in Budget Paper No. 1 actually cover this issue. This is absolute rubbish. What we envisaged is that this independent statement by the bureaucrats will not be the generalised language of the kind that has been traditional in that section of Budget Paper No.1, but, as I have said, a much more detailed statement about specific schemes and specific issues which will complement the broad information that has already been provided. Secondly, Senator Kemp advanced the ludicrous notion that publication of information about schemes or other threats to the tax base would in fact increase their use. The point is that the tax office does not dream up theoretical schemes. What the tax office and Treasury do is detect taxpayer behaviouroften many years, unhappily, after it has become established practice-and then advise the government of the problems and the possible solutions. It is simply wrong to suggest that the tax office could advise, by this means, the tax industry on ways to avoid tax. In practice, of course, it is absolutely other way around; the sequence of events works quite differently. If the proposition that is contended for in defence of the government's position here were to prevail, the tax office would never take any taxpayers to court on the basis that a loss would alert taxpayers to possible schemes. Clearly, that is utterly absurd and at odds with current practice. (Extension of time granted) What we do know is that the tax system and the threat to its integrity is under constant and sustained attack. In some instances this is as a result even of the government's own legislation directly opening up loopholes or deliberately leaving them open. Again, I refer in that context to the family trust losses legislation before this parliament. In other cases it can arise through a lack of action on tax avoidance through such means, for example, as allowing salary repackaging by senior public servants. We believe that the risks to the integrity of the tax system are always going to exist. It is a recurring problem that every government has to confront. We do believe in that context that one way of ensuring that those risks are properly dealt with is to ensure that the government can be held accountable for inaction. That is the point of this amendment. That is why we insist upon it. That is why we are very disappointed, and I think the community will be very disappointed, that the government has taken the path that it has. I can be briefer about some of the remaining amendments, but not necessarily all of them. Amendment No. (3) goes to intergenerational reporting. This amendment changes the frequency of the proposed intergenerational fiscal reports from five years back to three years. This one was actually moved by the Democrats but it was supported by us in the Senate. What it does is to ensure that there will be such a report, in effect, during every normal term of parliament-at least once in the life of that parliament. The reporting framework of three years that is here proposed does in fact align with the other long-term fiscal report which is already presented to this parliament, namely, the report by the government actuary into the the long-term costs of the Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation funds. Those reports are prepared every three years and we consider this to be taking into account that kind of precedent-an appropriate interval for updating reports to be released. We hope very much the government reconsiders its position on that amendment. But all the available evidence is, of course, that it will not and that is unfortunate. Amendments Nos (4) and (5) both relate to the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report which the legislation proposes to require. What amendment No. (4) does is seek to replace and improve the proposed provisions for a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report that is published prior to an election. The bill itself proposes, as the parliamentary secretary said, that within 10 days of the issue of writs for an election the responsible economic bureaucrats produce a report to inform the electorate of the economic and fiscal outlook as it is likely to be after the election. The amendment proposes that instead of waiting until an election is called, in the case of a parliament that looks likely to see out full term, that report should be published in the normal way two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of a new parliament. If an election should be called prior to that time, then we argue in the amendment that the report be produced not within 10 days but five. We moved this amendment for the very simple reason that if a pre-election economic and fiscal report is to be published, then for it to be genuinely useful and genuinely contribute towards public debate, genuinely enable policy commitments and so on to be reconsidered in the light of the information which it contains so that better promises, more credible promises are made, such a report needs to be available on a very timely basis, as soon as is practicably possible. This system should certainly not be set up in such a way as to enable such a report to be used as a political tactic by the government of the day simply in order to advance its own political agenda. Obviously, the later such a report is released the more beneficial it will be to the government and the less opportunity it will allow to the opposition to consider its position in the light of it. The opposition and other non-government parties, and Independent members, will be denied a reasonable time in which to respond to the issues and possibly adjust policy on the basis of the issues that the report has raised. It is a matter of weighing and balancing on the one hand, as the parliamentary secretary has said, the point you want the outlook report to be as accurate as possible, and always the later you leave such a report the more accurate it is likely to be in forecasting, predicting or projecting a course of events in the future. But that really does, in our judgment, have to weighed off against the obvious advantage to the government of the day in having such a report dropped as late as possible-because you very well know all along the material that is embodied in it, even if it is not publicly made available-and, on the other hand, the adverse impact this has on the political capability of the opposition. (Time expired)",113
36,Mr MILES,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) its (1.12 p.m.)-I took about 10 minutes to get through this. I have been generous in allowing you 15 minutes. You can keep going, but I remind you that we would like to get through this legislation as soon as possible.",119
37,Mr GARETH EVANS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I am indebted to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) for making that point. There can be no more important legislation, frankly, before this parliament at the moment and I am frankly determined to say what I want to say, succinctly, but, nonetheless, with the necessary degree of detail to make the point as to why we are going to divide on these amendments and why we are going to insist upon them. We could, of course, have the potential here for a double dissolution piece of legislation. It is only reasonable under these circumstances, should the Senate insist on these amendments-as I hope it will-that the public be well informed as to what the issues are. I have been making the point about the reason why we want these reports to be produced as soon as possible-in order to keep some serious balance between their utility to the government of the day and the opposition. There is a practical question, as the parliamentary secretary said, as to whether they can be prepared within five days as distinct from the 10 days in the legislation. I am one of those people, after 13 years as a that cabinet minister, who has a great confidence in the capacity of the bureaucracy, not least the Finance and Treasury bureaucracy, to do what is necessary in these situations. They keep this data prepared on pretty much a rolling basis and I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that they can produce credible and effective reporting within five days. The point is that if the government is serious about presenting timely and relevant data to allow a fully informed electorate, then the opposition's amendment should, here as elsewhere, be supported. Amendment No. (5), which is associated with this-it is again a Democrat oneproposes to ensure beyond doubt that ministers are forbidden from participating in the preparation of a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report. From the way it is set up in the legislation, it is apparent that it is the intent that this report not be a political document but a genuinely objective assessment by capable bureaucracy as to what the outlook will be. If that is the intention of the government, there should be absolutely no reason why the government would reject making clear that that is the intention, in a bipartisan way, by agreeing to this amendment. If the government are opposing this amendment, they are conceding that they support the possibility of political interference; and, again, that is something that I think is utterly at odds with the title of this legislation and its purported role in improving the quality of government in this country. Amendments (6) and (7) go to the heart of the opposition's concern here about this legislation. They concern requests about the costing of election commitments. The particular amendments sought by the Senate are very short in terms of their verbal impact-they require only the deletion of a couple of words from two separate clauses-but they are enormously significant in terms of the substantive impact of all of this. They go to the heart of the question as to whether this legislation is really concerned to improve the quality of public administration and democratic debate in this country, or whether it is really all about just giving political advantage to the government of the day. I hope the coalition, given its current political fortunes, might just stand back a little now and think about what it would be like for it to be in opposition contesting an election in 4Y2 years time, as no doubt it will be with these particua lar provisions confronting it. Let me explain what I mean. Part 8 contains the proposed costing regime. Clause 29, at the moment, is the major clause which sets the ground rules for the costing of election commitments after an election has been called during the so-called caretaker period. The government have been very devious in framing these provisions. They are pretending that they are improving access to the costing resources of the bureaucracy-the economic departments-when they are proposing to create avery, very severe set of practical and political difficulties for the opposition of the day. In the form in which the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 was introduced, only publicly announced policies can be costed, that is to say, the opposition has to formally announce a policy before it is entitled to get a cost estimate from the bureaucracy during the caretaker period. There is no provision at all to get costing advice earlier than the caretaker period. It may, of course, be the case that official costing indicates that the financial impact of the policy is significantly different from that which has been assumed by the opposition. Even the most competent opposition with the resources available to it does find it very, very difficult to produce estimates of economic and financial impact of a lot of measures with anything like the same precision as is possible for a bureaucracy. That is just in the nature of affairs; it makes no concession about our inadequacy or the inadequacy of any opposition. It is just a reflection of reality. We say that, under those circumstances, it is simply not reasonable to force an opposition to publicly announce a policy about the precise fiscal implications of which it may be unsure. (Extension of time granted) The further political dynamic that, of course, will operate here is that, if the opposition has publicly announced policies-as it will indeed have to, given ordinary political realities-the mere existence of this particular clause in the legislation will create a source of political pressure for the opposition to seek costing of it from the bureaucracy, even though the dynamics are such that nobody can be sure what the outcome of that costing will be or the political consequences of a costing that does not conform with the opposition's own estimates. So it is a very neat little dilemma that has been constructed for the opposition of the day. I do not think that it is, in any way, an inadvertent consequence of this legislation. I am absolutely sure it is a deliberate consequence of the way in which the legislation has been crafted. If it is not a deliberate intention, the government ought to be prepared to listen to-as the Senate did-and think through what we are proposing by way of amendments and act graciously and decently accordingly. If you are serious about this being a piece of legislation designed to improve the overall quality of public administration and the overall quality of democratic debate and democratic accountability, you would not be a creating a legislative regime which has inbuilt necessary disadvantages for the opposition of the day. We happen to be the opposition of the day at the moment. It is not going to be very long before you, the coalition, find yourselves in exactly that situation and you will be just as worried about the imbalance and unfairness of this once you are in this particular situation. So I ask you, in all seriousness, to listen carefully to what I am saying. The fact is that this legislation does massively favour the government because the government has access to the economic bureaucracy resources continuously throughout its entire tenure in government simply by virtue of being the government. That means that the government can refine, to its heart's content, its proposed policies with the assistance of costing advice from those departments without any question of those policies having to be publicly announced. You can test them; you can work out the costing implications; you can refine them; and you can change them without having to go through the business that the opposition is being forced to by this requirement that policies be publicly announced. Sure, the public announcement criterion applies equally to the government once you are in the caretaker period, but a government, by virtue of being a government-even one as incompetent as this onewould obviously have all those tasks well and truly done before it takes the step itself-it is in its hands-of calling the election. The effect of the bill is to force tion to release publicly its policies before they are costed if we want them to be cos ted or if we are under the kind of pressure which means that they will, in effect, be thought to have to be costed. It is fraught with danger for any opposition to be forced to announce policy decisions on the basis sometimes of quite incomplete information which exposes it to real political disadvantage. This particular provision is of no advantage to the opposition, but it is of tremendous benefit to the government, and that ought to be understood by anyone who is trying to work out what this debate is all about. Our amendments-the Senate amendments...,-simply seek to inject some equity and fairness into this costings business so that the government and the opposition have access to advice on costings, regardless of whether the policies have been publicly announced or not. Ideally, we would have access to such advice earlier on in the electoral term rather than just being confined to the caretaker period. That was not to be, in terms of the Senate's willingness to embrace that, but at least the legislation would be very substantially improved by this amendment being carried for the caretaker period. Amendment (8) goes to the question of pre-election costings as well, but it seeks to remove from the Prime Minister the discretion, which is presently granted in clause 29 of the bill, to decline a request from the opposition for a costing to be made by the relevant departmental secretary, and to eliminate the proposal, which is there in the original bill, that the Prime Minister should actually be given a copy of the opposition policies concerned. We say that it is entirely inappropriate in the first place that the government, through the Prime Minister, should have any discretion on the question of whether or not opposition policy costings are to in fact proceed. It surely should be the case that, if those costings are to be done, they should be done free of government influence, and free of the perception of influence, in the interests of proper and open public debate, not in the interests of the government of the day. (Exthe oppositension of time granted) The amendment does recognise that there are some Westminster formalities to be observed, and it incorporates a requirement that access to the economic department secretaries is still through a request made to the Prime Minister. However, what amendment (8) does achieve is to remove the requirement that the Prime Minister be provided with a copy of the policies to be costed. There is no requirement under our amendment of disclosure of the relevant details, and that is exactly as it should be. Amendment (9) adds two new subclauses, 29(6) and 29(7), which will grant the responsible secretaries a discretion to decline to provide advice where this would include policy advice. This amendment is a clear demonstration, I hope the House will acknowledge, of the opposition's good faith. We would find useful, I guess, policy advice coming out of the bureaucracy in the guise of a costings exercise. But, just as it is not appropriate during the caretaker period, as is accepted on all sides, for the bureaucracy to provide policy advice to the government during that period, so too, we think, in the interests of even-handed public administration, it would be inappropriate for policy advice to be able to be provided to the opposition. We are saying in this amendment that the discretion should be left in the hands of the relevant departmental secretary whereby if, in the secretary's opinion, he or she considers a request to be more in the nature of one seeking policy advice than a policy costing exercise, he or she can rightly decline to undertake the request to the extent that it encompasses policy advice. That will ensure that the bureaucracy is not compromised between serving the government of the day and providing information to the opposition that has a policy character. A further change that the opposition seeks via new subsection (7) is to ensure that any request made by the Leader of the Opposition to seek a costing is in fact private so that opposition, at least during the caretaker period, if not earlier, has the same advantage as that of the government. If the government is truly committed to the democratic process us much as it continues to pretend to be, then this measure ought to be embraced by the government because it does obviously seek to introduce some balance by ensuring that not only the government but also the opposition has access to professional and private advice with regard to policy costing matters. It does fly in the face of the kind of decent, fair minded, even-handed regime for opposition costing processes to be denied privacy in this sense. The provision in clause 31 of the bill requires co'Stings, when actually done, to be made public. Ideally, the whole process would be private but, if the work has been done, and is done during the caretaker period, we are prepared to accept the continuation of that obligation to do it publicly. However, at least the opposition-if the earlier amendment is accepted of the policies not having to be publicly announced before the costing is done-is in a position, under these circumstances, to be able to treat the publicly given costing advice as simply an option to be pursued rather than something to which the opposition has to be committed beforehand. When you add all these things together, we say the balance comes out as a fair one and it would be reasonably workable in practice. Finally, amendment (10) goes to how policy costings are to be prepared. This amendment is again from the Democrats in origin, requiring that the assumptions upon which those costings have been made are spelled out when a costing is provided. It is simply an improvement in the transparency of the costings process and, as such, it is supported by the opposition. If the government was halfway decent on this, as on anything else, which it is not, it would support it. I know that we are now going to have the government reiterating its opposition to all these amendments. I hope, nonetheless, that some light has dawned in the mind of Mr Miles, the parliamentary secretary in this the respect, that there will be a Damascene conversion evident and that he will announce a complete policy change. I will not, however, hold my breath. Question put: That Senate amendments Nos I to 10 be disagreed to. The House divided. [1.32 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Hon. G.B. Adams) Ayes ...............

Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Miles) agreed to: That Mr RD.C. Evans, Mr Bartlett, and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate.",119
38,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (1.37 p.m.)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate, r present the reasons, which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate amendment (1) The House of Representatives considers this Amendment_to broaden the principles of sound fiscal management to include: the achievement of full employment in Australia; the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia; and maintenance of real wages and conditions_should not proceed. It is unnecessary as these issues are already, and more appropriately, covered in Clause 4 of the Bill. That NOES clause provides that fiscal policy should be directed to maintain the on-going economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. Senate amendment (2) This Amendment requires the annual preparation of a report by the Secretary to the Treasury and the Commissioner of Taxation on material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of such threats and specific action necessary to counter these threats. The House of Representatives considers that this Amendment should not proceed, as it would draw the attention of tax planners to weaknesses and anomalies in tax legislation, risking larger losses in revenue than would otherwise be the case. Moreover, Clause 12 of the Bill already requires that material threats to the fiscal outlook, quantified where feasible, be outlined in a Statement of Risks. Senate amendment (3) The House of Representatives considers that this Amendment_which requires an intergenerational report to be produced within three years after the commencement of the Act and thereafter within three years of the public release of the preceding report_should not proceed. The House of Representatives considers that it is not appropriate to require the release of reports at a greater frequency than five years, as assessments of the long term sustainability of policy are unlikely to change quickly. Assessments in an intergenerational report will be more affected by factors such as demographic change and Australia's long term growth potential, rather than short-term budgetary and economic developments. The House of Representatives notes that the Bill only prescribes a minimum reporting frequency and that does not prevent governments from releasing reports more frequently if appropriate. Senate amendment (4) This Amendment requires responsible Secretaries to jointly release a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report two years and nine months after the first sitting day of the House of Representatives following the previous election. If an election is called before then, a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report would be required within five days of the issue of writs for a general election. The House of Representatives considers this Amendment should not proceed. In the case where a report is produced two years and nine months after the first sitting following an election, the Amendment could allow economic and tiscal developments in the subsequent months prior to an election announcement to go unreported. This would be inconsistent with providing up to date information on the economic and tiscal outlook to the electorate prior to an election. In the case where an earlier election is called, the House of Representatives considers that a requirement for a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report to be produced within five days of the issue of writs is impractical. A minimum period of ten days is required for a report to be produced. Senate amendment (5) The House of Representatives considers that this Amendment_requiring Ministers to not participate in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report other than to provide needed information_should not proceed. The Amendment is not necessary as the Bill already requires that the Treasury and Finance Secretaries must sign off on the report stating that it reflects the best professional judgement of officers of their Departments. Senate amendments (6), (7), (8) and (9) These Amendments will allow the possibility of the Departments of the Treasury and Finance costing unannounced policies for the Government and Opposition in the caretaker period prior to an election. Further, the Amendments allow for the making of requests for costings by the Leader of the Opposition to be authorised by the Prime Minister, but that the details of the policies being costed need not be disclosed to the Prime Minister. They also provide that the details of policies, which are the subject of a request by the Leader of the Opposition, shall not be disclosed by the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Finance to anyone not authorised by the Leader of the Opposition. The Secretaries may decline to prepare costings under any request where they consider that policy advice is being sought. The House of Representatives does not consider that these Amendments should proceed. The Amendments will result in the loss of transparency in the costing process. The lack of transparency under the Amendments is also inconsistent with Clause 31 of the Bill. This Clause requires that all policy costings are made public by the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Finance as soon as practicable before polling day. As the requests for the costing of unannounced policies would be permitted, requests could be made for a range of alternative policy options to be costed. The House of Representatives considers that this risks placing the Departments of Treasury and Finance in the position of developing policy for the Opposition, inconsistent with usual conventions. It could also add substantially to the workload of Departments, which could be required to cost a myriad of alternative options. Senate amendment (10) This Amendment requires that policy co stings must indicate what assumptions have been used and explain any limitations on the methodology used. The House of Representatives considers that this Amendment is unnecessary as costing guidelines issued by Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury and Finance for the preparation of policy costings (provided for in subclause 30(1» would detail such processes.

39,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"l move: That Senate amendments Nos 3 to 12 be agreed to. I do not propose to speak to these amendments, other than to say that I believe these are all essentially technical matters. We have agreed to them in the Senate. Some of them were proposed by the government as a result of matters arising in the time since the bill was first introduced and also as a result of proposals from other parties in the Senate.",128
40,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (l.40 p.m.)On the face of it, these do not seem to be amendments about which the opposition has any concern. We said initially that there were a large number of amendments which we all accepted were technical and should be approved on that basis. Therefore, on a quick perusal of the amendments we are referring to, while they are not all ones, I have to say, we are excited about-for example, the one concerning amalgamations; we had a previous debate about that in the House and we do not want to have it again-we are prepared to agree to the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative.",128
41,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"l move: That Senate amendments Nos 1 and 2 and 13 to 15 be disagreed to. These amendments go to the heart of most of the contentious matters in respect of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. I will attempt to be brief so we can deal with these matters if possible before question time. The government set out with these amendamendment ments to introduce matters which were merely technical-in other words, we were at pains to ensure that this bill did not contain policy proposals that would provoke undue, unnecesment. sary controversy, because the matters which were included in the bill were technical just to make easier the operation of the behind the existing Workplace Relations Act. We sat down, for example, with the ACTU in the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is a subcommittee of the National 'relevant Labour Consultative Committee, and we pulled out a few of the amendments that we were considering on the grounds wanted to keep the thing on a technical basis. Clearly, some matters relating to Australian workplace agreements would be opposed by the opposition parties because of their concerns about the policy but, again, we have kept the matters to technical issues. As a result of deliberations in the Senate, amendments were moved and carried in the Senate which go to other policy issues. keep the matter to the technical issues-which has always been the intention of this bill-the government will vote to not support certain amendments made by the Senate. Senate amendment No.1, for example, raises very substantial policy issues in respect of award coverage vis-a-vis Western Australia. This arises out of differences of opinion about state law in Western Australia-the second wave or the third wave. Regardless of one's point of view, the fact is that these are not technical issues and we do not support these proposals. There are policy reasons as well for why do not support them, but I do not intend to go into those now. Senate amendment No. 2 would permit a limitations court, in addition to ordering the reinstatement of a dismissed employee and payment compensation for loss suffered as a result of dismissal or other prejudicial conduct, to make any other order it considers necessary to remedy the effect of a breach of section 170MU and any consequential orders. Suffice to say that the amendment is unnecessary the government does not support it. Amendment No. 13 arises out of a proposed amendment, which the opposition Senate has omitted, which did not alter the meaning or operation of subsection 152(5). In other words, we had an amendment up and the Senate has omitted that amend The point I make in response to that is that what we were doing made no change to things the meaning. You could not get a more policy technical amendment than this one. Our amendment was simply intended to avoid any uncertainty about the operation of subsection 152(5) by including the word 'state' before award'. That is all there is to it. I do not believe that should be a matter of any 'controversy whatsoever. It is basically a typo, that we in layman's language. Amendments Nos 14 and 15 both go to the issue of whether or not people should be paid when they are taking industrial action. These amendments are an attempt to water down the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, which basically says that, if you take industrial reaction-whether it is a strike, bans or limitations-you do not get paid. We are To obviously not in favour of watering down those provisions. Those amendments have obviously been moved by the opposition, and the Democrats would support them because the unions would tell them they do not like provisions which prohibit the payment of strike pay. We obviously do not support that proposition from the opposition and the Democrats. It flies in the face of the system we have put in place, which is fair to both employees and employers and includes penalties against employers who pay people for taking industrial action. Employers are half we the problem when it comes to the incidence of strike pay in Australia, and it is one of the reasons we have a very high level of bans and in this country. That is the thinking behind amendments Nos 14 and 15 and of the reasons we reject them.",128
42,Mr MCMULLAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Canberra) (1.46 p.m.)The problem with this whole approach is that it reflects the government's difficulty in handling its relationship with the Senate altogether. A large set of technical amendments were and put forward and overwhelmingly carried. Some matters of policy significance were carried, some of them over our opposition but with the support of the Democrats. Therefore, the government substantially got its way. We did not like what it did about strengthening the powers of the Employment Advocate, but it has been passed. We did not like what happened with prohibiting people from pursuing remedies for unlawful termination in some circumstances, but it has been passed. We did not like some aspects of or what happened with disamalgamation, but it has been passed. The government got a substantial part of what it wanted and is now heading back for some sort of small or large collision with the Senate. It is not exactly of great magnitude but, nevertheless, it is some sort of collision over the small number of losses it had. As someone who was Manager of Government Business in the Senate in a previous life, happily passed, it seems to me that that is not an efficient way to handle government relationships with the Senate. If it continues, is not going to be the high point of the problems it causes in the relationship between the government and the Senate. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill has blended legitimate technical changes over most of which there was no difference. Even though a few were substantially technical, there were small disagreements with some policy matters, some things which the government put in which we regarded as policy substance-some of which we were significantly opposed to-and some amendments which have policy implications. We want to pursue those amendments. Not all of the amendments which the government is opposed to are ones initiated by the opposition, but they are ones which we supportedclearly, or else they would not have passedand which we think ought to be persisted with. I will go through and indicate them quickly. Amendment No. 1 is one which, although we did not initiate it, was moved by the Democrats and supported by everybody in the Senate other than the government. It is similar to a matter introduced into this House by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) by way of a private member's bill. It is an important question with regard to the relationship between state and federal unions and state and federal legislation. They want to now get into all the complexities being debated here and in the Senate at length. But I think it is right, in principle, and makes the operation of the act-whatever we think of the act overall-fairer and more appropriate. I can understand the policy differences we have on that matter. The government does not agree with us in policy on that matter, so we will vote and agree or disagree. I cannot understand the government's concern with amendment No.2. It seems to be the most straightforward of matters on the face of it where the range of relief for employees unlawfully terminated for engaging in proteCted industrial action should be the same as for employees unlawfully terminated on other grounds. I do not understand the government's position on that. There does not seem to be a matter of policy principle involved this that ought to motivate them to be as concerned about it as they seem to be. The Greens amendment, which is amendment No. 14, is, I accept, important and worthy of support. We do not like the government's policy about strike pay but, once again, that is the law of the country and it is there. It is a very strange situation where we are actually saying to people, 'Don't do part of your job; do all of it or none. If you're at work being productive right through your shift but not doing all those things requested or required, you can't be paid.' All that means is there is never going to be any more work to rules. Everybody is just going to go on strike. It does not seem to make any sense at all, but the government has this very narrow view. It is fixated by it and it seems to be persisting with it. I think it is profoundly wrong. I cannot get very excited about amendment No. 15. We will support it, but it is a matter of very little consequence. It was not initiated by us. We support it. We continue to support it, but let me not exaggerate its significance. (Extension of time granted) Amendment No. 13 is one which I do regard as important, and it was where a government amendment was defeated. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) seems to say it is of no consequence. We have had this discussion here in the House and in the Senate. It is not our view that it is of no consequence or a mere typo. It never was. It still is not. It is our view that it does have consequences with which we do not agree. The existing provisions provide that state employment agreements are able to override federal awards, provided the employee is not disadvantaged in comparison to entitlements provided by the relevant federal award. Whatever I think about that policy matter, that is what the existing law says. The government's defeated amendment would have allowed this override to occur if the employee is not disadvantaged by reference to any relevant state award. This is not a standard with which we are comfortable to see incorporated in the federal ly given the standards set by some of the current conservative state governments and those in prospect. In regard to neither the principle of the federal law operating in that way nor its practice in the readily foreseeable circumstances of state governments such as Western Australia today-whose industrial relations policies are so abhorrent to this side of the House and, fortunately, to many Australians, particularly to very many Western Australians since their post-election amendments which they ran through the Legislative Council prior to the result of the election taking effect and preventing their having the numbers to do so-should we take lightly this question of the reference being to a relevant state award. That is not something that we regard as merely technical, nor is it something that we will lightly allow to proceed. There are a lot of matters incorporated in all the amendments which we could all speak about at length because they are issues that are important to both sides of the House. We disagree about them, but we share the view that some of them are important and are matters on which we would normally wish to have a longer discussion. To facilitate the proceedings of the chamber, and because we debated them twice before-and, on the face of the evidence, we are likely to do so a fourth time in the Senate-I will not speak any longer. I simply indicate the opposition's view on all those matters.",129
43,Mr MCCLELLAND,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"'-I would like to speak in particular on amendments (14) and (15) and touch on amendment (13) of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. Essentially, from the government's perspective, amendments (14) and (15) try to override those no work, no pay cases. In the early federal Gapes case the Federal Court determined that, just because bank employees had refused to perform a relatively minor part of their work in circumstances where the employer acquiesced in their staying on the job-indeed, was happy with them to stay on the job and wanted them to stay on the job to perform their other tasks-they were not precluded law, particularfrom their payment. On the other hand, there are numerous cases, particularly in the New South Wales state jurisdiction, where employers have directed the workers to go home. The employers have said to their workers, for instance, 'If you're not prepared to fulfil the full range of your contract of employment, I don't want you here on the job. Please leave the premises.' In those cases the courts have said that the employer has accepted their breach of contract and is not liable for payment of their wages. That is fair and reasonable. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has said that in recent years there has been an increase in industrial action by way of bans or limitations. I have not seen figures to know whether that is right or wrong. But there is a dangerand I think it is an event which will necessarily follow-that, instead of bans and limitations, which can often be more in the nature of protest action rather than necessarily extremely damaging to business, you are going to have workers simply downing tools, or downing pens as it were, and leaving the workplace altogether. So the real risk here, and I think it will follow, is that, instead of having relatively trivial bans and limitations, actual stoppages will occur. Workers would be silly, I would submit, to stay on the job if they were to get no payment whatsoever. So it may well be a situation where the employer would prefer to have the employees on the job at least doing the better part of their producti ve duties rather than compelling a situation where they go home. This is, effectively, a government coming over the top of what might be an arrangement desired by both the employer and the employee. Not all industrial action is bad. Not all industrial action is caused by employees, which seems to be the starting point from the government's reference. Often it is desirable to let workers blow off a bit of steam, have a bit of a protest, and then get back and sort the issue out. They feel as though they have had an input when a common result is achieved. Often a good way of achieving an outcome is through a trivial sort of protest, through a low level work ban. So it is inappropriate for the government to come in over the top. Effectively, the government is imposing its own liquidated damages on. what could be a trivial breach of contract. The government would not do that in any other commercial relationship. It would not say, 'We're going to assess the damages in this case, the damages being equivalent to whatever that worker's rate of pay is.' The government is effectively intervening in a contractual relationship which it would not dare do in respect of its own constituency or commercial base that tends to patronise them. There have been a number of articles written on this no work, no pay concept. Professor MCCarry from Sydney University, for instance, has written several articles. The system works fairly and appropriately. If the employer gets the benefit of the labour, he has to pay. If he sends them home, he does not. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That the amendments as set out in the schedule circulated to honourable members which are relevant to amendments Nos 6 and 13 of the Senate be made. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That Mr Lloyd, and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos I, 2 and 13 to 15 of the Senate.",131
44,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"-After very quick work by the members of the committee, on behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 1, 2 and 13 to 15 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. I move that the committee's reasons be adopted. The reasons read as /ollowsSenate amendment (1) This amendment would oblige the AIRC to move quickly to deal with certain dispute notifications, and where appropriate make interim awards, relating to employees whose employment is covered by a State award or agreement. The effect of the amendment is that section III AAA of the Workplace Relations Act, which requires the Commission to cease dealing with any matter where the employees concerned are covered by a State award or agreement, unless the Commission considers that to cease dealing with the matter would be contrary to the public interest, would not apply to the applications covered by the amendment. The purpose of section IIIAAA is to ensure that employers and employees are free to operate within the jurisdiction of their choice. In determining the public interest for the purposes of the section, the Commission is obliged to give primary consideration to the views of the employees and employers concerned. The proposed amendment would reverse the policy of choice which underpins the Workplace Relations Act by obliging the AIRC to proceed without regard to section III AAA. The amendment is directed specifically towards fast-tracking federal award applications made by Westem Australian unions. It singles out Western Australia, taking away from Western Australian employers and employees operating in the State system the right to have section IIIAAA apply to federal award applications affecting them. Where employees wish to transfer to federal jurisdiction, there is scope for them to do so under the Act as it stands. The views of the employees will be a primary consideration for the Commission in determining whether to continue to deal with a matter. Subsection IIIAAA(3) obliges the Commission to move quickly to ascertain their views. Section 98 of the Act requires the Commission to move as quickly as practicable in performing its functions. Where the Commission decides to continue to deal with a matter, it is able to make an interim award, and subsection 111(1D) requires the Commission to decide quickly whether to make an interim award. The existing legislation therefore provides appropriate protection for employees without taking away their rights, and the rights of their employers, to remain in a State jurisdiction if they wish to do so. Senate amendment (2) This amendment would permit a Court, in addition to ordering the reinstatement of a dismissed employee and payment of compensation for loss suffered as a result of dismissal or other prejudicial conduct, to make any other order it considers necessary to remedy the effect of a breach of section 170MU and any consequential orders. This amendment is unnecessary. It does no more than add another layer of regulation. Section 170NH already provides for reinstatement and compensation and preserves any other rights a person may have in connection with a breach of section 170MU. Section 170NF provides for penalties in respect of breaches of section 170MU. It is also the case that Courts generally have inherent powers to make consequential orders. When these factors are taken into account, the amendment serves no purpose. Senate amendment (13) Subsection 152(5)-Circumstances in which State agreements to prevail over federal awards Section 152 of the Act deals with the interaction between federal awards and State laws, State awards and State employment agreements. Subsection 152(3) of the Act is intended to allow State employment agreements to override federal awards, provided certain conditions are met. Those conditions are contained in subsection 152(5) of the Act. One condition is that the employees covered by the agreement are not disadvantaged in comparison to their entitlements under the relevant award. The term 'relevant award', for the purposes of section 152, is not defined in the Act. However, it can only mean the relevant State award. This is because State industrial authorities apply their no-disadvantage tests against relevant State awards. The proposed Government amendment - hich t-e Opposition Senate amendment. has orrutted - hd not alter the meaning or operatIOn of subsectlon 152(5). It was simply intended avoid any uncertainty about the operation of the provision. In the Government's view, the inclusion of the word ""State"" before ""relevant award"" will provide clarification of the provision and be of to the parties, so the Government amendment should be reinstated. Senate amendment (14) Section 187AA-Strike pay-employee not deemed to be taking industrial action if ""fully engaged"" during ordinary hours in work directed by employer NA The House of Representatives opposes this amendment because it amounts to an open invitation to employees to engage in industrial action involving bans and limitations. It would allow employees to choose not to perform certai!l work, knowing that they could pressure thelr employers into paying them irrespective of the effects of their action on their employers' businesses. This amendment would allow employees to be paid even if they imp?se bans on - ey e-ements of their work and thelr employers busmesses, simply because particular tasks in relation to which bans have been imposed happen to involve little actual working time and there is other work available to be done. The amendment ignores the realities of work. The failure to perform a particular task involving little time could have major adverse implications for an employer, other businesses and the community more generally. Senate amendment (15) New section 187AE-Strike pay-industrial action does not include action authorised, agreed to or accepted by employer NA The definition of industrial action contained in the Workplace Relations Act already excludes action authorised or agreed to by an employer. This means that there will be some circumstances in which an employer may choose to authorise or agree to defective work performance. The House of Representatives opposes the proposed amendment because it will expose employers to pressure after the event to accept action, which could be in the form of bans, limitations or even all out strike action, and pay the employees engaged in the action.

47,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, may I seek your indulgence for just one moment. I was not present yesterday when there was a brief reference made by the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to the death of Dr H.C. Coombs. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my personal respect for the enormous contribution that the late Dr Coombs made to this nation. He was, by any measure, one of the most profoundly influential public servants that the Australian nation has seen. Not only did he leave his mark in areas of public administration, most particularly in the economic area, but also he had a very profound influence in the direction of policy on indigenous affairs. He had the rare distinction of somebody who was counted as a close adviser and confidant of prime ministers on both sides of the political divide in Australia. I know that it is the desire of all members of the House that his memory be appropriately honoured, as it will be, at a state memorial service at a date to be announced after due consultation with the members of Dr Coombs' family. I did want to warmly place on record my personal regard for his quite outstanding and unstinting contribution to the welfare of the Commonwealth of Australia. NA",134
48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, we have. Opposition recently heard from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police that some 80 per cent of all heroin coming into Australia enters through Sydney. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that because of your government's massive budget cuts to the Customs Service only 20 customs officers work on the Sydney wharves, which handle hundreds of thousands of containers each year? Isn't it also a. fact that only one container in each major port around Australia is checked each day or, put another way, three in 10,000? How does this compare with the United States, which is reported to randomly check something ""like three times this number? Is this Australian rate an acceptable one to you?",134
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is about as relevant and about as accurate as some of the wild allegations made by the Premier of New South Wales, whose only contribution to the fight against drugs is to pass the buck and to not accept any responsibility of his own. Fighting drugs is a national responsibility, and those responsibilities have to be shared between the Commonwealth and the state governments. I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to a statement issued yesterday jointly by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. In the course of that statement, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs says that customs resources devoted specifically to anti-drug efforts have not been reduced during a time of general budget expenditure reductions. In the 1996 budget the government provided $26 million in additional funding over three years for technology specifically to aid in drug detection and interception, painting a completely different picture from that attempted by the Leader of the Opposition and from that attempted by the Premier of New South Wales. Furthermore, the minister went on to say that the 1997 budget provided funding for an upgrade in the capability and capacity of the Customs marine fleet. The total cost of purchasing the boats will be $55 million over Drugs a period of 10 years. What I would say to the Leader of the is that, if you are really interested in doing something effective about drugs, you will stop politicising the issue. You will have a great opportunity at the weekend to demonstrate your credentials in serving the national interest instead of trying to undermine the national interest, as you do so frequently. You tried to do it the other day with Telstra, and now you are trying to do it in relation to drugs. You will have an opportunity at the weekend to demonstrate your concern, and you ought to get behind a decent national initiative instead of trying to score miserable political points on something that goes to the heart and soul of the existence of many families in Australia.",134
50,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister outline to the House how this government is striving to improve Australia's economic fundamentals? How will the government's efforts assist Australia in meeting economic challenges at home and abroad?,135
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say in response to the member for Lowe that over the past few weeks, particularly over the last week, I think all Australians have had reason to pause for a moment and reflect upon the value of having an Australian government dedicated to getting the fundamentals of the Australian economy in good order. The reality is thatand increasingly, as time goes by, it will be written of this period in Australia's economic history-the measures that. have been taken by my government since it came to power in March of 1996 have provided to the Australian nation additional economic insurance. What those measures have done is to strengthen the infrastructure of the Australian economy. What those measures have done is to better arm the Australian economy to withstand the harmful shocks abroad because of adverse economic developments. What those measures have done is to make the Australian economy more competitive. What those measures have done is to enable the Australian economy to playa significant and positi ve role in the regional economic affairs at a time in our history where all Australians, whatever their political beliefs, regard a deep involvement in regional economic affairs as being of fundamental importance. It is very instructive to note that not only did those opposite leave us with a vulnerable economy but they tried to stop us repairing the vulnerability. It was a double economic crime on the people of Australia: you leave us with a mess and you try to stop us cleaning up the mess. We have undertaken these measures in the face of ferocious opposition from those who sit opposite, whose only mantra is whatever it takes to score a political point; it does not matter about the national interest, hang the national interest and hang waterproofing the Australian economy against Economy the ebbs and flows of adverse economic circumstances. We inherited a deficit of $lOYz billion. Over the last two budgets we have created the circumstances where at the end of our first term in government we will have an underlying surplus in the budget of the Commonwealth account. That is a remarkable achievement. More important than being a remarkable achievement, it has given to the Australian economy a strength, a resilience and a protection against adverse circumstances from abroad. I think all Australians when they pause and reflect upon the events of the past few weeks will have occasion to say, 'Thank heavens we had a government that was willing to take some difficult decisions. Why on earth did the opposition try to stop them doing it? Why on earth did the opposition try to stop the government cutting the budget deficit? Why did the opposition oppose measures that have brought interest rates down in Australia by 2Yz per cent? Why has the opposition opposed measures to privatise Telstra so that Australians can directly join in the ownership of Telstra? Why has the opposition tried to frustrate the legitimate attempts of the government to defend the jobs of Australians in relation to the greenhouse gas issue?' On greenhouses gases, the Labor Party for weeks was deriding my attempts to defend the jobs of, amongst others, mine workers in the mining areas of Australia. I had occasion when I was overseas to draw attention to a rather humorous leading article in the Manchester Guardian. It rather shamefully described those who sit on the government benches now as being a Labor government. It said that is why we were defending the interests of the mine workers of Australia. I am very proud that I am defending the interests of the mine workers of Australia. I want to say to all of the mine workers of the Hunter Valley-Bob, you will like this-to the mine workers of the Bowen Basin and to the mine workers all over Australia: if you want your jobs defended, if you want your jobs protected, always vote for the coalition. Australian Federal Police: Drugs",135
52,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. Attorney, you will be aware of Minister Truss's fear that much drug trafficking is not being policed because some police stations work only nine to five. Are you aware that drug traffickers operate well outside those hours in Western Australia, the state with the largest coastline in the nation, the state which is experiencing a massive increase in criminal activity and the state where heroin at $7 per hit has caused the deaths of more than 50 people alone this year? Attorney-General, can you now explain why the 16 per cent cuts to the AFP administrative budget under your government have effectively confined police in Perth to standard working hours as a result of a near complete ban on overtime and the NCA's staff in Perth having been cut by half?",136
53,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think the members of the opposition listened, when I answered a question on Tuesday, I do not think they listened when the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs answered question on Tuesday and I do not think they listened to the answer the Prime Minister gave to the Leader of the Opposition's question today. You are simply trying to politicise something that is of great concern to every- , tralia? body in the community. We and the public have been subjected an awful misinformation campaign emanating from the opposition. Mr Carr says that $110 million is being cut from budgets. Where he get that figure from? I explained on Tuessurplus day that $8.6 million was cut from the AFP budget in this year's budget and $6.2 million last year-just over $14 million in total. I also explained that, in the five years leading up to the election, 400 staff members of the 'AFP disappeared under your government. What about the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus? He put out a press release yesterday saying that Australia's law enforcement agencies have had their budgets cut by more than $225 million over four years. Where did he get that from? It does not exist. He roams around the country saying to the public that, if Labor had been elected, there would have been $80 million more, therefore, there has been an $80 million cut. What sort of a statement is that? The opposition has the opportunity to get behind government initiatives in relation to the drug problem. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order in relation to relevance. I was listening with interest, as I am sure you were. My question was specifically about Western Australia, the Attorney-General's own home state, and my question was specifically relevant to Perth and cutbacks in police services in that state.",136
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,136
55,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The only budget cuts in the AFP and the NCA in the last two years have been cross-portfolio savings and efficiency dividends-nothing more.

56,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed a to the Treasurer. Can he advise the House what the latest export figures indicate about the strength of the Australian economy? How have the government's policies worked to improve the economic fundamentals in Aus,136
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable to member for Menzies for his question. He may not be aware that the figures on goods and services released today for the month of does September show that the balance was in a of $408 million, well above market expectations of $195 million. The balance on goods and services recorded its sixth monthly trade surplus, rising $90 million compared with August, with a growth in exports of 1.3 per cent, more than offsetting modest growth in imports of 0.4 per cent. I am sure all Australians will welcome the fact that the accounts have been in surplus over the last six months. That does not mean that Australia will not be beset with a account deficit. What it means is that we are now trading in surplus, but we will continue to run current account deficits as we continue . to try to service the foreign debt which the Labor Party built up over 13 years of mismanagement of the Australian economy. But the good news is that we are now trading in surplus, and it was the sixth in a row. I believe that members of the House will welcome the fact that the DEETYA skilled vacancies, which were released today, also showed a rise in trend terms of 3.9 per cent in October, the strongest monthly increase in nearly three years. So we have the DEETYA skilled vacancies showing good strong rises and we have the trade on the external account being in surplus. These are welcome signs of strengthening in the Australian domestic economy. But, as the Prime Minister said, we have to make sure not just that we are taking into account the domestic economy but that we in Australia are putting in place the steps which will give us insurance against external shocks which we as a country have no control over, one of which we have seen in recent months in relation to the South-East Asian currencies. As we said repeatedly over the last two years, to be in a position where the Australian budget was $10,000 million in deficit would have meant that we were exposed and fragile. To be in a position where we had no measures to cope with current account deficits which had bedevilled the Australian economy through the 1980s and 1990s would have meant that the Australian economy was exposed and fragile. The events of the last couple of months have reiterated the importance of government getting the domestic settings right, of making sure that we get our house in order, rather than rely on work being done overseas. These are very important steps in relation to the Australian economy. What is moreand this is a very important point-this government intends not just to tum around Australia's budget but to lock the benefit in for good. We are putting in place a charter of budget honesty which will prevent any future government engaging in the deception which current the Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Finance, tried to do before the last election. On 1 February 1996, he said this: We're in a position where we have no plans to increase taxes. Why would we? We're operating in surplus and our projections are for surplus in the future. At that time the Australian Commonwealth budget was $10,000 million in deficit, and he said on 1 February 1996 'We're operating in surplus'. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, which should be renamed the 'Beazley Bill', is designed to ensure that nobody can do anything like that again. When the Prime Minister was answering the question I was reminded about the steps that the Labor Party went to before the last election and about the steps they were at two days ago in a situation of stock market volatility. Why would anybody do that? Why would anybody behave like that? Why would any responsible leader behave like that? It is because the moral godfather of the Australian Labor Party summed it all up for them when he said, 'Whatever it takes.' NA",136

66,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me point out to you, as I did on Tuesday, that all the police forces and law enforcement agencies have been learning to act cooperatively and to spend the dollars committed to them in a smarter, wiser way. This is having significant consequences. Despite the small savings that have been made in the AFP's budget this year, in the first eight months heroin seizures have been more than double those for the whole of last year. Around 60 kilograms of cocaine. and another 60 kilograms of amphetamines have been seized. The AFP has made 381 drug related arrests or issued summonses, and it has laid 711 charges for drug offences. This is a consequence of acting smarter and using intelligence. The policy which the shadow Attorney-General seems to be pushing is that police should be standing shoulder to shoulder on the coastline and checking every ship and every boat. They do not work that way any more; they work on intelligence and they work smartly. Drugs",138
67,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Like many other regions in Australia, there is a serious problem with illicit drugs in my electorate of Leichhardt. How important is fighting the threat of illicit drugs to Australia's children and families for this government? How does, the Prime Minister intend to address the problem of drugs within Australia?",138
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that, of all political issues and of all issues of public policy, the one above all that would command and demand of all participants in politics in Australia a relatively bipartisan approach ought to be the challenge of drugs. But apparently, according to the whatever it takes doctrine, not even fighting the drug menace in Australia can ever hope to be free or immune from the sort of cheapjack political point scoring that we have witnessed from the Labor opposition over the first few questions. The facts are that there were 634 heroin related deaths in Australia last year; the average length of life lost per drug death is over 36 years; up to 80 per cent of property crime in a state like New South Wales is drug related; up to two-thirds of prisoners were affected by alcohol or illicit drugs when they committed their most serious offence; over 25 per cent of prisoners have a major drug problem; and illicit drug deaths result in over 40,000 hospital bed days used in Australia each year. Mr Tanner-Give us tobacco and alcohol.",138
69,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you're cutting police funding.,139
70,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I invite those who sit opposite, and who interject on this issueMr Crean-What about the cuts?",139
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,to contemplate the proposition that the drug menace in Australia did not arrive in March 1996 any more than the drug menace in Australia is going to be removed by anyone single act. Mr Crean interjecting,139
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to those who sit opposite that the Australian people will respect a genuine bipartisan approach on this issue; the Australian people will condemn, with justifiable contempt, your refusal to adopt any semblance of a bipartisan approach on this particular issue.",139
73,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,139
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The more that you carry on as you are now, the more you are demonstrating to the Australian people what the Labor Party is all about: hang the national interest, don't worry about the national interest, don't pay any regard to what is overall good public policy, but if you can score a cheap, irrelevant, insubstantial political point you go ahead and do so. As I indicated in parliament last August, Commonwealth government does accept its responsibility to take a strong lead, in conjunction with the state governments, in fighting the drug menace. We have now received and considered recommendations from the task force that I established a few months ago. I have also had extensive discussions with a number of non-government organisations, and on Sunday I will announce the first instalment of a major new Commonwealth initiative to combat the illicit drug menace in Australia. This will be followed by further measures to be developed in partnership with others who have valuable expertise and who share our commitment to solving this problem. I would hope-however vain that hope might appear-that might even include the members of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Perhaps we will live for a long time in the hope of that. We will work with other Australian governments and with parents, teachers and health professionals.",139
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,139
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I find it amazing that the Labor opposition should interject on a proposition that the government of this country would be working with parents, health professionals and teachers in order to combat the drug menace, but apparently that is quite acceptable. We will also work with the nongovernment treatment agencies. On Friday, 7 November I will talk to my state and territory colleagues at the COAG meeting about how we can all pull together more effectively in this area in the national interest. I do not pretend for a moment that the initiatives that will be unveiled over the weeks ahead will rid this country of the drug menace, but I do argue that it will represent a comprehensive, sincere attempt to make serious inroads into something that is regarded justifiably by the men and women of Australia and by the parents and families of Australia as one of the greatest social menaces that this country has ever had. My government is determined to work with all sides of politics, with all governments and with all sections of the Australian community to do something effective about it and not to tum it the into the stuff of political point scoring and political argument. Trafficking in Trust Loss Legislation",139
77,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer inform the House with whom he or his staff had discussions concerning the particular alteration to the trafficking in trust loss legislation which he announced on 13 May? Were representatives of any of the high wealth individuals being investigated by the Taxation Office involved in such discussions?,139
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He keeps asking the questions but he never makes any advances. I do not know how many answers I have given in relation to this, but even the member for Gellibrand has given up on this one. Government members-He's gone.",139
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He's gone? He's showing extreme interest in relation to this. The government said in its budget that it would consult with people in relation to the nature of the legislation, and we did. And, as a result of that, we overcame one of the defects that was in the legislation which, as I said earlier, did not allow people who are operating small businesses through trusts to adequately offset income and losses, but we significantly narrowed the scope of the legislation that Labor had provided. The amounts that were assessed under the revenue, as are in the budget, actually showed, as a consequence, that the revenue take would go up. If it had not been for me narrowing the definition of family, under the Labor Party the people who could have taken advantage of the family exemption in relation to the income injection test would have included a former spouse of a child of a nephew. They are the people that would have been in under the definition of Labor: the former spouse of a child of a nephew and the great-grandparent of the uncle or the aunt of the former spouse as well. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: he was asked with whom he had discussed this matter. His only answer so far is that he discussed it with people. That is not an answer in this place and he ought to be brought to account.",140
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,140
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, under the Labor Party, the former spouse of a child of a nephew's great-grandparent's aunt's or uncle's former spouse could have come in under the test. The definition that I put in place ed great-grandparents, aunts, uncles and former spouses to try to narrow the income injection test considerably. Mr Gareth Evans-You didn't narrow it.",140
82,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We didn't narrow it? What do you call taking out great-grandparents? What do you call that-expanding it, do you? What do you call taking out aunts? Do you call that expanding it? What do you call taking out uncles? Do you call that expanding it? What do you call taking out spouses and former spouses? Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the treasurer knows perfectly well that the previous exemption only applied to beneficiaries. He extended it to nonbeneficiaries. He opened the farm gate on this issue.",140
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. We will not debate issues. I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,140
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not a point of order. What you are embarrassed about is the wide definition of family in this legislation. You were going to allow former spouses, their great-grandparents, their aunts and their uncles to get the benefit of the income injection test. As a result of the amendments that I put in place, none of them would be allowed to do so. But what you would be allowed to do, where you were part of a family, is that you could exercise the income injection test through another trust as long as the beneficiaries were the same. There seems to be an incapacity of the Labor Party to actually understand that point-an absolute incapacity to understand it. The proofs in the pudding, isn't it? Let me ask this question: in what year of Labor government did the Labor Party enact legislation dealing with trafficking in trust losses?",140
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: much to his chagrin, the rest of the country is beginning to understand this a bit better, but it is unfortunately not related to the question he was asked, which was a question that sought specific information about",140
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What was your point of exclud- order? The Treasurer was talking about trafficking in trust losses.,140
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he wasn't. No, Mr Speaker, it was question about who he saw, that's all.",140
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,140
89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So we can ask this question to the people who are concerned about trafficking in trusts: in what year did the Labor Party enact the legislation? There are 13 alternatives: 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 or 1996. The answer is: none of the above. Social Security",140
90,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister Representing the Minister for Social Security. Could the minister inform the House of the progress which has been made by this government in upholding the integrity of our social security system? Can you reassure taxpayers in my electorate of Robertson and throughout Australia that social security assistance is only going to those who need it? How does the record of the coalition government compare with the dismal efforts of the previous government on social security compliance?,141
91,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. I think it is a very interesting area for analysis because we know-and I have mentioned this before-that the member for Sydney, when he was Minister for Social Security, said that the system was as tight as a drum and claimed that Australia was leading the world in relation to dealing with the maintenance of the integrity of the social security system. He brought a world expert out to tell us that we were way out in front in relation to these matters, and he would have us believe that everything was being done that could be done. Yesterday, the Minister for Social Security tabled the department's compliance report for 1996-97. The statistics tell it all, because in 1996-97 there was a very significant increase in all areas of reporting: 55,000 advices from the public led to something in the order of 12,000 cancellations and reductions. Over three million reviews were conducted during that year, and it was up almost 28 per cent. There were",141
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Pensions?,141
93,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that in a moment. There were 333,120 payment cancellations and reductions-an increase of over 40 per cent. Debt recovery was at $369 million, and that was up by 47 per cent. So we have had savings of almost $28 million in every week as a result of compliance activity. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition picked up the comments from the member for Jagajaga yesterday. Instead of congratulating the government on its performance, she tried to take a smart point. Let us understand what she said in her usual nagging style. Let us deal with the substance. The report was-and this is what you are taking up-that, after a year of increased compliance activities, the number of fraud prosecutions had dropped by 5.2 per cent. Ms Macklin-Convictions. Mr Tanner-Convictions.",141
94,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us understand where convictions arise in this year. They arise because of the reports that were made in the last year that you were in office. In fact, looking at 1995-96, of course the low number of prosecutions referred to the director in that year led to a decrease in the number of convictions. That is the logical outcome of the number of referrals that you were making. That is the point that ought to be understood. The referrals to prosecution in the year when we were responsible were up by 32 per cent. If you have got any other smart remarks of that character to make, let us hear them. Indonesia",141
95,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister please explain how this government can justify making available to Indonesia what may be as much as $1.7 billion when we already give approximately $90 million in foreign aid, $8 million of which is for their defence forces? Has the government considered that perhaps it is more appropriate for President Suharto to help bailout his own people with some of the billions he and his family have profited from during his time in office? Is it the policy of this government to prop up questionable and militaristic regimes with appalling human rights records?",141
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the question raised by the member for Oxley deserves a serious and considered response. I think that what the member for Oxley is endeavouring to do is, firstly, misrepresent what my government is proposing to do-as, with respect, she did in relation to the currency swap for Thailand when she quite wrongly categorised that as a direct contribution. What I announced yesterday after my meeting with President Suharto is justifiable ahd ought to be strongly supported by Australians on a number of grounds. The first ground is, may I say, national self-interest. is in the national self-interest of Australia have strong regional economies. It is in the national self-interest of Australia to help where it can strengthen an economy as large and potentially as powerful as that of Indonesia. The measure that I announced was designed not to prop up a regime but to help the Indonesian people. The measure that I announced was a demonstration of regional neighbourliness; I describe it as regional mateship. It was a desire on the part of my government, and I hope on behalf of most shades of political opinion in Australia, to demonstrate that, when a neighbour and close friend is in difficulty and you have the economic strength which this country has-and I am very proud of the fact that my country does have the economic strength to help and to play a part, and I am very proud of the measures that my government has taken to give us that strength-and you are faced with a situation like that, the right thing to do in the national interest and in the long-term interests of the region and our role in the region is to make the commitment that I made yesterday. It does not-as I hope the honourable member, on reflection, will understandamount to an outright gift as, with respect, your question implied and as you implied in relation to Thailand. What I indicated was that we would be prepared to participate in facilities organised by the IMP. I want to take the opportunity of making it clear that any involvement by Australia will be subject to the arrangement being supervised by the International Monetary Fund. I made it very clear to President Suharto in my discussion yesterday that we would expect Indonesia to comply with all the conditions laid down by the International Monetary Fund. Those conditions will undoubtedly involve measures to further improve, liberalise and strengthen the Indonesian economy. What you have here is a situation where it is in Australia's national self-interest to have a strong Indonesia capable of buying goods and services from Australia, capable of sending tourists to this country and capable of It making a contribution in partnership and into trade with Australia to the strengthening and the development of the Australian economy. It would be a very short-sighted and narrow-minded Australian government that passed up the opportunity to extend a strong hand of economic support in a time of difficulty to a friend and a neighbour. Wool",141
97,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Will today's announcement of a massive cash distribution to wool growers of equity from the wool stockpile help to restore the industry's viability and long-term prospects for growth? What financial flexibility will this equity payment give to wool growing families in my electorate of Wannon and across Australia?,142
98,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I know that all members of this House will wish the wool industry the best in its recovery. Here we see at last some real return for wool growers for all the blood, sweat and tears of the last six years. Today, the Chairman of Wool International, Dick Warburton, and I handed a large promotional cheque for $84 million to Andy Winterflood, a representative wool grower from the member for Hume' s electorate, John Sharp's electorate, nearby. That $84 million for the sale of non-wool assets is the first of what is actually likely to be several hundred million equity in Wool International as the mammoth task of winding up the stockpile and paying off the debt draws to a successful conclusion. It is worth remembering that when the process began the debt was $2.7 billion, the stockpile was around 4.7 million bales, and no-one believed that the wool could be sold for enough to pay the debt. Mr Crean interjecting",142
99,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member for Hotham obviously remembers. Indeed, there were some who wanted to bury or bum the stockpile. Mr Crean-Tim did; your leader did.",143
100,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"By the time we came to government we had an industry in a mess. It was divided, demoralised and going broke. In very difficult circumstances I convened two historic round tables involving every sector of the industry here and internationally, and we hammered out jointly a plan for recovery. And action followed that plan. We as a government committed ourselves to withdrawing from the industry and setting it on a path of self-destiny. We abolished the four per cent debt tax. We opened up the fixed release schedule. We rewrote Wool International's charter so that their responsibility became one of maximising the value of the industry instead of maximising the value of the stockpile. We put in place a program to phase down and then wind up Wool International, a statutory corporation which will no longer be needed when its task is completed. We set up a committee to look at wool contamination-to tackle that vitally important issue once and for all-and the member for Wannon is a valued member of that committee which is about to report. The government, and especially the Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, have worked extraordinarily hard on opening up new opportunities for this very important industry, including tariff free access to the United States via Mexico and lower barriers in China and India. The result is an industry in recovery: the stockpile down to 1.4 million bales, the debt now under $500 million, net assets of around $800 million against which growers can now borrow and prices in recovery. That recovery is based quite clearly on a restoration of confidence. A major wool user recently said to me that the trade now has restored confidence in the Australian government and the Australian industry, and that is in stark contrast to the chaos of John Kerin's reign, when the words 'immutable' and 'cast-iron' were not worth the paper they were written on. Remember that? Cast-iron and immutable: not worth the paper they were written on. In conclusion, this is a recovery for this major Australian industry, built on a level of confidence and trust that the previous government could never establish for this or any other major Australian industry any more than they could deliver the lower interest rates and the stable and properly valued Australian dollar that results from balancing the nation's books. Glysophate: Dumping",143
101,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Yesterday, Minister, you failed to answer whether the government had received a memo from China's Ministry of Chemical Industry seeking to fix the price of glysophate. Minister, now that you have had the opportunity to check, did your predecessor or any other minister receive a copy of this memo or receive a briefing in relation to it prior to the decision on the dumping of glysophate?",143
102,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I had asked my own questions committee to have a question on this issue today, but it did not get up, so I am thankful to the member for Hotham for serving up a nice, slow full toss. The AntiDumping Authority did receive a copy of a memo in relation to a proposed meeting in China to discuss issues of pricing of glysophate in China. The memo was provided by the agent to Monsanto, which was of course the company involved in lodging this action. The memo was marked 'confidential' and, in fact, attached to it was a letter which said: It is essential that this document remain strictly confidential. My office has spoken to Monsanto this morning, and it is still their wish that this memo be regarded as strictly confidential. However, it was received by the Anti-Dumping Authority. Mr Crean-And the minister?",143
103,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was considered by themMr Crean-By the minister?,143
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,143
105,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"before they reached their decision in relation to this matter. There role for the minister in being involved in considering the evidence before the AntiDumping Authority. His role comes after the decision is made. Whilst I was obviously not minister at the time, the minister at the time acted perfectly properly in this matter. He it to the Anti-Dumping Authority, which under legislation established by the ALP was charged with undertaking this responsibility. He acted correctly. Mr Crean-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.",144
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the minister concluded his answer? Mr Truss-Yes. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I had the call while he kept going. I ask a supplementary question.",144
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did you have a point of order first? Mr Crean-Now that he has sat down, I would prefer to pursue the supplementary. Did the minister receive this memo? Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Hotham rose to seek your call whilst the minister was answering a question. It is quite clear that you were prepared to give him the opportunity to raise a point of order. He has just gone on from that to take the opportunity to ask a supplementary question. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that in the ordinary course of events you would have turned to the right and given the call to a speaker on this side. You should not allow him this debating technique, which we have every day, of using a point of order for that purpose.",144
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not uphold the point of order. Mr Crean-A point of order, Mr Speaker",144
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have not upheld the point of order. Mr Crean-Then I repeat the supplementary question. Did the minister's predecessor or any other minister receive the memo?,144
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable is no member for Hotham will resume his seat.,144
111,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. While we were delighted to hear the answer from the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, unfortunately the microphone was turned off about five seconds left before he finished it. At this end of the chamber, we had no idea what the end of the answer was. Could I ask him to finish his answer before any supplementary question is presented.",144
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the right honourable member for New England. In recognition of your extensive experience, I am tempted to allow that course. However, I am sure that we have the response digitally recorded and recorded by our excellent and professional Hansard staff. I am sure anybody who wishes to see the detail of the minister's response will be afforded an opportunity either later today or certainly first thing in the morning. Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The supplementary question is an exact restatement of the original question. It has already been fully answered. I ask you to rule it out of order.",144
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Opposition members-What about the supplementary?,144
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am contemplating the words of the member for Hotham. We have had a series of interjection since then. Mr Martin Ferguson-Read them again.,144
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I thought he could repeat his words precisely then I might encourage him to do that, but I am I)ot prepared to go that far. From recollection, the supplementary question was very much in line with the question first asked and I will not allow it. Waterfront Industry: Reform",144
116,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, following discussions with the Maritime Union of Australia, the Australian Maritime Officers Union and the ACTO last night on reform of the Australian waterfront, can you inform the House of any progress towards improved productivity?",144
117,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for his question. Mr Latham-Is there a park bench in it?,145
118,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, we are not going to sit point. on a park bench. But the government did have a 3Y2-hour meeting last night with the MUA, the AMOU and the ACTU. We issued a joint press release after it, which is probably a in itself. The press release actually had telephone numbers of the MUA on the bottom of it, upon their request, which is a minor matter but it shows you that we are prepared to, at least, work to some common outcome. This morning when Mr Coombs came into do a radio interview a member of my staff actually met him at the Senate door to make sure he got there. It is certainly unusual the government to be inviting members of the MUA into the parliament. Prime Minister, will give you a full briefing later. We did have a very frank discussion and we did canvass a lot of the issues. As I said to Mr Coombs in no uncertain terms last night, the government is absolutely deteraddition mined to see a significant improvement productivity on the waterfront. We do not resile from that and we are very determined to press ahead with it. That we do not believe that we have an obligation to talk. We do believe that. Last night we spent a lot of time literally laying it out in a frank way with the MUA, making it very clear to them what we believe the industry should be aiming for and the means by which that objective should be achieved. I also made it clear to Mr Coombs that we do not believe that this matter can talked and talked about without result. view is that sitting down and genuinely talking about it is fair enough, but we do to see some real progress and we have agreed to meet in a few short weeks before Christfront, mas. It is true that there was one area where think that there may be some common body. ground. That is on the question of safety. tabled the Easson report. We gave them a copy of it last night. I think that they would waterfront. have to accept that, based on that report, the safety record in the industry is not good. We do need to set some general objectives about trying to improve safety for the people who work on the waterfront. I think that they will in due course, as they digest that, see that Whilst they are prepared, I think, ultimately, feat to see that point, they are not prepared to the accept the idea of benchmarks in respect of industrial action. I say to John Coombs, 'Listen, John, industrial action on the waterfront is 10 times the national average,' and he says, 'Don't be confrontationist; don't provoke us.' I say to him, 'The crane rates are shocking, John. Look at New Zealand. Can't we do as well as New Zealand?' and he says, 'Don't you be provocative. Don't you confor front us.' I say, 'And, John, you are undermining the reputation Australia should have I as a reliable supplier,' and he says, 'Well, when you say it then the world knows it.' So we are undermining the reputation that we ought to have for reliability. Even as we were debating these issues last night, the newest to Australia's merchant fleet arrived into berth in Geelong and could not get in because of industrial action being taken in Victoria in which the MUA was, effectively, is not to say that participating. In fairness, it was a frank discussion and John Coombs said as much this morning. I welcome that. That is a step in the right direction. That is good, as far as it goes. Noone is kidding themselves about the likely results of those discussions, but we are prepared to give it a go. We are prepared to talk be to them. We encourage them to, for starters, Our acknowledge that there is a problem. And there is a problem. It is a big problem. Beneed yond the problems, what needs to be understood is that, if we could have a good waterwe would have more jobs created in the Australian economy and higher export inI comes, and that would be better for everyIt is a start, but I say to the MUA that We the days of denial are over and we have to have a pathway to doing a lot better on the Glysophate: Dumping",145
119,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is again addressed to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Can the minister confirm that Monsanto sent a letter to Mr Prosser, then minister for customs, on 11 November 1996, with the price fixing memo attached? To quote from that letter. There is no doubt that this commodity is subject to government control in terms of its ex-factory selling price and export price. The attached directive from the price coordination committee of the Ministry of Chemical Industry confirms this. How can you continue to say that this government was unaware of glysophate price fixing, and why did the government cover up this evidence in its decision to declare China a market economy?",146
120,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Obviously I cannot confirm or deny what correspondence the previous minister may have received. Mr Crean-Will you check it and come back?,146
121,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is obviously a matter for him. Mr Crean-No, it was you.",146
122,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If in factMr Crean-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker? Isn'the the minister for customs? Doesn'the have responsibility for this?",146
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat. I will not allow frivolous action of that sort, and I warn the member for Hotham.",146
124,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If it is in fact the case that a letter was written on 11 November, I would remind the honourable member for Hotham that the Anti-Dumping Authority's report was dated 8 November, so it was too late. But what in fact the member for Hotham has said is really a scurrilous allegation that the government has endeavoured to cover up some kind of memo. That is clearly false. Monsanto specifically asked that the memo be kept confidential. That is still their wish. The Anti-Dumping Authority respected that wish. But I think I should add a couple of other points. The memo is not particularly relevant to the case in the first place. It dealt with a proposed meeting to be held to discuss price fixing. Mr Crean-Price fixing!",146
125,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Price setting!,146
126,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"However, the Anti-Dumping Authority was considering actions in relation to matters between",146
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, would you resume your seat for a moment. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Denison. The honourable member for Denison thereupon withdrew from the chamber.",146
128,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The matters before the AntiDumping Authority at the request of Monsanto dealt with allegations of dumping between 1990 and 8 November 1996. Therefore, a meeting proposed to be held in October 1996 to discuss future arrangements is obviously irrelevant. I will make another important point. The Anti-Dumping Authority, under the legislation introduced by Labor, is required to consider the domestic pricing arrangements in the country of manufacture and compare them with the prices in this country. This particular meeting that you are referring to was about export pricing. In fact, in the memo 'export' is mentioned five times and 'domestic' not at all, so it really is completely irrelevant. That was the view taken by the Anti-Dumping Authority, which was set up to provide independent advice on these sorts of issues. I will make one final point in relation to this matter, and it is a very critical point that is highlighted right at the commencement of the report. Perhaps the member for Hotham might like to go and read the Anti-Dumping Authority report on this glysophate issue. It reads: A fundamental feature of a valid complaint about dumping has got to be the issue of local content. There must be 25 per cent of the factory cost of the good attributed to the cost of production in Australia. A critical element in the ADA's decision on this glysophate case was that Monsanto did not meet the 25 per cent test. So it was completely impossible for them to succeed in that regard. There has been no cover-up on behalf of the government. The ADA did, however, respect Monsanto's specific request that the memo be kept confidential. . Migration: Skill Vacancies",146
129,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I address my question to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Minister, my electorate of O'Connor is participating in the exciting economic growth arising from development projects in WA such as a $1.4 billion steelworks in Geraldton. Minister, local employers have already asked for and received coalition government assistance to train local workers but have concerns that additional skilled workers will be needed to ensure their particithe pation in lucrative contracts. Minister, what government initiatives are in place to address this good news problem?",147
130,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. Of course, it is the government's priority to get Australians into jobs but, where skill vacancies cannot be filled from the local and the Australian job market, employers do need flexibility. We have recognised this. There some regional areas of Australia where it is especially hard to fill vacancies for highly skilled positions. If you have these unfilled, of course, it can jeopardise opportunities in projects of the type that the honourable member for O'Connor referred to, and that can put the job opportunities for other Australians at risk as well. We have supported a number of schemes to enable employers in regional areas to bring in skilled migrants where they cannot fill the positions locally. We have done that through the local regional development organisations, which are given authority to certify the shortages that do exist. I am pleased to be able to announce again that we have in fact appointed a number of additional organisations to fulfil this role as regional sponsored bodies. They include the Mid-West Development Commission of Western Australia based at Geraldton, which will have authority to approve nominations under that scheme. I have also approved the Great Southern Development Commission in Albany, the Pilbara Development Commission based in Karratha and the City of Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales. These organisations will assist significantly in filling these sorts of vacancies. There is to also commence on 1 November a new scheme involving state and territory governments, which will be able to sponsor up to 200 skilled migrants and their families in the independent skilled category. They do have a very positive impact upon the economy. They bring young skilled people with English language competency, and that assists greatly with the economy. I think it is a very significant demonstration of the way in which government is assisting regional Australia in development, and it is ensuring that there is greater public confidence in the immigration program by obtaining a better dispersal of the migration intake. Aged Care",147
131,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Premier of South Australia, Mr are John Olsen, supported by his Minister for Family Services and former Premier Dean Brown, has warned your Minister for Family Services that 'the change to this government's controversial aged care legislation announced on Monday did not go far enough'? Further, that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone, was quoted as warning, 'Most territorians in aged care could not afford the accommodation bonds and there would be no winners.' In light of the Premier's and Chief Minister's comments and the ongoing anguish of older Australians, will you now state whether there will be any further changes to your policy?",147
132,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have long since learnt from experience not to accept as gospel remarks attributed to other people out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition. I will go and check precisely what both Mr Olsen and Mr Stone may have said. Can I say in relation to each of them that if they have anything they want to put to me I will certainly be willing to listen to what they have to say. As to the second part of the honourable gentleman's question, I refer him to the statement that was made by my colleague the Minister for Family Services. Sydney 2000 Olympic Games",147
133,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister fof'Sport and Tourism and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Sydney 2000 Games. I refer the minister to the Howard government's commitment to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. What is the Commonwealth's commitment to the 2000 Games to date? What extra resources, if any, will be directed towards the staging of the games? How is this contribution consistent with the approach of the New South Wales government?",148
134,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. He is a very keen sportsman himself. Mr Latham-Sumo wrestling.,148
135,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know he is a great squash player. Even though squash is not an Olympic sport, he should not feel too bad because neither is golf. For those of on the other side of the House, neither is sumo wrestling, nor is it ever likely to be.",148

137,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think that is enough. I am very fortunate that my predeinclude cessor in this job, the current Minister for Family Services, the Hon. Warwick Smithindeed the great Warwick SmithMr Warwick Smith-What does it take to get a ticket?",148
138,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You better go and see Richo about that.,148
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will address the question.,148
140,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He established a strong partnership with both the New South Wales government,148
141,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,148
142,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me repeat that for the edification of honourable members. My sainted predecessor established a strong partnership with the New South Wales government and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, better known as SOCOG. I have done what I can to build on that rapport with both Minister Knight and the board members of SOCOG. Those links were extended this morning with the IOC when commissioners Dr Jacques the Rogge and Monsieur Francois Carrard, to the gether with John Coates of the Australian Olympic Committee, took time out to visit Canberra and meet me and my ministerial colleagues. I notice also in the media there has been a little speculation about the issue of funding for a host of logistical items that will be undertaken by the Commonwealth in connection with the games. I would like to use this opportunity to perhaps clarify some of the facts surrounding the Commonwealth government's direct contribution to the costs of the Olympic Games. That stands at the moment at around $700 million. This includes up to $290 million by way of rebate to SOCOG of income and sales taxes. I think it is a very real manifestation indeed of the clear goodwill on the part of the Commonwealth government to make sure that the job SOCOG you has to perform gets done. It also includes $175 million forfacilities for the games, $135 million towards athlete preparation and of course the tax reimbursement figure. But, more importantly, what it does not are the significant costs being incurred day to day and week to week by a number of departments and agencies of the Commonwealth government as they undertake preparations for games related activities. Mr Albanese interjecting",148
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-Order! I warn the member for Grayndler.,148
144,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nor does it cover the potential costs of security and the millions of dollars, up to I believe about $640 million, to be spent by the Federal Airports Corporation to improve Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The Commonwealth is also honouring a number of other guarantees made by the previous government to the organisers of the games at the time of the bid. These includes such things as the facilitation of entry to Australia by members of the Olympic and Paralympic families, extension of Medicare benefits to Olympic and Paralympic family members and other more perhaps nuts and bolts items such as the streamline entry of goods for use at the time of the games and their exemption from sales tax or customs duties. All these matters have been or are in the process of being resolved between the two tiers of government, both of whom have the same full and enthusiastic commitment to seeing that the Sydney Games will be the best ever staged. Nursing Homes",148
145,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Is the minister aware of nursing homes delaying entry of patients to test the market for entry fees in order to give preference to those who can pay the highest, as was reported in Sunday's SunHerald? When will the minister get rid of these accommodation bonds to make sure access to nursing homes is on the basis of health need alone?",149
146,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not had reports of those issues whatsoever. I suspect that it is like a lot of your contributions in the parliament over the last couple of days-an exaggeration of reality. I am very surprised you have waited till the last question. You were almost saved by the bell, waiting for the last question, because today I see in the Sydney Morning Herald what I predicted would happen last Monday: that, once people started to understand the sense of what we are proposing for the long-term needs of this country, people would start to recognise the ploy you are pursuing in scaring people would be recognised for what it is. Let me quote from the Sydney Morning Herald today. It said: ... having done so, has been exploited cynically by the Opposition. Then it went on to say: But the Opposition does have a responsibility to approach the matter with more seriousness and less inclination to political advantage than now. If you have legitimate issues you wish to raise, I invited you to do so last Monday. Industry Policy",149
147,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Has the minister seen recent reports detailing the opposition's approach to industry policy? Can the minister inform the House how these policies compare to the government's achievements in this area for a competitive Australia?",149
148,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is not responsible for the opposition's industry policy and the question is therefore out of order. He should be asked a question about his industry policy, of which there is none.",149
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Calwell will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,149
150,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased that the member for Bendigo raised this matter because I know members of the government have been concerned about the rate of progress of the government's record, which is quite remarkable this year, and what has occurred in the opposition. The Prime Minister might not be aware that on Monday both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham were not in question time. I was expecting a question but nothing occurred. So I went back to the office and picked up the press release that came out from the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Crean interjecting",149
151,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was a joint statement. You were in it too. For a start, they rambled along about what they may and may not doa metal fabrication council and all these sorts of things.",149
152,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Table it. It is an excellent paper.,149
153,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is an excellent press release. I quite agree, because in the last two paragraphs you run a great contradiction. It says: ... the government's failure to implement an interventionist policy. it is showing Two paragraphs later it says: However, Labor does not believe that central governments should impose these strategies upon the community. You have to make up your mind on what you are doing. When I heard all these thingsgoing around and what was coming out from the member for Hotham-I seem to remember having read them somewhere before. Old ACTU habits never die; they keep on going. I went to a trade union handout on policy, the policy from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. All the things I had read the day before from the member for Hothamexport targets, sectoral working parties, replace the Productivity Commission-and there they all were when I turned over to the trade union paperMr Crean interjecting",149
154,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sectoral. Didn't you hear? That is the trouble when you go to Bordeaux; you don't hear a lot of things. When I picked this up I immediately recognised that the great policy vacuum the Labor Party has is going to be answered once again by their ACTU mates, their unions. What they say is good enough for Crean. It is no wonder the gentlemen down here are getting restless, because they are writing books, essays and theses about policy issues; but, no, they stay with the ACTU part over here where nothing goes on. Just in case people have forgotten how long the history goes, we go back to Australia Reconstructed. This is the bible from which all your policy came for the accord. You could not make that work. You cannot get past it. The ACTU tried to run an industry policy by picking up all the very worse of trade union policies? I wish you weB, Simon. You have a long way to go. Higher Education Contribution Scheme",150
155,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, isn't the true state of Australia's university sector reflected in the enrolment application figures for 1998, showing a seven per cent decline in New South Wales, a three per cent drop in Victoria following a national fall of more than four per cent for 1997? Don't these figures show that the government's changes to HECS have discouraged tens of thousands of young Australians from pursuing their best opportunities in life through a university education? When will the government reverse its damaging HECS structure?",150
156,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is always interesting to get a question from the 'anointed one' down the end of the bench, as I think the Age Good Weekend magazine called you. He is so restless that he is trying to get rid of the old guys up here. He is quite entitled to ask questions about universities. It is the only thing he seems to be interested in. He never asks a question that concerns the 70 per cent of young people who are not going on to university; he is always focused on the university sector. He is entitled to ask questions about universities, but if he does ask questions about universities he might at least make sure that they are well based. The member for Werriwa asks about the effects of the government's policies on universities. The objectives of the government's policies on universities have been twofold: firstly, to increase the number of places and opportunities at universities for young Australians-to expand opportunities in contrast to the policies of the previous government which shut tens of thousands of qualified students out of universities-and, secondly, to expand the total resources going into Australian universities so that the quality of the facilities and the quality of the education can be improved. What have been the consequences of the government's policies for universities? Mr Tanner-Applications are going down.",150
157,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne, backing up his other young and restless coBeague there, seems to think that applications are the critical factor. The critical factor is the number of students in universities. Enrolments are the critical factor. What the enrolments show is that undergraduate enrolments in universities this year are up 13,000 over last year, giving expanded opporturiities for young Australians. Mr Hardgrave interjecting",150
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Moreton!,150
159,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, more than that, I have gone to the trouble of checking what has happened to total university resources over the last two years. Members of this House will be very surprised to hear-given the totaBy misleading rhetoric of the member for Werriwa-that total university resources, governmental and private, over the last two years are estimated, on the best data we have available, to have increased by some $500 million. Mr Hardgrave interjecting",150
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Moreton!,151
161,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In other words, the university sector has increased its resources as a result of the freeing up of that sector very substantially over the last couple of years. What this underlines is that this government, unlike the previous government, through its policies is there to expand education and training opportunities for all young Australians-those who want to go on to university, those who want to do apprenticeships and those who want to do vocational education in school. All young Australians have benefited from the policies of this government. Employment: Young Australians",151
162,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and deals with the 70 per cent of young people who are not going to university. Is the minister aware of the success of the 'Young Australians want to work' program sponsored by the Rotary Club of Canberra City and embraced by the Rotary Club of Gladstone Midday in my electorate of Hinkler? How does this campaign complement the government's recently announced new apprenticeships initiative to promote apprenticeships and traineeships and to create real jobs for young Australians?",151
163,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I note for the benefit of the House that the member for Hinkler is rapidly building a very strong reputation of concern for job opportunities for young people in his electorate. I understand that he has recently launched the 'Young Australians want to work' campaign in his electorate, organised by Rotary International in conjunction with the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition. This campaign which I launched nationally on 4 September encourages employers, particularly small businesses, to hire more young unemployed people by taking advantage of the government's initiatives for the unemployed. The government provided some $32,900 for the production of a video, the core component of this campaign. I understand that the Rotary Club of Gladstone Midday, working with the local CES, has been successful in encouraging local employers to lodge vacancies for young people. In fact, as a result of this campaign, a total of 63 vacancies have so far been lodged with the Gladstone CES: 24 positions are for new apprenticeships, 17 positions are for full-time work and 22 positions are for casual employees. This very important and valuable program by Rotary is still in its early stages. I encourage Rotary clubs around Australia to participate in it, as the member for Hinkler's local Rotary club has done. I am sure that young people will benefit greatly. It complements the government's campaign to increase the number of new apprenticeship opportunities for young people. This week some information was mailed out to 2,800 secondary schools around Australia, highlighting the opportunities available for young people in new apprenticeships in industries such as communications, telecommunications, multimedia, tourism and hospitality. A further mail-out to 60,000 employers, promoting the benefits to their business of taking on a new apprentice, will go out in November. I am pleased to report that there has been a continuing positive response to this new apprenticeship marketing campaign with some 9,000 inquiries so far. This demonstrates the efforts the government is prepared to make to expand opportunities for the 70 per cent of young people who are not going on to university-which the member for Sydney, on behalf of the Labor Party, conceded that they did not do enough for in government and which the member for Werriwa does virtually nothing for. Under this government, traineeships continue to expand at a very substantial rate. Last financial year there were 52,700 new traineeships-a record number-which was a 44 per cent increase over the previous 12 months. In this financial year there have already been some 15,000 new traineeships, a 25 per cent increase over the same period last year. This government's policies are designed to ensure fairness and equity in educational and training opportunities for all young Australians.",151

180,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have two questions for you, and they relate to some divisions that occurred in the House at about 7 p.m. last night. The first question is: as one of those who was denied the opportunity to vote against the amendments introduced by the member for Dawson, could I ask you to rule on the appropriate timeMr Crean- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is that this was canvassed last night. It has already been taken on board by the Deputy Speaker, and it is out of order because it is just repeating what has already been referred to.",152

182,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, as one of those who was denied the opportunity to vote against the amendments introduced by the member for Dawson, could I ask you to rule on the appropriate time for the ringing of the bells in view of the definition of debate on page 457 of Parliamentary Practice, in in view of the Hansard record on page 9851 and in view of the fact that some 2Y2 minutes elapsed between divisions? Mr Speaker, my second question is: a viewing of the tape of proceedings shows very clearly that the member for Lyons, who was in the chair at the time, was acting under instruction from the member for Hotham. Could you advise whether, by instructing the Deputy Speaker to call the bells for one minute, there was undue intervention in the independence of the chair by the member for Hotham?",152

193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to prevent the recent influx of heroin and other harmful drugs as a result of federal budget cuts to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service which has led to the unnecessary death of hundreds of young Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",154
194,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to approach this matter of public importance without all the histrionics that were demonstrated in this place this afternoon by those on the other side who purport to be the government of this country in responding to very legitimate questions that we as an opposition raised. I would also like to approach this from the point of view of the invitation by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to have some sort of a bipartisan view on the fight against drugs in Australia as to how we might achieve that. At the outset let me suggest one of those remedies to the Prime Minister immediately-that is, restore the funding cuts to both the AFP and the Australian Customs Service that were in the 1996 budget delivered by his government. I do not think anyone in this place, particuoccasions. larly anyone who has a family, has not been touched by the ravage that is the drug menace of our society today. It seems almost every day we read newspaper stories or we see television footage of somebody collapsing in the street, whether it be in Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth, in country New South Wales or in country Victoria. If people are quick enough to get the ambulance service there and if that ambulance paramedic is quick enough to administer the antidote, we see the person who has OD'd revived. The OD'ing that is taking place is quite often these days on heroin. Why? Because heroin is nooding this country. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) would have to admit himself that, where people can go into suburban Sydney, suburban Perth and, dare I say, even suburban Brisbane and buy a hit of high-grade heroin for between $5 and $7, there is something wrong with the detection systems in this country. Where people can buy heroin at a cost that is actually less than the cost of a packet of cigarettes-which we stand up in this place and talk about, which we put barriers in front of, which we ban the advertising of and so on because they are seen as being a health risk-there is something wrong with the system. The Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police and state police forces generally speaking are men and women devoted to the task-the task of drug enforcement programs, drug detection programs and programs of prosecuting those people who would trade in illicit substances. Those people are not super men and women. Those people cannot be expected to fight this fight against this menace to society when resources are constantly cut. I am sure the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs is going to get up in this place shortly, refer to some of his budget papers and say, 'But we have actually increased the money.' That is not true; it is simply not true. If you have a look at the figures for the Australian Customs Service and for the Australian Federal Police, you can see that their budgets have been cut on both For example, the Australian Federal Police budget has been cut by $37.6 million in the last two years. Over the coming short period of time, that will equate to a loss of at least 100 Federal Police agents in this year alone. As Commissioner Palmer recently admitted, the AFP is now capable of undertaking proactive operations against only one of the seven or eight major crime rings at a time. In the AFP 1996-97 annual report, for example, it was stated: With reducing budgets and fewer people ... the number of tasks the AFP must place 'on hold' or reject because of lack of resources will increase. There is also an increasing opportunity cost to the AFP's clients and stakeholders, and ultimately Australia, of the amount of crime falling within the AFP's jurisdiction that will be allowed to continue unimpeded, and remain uninvestigated and undiscovered. It does not just stop there. The Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions' budget has been cut by $14.6 million over the next four years, reducing its ability to prosecute criminals who are caught by the AFP. The National Crime Authority'S budget has been cut by $7.4 million in last year alone and $20.4 million of its reduced budget over the coming years will not be available for the war against drugs. As a result of the cuts, the NCA, which targets the activities of organised crime, now has only a notional presence in South Australia and Western Australia. Yet the government and the Prime Minister stood up in this place this afternoon and said, 'We are prepared to put resources into the fight against crime. We are prepared to put resources into the fight against drugs.' In what way are those resources going to be applied? He is going to have a talkfest at the next COAG meeting with his colleagues from the various states and say yet again, 'Premiers, how can we approach this issue?' Quite frankly, his ability to approach this to date has been absolutely abysmal. I return again to the figures. As I said, minister is going to rely on his interpretation of the figures, but I just refer him in respect of the AFP to Budget Paper No.1 of 1997-98 and Budget Paper No.1 of 1996-97. If you look at those two tables and rationalise them, you can actually see that the APP budget has been reduced by $96.7 million over the years 1996-97 to 2000-01 as against what the budget might have been had it been maintained at the 1995-96 level of $201.6 million. Those figures can be demonstrated and I would be more than happy to table the documentation that proves that. There is something else which is important in this debate, that is, the amount of illicit drugs coming into this country is on the increase. The Australian Customs Service annual report, tabled in this parliament only yesterday, detailed the large increase in the volume of drugs seized. It is important and instructive for people to listen to this. The Australian Customs Service intercepted 169 kilos of heroin in 1996-97 compared with 64 kilos the previous year; 68 kilos of cocaine in 1996-97 compared with 58 kilos the previous year; 24,296 kilos of cannabis in 1996-97 compared with 53 the previous year; and 75 kilos of ecstasy in 1996-97 compared with 31 kilos the previous year. I am sure honourable members would all agree that this is an impressive increase. There is no doubt about that. As I said to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and as I say again now, the dedicated men and women of the Australian Customs Service-those who are left-are working in a part-time capacity, regrettably, between 9 and 5. As my colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) will outline with respect to the port of Port Kembla, under your administration, Minister, since your government came to power, the number of people working at Port Kembla for the Australian Customs Service has been slashed from 14 down to five. They work between the hours of 9 and 5 and then they disappear. Do the drug pushers clock off at 5 o'clock? You say, 'We will have a flying squad come in if we suddenly hear through the intelligence unit that there might be drugs the coming into Port Kembla.' As my friend the member for Throsby is going to point out, the trouble is that as the flying squads come into Port Kembla, the drug pushers are going up to Sydney to sell the stuff. They pass each other on the freeway. How do you explain that, Minister? The simple fact is that the cuts to the Australian Customs Service are all so substantial. The Australian Customs Service's budget has been cut by $79 miIlion over the coming four years. Mr Truss-Ha, hal",154
195,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Have a look at your own budget papers, instead of shaking your head and mock laughing. I refer the minister-he has only been here for five minutes-to the Senate estimates committee meeting of 3 June 1997 where your own Comptroller General of Customs said: Last year the government took a decision to slice $50 million over three years off Customs. Last year it was $9.2 million or $9.4 million and that goes to $20.8 million this year, and I think we have had our fair share. Dead right. That was your own Comptroller General of the Australian Customs Service complaining about the cuts to his own organisation. As I said, you have only to look at the major ports around this country to see what the problem is about the importation of drugs. With the sniffer dogs and the intelligence units, and the way in which Australian Customs Service works effectively with overseas agencies to trace some of those movements into this country, they get only about one in five, and the four out of five which they miss are bringing in massive quantities-quite obviously by the amount that is now on the streets. If there has been an increase of drugs coming in in the last 12 months to two years and the seizures have gone up, it is because there is more being imported into this country which is going undetected. One of the most insidious problems faced because of the drugs coming into this country is the effect it has on families. I recently attended a drug summit in my home town of Wollongong with some very well meaning people. I listened in absolute horror as former drug addicts told their stories of buying heroin and crack, and stories about snorting cocaine-it did not matter-and stories about cannabis being the start and how they prothe streets. gressed to heavy drugs, the stories from police officers who tore their hair out saying that, because of resources and restraints being imposed by governments, they could not their job. As a pareIlt I sat there in absolute horror because I have heard the stories from my kids' school. Kids aged 13 and 14 in year 7 and year 8, because of peer pressure, have carry around little sachets of cannabis. Some carry around heroin because of that peer pressure. What is more alarming than anytralians. thing is that we are seeing that no longer only in high schools; we are seeing it in the prileave granted? mary schools. In Australia, we are now getting reports of kids as young as 10 of age being exposed to the drug problem. You might all laugh and think nonsense. Go and talk to the people who work with the drug rehabilitation units around this country. Talk to them and get the names and addresses of some of the parents whose kids have been turned on to these illicit substances and see whether it is true. Talk some of the former users, talk to some of people who are scrounging money together go to places like Mexico to get some exotic method of getting off heroin addiction other things. See whether or not those stories are true. Do not just take our word for it, opportunity. either. What we tend to do in this place quite often is say, 'The government produces statistics, the opposition goes and finds something different from the information that is there, they read the Australian Customs Service annual reports and come to different concluSouth sions.' Let me report on a very extensive study that has been done very recently PhD thesis by Mr Hank Prunckun on the use of narcotics in this country. What he has found is that there were 1,700 kilos of heroin imported into Australia in 1996-97, which had a retail value-now hear this-of $2.9 billion. He found that the amount of heroin seized in Australia by law enforcement agencies ranged from 3.5 per cent to 20 per cent-as I said, one in five. By a process of deduction, that means that at least 96.5 to 80 per cent of heroin imported into Australia ended up on One of the more interesting points that Mr Prunckun found was that the average street prices had fallen for heroin and that the purity do had increased. If the government does not believe me on this, I am quite happy to table the statistics contained in that PhD thesis, own which clearly demonstrate and indicate the rate of importation of illicit drugs into this to country, the values and the prices associated with those drugs and the devastating consequences that they have on the lives of AusI seek to table that information.",156
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Is Mr Truss-You haven't exercised the years normal courtesy of showing it to us.,157
197,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Yes or no? I want to get on that this is with the speech. Mr Truss-No.,157
198,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There you go: I think that just about says it all. When I am prepared to advance to this parliament in this important to debate some independent advice from somethe one who does not have a political agenda-as to the Prime Minister described our raising of questions in this place as being all about and today-the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, who is at the table, denies that Regrettably, this is a government which is soft on drugs. This is a government that is putting the lives of Australians at risk. It is a government that slashes resources to the Australian Customs Service, to the Australian Federal Police and, by inference, to the New Wales and other state police forces around Australia, yet it says it wants to get as a serious about drugs. The Prime Minister wants to have a talkfest. The Prime Minister was against the drug program that was proposed for the ACT, and as a consequence it fell over. Any innovative approach that is developed in this country seems to be knocked over by this Prime Minister, yet he stands up in this' place and says that he is opposed to drugs. (Time expired)",157
199,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (3.53 p.m.)A discussion on drugs is indeed a matter of public importance, and these sorts of subjects should be on the agenda for discussion in this parliament often. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) spoke about some desire for bipartisanship on this issue in his opening remarks, but throughout his entire address he resorted to petty party politics attempts at cheap point scoring. Labor has waited until the last sitting day before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is about to announce important new initiatives in this area to even bother to come into the House to raise the issue. They are so ashamed of their own record that they make a belated, last minute attempt to feign some interest in the issue. They are also suffering a good dose of embarrassment because of the outbursts of the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, on these matters. He is running off with all sorts of figures about budget cuts-entirely different, I might add, from the figures used today by the member for Cunningham and by Senator Bolkus in the other place. If members on the other side are going to make up some figures, it would be rather handy if they got their act together and sorted out what reductions the government is being accused of in this area. The facts are that the figures are a fantasy, contain an element of economic illiteracy and contribute absolutely nothing to the debate. It has been disappointing that the New South Wales government has shown such a reluctance to be involved in cooperative measures and to talk with the other states and Commonwealth agencies about what can be done to address the drug problems in that state and, indeed, in the whole of our country. It is we)) known that much of the drug related activity in Australia is centred around the New South Wales capital and that there are a number of major operations in that state. So it is absolutely essential that New South Wales is a partner in any effective program that we might have in addressing the enforcement issue in particular. Drugs are indeed a serious issue for all Australians. To suggest' that this is a new problem, a relatively new influx into our country, is impossible to justify, but it is without question that the problem continues to raise its head. Whatever amounts of drugs are available in our country are too large, and we want to do what we can as a government and as a community to address issues of supply. However, it is also important that we and address education issues. If we can reduce demand then the requirements for enforcement will be fewer. The Prime Minister's package, which will be announced later this week, will be very even-handed in that regard. It will address the importance of education and the importance of encouraging young people to have confidence in themselves and in their capacity to achieve and not to resort to drugs. It will have an emphasis on enforcement and on ensuring that we do what we can to reduce the flow of illicit drugs into this country. There are not only problems in relation to heroin and illicit drugs of that - nature; we must also address issues such as alcohol and tobacco related problems. The previous government endorsed a program some time ago which, at the time, was alleged to deal with a range of drug related issues. Sadly, it has retreated much more these days into dealing with things such as alcohol and tobacco-not that those are not important problems, but it is clear that we must also address major issues such as heroin. We do not want political stunts. We do not want empty name calling, as has been happening from the New South Wales Premier when in fact New South Wales has played a very limited role in many of these issues. I was interested that Mr Whelan, who has been making many comments as the New South Wales police minister, has shown a positive disinterest in being involved in the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy. I understand that there have been 15 meetings of the Australian Police Ministers Council since he has been the minister and that he has bothered to attend just three. Even when he was there, I am told, his contribution to those meetings was very paltry indeed and he has made very little contribution towards these sorts of issues. It is a low priority issue for the New South Wales police minister and, whilst the New South Wales government slash into their police budget and into their capacity to undertake effective operations against heroin and other illicit drugs, they try to tum the focus onto Commonwealth agencies. The Commonwealth stands ready to work with New South Wales and with the other states to mount an effective campaign against the entry of illicit drugs into our country, and also to ensure that effective education programs are in place so that young Australians-indeed, all Australians-look for alternatives than resorting to these sorts of props. Let us look clearly and in some detail at the issue of how much is actually spent by the government on Customs matters. The member for Cunningham foreshadowed in his MPI speech that I would quote the budget figures. Of course, I am going to quote the budget figures because they are an obviously reliable guide to what is being allocated in this particular area. The Customs budget this year is $422 million; last year it was $403 million; and the year before that it was $390 million. That does not sound like cuts to me. Earlier today, we heard references in question time to the annual report of the Australian Federal Police. I notice that the opposition did not choose to make any references to the annual report of the Australian Customs Service, even though it was released only yesterday, because it really is a proud record of achievement. In its annual document, the Australian Customs Service reports a remarkable record of success. We can proudly acknowledge the work and effort of Customs officers around Australia. These days, they are working smarter. They are relying much more on intelligence and technology to ensure that they know where to look. The nonsense being quoted about how many containers may be physically searched from top to bottom is really an irrelevance. If you are going to start looking for needles in haystacks, you are certainly going to need a cast of millions and very often be unsuccessful. It is far more important to rely on technology, intelligence and analysis so that, clearly when we go looking, we know what we can expect to find. We are much more likely to succeed in those sorts of efforts. These days, foot-to-foot barriers around the whole coastline of Australia would not be very effective. What we need to concentrate on is advanced technology and using our resources more wisely and well. That is what this government has.done. In our budget, $26 million has been provided over three years for technology, specifically to aid in drug detection and interception. The 1997 budget provided the first instalment of an upgrading in the Customs marine fleet, as the Prime Minister referred to in question time today. Customs now has the capacity to undertake surveillance up to 300 nautical miles off the coast. These sorts of initiatives are achieving real results. We are not working alone. Last weekend I was in Mackay and I met the Customs staff on the ground in a regional centre. They were able to report on the effectiveness of two Customs programs that I think are of enormous value. With the front-line program, Customs works in cooperation with importers to endeavour to develop intelligence and to get access to the sort of information that is likely to lead to results. One excellent example of that front-line program occurred in Mackay last year when 20 kilograms of cocaine were seized from a bulk ship. This was an example of Customs working cooperatively with the community. We have our own version of Neighbourhood Watch, the Customs Watch program, where people in the community are invited to provide information to Customs. That has been enormously successful. In areas such as the Torres Strait, where clearly a major surveillance task needs to be undertaken, we also rely heavily on local people to assist in that work. That sort of thing has helped to provide a much more effective and cost efficient barrier for our country to help stem the flow of drugs and other unwanted things into our nation. The member for Cunningham suggested that these strategies were failing, and he even had the temerity to suggest that the Australian Federal Police Commissioner had concerns in this regard. I refer the member to yesterday's Canberra Times where Commissioner Palmer stated categorically, as the headline says, 'Drugs fight not failing: police'. The article says: Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer has rejected claims by NSW Premier Bob Carr and his Police Commissioner Peter Ryan that federal authorities were not effective in keeping heroin out of Australia. The commissioner went on to explain much of the AFP's achievements in that regard. The responsibility for the Australian Federal Police is the responsibility of my colleague Senator Vanstone in the other place. Both Senator Vanstone in the other place and the Attorney General (Mr Williams) today identified that, firstly, the sorts of statistics quoted by the opposition in relation to cuts in the Australian Federal Police budget are false-they are completely wrong. Today, Mr Williams outlined the details of the efficiency dividends and the improvements that have been made in the administration of the AFP. Also, in the Australian Federal Police, the delivery of these savings is focused on administrative efficiencies and does not significantly impact on the AFP's important operational work and capability. The AFP is managing its expenditure to ensure that it maintains its commitment to important operations and activities within the projected budget allocations for this financial year. The AFP has in place a national prioritisation framework, which ensures that all matters are properly and appropriately assessed and prioritised according to available resources. The government has also commissioned a review of the financial practices of the AFP to provide a solid foundation for future resource considerations. The government is providing an additional $505,000 to the AFP to allow it to undertake preliminary work on security for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Nearly another $1 million over three years has been allocated to provide for the AFP adjustment scheme, a scheme supporting initiatives for broader anti-corruption measures. The government and the AFP are working together to ensure that AFP resources are effectively utilised. We need to be vigilant in our fight against the arrival into this nation of products, materials and drugs that no-one wants. We need to achieve those sorts of objectives by improved technology, improved intelligence and improved analysis of the information available. If Labor is interested in cuts in staffing numbers, perhaps it could explain why the Customs Service was slashed by 700 people in the last five years of its administration. That is where the slashing occurred-under Labor. The figures in relation to the Australian Federal Police were outlined by the Attorney-General during question time today. Labor members have stood in this place today crying crocodile tears and complaining about the number of staff in these organisations, while they were the ones who presided over significant reductions in staffing numbers. Mr Marek-Hypocrites!",158
200,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I note the interjection about the reliability of their comments in that matter. Despite the fact that they managed all these reductions in staffing numbers, they still delivered to this government a $10.3 billion budget deficit which we have had to fund. To the great credit of this government, we are returning our nation's books to equilibrium. There will be a surplus next year. We have achieved this by proper economic management, so naturally all sections, all departments, have had to do things more efficiently, more effectively, and that includes Customs and the AFP. I believe that our record in that regard is outstanding. The real reason for this matter of public importance is that under Labor very little was done, very little was achieved, in this important area. They are conscious of the fact that major announcements will be made in Sydney on Sunday. They are embarrassed that these announcements will show up their own paltry record. On Sunday, the Australian people will be challenged to join with this government, our law enforcement agencies and our educators in a new program to fight illicit drugs in this country. This government is committed and we invite others to join us. I hope that the opposition will do us and the people of Australia the credit of joining in these positive initiatives for the betterment of all Australians.",160
201,Mr HOLLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"How often do we hear people say that the future of Australia is its youth? Who can forget that during the election campaign those opposite touted family values as one of the central planks of their policies? But, when you look at the results, you have to ask what the government has done for youth or family values. There is no protection for young people from the scourge of drugs. It was claimed today that it is cheaper to buy a hit of heroin than it is to buy a packet of cigarettes. In Australia we are wide open to drugs. I noted what the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) said about there being a bipartisan approach. We are looking forward to what will be said on Sunday. We want to have a bipartisan approach, but we have got to recognise that there is a problem. Hurling abuse and saying, 'You people did nothing,' will not achieve a bipartisan approach. I think everyone in the chamber wants a bipartisan approach, but stop closing your eyes to the fact that there is a very serious problem out there. Representing, as I do, Port Kembla, I am well aware of the drug problems. I see what goes on on the streets of Port Kembla. People come and talk to me. I am on the board of the mission for the seamen. I talk to people in Port Kembla. I know what is happening there. I know that heroin is sold very cheaply for as little as $5 or $6 a hit. Drug pushers sell the first hit to the young very cheaply. They leave the kids dry for a while and then they hit the kids again for an increased cost. When heroin is not about at Port Kembla the crime rate goes up and iml!lediately everyone is restless. When the heroin is brought in the crime rate goes down. That is going on in Port Kembla and you cannot say that it is not. It is a vicious circle. Heroin has become a cheap and readily available drug and the young kids are buying and using it. How dare the minister say that we have not raised that issue! You have only to look back through Hansard to see the number of times that the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and I have raised in this House the question of the customs services at Port Kembla. In fact, I have written to all the Customs ministers-I have not written to the new minister, but he will receive a letter from me-inviting them to come to Port Kembla, talk to the customs people and see what is happening there. Unfortunately, they cannot talk to the Federal Police because they have been taken away from Port Kembla. As the member for Cunningham has pointed out, in its mad drive for the bottom line in the last two budgets the government has cut back funding to vital services which are supposed to be Australia's defence line against drugs and the people who push them into our community and to our youth. These budget cuts most savagely hit regional Australia and the specific law enforcement agencies tasked to fight the war on drugs. Do not be misled into thinking that drugs only come in through the major airports and ports of Australia, the so-called front doors; they also come in on isolated fishing vessels. Boats go up the north coast of New South Wales- Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you have heard the stories as I have heard the stories from my family there-things are thrown over and other boats come out and pick them up. But the main places where drugs come in are the regional ports close to our major cities. Port Kembla is a wide-open drug centre on the east coast of Australia. It is no exaggeration to say that Port Kembla is the major heroin importing port on the east coast. Drug runners have a free hand in the area. They do as they please, sell what they like and flout the local police and law enforcement agencies because there are not enough people there to stop them. It is a tragedy and an enormous disgrace. Port Kembla has over 500 ship visits a year, but the Customs Service at Port Kembla has in theory only five officers. There are usually only three officers at Port Kembla because people are off sick or on holiday. Two years ago there were 16 officers at Port Kembla. Today there effectively are three officers at Port Kembla. They operate from 9 to 5. They are fighting a war with one hand tied behind their back: as if the importation there is between 9 and 5! A few months ago I received a letter from the local pastor at Port Kembla. The pastor outlined in his letter what everyone in Port Kembla has known for some time. I forwarded this letter to the then newly appointed Minister for Customs, and Consumer Affairs, Senator Ellison, for response. The minister responded in due course and said, interestingly, that a top priority for the Australian Customs Service 'is the interdiction of imports of illicit drugs'. We all agree on that point. The minister also told me that 'a large proportion of these funds will be spent on acquiring and installing closed-circuit television cameras for monitoring Australian ports, including Port Kembla'. Just this morning I was informed that the closed-circuit television camera that was installed at the grain berth at Port Kembla had been packed up and shipped back to Sydney because of technical problems. It may interest the then minister to know that Port Kembla has no closed-circuit television to, as he said in his letter to me, 'significantly improve after-hours surveillance of wharves and vessels' . The closed circuit television that has just been packed off because of technical problems was hardly worth boasting about. I was taken on a tour of the port, as I am from time to time, earlier this year. I was taken to the places where these closed-circuit televisions and cameras are placed. They are so well placed that everyone knows where they are. They are so well placed that, instead of focusing on a vessel or some activity at the berth, the majority of the images were overshadowed by fixtures belonging to the structure of buildings and other things. If it was not so serious it would be quite funny. Further down the south coast is Eden, which is developing into another significant regional port. Log boats use the port extensively for woodchip exports and there is even a proposal to construct a new berth there. Drugs are coming through Eden as they are coming through Port Kembla. What has to be understood is that Port Kembla is one hour and 30 minutes from the all major distribution centres of Sydney. Heroin can come off a ship at Port Kembla and be on the streets being sold within an hour and a half. The response of the government has been to establish a flying squad in Sydney which comes to Port Kembla for major drug runs. The drug runners can get their supply of heroin and be passing the flying squad on the F6 freeway coming in the other direction. With this well researched intelligence that everyone has got, they are in the cars going up the M6 to Cabramatta or to Sydney while the flying squad is coming down to intercept them on the boats or somewhere. I have raised the issue of drug importation at Port Kembla with successive ministers. I have asked these ministers to visit Port Kembla with me to talk to the locals and see for themselves just how open Port Kembla really is. A former minister, in an answer to a question from the member for Cunningham, made the point that Port Hedland had a larger shipping movement than Port Kembla and they had electronic surveillance there which was very successful. So be it. How can anyone compare a port thousands of kilometres from a city with a port facility within a regional centre that is only an hour and a half from Sydney? It is just beyond me. In too many respects, the drug trade in Australia is out of control. I only wish that those who had become so vocal and outspoken about paedophilia and other anti-social behaviour were equally outspoken and vocal about the importation of hard drugs and the way they are destroying young Australian lives. The cost cutting measures introduced in the last two budgets are short-sighted and pennypinching at its most manic. The drug trade is worth millions-in fact, more than millions, billions of dollars. The drug runners are well organised, well financed and well equipped. We are definitely not talking about a bunch of amateurs. And the trade is increasing. You know it is increasing. It is not what people say publicly in the papers. Go and talk to the Federal Police. Go and talk to the customs people. Go and talk to anyone. It is a well organised business, and it is increasing in frightening proportions. Yet what do we put up against this organised crime? An underfunded, under-researched group of law enforcement agencies. Do not come with this rubbish about what the Labor Party did. What they have got to do is realise we have a problem and approach it. This is in no way to be critical of the Australian Federal Police, the NCA or the customs officers. Under the circumstances, they do a magnificent job with the limited resources they have been provided with by this government-and I might say by previous governments. We have got to start funding them if we are going to be serious about it. Until we properly resource these agencies, we are only scratching the surface-making no impact on the drug trade, losing the battle and wasting young lives because of the penny-pinching and ultimately short-sighted stupidity of the government with regard to these fundamental services for Australia. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (4.18 p.m.)-Earlier this year I spent a couple of nights on the streets of Kings Cross talking young people who were involved with drugs. I met one young fellow and he told me that heroin had saved his life. As a child he had lived with his mother who had broken up with his father when he was very young. Early in his life his mother had remarried. His stepfather had abused him right throughout his life. He had exceptionally low self-esteem and by age 13 he had left home and was on the streets. He was not educated. He had not done terribly well at school and, at age 16, contemWilliams) plating suicide, he tried heroin for the first time. Suddenly, for the first time in his life, he had esteem-he felt good about himself. And he was hooked. Aged 19, for various break and enter and drug related crimes, he was sent to prison for four years. I met him three days after his release at a food cart in Kings Cross. He was exceptionally angry because, four years later, all of his friends were gone, he had no family connections and he had been released with the clothes he had been arrested in and a small amount of money. After 13 years of Labor in government, there was no program there to pick him up when he was released. I met another young woman who had a mental illness. She was an addict, but there was very little that the government programs at that time could do for her because she did not fit in with the programs to deal with mental illness because she was a drug addict. But she did not fit into the programs designed for drug rehabilitation because she had a mental illness, so she was wandering in limbo. I met another young woman who had married an Australian when she was in South America. She did not speak any English. She had come to Australia with him. He had abused her and she found herself on the streets not speaking English in Australia. When looking at prostitution as a means to get by, heroin seems a pretty good option. It is about alternative programs. It is not simply catching the drugs when quite significantly and right throughout the world at this time every nation is losing the battle against the importation of the physical substances. It is about caring for the individuals who are affected. It is about offering them something to more, a better life and less despair than the circumstances in which they find themselves when they first try heroin, cocaine, ecstasy or even marijuana. It is a problem of enormous complexity and no nation has solved it. After 13 years in government, Labor had not solved it either. It is very disappointing to find them trying to score cheap political points on this issue at this time. The Australian Federal Police have indicated quite clearly to the Attorney-General (Mr that no operation, no sting, no task force that they had out there on the streets was compromised by any budget cuts. It was done administratively. They offered up the five per cent saving that every other government department offered up, in order to get our fiscal policy back in the black, in order to overcome that unemployment amongst our youth, the tragic levels of unemployment of our youth left to us by Labor. That unemployability was brought about through low literacy levels, through broken families, through financial stress on relationships that left kids in dire circumstances with low selfesteem and low skills. Labor left us with' $10 billion worth of debt to deal with those problems. The mandate with which we were elected is clear evidence that the previous government had failed in addressing social issues and the reasons that people actually tum to drugs. It is not a simple problem. It is not something as simple as saying, 'Oh well, let us increase the number of men on the beat and we will get all of the cocaine and all of the substances that are out there.' It has not happened in Australia's history. It has not happened III America's history. It has not happened III Scandinavia's history. It is a cheap stunt by the opposition think that they can drive the demand for these substances underground. It is a matter of addressing the real issues behind that demand. The extra money that has been put into this area has been put into technological surveillance. When I first came to this parliament on 2 March 1996, I had a 486 computer and a hot-paper fax. That is the state of technology that the Labor government left the government services with. It is known that it is not the cocaine you need to get. It is the money trail. It is the money laundering. When you track down the money that is where you get the operators. Today, to chase that paper trail you need technological capability such as satellite communications, interception devices and encryption devices. From a defence point of view, the government's encryption devices were left in a decrepit state by Labor. We really need to look at all of these resources to ensure our activities against the drug lords are secure-to ensure that we can break any codes that they are using and we can trace any banking transactions and any money laundering that is going on. You can see from Tuesday's paper that we have unmasked two of the major dealers in this area who were basically using casinos and various other mechanisms to launder money . We have had them banned from casinos. We are tracking them through the banks. If you cannot do that nine to five, when else can you do it? It is a matter of tracking those international banking connections. It takes technology to do that. It is something that Labor ignored, they had no zest for and they had no understanding of. They left the Australian Federal Police technologically in the dark ages against an organised Asian crime syndicate that is well funded, well resourced and high-tech. They are also investigating individuals on the east coast who are involved in organised crime and illicit motorcycle gangs-which I think reflects poorly on a number of motorcycle groups in my area. We hold an annual get-together in Penrith. Police are very aware of those activities through surveillance. We are closing down the ways they have availif they able to them to launder money. After taking the action this government has, we then tum to addressing the despair of the users. Why do they use for the first time? We have introduced literacy programs-we are fixing that problem-lPET, youth homelessness pilot programs, family counselling, family tax initiatives and savings initiatives to take the financial pressure off families. Financial pressure reaIly busts families up. We have family counselling to resolve crises before they get to the Family Court. There is no point, once summonses are issued, to offer them family counseIling. We are setting up systems to keep families together earlier. We have built strongly on our budget figures. Our underlying deficit has been reduced dramatically. In the last four years we have been running at least $10 billion in deficit. In the last four years of Labor they sunk Australia nearly $60 billion into the hole and we have that to pay that back. That amount of money carries with it interest as weIl. By 1999, we will be back in the black. There will be confidence in the Australian economy, there will be jobs growth and there will be a future for young people. They will recognise and have confidence in that. They will have jobs. They will have skills. They will have literacy. They will have a community awareness that will carry them straight through into the next miIlennium. This government has done an exceptional job of addressing the underlying causes of drug use. It is disappointing to see the political point scoring on this issue. (Time expired)",161
202,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am actually a bit loathe to rise to speak in this debate since the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) is now in the chamber. It is interesting that when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) answered a question on this issue in question time today he talked about the lack of bipartisanship in this field. In fact that is not quite true. There has been bipartisanship. Over recent years, the government and the opposition, whichever was in power at the time, have actually cut back in federal law enforcement agencies. When one looks at the cuts that have been inflicted upon the AFP in recent years, it is important to note th-t now the AFP has operational staff levels that it' has not had since 1984. It has had a very serious decline in the operational staff capability in its fight against drugs. I have proposed in this place and elsewhere that we ought to have a $100 million war against drugs. This is one of those areas where you have to balance up the fiscal responsibility of a fiscally responsible government and the social costs of the insidious threat of drug trafficking. I am not going to rely on the sorts of things that we pick up around our electorates. I am going to quote some of the experts. It is interesting that the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), who is no longer in the chamber, was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority during the time we were receiving evidence from experts around the country, both from the state and federal law enforcement agencies, who were reflecting the views of the AFP Association and others that the cutbacks have had a debilitating effect in the fight against crime and drugs, in particular. Jane E. Becker, a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, stated: The problem is getting bigger internationally. Worldwide opium production has more than doubled in a decade. The increase is disproportionately larger in South-East Asia. The CIA's latest estimates show that South-East Asia's 1994-95 crop was one of the largest in years. Cultivation five per cent and production, thanks to ideal weather, was up 20 per cent to 2,545 metric tonnes-64 per cent of worldwide production. More countries meanwhile are becoming increasingly involved in heroin production and trafficking. That quote gives one of the reasons why we have a much more pronounced problem with heroin trafficking in Australia: the availability of supply. I do not often support the New South Wales Premier, but I must say that he is not alone in criticising the federal government's cutbacks. I think it is cheap political point scoring for the federal government to single him out as the only voice of criticism in the area of drug trafficking, because he is not alone. The Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, a Liberal Premier, his Minister for Police and Emergency Services and his commissioner of police have said that they believe there is a crisis in drug trafficking in Australia. The Victorian police minister, another Liberal minister, and his Chief Commissioner of Police, Mr Comrie, have both said that there is a crisis requiring crisis response, not just another round of rhetoric. The commissioners of the South Australian and Queensland police services have also said that there is a very serious crisis. They have all indicatedcertainly in the evidence we received in the public hearings of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, a committee of which the minister for customs was formerly a member, and a member during the relevant period-that the federal cutbacks have had a debilitating effect on the fight against drugs. The minister said that the drug problem is not a new phenomenon. Of course it is not. It goes back many years. There is no doubt, and the experts all agree, that the problem has accelerated in recent years. In particular, in the last three years it has got to the extent where the purity and availability of heroin now is unprecedented. It is unprecedented to the extent that it has caused so many overdoses from people who are unable to cope with the increased purity of the heroin supply on the streets. Let me ask this question: is the federal government serious about the drug trafficking problem or does it just see it as another was up second order problem when it is considering financial cutbacks as part of its general fiscal disciplined approach? When I said at the beginning that there is a balance between the fiscal discipline required of a responsible government and the requirement to ensure these types of social problems do not get out of hand, then quite clearly in this case the drug problem-in particular the heroin problem-is a matter that requires crisis responses. The minister for customs talks about the changes to customs technology and intelligence. My information is, when we are talking about closed-circuit television improvements, that in many instances those closed-circuit television monitors are not monitored by staff. So, if a courier or somebody who is a suspect comes through, then those tapes have to be reviewed before anything can be done about it. The other thing is that the backscatter X-ray detection equipment, which has been promoted as one of the most advanced technological weapons in the fight against drug trafficking, is principally used for material going outwards. It is for the detection of cy transactions. When they say that it is another part of the armoury in the fight against drugs, they are not being fair dinkum. When they talk about the intelligence effort, they are not fair dinkum either because my information is that, with drug busts of more than $10,000, no drug bust has been initiated by the customs service based purely on customs intelligence; it has often come from other arrangements or other services. Let me talk about other areas where we have to ask whether the federal government is really fair dinkum about the fight against drugs. Another area relates to mutual assistance in criminal matters-legislation which was passed last year. In effect, this legislation makes it more difficult for Australia to participate in intelligence circulation and exchange with criminal intelligence agencies in our region. In 1994 I went to a conference in Sydney on Asian organised crime-and in particular on drugs-organised by the AFP and NCA. At that conference it was said that one of the biggest concerns was the Australian government's approach in areas where particular nations have capital penalties attached to offences when a person has been arrested. The mutual assistance in criminal matters legislation prohibits the Attorney General from providing information--even when the person arrested is not an Australian citizen-when Australia can provide information that may lead to a conviction. I might tell you that the Asian nations in our region colloquially call Australia a 'NATO' country-no action, talk only. I can tell you that when the secretarygeneral of Interpol was here he agreed with the proposition that any impediment to the free and efficient circulation and exchange of information in these matters will impede drug detection. Although it is not a drug matter, if there was another Oklahoma bombing, for instance, and Australia had information that could lead to the detection and conviction of a person who could be arrested and charged with that, the Attorney-General would be prevented by that legislation from exchanging that information unless the United States government came up with an assurance that they would not carry out the penalty, and that illegal currenwould be very unlikely. Recently, the government participated in the Thai baht bailout, a matter not debated in this place-nor was there any statement by the government. I ask why there was no requirement placed on the government of Thailand in relation to our $1.4 billion currency swap to improve and crack down on the drug trafficking coming from the Golden Triangle, of which Thailand is a part. In the end, how would we know? How could the population know? In actual fact, the matter was not made available for debate, even by the representatives of the public in this particular place. A principal senior adviser to this government is Daryl Smeaton. He is head of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. He was responsible for the Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements review in 1994, when they clearly identified who was responsible for much of the heroin importation into Australia. That was identified in 1994, and now the situation is much worse. So we can ask this question-irrespective of party background: is this government really serious about the fight against organised crime? We can ask the question: what has been done since 1994 except to cut back Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements? Mr Smeaton told us in May 1997: That has been quite clearwhen responding to government cutbacks impeding the fight against crimein the public statements of the chair of the National Crime Authority, and the Attorney-General himself has said publicly that resource reductions do not help in the fight. I would say that that clearly contradicts the argument in place by the minister when he was participating in this particular debate. Anyway, the Victorian police told us that children as young as 14 are selling heroin at $7 a taste on Little Bourke Street in Melbourne and they can do virtually little or nothing about that. That in my view is a national tragedy. It is a crisis. It quite clearly requires an extraordinary effort. I can only call on the government to change its mind and do something about it once and for all. (Time expired)",165
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work,167
204,Mr FAHEY,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Extension of National Film and Sound Archive Headquarters Building, Acton, ACT. The government agreed in the 1997-98 budget to the construction of purpose-built accommodation for the archive at its Acton headquarters and refurbishment of the archive's existing headquarters building. The agreement was made to remedy the dangerously unsafe working conditions within the archive. The existing buildings at Acton are suitable for the public functions of the NFSA but are inadequate for its administrative and specialist technical facilities. Current use of the buildings does not satisfy occupational health and safety building standards and is at odds with the heritage aspects of the building and site. The new building is required to provide safe, secure and suitable facilities and accommodation for the NFSA, and the consequential refurbishment of the existing building is necessary for the same reasons, as well as to improve access to its collections. This proposal will include construction of a new twostorey building to house the NFSA's administrative and technical functions; refurbishment of the existing headquarters, including public galleries, to house the public functions of the NFSA; refurbishment of the existing residence building to house corporate affairs staff; demolition of the existing demountable buildings, metal clad storage structures and nitrate vaults; redevelopment of the character of the site and buildings within a landscape setting; and retention of the existing permanent car park with minor modifications. Additional onsite parking will be provided for approximately 25 cars and five tourist coaches. The out-tum cost of the proposal is estimated to be $14.85 million. The project will be funded through instalment purchase payments of approximately $2.3 million per annum for a period of up to 15 years. It is anticipated that construction will commence in November 1997 and be completed in mid to late 1999. The Public Works Committee in its report tabled on 21 October 1997 concluded that there is a need for the project. In response to the recommendations of the committee, the National Film and Sound Archive has provided the following comments: The National Film and Sound Archive will arrange for an efficiency audit of the engineering services, providing heating, ventilation and cooling, once the building has been in use for 12 months. The Archive will be happy to incorporate any identified changes which will make the building operate more efficientl y. The Archive will consult further with the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled to ensure that access to the southern main entry does not discriminate against the disabled. The Archive will continue to consult with the heritage authorities during further landscape design developments. I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",167
205,Mr FAHEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: New facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The coalition's 1996 election policy statement 'For art's sake-a fair go!' stated: It is a matter of national embarrassment that Australia remains the only nation which does not have a fully fledged national museum. These works will address that matter. The National Museum of Australia was established with bipartisan political support by the National Museum of Australia Act 1980 to research Australian history, establish a gallery of Aboriginal Australia, develop a national collection of historical material and create exhibitions and public programs which explore our heritage and history. Without a building the museum has been constrained in its operations as a national institution and as a showcase for the nation's cultural heritage. The museum will break new ground among the nation's museums and educational institutions by combining the best contemporary exhibition techniques with new media technologies. A digital theatre is planned as the centrepiece of the museum, featuring the Asia-Pacific's largest high definition video screen. Incorporated within the facility will be a sophisticated media and communications centre so that the museum can become a communications hub, exchanging media programming and data with schools, museums and other institutions around the continent and the world. The museum will total a net area of 16,160 square metres, including allowances for orientation space, commercial and public use areas, public programs, outdoor programs, administration and research facilities and an· educational centre. The Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies was founded in 1964. It is the largest research centre of its kind for information about the cultures and lifestyles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The institute's leased premises are makeshift and inadequate. It has an urgent need for environmentally controlled storage for the preservation of its collections of of the photographs, audiovisual material, books, journals and manuscripts. The institute will total a net area of 4,305 square metres including allowances for orientation space, the institute's library and digital production team, the Aboriginal studies press, research facilities and executive, finance and corporate services. Co-location of the museum and the institute has always been intended and will benefit both organisations through· shared access to collections and research data. Many visitors will visit both. The 1997-98 budget confirmed the government's commitment to the project by allocating $7 million in 1997-98 for design development and approvals for future funding to be provided through the newly established Federation Fund. The indicative cost of the capital works is $l33 million. The ACT government has also committed $3 million for infrastructure and is proposing to establish the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre on the site. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in April 1998 and the facilities are scheduled to open on 1 January 2001 as the Commonwealth's flagship for the centenary of Federation celebrations. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF NA CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",168
206,Mr RUDDOCK,PROVISIONS RELATING TO,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the government can effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who have a criminal background or have criminal associations. In considering this bill, we must remember that the vast majority of non-citizens who come to Australia are in fact law-abiding people. In a world of rapidly increasing people movements, our immigration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of all genuine visitors, students, business people and permanent residents. However, a small proportion of non-citizens seeking to enter Australia do have substantial criminal backgrounds or criminal associations. Others commit crimes while they are in Australia. Steps to improve my department's ability to detect visa applicants with substantial criminal backgrounds or associations are being taken including consultation with law enforcement bodies overseas. For these steps to be effective, however, they must be complemented by legislative provisions to ensure that noncitizens with a criminal background or criminal associations can be refused a visa. The provisions must also enable the government to remove those non-citizens who are detained following convictions for crimes committed in Australia. Experience over recent years has shown that the existing legislative provisions are inadequate for this task. This is despite the fact that they were amended as recently as 1992 with the express purpose of improving the government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders with a substantial criminal background. In broad terms, the bill seeks to enhance the government's ability to deal with non-citizens who are not of good character in three ways: Firstly, decision making in routine cases will be improved by: - requiring applicants to show that they are of good character; - deeming that certain levels of criminal sentences will lead to an automatic finding that the non-citizen concerned is not of good character; and - allowing the minister to give binding directions to decision makers. Secondly, in exceptional or emergency circumstances, the minister, acting personally, will be given powers to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and the removal of non-citizens. Thirdly, information provided by Australian and international law enforcement agencies will be afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can be confident about passing information to immigration decision makers. I will now describe the major provisions of the bill in more detail. The character test The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test. Under this test, the onus will be on visa applicants and visa holders to satisfy decision makers that they can pass the test. This will redress a significant deficiency in the legislation arising from the changes made in 1992. Since that time, decision makers have been required to establish that a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa applicant or cancel a visa. This has meant that, whenever there has been doubt about the criminal background or criminal associations of a non-citizen, the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. I understand that this was not the intention of the 1992 amendments. This bill then takes us back to the situation that existed before 1992 by placing the onus of proof on the visa applicant to demonstrate that he or she is of good character. This means that where there are real doubts about the criminal background or criminal associations of a visa applicant or visa holder, the objective of protecting the Australian community will take precedence in immigration decision making. Deeming provisions This bill also seeks to establish clear benchpreventing marks for criminal behaviour that would automatically lead to a non-citizen failing the character test. Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test. This will truncate the character assessment process and cover most non-citizens of character concern who come to notice. This will provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test. Binding directions on exercise of the discretion Once it is established that a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test, decision makers will have to decide whether to refuse the application or to cancel the visa. Exercise of this discretion will need to take into account a wide range of factors including: the non-citizen's links to Australia, the nature of crimes committed and any international law obligations. This bill will enable me to give precise written directions on what weight is to be given to each of these factors. These directions must be binding on all decision makers, including merits review tribunals, to ensure a consistency of approach. The written directions will be tabled in parliament. Protection of criminal intelligence Criminal intelligence and related information is critical to assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders. At present, it is difficult for my department to use such information in making character decisions because its disclosure might be threatened. Australian and international law enforcement agencies are reluctant to provide sensitive information unless they are sure that both the information and its sources can be protected. Greater protection for such material would complement broader national and international strategies to counter transnational crime and the activities of those associated with it. This bill increases the level of protection for such information. I cannot overstate the importance of this protection to the job of the entry of foreign criminals to Australia. This was highlighted in my recent discussions with officials of international law enforcement agencies. Merits review The opportunity to appeal character decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be retained. However, there is critical need to reform these arrangements in two main respects: firstly, in terms of speeding up merits review processes; and, secondly, in terms of ensuring that merits review decisions reflect community standards and expectations. Merits review streamlining and time limits Where a non-citizen who is already in Australia is refused a further visa or has their visa cancelled on character grounds, it is essential that merits review cannot be used to prolong stay in Australia at taxpayers' expense. The average time currently taken for such cases at merits review is around 250 days from initial notification to a final decision. Many cases take even longer. During this time, the non-citizens involved, many of whom have committed serious crimes, either will be in detention at great cost to the taxpayer or will be at liberty in the community. Quite frankly, this must stop. This bill introduces more streamlined procedures for dealing with such cases. It also introduces strict time limits for the conduct of merits review cases involving character where the non-citizen is in Australia. Minister's power to intervene or set aside Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions Over the past 12 months, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, has made a number of character decisions that are clearly at odds with community standards and expectations. The AAT has found a number of noncitizens who have been convicted of very serious crimes to be of good character, and has ruled that they should be granted a visa. This has alarmed the community and I might say the community, when they are aware of these decisions, hold the government and not the AAT responsible. I do not know think can go on either. It is essential that the minister, acting personally, have the power to intervene or set aside such decisions in the national interest. The minister should, however, continue to be required to table the making of any such decisions in the parliament. Emergency cases From time to time, there will be emergency cases involving non-citizens who may be a significant threat to the community. These people may be threatening violence or some other act of destruction or have a prior history of serious crime. In these emergency circumstances, the minister, again acting personally, should have the power to act without notice and have them taken into detention. These people should have a subsequent opportunity to make representations to the minister to have the decision revoked. However, if they cannot satisfy the minister that they pass the character test, they should be removed immediately. Parliament should be notified of the making of such decisions but the decisions should not be subject to merits review because of their national significance. Conclusion This bilI sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community. The Australian community expects that non-citizens coming to Australia should be of good character. To discharge this expectation, the government must have the ability to act quickly and decisively, wherever necessary, to remove non-citizens who are not of good character. This bill meets our election commitment to the Australian people to strengthen the character provisions of the Migration Act. I commend the bill to the House and I table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Bill returned from Main Committee without having been fully considered; certified copy of bilI presented. Ordered that the bill be taken into consideration forthwith. Unresolved questionThat the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Martin Ferguson's amendment) stand part of the question.",169
207,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"-':in reply-In closing, I would like to take the opportunity of dealing with some matters that were raised in the Main Committee in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997. First, may I thank the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the opposition shadow minister; the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) from this side of the House; and the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) for their contributions. This is a serious matter. It is one which I hope the opposition shadow minister will carefully listen to what I have to say and that he and his coIIeagues may reconsider their position on this issue. Mr Latham interjecting",171
208,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,Is that a sexist comment addressed to me? Mr Latham interjecting,171
209,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"Yes, but I understand the offence that was taken was the suggestion that it might be sexist in some way. The word is not. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to a question of relevance. I thought we were dealing with migration, not a question of sexist remarks or who dresses in drag.",171
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member for Batman, and I would also encourage his colleague sitting on his left to refrain from interjecting.",171
211,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank the honourable member for Batman for his helpful point of order. I will take the opportunity of dealing with a number of matters that the honourable member for Batman raised. The member for Batman referred to an article in the Weekend Australian dealing with criminal elements entering Australia. I have carefully read the article that I believe he was referring to, which said: Police have been warned of a flood of illegal Asian immigrants entering Australia through corrupt consulate officials, sham English-language courses and organised crime syndicates. What I find interesting is the linkage that he made in view of those observations with migration agents. There is nothing I can see in the article that makes any reference to linking migration agents with the entry of criminals into Australia. Obviously, if the member has any information of that sort, he should provide it to us so that it can be investigated. I regard the allegations that the honourable member made very seriously because I do place a great deal of emphasis on character issues. In this matter of the importance of character issues, I would judge very much the opposition by the response that they will make in several weeks to the bill that I have just introduced into the House today. The further comment that was made, and I think it was picked up by other members who spoke, was the reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report entitled Protecting the vulnerable? I was a party to that committee report, and I know what happened in relation to the deliberations on it. I know that the report was not one that had been responded to by the former government-notwithstanding that it was a committee report that they had had in their hands for some 12 months before the last election. I think that says something of the former government's aspirations to dealing with a number of the matters that the committee raised, which I haveMr Martin Ferguson-We thought we were going to be re-elected.",171
212,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"You did not expect to be re-elected? Mr Martin Ferguson-I said, 'We thought we were going to be re-elected.'",172
213,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,You did not expect you were going to be re-elected.,172
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,Order! The minister will ignore the chatter across the table.,172
215,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"Let me just say that the existing scheme has had mixed results. That was the judgment of the committee. If you read page 61 of the report, you will find this quote: To date, the Migration Agents Registration Scheme has achieved mixed results. Critics of the Scheme suggested that it has had little if any impact on the standard and conduct of persons providing immigration advice. They cited continuing problems with poor advice and unscrupulous practice as evidence of the Scheme's failure to make any discernible difference. The committee went on to say: Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that the achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered. Moving to a statutory self-regulation scheme does not go against the recommendations of that committee. While the committee considered that self-regulation was not viable at the time of the report, it did not rule out that it may be viable in the future. I think that is the important point to note: this scheme which we are implementing will ensure that a self-regulatory scheme will be viable. It will ensure, because it is statutory, that all migration agents, in order to be able to practise, will be members of the institute. The government's new scheme reflects also a number of other recommendations from the report. I make the point that everyone who is to give immigration advice, other than those who have had the same form of statutory exemption in the past, has to be registered. There will be a code of conduct regulating agents behaviour. There will be additional measures to improve competency. I have to say that, in my judgment, peer pressure from the sorts of people who were sensible enough to belong to an institute which was concerned about standards is going to be far stronger in its coercion to improve standards than the regulatory scheme has proved to be. Mr Dargavel-It is a bit like the Law Society.",172
216,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"I suspect that one of the reasons that the legal profession have been concerned about these matters, and continue to be concerned about these matters, arises from an expectation that the standards may well be pressed very strongly by the institute. Certainly my dealings with the people who have been at a senior level of that organisation give me confidence in the belief that the system can work. There were allegations made by members who spoke about reduction in funding to advice bodies. The honourable member for Batman was at a public forum in Melbourne where I spoke, where this issue had been raised. He heard what I had to say then, and I will repeat it now. I said: The grant funding previously provided to community advice bodies under the former immigration advisory services scheme has been fully incorporatto ed into the new immigration advice and application assistance scheme. The two previous schemes have been merged into one, and the new scheme will provide the full range of services that ously provided. These services include: immigration advice and application assistance to asylum seekers and other disadvantaged people in the community; application assistance for asylum seekers tion; and training for voluntary sector migration agents. These services have been put out to tender throughout Australia and the overall level of funding has been increased by two per cent. My expectation is, and it is being realised, that we will get better value for money through the tender process. In that sense, there has been no overall reduction at all in the level of funding available for voluntary service delivery. I have made some further inquiries because it is important to be able to clarify for the House some of the changes that occurred as a result of the review that was undertaken. The planned allocation of resources between the states for immigration advice and assistance services has been altered. That reflects significantly increased numbers of residence applications in New South Wales. Between 43 and 45 per cent of all new arrivals have been going to New South Wales for a number of years now and service delivery has not reflected that circumstance. Mr Latham-Pollution; urban sprawl.",172
217,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"The member mentions those factors, but the point I am making is that I am trying to get a better dispersal of the outcome. In relation to the delivery of services, we had a situation in 1996-97 where 40 per cent of the funding went to Victoria and 30 per cent of the funding went to New South Wales. That reflected the historical distribution of applications and there has been some change, which has prompted some of the organisations that have seen that change to complain. The planned allocations for 199798 will see 26 per cent of the funding going to Victoria and 44 per cent of the funding going to New South Wales. I want to make some comments on the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. In relation to the charge that the bill will open the way for unscrupulous agents exploit the vulnerable, let me make the point that this bill retains all of the important consumer protection elements in the existing were previscheme. The new scheme improves the existing protection elements. Agents will be required to register and meet entry standards in order to practise. Agents will be subject to in detenan expanded code of conduct and will be subject to sanctions if they breach that code. Agents will have to meet new competency and professional development requirements in order to obtain further periods of registration. Previously re-registration was automatic and there was no testing of skills. That is a significant change and a beneficial change. Agents who fail to meet these requirements will be refused registration and will not be eligible for further registration for another 12 months. Any further move to self-regulation depends on a review of these arrangements that will be undertaken before March 2000. There have been some questions raised in the second paragraph of the opposition's second reading amendment in relation to voluntary agents not having to pay registration fees. Currently there are about 450 nonfee charging agents who work in the voluntary sector and do not pay a registration fee. They did not have to meet the same standards as fee charging agents. You cannot tolerate a two-tier system where the most vulnerable, about whom you were speaking, receive a lower standard of service. That was what was happening under the existing scheme. If you do not have to meet the same educational qualifications and prove themMr Martin Ferguson interjecting",173
218,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"You make that observation. All I am saying is that the standards under the legislation were not the same and were not required to be the same. That is the fact. You can make these allegations, but that was the legal regime that you had in place. All agents will be required to be registered and will be charged a fee. All agents will be required to meet the same knowledge test. The government is providing training to assist voluntary sector agents to meet the full knowledge test and registration through the immigration advice and assistance scheme. The only other point I would make is that there will still be a disparity in the fees. voluntary agents will pay a fee of $450 compared with full registration fees of around $1,000. Mr Martin Ferguson-Who authorised the negotiation of the fees?",174
219,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,I was involved in the settlement of those matters and they had to be dealt with by me. Mr Martin Ferguson-What are the fees?,174
220,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"I just told you what they will be. In relation to the claim in the third paragraph of the opposition's second reading amendment that consumer rights will be marginalised and there will be no overall monitoring authority, let me make the point that the overall monitoring authority is and remains under this legislation the government. The bill gives me as the minister the power to register and sanction migration agents. It allows me to appoint an agent to undertake that work, and I intend to appoint the Migration Institute of Australia as the migration agents registration authority. The appointment will be supported by a formal agreement between that organisation and me on how these powers are to be exercised. Its performance will be closely monitored. The appointment is able to be revoked by me if the powers are not being exercised in the interests of consumers. The act will continue to provide that decisions made about registration agents may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So the opposition needs to recognise that this is a statutory self-regulatory scheme; it does not deregulate the industry. The further point I would make relates to the opposition's claim about the reduction in time for lodging of objections to proposed registration. I could go on for some time, but let me say at the moment the notification about which there is a longer time is provided in the government Gazette. I do not know how many people actually read the government Gazette to look for notifications as to who is going to be a registered migration agent, but I suspect very few consumers ever read the government Gazette. The government intends that agents will have to publish their The intention in major daily newspapers to ensure the widest possible coverage. Mr Martin Ferguson-On the front page?",174
221,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"Come on, be sensible. Mr Martin Ferguson-Or buried in the· classifieds?",174
222,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"In major daily newspapers. This needs to be compared with the current situation where it is done in the government Gazette. In relation to seeking the continuation of existing arrangements in the opposition's second reading amendment, let me make it clear that, if this bill is opposed, it is not a question of going back to the existing scheme. Under the sunset clause, which you have included in the legislation and which we have extended to enable this bill to be introduced, and without this bill, there will be no registration scheme. The sunset clause will come into effect next March and we will have a totally unregulated industry. If you believe that there is a need for improvements, support the bill. The bill enables you to give effect to a much more substantial and effective scheme than was left in place by your government and it is one that will continue to exist. If there is no scheme, I can tell you who will be responsible and who will be seen to be responsible. It will be those who oppose the willingness to improve the system through a self-regulatory model. Let me deal with the schizophrenia of the Labor Party as a final matter. The Labor Party is schizophrenic on this issue. They are railing about the need to deal with 'shonks and crooks in the industry'-they were the words used in the committee stage. Yet when it comes to supporting sensible measures to enable us to take away some of the opportunities for people to exploit our law, they are quite prepared to oppose these measures in the parliament. It was only a week or so ago that we saw the Labor Party oppose the seeking of the opportunity to limit the situations in which non bona fide applicants are able to exploit judicial review. We have introduced legislation which contains a privative clause, which is very important in enabling us to deal with those matters. And when it is a question of dealing with shonks and crooks and denying them the opportunity of exploiting the system, the opposition is quite preparedMr Martin Ferguson-That is drawing a long bow.",174
223,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"It is not a long bow. It is direct and it applies directly to the very people you are saying are exploiting the vulnerable. We want to take away that opportunity. If you want to give evidence of your bona fides in these matters, support that legislation. Earlier today, as I said, I introduced further Sinclair, I. MCC. legislation to strengthen the character provisions. I am going to arrange a briefing for the honourable member because I want him to be aware of the nature of these provisions and how they are intended to operate. How you respond to that legislation will be a further test of your bona fides in these matters. Here is an opportunity for you to reconsider your position, to withdraw your amendment and to support sensible legislation which improves registration of migration agents and effectively ensures the protection of some of those whom you have identified, and I acknowledge, can be very vulnerable.

228,Mr MELHAM,NOES,"With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was a stranger in the House, and my point of order was that Senator Boswell was at the back of the chamber wandering around in the Speaker's gallery in the comer. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is reserved for visiting dignitaries. not know whether Senator Boswell fits into that category. Was permission given for him to occupy the Speaker's gallery in the comer? It is a very dangerous precedent for senators to be wandering around here.

I can recall, during the tenure of Mr Speaker's predecessor, that the subject of seats being placed on the floor of this chamber to accommodate senators in particular was raised. I can recall I do that the Speaker's predecessor at the time refused that request on the basis that disorderly conduct had occurred by senators carrying on from the public galleries in this place', and it was therefore considered to be inappropriate. Given the fact that Senator Boswell has been in here this afternoon, I also ask, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether Mr Speaker might contact senators and other people who are going to be offered the opportunity to sit on the floor of this House so that they can be given appropriate counselling and instruction as to how they are to conduct themselves.",176
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Cunningham, and I suggest that the appropriate thing-assuming my understanding is correct-is that senators should enter through the west door, go directly to those seats and, if they wish to leave, they should go directly to and leave by the west door.

245,Mr MILES,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (5.40 p.m.)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. I am asking the House to agree to the Native shares. Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 as amended by the Senate due to the pressing need to have the amendments contained in the bill passed in the legislation. The bill as amended includes a provision altering the qualifications for the appointment of the registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal. The amendments remove the requirement that the registrar be admitted to legal practice for five years and replace it with a requirement that a person may not be appointed as registrar unless the person is legally qualified and has had substantial experience in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies or the law or administration or any other class of activity considered relevant to the duties of the registrar. As the registrar will no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted, it is appropriate that the qualifications for appointment be changed. The proposed amendment will ensure that a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates may be considered for the position of registrar of the tribunal. The registrar has agreed to stay on until the end of the year to allow a suitable replacement to be appointed. Therefore, as it is imperative that the bill is passed to allow a replacement appointment to be made before the end of the year, the government is accepting the bill as amended. The Slenate did not. - gre- to a pro-osed amendment to the qualifIcatIOns of presIdential members. Currently, a presidential member has to be a Federal Court judge or a former judge of the High Court, Federal Court or state or territory Supreme Court in order to be eligible for selection. This not only severely restricts the pool from which suitable candidates can be drawn, it also means that otherwise highly qualified people, especially those experienced in the rapidly developing area of native title law, are excluded from consideration. The proposed amendment sought to include a further class of persons who could be appointed as a presidential member, that is, a person who has been admitted to legal practice for at least five years. The Senate did not agree to this amendment. The constitution requires that judicial functions involving the determination of people's legal rights are exercised by the courts and not tribunals or commissions. Restricting presidential appointments to the tribunal to Superior Court judges only means that judges are taken away from where they are most needed by the publicdetermining people's rights under law-and placed in a tribunal to undertake functions that differ from their judicial role. This amendment is essential to the changed role of the tribunal as a result of the Brandy decision. Accordingly, the government is committed to bringing back to parliament in the near future this necessary alteration to the selection requirement for the appointment of presidential members for the National Native Title Tribunal. I commend the amendment to the House. Ainendment agreed to. NA BILL (No.4) 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed from 29 October.

246,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (5.43 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I have some very brief comments about each of the amendments. Amendment 1: this minor amendment is consequential on earlier amendments mirde in the House and amends paragraph 159GZF(4)(b) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which defines the foreign debtor for the foreign investor. The earlier amendments improve the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules and ensure that foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees of Australian partnerships and trusts would be subject to the thin capitalisation gearing ratio. Amendments 2 to 14: the amendments will change the date of effect for all charitable trusts and certain other tax-exempt organisations to 1 July 1997. The original date of effect was generally 20 August 1996, as announced in both the 1996 and 1997 budgets and the exposure draft to the legislation. Since the bill was introduced into the parliament there have been representations pointing out that a number of charitable trusts have not taken into account the budget announcement and have continued .to make contributions offshore since 20 August 1996. If this date of effect stands they will permanently lose their tax-exempt status. These measures are, of course, aimed at tax avoidance and it would be unfortunate if any charitable trusts were to lose their tax exemption simply because they were not aware that they were prohibited from distributing funds directly offshore. In response to this concern, the government decided to amend the date of effect, even though it expects that $25 million in revenue will be forgone. I commend the amendments to the House.",180
247,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The opposition does not oppose these amendments. Indeed, they represent the product of our work in the Senate in drawing to the attention of the government the concerns of some charitable trusts, such as the Buckland Foundation, which was established income very many years ago and has been doing very good work in providing charitable work on behalf of former employees of Westpac. On that basis, we are pleased to see that the government has moved these amendments. They do not go as far as we would have liked, but it is our understanding from those who are affected by them that they can live with the amendments. On that basis, we are supporting them and we will be monitoring the situation in due course. Question resolved in the affirmative. DIVISIONS: INTERVENING DEBATE",180
248,Mr SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Last night a dispute arose in connection with divisions on the Native Title Amendment Bill and questions were put to me on the matter today. I have examined the Hansard record of proceedings and also the tape. The records show that after the House made its decision on an amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) the chair stated the question on an amendment moved earlier by the Attorney General (Mr Williams). The chair then called the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) to move two amendments by leave to the Attorney's amendment. When the honourable member for Dawson moved her amendment, she would have been entitled to speak for five minutes. In fact, she moved her amendments quickly and resumed her seat. A division was called and the chair ordered the bells to be rung for one minute. I can certainly understand the feelings of members who found themselves prevented from voting when the doors were locked after one minute. The procedures followed yesterday on the Native Title Bill were unusual. Amendments were moved and then postponed so that a general debate could take place. After the debate finished the divisions were to take place, and they did. This arrangement was made earlier in the day. It was necessary for the member for Dawson to formally move her final amendments in between divisions, which she did without debate. These were unusual circumstances, and I wish to record my full confidence in the work of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). Like other members of the Speaker's Panel he takes his duties in the chair most seriously. These can be onerous. With the Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker, I am grateful to all members of the panel. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) also referred to the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) having given instructions to the chair yesterday. I have viewed a tape of the division and saw no evidence of that. As far as I am concerned, the matter has now been concluded. MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT: NA",180
249,Mr SPEAKER,COMPUTER EQUIPMENT,"I was asked a question in the House today by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) concerning computing equipment available to members in Parliament House. In particular, the member asked whether members could have equipment to access CD-ROMs. For the information of members, I advise that each office has at least one personal computer with multimedia capability that will enable CD-ROMs to be run. Therefore, all members-and I learn something every day--can access CD-ROM at Parliament House. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Miles)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent a motion being moved forthwith to enable a 30-minute adjournment debate today. NA Motion (by Mr Miles) agreed to: That the adjournment debate today proceed for 30 minutes after the motion for the adjournment of the House is moved by a parliamentary secretary. Motion (by Mr Miles) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Coombs, Dr Herbert Cole 'Nugget': Death",181
250,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay tribute to a great Australian who passed away yesterday. Dr H.C. 'Nugget' Coombs has been described as a planner of dreams, an inexhaustible resource, a rebel, and the most influential public servant in Australian history. An adviser to seven prime ministers, Nugget Coombs earned the respect of men as divergent in their world views as Bob Menzies and Gough Whitlam. Nugget Coombs was a dedicated and passionate man who shared his wisdom without fear or favour. Nugget Coombs was an accomplished, hands-on economist who believed the economy should serve the people-and not the reverse. As shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs it is fitting that I say a few words about Nugget Coombs' contribution to the advancement of indigenous Australians. Nugget Coombs was appointed to chair the Council for Aboriginal Affairs in 1968. From that moment, his life and work became more and more involved in the struggle to help indigenous Australians take control of their lives and make their own way in the nation. So respected was he by indigenous Australians that he was the only whitefella invited to attend the crucial Eva Valley meeting in 1993, where an indigenous position on proposed native title legislation was hammered out. Nugget was a fearless advocate of what he called 'Aboriginal autonomy'. He argued strongly that indigenous people should be empowered to take control of their own lives on their own terms. He was convinced that native title rights are essential to achieving that goal. Nugget Coombs was a hard working man. Even in the last few years before he suffered a stroke three years ago, he was still working eight-, 10and 12-hour days-researching, writing and visiting remote Aboriginal communities, participating in the affairs of the Australian National University, or sharing his wisdom with the many politicians, businessmen, indigenous people and others who came to him for advice. He has published countless articles and essays on issues related to indigenous affairs and was recognised as one of the leading authorities in a wide range of subject areas. The books he published include: Other People's Money; The Fragile Pattern; Trial Balance-his autobiography; A Certain Heritage-of which he was co-author; and The Return of Scarcity; as well as a collection of his works published in 1994 entitled Aboriginal Autonomy. Nugget died on the same day the government's flawed native title legislation went through this House. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should read another of Nugget's works. It's calIed Kulinma: Listening to Aboriginal Australians. But I want to read from the preface to Aboriginal Autonomy. In 1994 Nugget wrote: Greed, contempt for future generations and willingness to exploit racial antagonism in order to change have become, with honourable but few exceptions, the mark of the policies of those who desire to control the world's resources. Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, said of Nugget Coombs: That old man must be respected. He is the white fellas most senior elder. I think the last word should go to Nugget himself. Asked by Michael Gordon of the Australian newspaper how he would like to be remembered, Nugget Coombs said simply, 'He was a good bloke.' In closing, I want to pay tribute to our most senior elder, Nugget Coombs: a good bloke whose contribution to Australian society cannot be overestimated; a public servant who did serve the public and the community in an exceptional manner. We salute you, Nugget. Houlson, Mr Brian: Death",181
251,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"May I also extend my condolences to the family of . Nugget Coombs. Tonight I was going to speak about two issues in this adjourn.ment debate, firstly, the JPET program WhICh I launched last Friday in my electorate of Makin and which is to be administered by the Salvation Army Ingle Farm Community Service and, secondly, a wonderful school community within my electorate of Makin. Mr Rod Tyney, the Principal of Para HiIIs Primary School, invited me to join the school to participate in their family fun day on Sunday, 26 October. The reason I wanted to speak on these events was to acknowledge the wonderful work accomplished by the volunteers in the various communities of my electorate of Makin. However, there is one particular special volunteer whom I would like to pay tribute to this evening. My special tribute is for Mr Brian Houlson, a member of the Newland Central Branch within the Makin Federal Electoral Committee. Brian Houlson passed away last night and it was late this morning that I received this very sad and tragic news. The news has been particularly devastating as Brian was still of a young age and a very active and enthusiastic supporter of all of our Liberal activities, resist within both the electorates of Newland and Makin. He was a devoted member along with his wife, Mrs Christine Houlson, and family members who survive him, especially supporting the member for Newland, the Hon. Dorothy Kotz, Minister for the Environment. My heart goes out to Christine Houlson. I am sure I speak for alI members of our FEC and Newland SEC when I say he was very much loved and respected by everyone. Brian's love of aeroplanes was well-known and he devoted many years of voluntary work to the Aviation Museum in Port Adelaide, South Australia, which I have visited at his invitation on many occasions. As all of us in this place know, without the support of our branch members and their families many of us would not be in this place. I wish to put on the record my appreciation of the dedication, hard work and support of the late Mr Brian Houlson, his wife Christine and their children during my campaign in 1995-96, culminating in the successful election of the new member for Makin. To the family, friends and supporters of Brian Houlson, I extend my sincere condolences on behalf of all members of the Makin FEC, including Newland, Florey, Wright and Playford. Debate interrupted. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Australian National Line",182
252,Mr REITH,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish to correct the record. Yesterday during question time. I referred to certain losses in ANL and There specified a figure. I am told that that figure was not right. I have the exact figure and details for those who wish to see them. wanted to clear up that issue for the record. NA Debate resumed. Coombs, Dr Herbert Cole 'Nugget':",183
253,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I stand here this evening to try to talk not about a great man. I say that because, truly, owners. words almost limit your ability to describe this man and his influence, his ideas radical conscience which has so formed this If nation postwar. Flip through the papers this exists morning and the superlatives fly. Newspaper op commentators, friends and colleagues have all struggled this morning to fully that Nugget Coombs has done for this nation. I do not think anyone of them has been able by themselves to completely tell everything about Nugget Coombs. Nugget passed away on a day when this chamber was in the middle of a heated debate about native title. Native title and the land rights struggle by indigenous Australians was one of the many issues that Nugget Coombs listens. was concerned and passionate about. Native title and the land rights struggle was one of the many issues issue that Nugget Coombs played a central role in. He played a central role in improving the conditions of Aborigines and in so doing once more strengthening the fabric of Australian society and its fair go ethos. Right into old age Nugget Coombs was campaigning for the rights of indigenous people. I tell you what, he gave curry to our side of politics if he thought we deserved it on this issue. He wrote to former Prime Minister Keating in 1993 when he thought we were going wrong on our Mabo legislation and when he thought we needed stiffening up. I think, though, that he would approve of our stance on the current native title legislation, which is now the centre of debate in the House and the Senate. In the letter to Paul Keating back in 1993 he and his co-writers wrote: is no valid reason why native title cannot coexist with pastoral leases in most cases. I Dr Coombs letter, which was also signed by . Professor David Lea and Mr Greg Crouch, warned the government of the day of the international shame Australia would suffer if it squibbed the issue of native title. In the letter to the then Prime Minister dated 10 September 1993, he warned that any uncerDeath tainty being created: has largely been because many companies are prepared to take the time and effort to negotiate appropriate agreements with Aboriginal land and his The letter went on to say: there is uncertainty as to whether native title in relation to a particular piece of land, there is no reason why the company proposing to develthat land, or exploit the resources of the land, could not negotiate with those claiming to have encapsulate all native title. great In 1993 Dr Coombs was providing sage advice and acting as a conscience to the Labor government. Labor listened to this famous public servant, who had provided good advice to both sides of the political fence in some 50 years of public activity. Today this advice could be just as aptly given to the current Prime Minister, and I hope he Prime Minister Howard correctly praised Dr Coombs earlier today. Maybe as a sign of respect, and a symbol of Dr Coombs' greatness, Mr Howard would listen just once more to this great civil servant. Maybe as a sign of gratitude to Dr Coombs in his life's work, Mr Howard will listen to those people whom Nugget Coombs spent a great deal of his time fighting for-indigenous Australia. In conclusion, for the children of the Depression the influence of Nugget Coombs on Australian policy was exceptionally important. He had responsibility with one Ben Chifley for the postwar reconstruction of Australia. Many children of the Depression went to war without opportunity in life. It was the work of Nugget Coombs with Ben Chifley that gave those young men and women an opportunity in life. The postwar reconstruction program gave those young men and women the opportunity to undertake some training, to develop a real career prospect in life, and to purchase, through the housing schemes that were available to servicemen, a home and create opportunities for their children. I am pleased to that my father, who left school at the age of 13, a child of the Depression, was one who clearly benefited, and so did his five children, from the opportunities that Ben Chifley and one Nugget Coombs created for this nation. I give credit to Nugget Coombs not only from the Australian Labor Party this evening but also from the Ferguson family. I would not be here this evening if it were not for Ben Chifley and Nugget Coombs. Natural Heritage Trust Funding",183
254,Mr BROUGH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to talk about a group of people in my electorate who are very much looking forward to the announcement of Natural Heritage Trust funding because, in my electorate and so many others around Australia, there are numerous activities which need to be undertaken to secure the environment. Everybody knows the importance of areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu National Park. Local creeks, waterways and rivers do not get international headlines, but they are equally important. In the first instance I would like to make a few comments about a particular waterway called Lagoon Creek. There is a very dedicated group of people who call themselves the Friends of Lagoon Creek. Lagoon Creek is a particularly pretty waterway which runs through Caboolture in the middle of my electorate. At one stage it was the entire water source for the town. It was also the place of entertainment. Today, it is chock-a-block full of algae weeds from run-off from farms, industry and the burgeoning spread of housing. It also has the pitiful sight of rusted car bodies, household rubbish and, of course, the trolley from the local supermarket which tends to find its way down there all too often. This group of people are trying to recover this land and achieve its restitution so that it can be here for generations to come. They, along with members of the Pumicestone water and ecosystem monitoring system and the Pumices tone Regional Catchment Coordination Association are working towards ensuring that the wonderful catchment area of the Pumices tone Passage, taking in Bribie Island, say all the way from Caloundra through Caboolture to Deception Bay-one of the most pristine area of Australia-is not only maintained in its current condition but also improved and returned to the standard that it was many years ago. It is not only the human habitation of that area but also the marine habitation, the wildlife and the bird life which have deteriorated as a result of the pollution in this area. It still looks fabulous to the eye, but the reality is that it is degenerating. This is the unfortunate spin-off from growth in the area, and there has been a deterioration in the water quality and the condition of the local waterways for some time. Recognising the need to preserve our local waterways, the Pumicestone Regional Catchment Association and the MaroochylMooloolah Catchment Care Association have applied for over $200,000 in Natural Heritage Trust funding for two projects, which will include a major data collecting study for the implementation of a regional catchment strategy. It is important that we as a community have a heightened awareness of our natural environment and preserve it for future generations, and these people are doing just that throughout the electorate of Longman. . Whilst I believe the recent development in the local area has been welcomed, I call on the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) to fund these studies so that we can stop the rate of deterioration of our local waterways. They am every bit as important to these local residents as the major environmental issues of the day right throughout the nation. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of all those people associated with both groups and recognise the role Caboolture councillor Chris Minetti has played in preparing the funding application. I donated a Waterwise kit last week to schools participating in an understanding of our catchment area so that the young people coming through, who will be responsible in generations to come for development, will be aware of the importance of waterways, no matter how small they may be. I was pleased that my wife, representing me last week, was able to make a presentation of a water kit to the Bribie Island State Primary School for their efforts and so that they can test the quality of water in our region. It is very important that we do this, that we have an awareness from the youth right through. This is a community activity which must be supported. This is a community activity which will improve the quality of life for all of those who live in the Longman electorate, whether they live in Deception Bay, Bribie Island, Ningi, Beachmere or in the more rural areas such as Caboolture and Woodford. These people deserve a good quality of life. It is important that the Natural Heritage Trust, which this government has had the foresight to put together with the sale of one-third of Telstra, be used not only for major projects but also for these important minor projects as well. I am sure this government will recognise the work of these people in their community to improve the lifestyle and the environment and, in doing so, will ensure that the Natural Heritage Trust leaves a lasting legacy not only for this generation but also for many generations of Australians to come. Member for Paterson",184
255,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"In recent weeks the House and the Newcastle media have seen the increasingly embarrassing and fatuous performance by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) which reached a crescendo both this week and last evening with the fiasco over chicken meat. One of the things that has been put about, and I think it must be laid to rest very promptly, is this suggestion that, in the time he has been a parliamentarian, he has made wonderful achievements for the area and that s.omehow this government is supportive of Newcastle and the Hunter. In putting that forward, he has been questioning and quite deceitfully projecting the performance of the previous Labor government. I want to mention a few things that were achieved in Newcastle and the Hunter under the previous federal Labor government. I might start with. the steel plan in the 1980s which contributed the equivalent of $60 million from the Commonwealth into that region's economy at its discretion. It was not chosen by Canberra, it was not chosen by the parliamentary secretary; it was chosen by local people. The member for Paterson might consider when he next goes game fishing, as apparently he does, that the wharf at Nelson Bay, in an area that was held by the National Party, was built and funded totally by the federal Labor government. Our concern was to try to generate employment in that region. That $4 million in 1985 dollars on that one project is probably three or four times as much as the total government spending in his term. But to go further, what about the 1,200 jobs that were generated, 800 in the Taxation Office alone? We have seen 400 of those go in the last year and a half; 400 jobs on the Commonwealth Public Service payroll have been ripped out of our region. Work out the cost of that per year to the local economy and it is quite substantial. If you also look at the downstream spending, you will see that the impact of those jobs alone runs into many tens of millions of dollars, which in tum has cost us more jobs. I will give a few other examples. The railway station at Newcastle University was fully funded by the Commonwealth Labor government. The ferries on Newcastle harbour were funded by the federal Labor government. The $70 million for the building better cities program was provided by the federal Labor government. The $1 billion minehunter project, which the current government seems to be trying to claim as its project, was established and put there by the federal Labor government. The British Aerospace project for the Hawk lead-in fighter aircraft was put in place well before this government came into office, and the downstream industries that are being built from that, as was the handover of the Williamtown airport together with $2% million in cash for the local councils to actually upgrade it. They are just a few examples. You can add anything you like: the Centre for Industrial Control Science, the Industry Development Centre, the Cooperative Coal Research Centre and the first ever special program for indigenous medical students. The first ever indigenous doctors to graduate in an Australian university were as a result of a special program funded by the Newcastle University. Perhaps you can top it off by looking at the Newcastle foreshores, one of the very few national bicentennial projects outside a capital city. That is just a very small sample of the range and depth of our commitment. If the member for Paterson wants to start matching this, he has a long way to go. He has been here a year and a half already, and I reckon he is probably at one or two per cent of what we did in the 13 years we were there. Mr Latham-That's generous.",185
256,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"And I am being very generous, as the member for Werriwa points out. He had the opportunity to help match that in recent months with the report on the iron and steel industry. I have written to the minister asking him to table that report so that we can debate it. I should point out that the member for Paterson did not attend the last four meetings, so he was not part of the report finalisation. He just dumped off on it, as he has with so many other things. These issues are deep and important. They are not fatuous. They should not be trivialised. The region we represent has depth and it has a future, but it does not have much of a future when people like the member for Paterson trivialise all that happens. (Time expired) Rotary International",186
257,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (6.12 p.m.)When the current WorId President. of Rotary International, Glen Kinross-incidentally only the fourth Australian to hold that lofty titletook as the theme for his year in office 'Show Rotary cares', a number of clubs took up that challenge across Australia. He was in Parliament House only a week ago talking about polio and his ambitions for that as well. Tonight I wanted to talk about this challenge taken up by the Rotary clubs. Not least amongst those who took up the challenge was the Rotary Club of Canberra City, which devised a genuine but practical program of caring for young unemployed people called 'young Australians want to work'-the name says it all. The name is simple enough but it graphically describes the deeply held yearning of the vast majority of young unemployed people who, given a chance, would like to work. Under the direction of the Past District Governor of Canberra City Rotary Club, Len Goodman, a carefully crafted but highly professional program was devised. It was launched by Dr David Kemp, the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, as recently as 3 September this year. The program was packaged in kit form and sent to 1,200 Rotary clubs around Australia. The kit consisted of a 14-minute video produced by the ABC; guidelines for employment focused public meetings; press releases and posters; a floppy disk with a formatted running sheet, agenda, evaluation form and certificate of participation; and, as weII as that, information on CES and DEETY A. In other words, instead of Rotary's normal fundraising activities, the club went to the heart of the matter, marshaIIing the various players, devising an effective operational program adaptable to most circumstances but, most importantly, creating the one-on-one contact between young people and potential employers. In my electorate of Hinkler, the Rotary Club of Gladstone Midday took up the challenge with considerable zeal. Its president, Graham Wilson, and the project coordinator, Gary Frost, marshalled the considerable skills of Gladstone's other Rotary clubs and the services of the Gladstone CES office under its acting manager, Lauren Thomason. The Gladstone CES was totally cooperative and its employer servicing unit, including Mary Mitchell and Leonie Hills, added their skills to the project. The Gladstone media created a community awareness of the program. General manager of the Gladstone Observer, Ned Makim, and its editor, Anne Roebuck, threw their weight behind the scheme. Sue Johnson of radio 4CC, herself a Rotarian, devised a special marketing program. It was my privilege to launch this program on the local scene at a function held at the Gladstone Yacht Club on 18 September. At that function we played the tape, reviewed material, heard what Rotaract's Anthea Jensen felt about what the program could do for youth, heard the value of employing young people from Ron Hawkins of MCDonald's and heard from the Queensland Chamber of Commerce on how young people can fill staff positions when shortages occur. That night the first trainee, Colin Cronin, signed up, and his papers were ratified that evening. In the six short weeks since then, 63 young people have found employment in that program. There were 17 full-time positions, 22 part-time positions, three apprenticeships and 21 traineeships-63 jobs in six weeks is a truly remarkable result. It just shows in this matter of employment how-with inflation down, with interest rates down and with the economy ready to take off again-the communities themselves, through the service organisations working together with their media and their CES office, can start a cycle of confidence and create a new opportunity for young people. Question resolved in the affirmative.

In my experience, I have understand that appeals to the Federal Court can was made and cannot overturn a decision made in Australia have a widespread problem with profit and non-profit, have been shown to provide Because of that, I am particularly concerned about the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), sort of recipe for disaster, as being some sort He may not be aware of it, coming from an of us who do have a professional background, common amongst accountants, lawyers, even with in those professions unless you go through the we have the Australian Psychological Society that we are ethical in what we do and we achieve profession. It is nothing new. It is not a recipe well know, migration agents often have another of lawyers, of course, they will not only be part but also for their own profession at the bar that a lot of them are crooks and rorters.

Sure, I agree, as the member there are a few bad apples that spoil it for tackle those individuals, and I know that selfNA 10396 MAIN COMMITTEE regulation will do that.

I believe that Bill (No.8). There are other mechanisms available, those concerns; but trying to bring it into this of issues is expecting far too Australia continues to be seen as a land abroad. Given this reputation, no wonder migration operating in this industry should be supported what has apparently been an underserviced hard to build a good working relationship with assistance to these people. Groups such as Cambodian Community Welfare Association, other migrant resource groups provide valuable and their families on a not for profit basis. For the member for Batman to suggest, as agents should not be paying a registration fee, is all about. The registration fee itself becomes to make sure that their standards of operation, of the migration agents registration scheme. Without place.

270,Mr DARGAVEL,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE," Mr member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) talked about the coalition being committed to cutting red businesses of migration agents. The proposition in this industry in particular will be more disastrous performance of this industry before under regulation. An example in comparison is the self-regulation this particular area versus that of migration been almost 1,000 complaints from individuals legislation. Out of those complaints, quite or unregistered agents, cautions, suspensions legislation. Those successful prosecutions number of complaints-as compared with the legislation. Compare that situation with the self-regulatory is a nice comparison. The total number of South Wales, arising from over 1,700 complaints this legislation, was just one. This is self-regulation the Migration Institute, which only covers some describe that as a closed shop. But you could shop. It commands a great deal of respect self-regulation in this industry resulted in effective self-regulation has been in this statutory regulations, and it is Prior to the introduction of the registration provision of immigration advice was always to this time, there was no regulation of the industry provisions in the Migration Act, which focused This was not a happy situation for any of the bad name by the unscrupulous and ignorant operators. We can look at some of examples of things legislation in 1992. Some of those were Centre in their report Free and independent collected between July 1990 and November 1992. The examples include: an agent who disappeared lodge an application which could not succeed; MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 to upgrade their skills and ensure that the to be of the best possible quality. review the regulation of a relatively new and for industries to move towards self-regulation in such an industry improve their ability to continue to monitor developments in their my constituents that this government is continuing and I commend the bill to the House. Deputy Speaker, the previous speaker, the self-regulation not being new or novel, and about tape for small business-in this case, the small turns upon an assumption that self-regulation effective than regulation, notwithstanding the it was regulated. That performance has improved by the New South Wales Law Society in agents as covered by the legislation. There have and agents during the term of the current a number of convictions of unregistered practices and cancellations were effected under the brought about a reduction in real terms of the difficulties that we confronted before the practices of the Law Society, which I suppose lawyers suspended by the Law Society of New over the entire period of the operation of in what is essentially a closed shop-not 10 per cent of the industry; you could hardly certainly describe the Law Society as a closed and has many members.

When the couple lodged the application several weeks after bound to fail and would have to apply from The situation before the government instituted there is a great deal of room for improvement, it is my belief that by removing the regulation number of complaints we are going The basic aim of this legislation has been Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) as an interim for two years in preparation for moves towards the government seeking, by incremental established over the last five years, a system immigration advice can have confidence in However, in the process the government will protections. The move towards self-regulation was initiated registration scheme which was commissioned on the impact of the scheme on consumer protection business. The review found that the existing had not adversely affected competition in the recognition that the competency standards We do not oppose improving the competency by taking away all the controls and giving them be able to engineer an increase in the competency protection for consumers, and neither will is mired by those unscrupulous agents. Raising the competency standards across aspire to. Essentially, there should be no difference by any of the three occupational groups in continuing professional development and education, under the regulations from March 10399 even though the advice he received was wrong; an entry permit which could never be granted and client complained the adviser threatened to report is a situation where the clients are utterly a couple $4,000 to prepare an application $1,200 to a person from Russia for assistance visa extension which was less than one page long; was on the priority occupations list when it positive view of his chances of immigrating to with an employer nomination scheme application of the prescribed non-citizen ban. a solicitor who had been struck off, who gave a marriage application on the basis of her eventually paid $2,500 to the agent he then the woman became illegal.

We have steps, to weaken the system which has been which tries to ensure that consumers of the accuracy and timeliness of that advice. lose control over the administration of those by the review of the migration agents by the government in 1996.

Therefore, the move to require which the minister advises will be required 1999, is also a positive move. NA 10400 However, it is unclear how competency standards moves towards self-regulation per se. In fact, agents in this context distracts attention from people receive on migration matters. These other issues include the clarification understand, which is a subject that I raised continuation of moves by the previous government that may occur in migration law each year, resource the department so that departmental information to provide high quality advice the need to have immigration advisers at In the second reading speech on this bill, self-regulation would not be achievable or desirable pointed out was that the consumer group which exploitation by service providers. This is barriers, lack of information about the Australian that they are unlikely to provide repeat business application being successful. That last point is critical because what not have here is a system where an Australian providers, as they might in the legal profession a consumer in the selection of competent hope of being a repeat consumer, the reputation as it might be in other industries. Another reason raised by the minister goes advice industry itself. The minister described raises the question of what it is that will make from coalition members and, particularly, the has suddenly become mature or what it is about maturity in this industry. The three main occupational groups in the of the industry and voluntary sector agents. cooperation between these three groups and the the Migration Institute of Australia. Indeed, migration agents. It makes a farce of the concept to self-regulate is so unrepresentative. As I said, it is not like the Law Society one suspension. They are a closed shop. The coalition to a mob that only has 10 per cent membership provides no positive reason for travelling down concerns he raised in his speech regarding the regulation, and the composition of the industry, nor have we been provided with any propositions Migrants to Australia will always be more language barriers, unless we move to a discriminatory MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 will be improved by the introduction of I believe the focus on self-regulation of migration the other issues which could improve the advice of legislation to make it easier for clients to in my previous speech on this ""legislation, the to reduce the number of legislative changes to make it more stable, and, finally, adequately officers have the capacity both in time and to a greater number of clients, thereby reducing all. But that is another debate entirely. the minister pointed out other reasons why full in the migration industry. The first reason uses migration agents is quite vulnerable to due to a number of factors including language legal and immigration systems, and the fact to the advice provider in the event of their we do not have here is a free market. What we do citizen can just wander between service where the reputations of those providers guides advice. Because the consumer does not have any of the agent is not necessarily as significant to the composition and operation of the migration the industry as 'not yet mature.' That assessment this industry mature. Nothing has been provided minister as to what it is about this industry that this legislation that will create a sense of industry are lawyers, agents in the private sector According to the minister, there is only limited proposed migration agents regulation authority, the institute covers only 10 per cent of registered of self-regulation when the proposed body of New South Wales, where they managed to effect is proposing to hand over self-regulation of the industry. In fact, the minister's speech the path of self-regulation at all. The primary barriers of the client group to introducing selfare unlikely to change in the next two years, as to why they would change. likely than Australian-born people to experience migration program, which we must NA Thursday, 30 October 1997 avoid.

I were in his position. But this legislation be more litigation as a result of this legislation unscrupulous operators as we otherwise would. Finally, given that the review of the scheme a party to the competition principles agreement, attempting to be reducing the involvement immigration advice. Neither is it likely he will overall. If these three groups are to be retained within cent of the industry in the form of the Migration regulation will promote competition between complaints against lawyers were able to be disciplinary action. How effective has that been effective at all. Another concern is that the move to self-regulation providers-which we as parliamentarians deal their shonky advice-that the government is less and misconduct in the immigration program. In the Department of Immigration and Multicultural department showed a reduction in refusals reduction in the number of complaints as a attributed the increased successful applications . . . an increased awareness of the standards required applicants, and a substantial reduction in the number practice in the industry prior to the introduction That is, the regulations brought about a reduction claims that had been made where perhaps they problems in this industry and the legislation reason advanced by coalition members as to stimulated an improvement in this industry.

I think going to be very much harder, and Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Risk (Question No. 1737) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 1376 (Hansard 13 May 1997, page 3411), is he arranging for a risk analysis to be undertaken in the Government's consideration of Airservices Australia's report on the long term operating plan for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and associated airspace. (2) If so, (a) who is undertaking the analysis and (b) will he refer to that person or organisation the concerns voiced by air traffic controllers and pilots regarding the current method of operation of the airport. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's. question is as follows: (1) Yes. I am advised by Airservices Australia that it is preparing a comprehensive Safety Case in accordance with my direction on the implementation of the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) Airservices Australia has engaged Praxis Critical Systems Limited to carry out an independent review of safety issues. The consultant will be free to meet with Air Traffic Controllers and industry users during the audit process. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2091) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Will additional homes be insulated against aircraft noise in the electoral division of Barton following his adoption of the long term operating plan for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if so, what homes. (2) What criteria have been used by the Government to assess homes to be eligible for insulation. (3) Do' the criteria involve Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) contours; if so, do those NA contours take into account higher altitude areas which, although a distance away from the end of Analysis the east-west runway, may be exposed to severe aircraft noise as a result of the shorter distance between their homes and the overflying aircraft. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (1) Yes. An additional 556 homes in the Barton electorate have been invited to participate in the Sydney Airport Noise Insulation Program. (2) Eligibility for aircraft noise insulation assistance under the Sydney Airport Noise Insulation Program is based on noise exposure as calculated under the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast system. Residential properties within the 30 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast contour are eligible for insulation assistance. It is not yet possible to determine a reliable Australian Noise Exposure Forecast which reflects the Long Term Operating Plan arrangements. Consequently, Australian Noise Exposure Concepts (ANECs) have been produced based on the best . information currently available. These have been used to re-prioritise the noise insulation program on an interim basis. (3) See answer to Question 2. Airservices Australia, which is the organisation within Australia responsible for vetting the technical accuracy of noise exposure forecasts, advises that topography is not taken into account in determining the ANEC's. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: RamInsulation raid Robbery (Question No. 2093) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a recent ramraid robbery at the International Terminal at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) Will he review the adequacy of the security at the airport in light of the incident. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) As the honourable member has noted, the purpose of the ram-raid was theft; in this case goods were stolen from one of the duty free shops in the airport terminal at a time the terminal was not in operation. Security arrangements for protection of shops is the responsibility of the Federal Airports Corporation and retailer. The protection arrangements can be compared with the protection for shops in normal shopping centres. Special security arrangements are, however, in place to protect the public during times when the terminal is operational. These arrangements include supplementing community policing by patrols of armed officers of the Australian Protective Service. The out of hours robbery does not throw into question the arrangements for the protection of aviation operations and public safety. The arrangements would, of course, be reviewed if the current level of threat changes. Drugs: Research (Question No. 2105) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has research been undertaken as to the size of the market for illegal drugs in Australia in terms of the annual monetary value of the trade; if so, what have been the findings of the studies. (2) Have studies been undertaken as to the extent to which the market in illegal drugs has been funded by criminal activity. (3) Has his attention been drawn to trials undertaken in Switzerland and The Netherlands in an endeavour to reduce the size of the market for illegal drugs in those countries; if so, is the Minister able to say (a) what has been the nature of those trials and (b) have those trials in reducing the extent of the market in illegal drugs. Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) I am advised that as far as it is possible to ascertain there have been no national studies conducted into the size of the market for illegal drugs. (2) I am advised that as far as it is possible to ascertain there have been no national studies conducted into the extent to which the market in illegal drugs has been funded by criminal activity. (3) I am aware of the trial conducted in the last two or three years in Switzerland, although I am advised that the focus of this trial is the gathering of experimental and research data associated with the treatment of heroin dependent persons with diacetylmorphine (pharmaceutical heroin) and other opiates. As far as can be ascertained, the similar trial in the Netherlands, while planned and recently announced in the media, has not yet commenced. (a) The nature of these trials is as described above. (b) It is not known whether the trial in Switzerland has been successful in reducing the extent of the market in illegal drugs. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise Monitoring Devices (Question No. 2146) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon . notice, on 26 August 1997: Have noise monitoring devices been relocated as a result of the adoption of the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; if so, to where have they been relocated. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The location of the 12 permanent noise monitoring terminals will be reviewed following the introduction of the new flight paths under the Plan in early December 1997. Mineral Exports (Question No. 2158) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice,on 27 August 1997: Further to his answer to a question without notice (Hansard, page 6801) 26 August 1997, (a) what. mineral exports will develop as a result of the completion of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, (b) where are the minerals located and (c) who has had success the rights to those minerals. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In his answer on 26 August 1997, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development quoted from a 1993 report by Morrison Knudsen which states that the Alice Springs-Darwin railway project would stimulate mineral exports from the north. I am advised that this was a general observation and it would not be appropriate or sensible to try to specify which of the particular mineral deposits which might be found would benefit from the line or who might own the rights to these deposits. The key point is, however, that given the ability of rail to move high volume mineral traffic much more cheaply and efficiently than road, the completion of this important link to the port of Darwin is likely to benefit the exploitation of any large mineral deposits discovered in localities that the line can serve. Airline Code Sharing (Question No. 2164) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 28 August 1997: Do Qantas and Ansett code-share with other airlines on international routes; if so, (a) which routes, (b) which other airlines are involved and (c) what checks are in place to ensure that the standard of airworthiness of planes and competence of the crews is equivalent to those operated directly by Qantas and Ansett. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Both Qantas and Ansett have extensive codeshare arrangements with numerous airlines. Qantas code-shares on flights to and from Austria, Canada, Fiji, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the United States. Qantas has code-share arrangements with British Airways, Canadian Airlines International Air Pacific, Japan Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Martinair, Air Caledonie, Air Niugini, Solomon Airlines, Air Vanuatu, American Airlines, USAir Inc and Federal Express. Ansett code-shares on flights to and from Korea Malaysia, New Zealand and Taiwan on flightoperated by Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Air New Zealand and Eva Air. - n- airlin- operating to Australia on a regular b-sls IS r-quired to ?btain - n Australian foreign mrcraft Au Operator s CertIficate from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Occasional flights require individual clearance from CASA. Airlines who do not operate into Australia but are code-sharing partners of Qantas and Ansett are the responsibility of the safety regulatory authority of the country - f the air.craft's .registration. They also b.e. subject to IllS-ectlon by the regulatory authontles of the countnes they transit through. Australian Defence Force: Grievance Procedures (Question No. 2175) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 1 September 1997: Further to her answer to question No. 1813 (Hansard, 28 August 1997, page 7165), is she satisfied with the situation where 43 of the 132 redress-s of. gri-vance being investigated or awaiting mvestigatIOn on behalf of a Chief of Service or the Chief of the Defence Force have been under consideration for over 9 months; if not, what processes has she undertaken to expedite decision making. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are many reasons why the resolution of individual redresses of grievance which have been referred to the Chiefs of Service or the Chief of the Defence Force or their delegates may be delayed. - he prio-tising of complaints is done on a daily basIs. In thIS regard, some complaints are more urgent than others. For example, cases which involve serious matters, or which are time-critical iI!volving executive action such as posting or dl-c-arge, are normally allocated the highest pnonty. Delays can occur when complaints are afforded a low priority. . Del-ys .can also occur in complex cases, where IllvestigatIOns may become lengthy and involved. In addition, in some cases, complainants delay their responses to requests for additional information which w-uld enable their complaint to be pro-ressed .. Fmally, some members are slow in providmg advIce as to whether they are satisfied with d-cision- made b- their Chief of Service, or if they wIsh theIr complamt to be further considered by the Chief of the Defence Force. In a recent case, two years elapsed before an officer decided that he wished his complaint to be referred to the Chief of the Defence Force. In order to determine the reasons for the various delays in finalising individual applications for redress of grievance, a physical search of all redress of grievance files would be necessary. I am not prepared to commit further resources for this task. Some steps have been taken to improve the current processes for handling ADF members' redresses of grievance. On I July 1997, a combined Complaint Resolution Agency was created in the may Defence Personnel Executive. A focus of the new Agency will be to establish, to the greatest extent possibl-, common procedures for the handling of complalllts and to encourage the resolution of complaints at the lowest level. The integration and ratio-alisation of Service complaint management functIOns should lead to the more efficient handling of ADF members' complaints. Government Tenders: Quality Assurance (Question No. 2177) Mr Hardgrave asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 1 September 1997: (1) Has the Government changed the requirements for quality assurance for use in Government tenders; if so, (a) what are the new provisions and (b) when will quality assurance be required for Government supplies. (2) Has progress been made in the use of electronic commerce for Government purchasing contracts; if so, what. (3) Who is entitled to use the Transigo system and at what cost. (4) Are provisions being made to include State government purchasing units and local governments in the system; if so, what. (5) What has been the cost to the Government of establishing the Transigo system. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There has been no change to the Commonwealth Government's requirements for quality assurance in Government tenders. The policy has always been to consider the need for quality assurance on a case by case basis, taking into account the risks associated with the provision and uS,e of those purchases. This is clearly stated in the recently released Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. (2) Yes. In November 1996 the Commonwealth and Telstra entered into a Deed of Agreement under which Telstra would establish and operate a Commonwealth Electronic Commerce Service (CECS). CECS, now known as 'Transigo', was to be funded on a user-pays basis and implemented in a series of releases, offering progressively expanded functionality. The first release of Transigo was made available in March 1997, with additional functionality added in a number of sub-releases since then. Commonwealth buyers use Transigo to advertise bidding opportunities and report their purchasing, while suppliers are able to access this information. Telstra has announced further developments of Transigo. An electronic trading document service will be available by December 1997 and an electronic payment service by March 1998. (3) Transigo is an Internet-based service. It has a free-to-air component which provides basic access to summary information about Commonwealth business opportunities and contracts and standing offers arranged by the Commonwealth. Buyers and suppliers can also subscribe to Transigo for a' basic annual subscription cost of $348 per user. This currently allows buyers to publish opportunities on Transigo and suppliers to download tender documentation and advertise their goods and services, with additional functionality to be provided in future releases. Additional services are available for the following fees: Automated tender matching and notification: $240 p.a. Data storage in excess of 5 Mb: $0.20 per Mb per day Manual upload of information by Transigo Support Centre: $10 per notice Bid request line: download and postal distribution of tender documents by the Transigo Support Centre: $15 per item. (4) The impetus behind Transigo originated with the Commonwealth, and other tiers of government are being encouraged to use Transigo to conduct , procurement. It is intended that Transigo will also become a medium for business-to-business transactions. Transigo provides links to state government Internet sites and information about their procurement policies and practices. (5) The development and implementation of Transigo is being undertaken by Telstra following an extensive tendering process. The terms of the contractual arrangements between the Commonwealth and Telstra are such that there are no payments by the Commonwealth to ·Telstra to establish the service. The project is being funded on a user-pays basis through subscriptions to Transigo by buyers and suppliers. Members: Inducements (Question No. 2200) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 3 September 1997: (1) Is he able to say how many Members have travelled overseas at the expense, or part expense, of (a) companies or corporations and (b) foreign government or agencies. (2) Does the Government have a policy on Members receiving inducements from (a) private companies or corporations or (b) foreign governments, if not, why not. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable Member's question: (1) No(2) The policy on the declaration of pecuniary interests and registration of private interests of Members of the House of Representatives has been determined by the standing orders and resolutions of the House. In relation to, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, there is a clear requirement that they not accept any benefit where acceptance might give an appearance that they may be subject to declarations in the Parliament and to the Prime Minister of gifts and hospitality received and of sponsored travel undertaken (see A Guide on Key Elements o+Ministerial Responsibility tabled in the House of Representatives on 30 April 1996). Parliamentary and News Network (Question No. 2202) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) What on-air time on the Parliamentary News Network has been taken up with broadcasts of the proceedings of the (a) Senate and (b) House of Representatives in the period 1 January to 22 September 1997. (2) What time has been taken up with live broadcasts of (a) proceedings and (b) question time in each House in the period. (3) On how many occasions has the full question time period in each House been broadcast live to air in the period. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) For the period 1 January to 22 September 1997, total ""on air time"" for the Senate was 288 hours 37 minutes. (1) (b) For the same period, total ""on air time"" for the House of Representatives was Senate was 288 hours 37 minutes. (2) (a) Total ""on air"" for proceedings in the House of Representatives, excluding live question time, was 227 hours 2 minutes. Total ""on air"" for proceedings in the Senate excluding live question time was 260 hours 20 minutes. (2) (b) Total ""on air"" time for live questions the House of Representatives was 32 hours 38 minutes. Total ""on air"" time for live questions in the Senate was 28 hours 17 minutes. (3) In the period 1 January to 22 September 1997, 28 question times were broadcast live to air in the Senate, and 26 question times were broadcast live to air in the House of Representatives. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Northern Territory (Question No. 2230) Mr Dondas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) What sums have been appropriated for the ABC in the Northern Territory in (a) 1997-98, (b) 1996-97, (c) 1995-96, (d) 1994-95 and (e) 1993-94. (2) What was the (a) dollar value and (b) percentage of funding cuts sustained by the ABC in the Northern Territory in (i) ABC Television, (ii) ABC Radio, (iii) Radio Australia and (c) Australia Television in the (A) 1996 and (B) 1997 Budgets. (3) What programming changes have occurred as a direct result of the budget cuts to the ABC in the Northern Territory. (4) Have budget cuts caused Northern Territory jobs losses in (a) ABC television, (b) ABC radio, (c) Radio Australia and (d) Australia Television; if so, how many. (5) What are the latest rating figures for (a) ABC television Darwin, (b) ABC radio Darwin and (c) ABC radio Alice Springs. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a--e) Funding allocations· for ABC activities in the Northern Territory are determined through internal ABC budget processes which allocate available funds to the various portfolios. Information for the years 1993-94 and 1994-95 in is not readily available as information prior to the last three years is not held on current systems. This data would need to be sourced from filed and archived information which would take considerable time and cost to compile. Actual expenditure information for 1995-96 and 1996-97 as well as the current budget allocation for 1997-98 is set out below. Year $,OOOs 97-98 (est) 96-97 (act) 95-96 (act) 9,062 Note: the above information does not include efficiency reasons are held centrally terrestrial communication costs, workers charges etc. (2) Based on the table shown at Question (1)(a), the Northern Territory budget allocation increased in the 1996-97 year by 9% and was reduced in the 1997-98 year by 16%. Under the One ABC structure the Divisions of Radio and Television no longer exist and funding is now split between non-media specific portfolios. Meaningful financial year comparisons based on the above classifications are therefore not available. Radio Australia has not had any direct expenditure or funding classified under the Northern Territory. Separate figures for ATV expenditure in the Northern Territory are not maintained. (3) In the Northern Territory, the local radio afternoon program from Alice Springs has been replaced by a Territory-wide program from Darwin. This change has, however, enabled the establishment of a part-time Broadcaster in Katherine to provide local input to Territory Radio from this important region of the Territory. 8DDD Radio National ABC Classic FM Triple J All ABC (5) (c) The latest radio ratings data for Alice Survey: August-September 1995"".

(5) (a) As the ABC does not subscribe to AC Nielsen-MCNair's television ratings surveys undertaken in Darwin, we are unable to provide figures for television. (5) (b) The latest radio ratings figures for Darwin have been taken from the ABC Audience Research report ""Radio Listening in Darwin: OctoberNovember 1996"". The weekly reach and percentage reach figures are as follows: Weekly Reach % Reach 25,81433.7 5,362 7.0 6,894 9.0 21,831 28.5 47,400 61.8 Springs is from the ABC ""Northern Territory Regional and percentage reach figures are as follows: Weekly Reach % Reach 7,800 35.4 2,200 10.2 1,600 7.4 4,000 18.2 12,400 56.5 Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Year 2000 Capacity (Question No. 2249) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1371 (Hansard, 14 May 1997, page 3677), is comprehensive data covering both passenger and aircraft movements during and after the Atlanta Olympics now available; if so, what does it reveal. (2) Does it remain the conclusion that the runway and terminal facilities at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will have sufficient capacity to cope effectively with the traffic demands associated with the Olympic Games with the current curfew arrangements and a cap on aircraft movements of 80 movements per hour. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. More comprehensive data has not yet been made available by the Atlanta authorities. (2) Yes. Government Purchasing: Electronic (Question No. 2267) Mrs West asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) What is the timetable for fully introducing electronic commerce for government purchasing. (2) What will be the subscription cost for small businesses to access the system. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable Member's question is as follows: (l) In July 1996 this Government approved a strategy for implementing electronic commerce by the Commonwealth. Under this strategy, Departments would use a Commonwealth Electronic Commerce Service (CECS) to trade electronically with their suppliers. In November 1996 the Commonwealth and Telstra entered into a Deed of Agreement under which Telstra would establish and operate CECS, to be known as 'Transigo', on a user-pays basis. The first release of Transigo was made available in March 1997, with additional functionality added in a number of sub-releases since then. Government agencies are obliged to use Transigo from 1 July 1997 to advertise publicly available bidding opportunities and notify all purchases of $2000 or more and standing offers arranged. The electronic version of the Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposals Gazette has been available on Transigo since 28 July 1997. Telstra has recently announced further development of Transigo, with an electronic trading document service to be available by December 1997 and an electronic payment service by March 1998. Future releases of Transigo will provide additional functionality, in line with latest developments in technology and procurement practice. (2) Anyone can access the free-to-air component of Transigo through any Internet Service Provider. This provides basic access to summary information about Commonwealth business opportunities and contracts and standing offers arranged by the Commonwealth. Buyers and suppliers can also subscribe to Transigo for a basic annual subscription cost of $348 per user. This allows buyers to publish opportunities on Transigo and suppliers to download tender documentation and advertise their goods and services. Future functionality will be included as part of the subscription at no additional cost. Additional services are available for the following fees: Commerce - Automated tender matching and notification: $240 p.a. - Data storage in excess of 5 Mb: $0.20 per Mb per day. - Manual upload of information by the Transigo Support Centre: $10 per notice. v - Bid request line: download and postal distribution of tender documents by the Transigo Support Centre: $ 15 per item. Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (Question No. 2282) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 25 September 1997: Has he approached Tasmanian industry leaders to ascertain what their opinions would be if the signing of the Tasmanian regional forest agreement was to be deferred until after the next Tasmanian State election; if so, was the approach authorised by the Minister. Mr Anderson-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. I have supported the completion of the RFA in an expeditious and thorough manner to provide increased certainty for all forest users. Department of Defence: Middle Head (Question No. 2296) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 September 1997: Is there an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales entered into in 1979 in relation to Defence Department land at Middle Head in order for the land being incorporated into the Sydney Harbour National Park as it becomes surplus to Defence requirements; if so, will the Government honour the agreement. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In 1979, the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Governments reached agreement (the Sydney Harbour Foreshores Agreement) on the exchange of land, which included the Commonwealth transferring land to form the Sydney Harbour National Park. The agreement provided for a pooling arrangement, based on transactions at agreed prices, and was to continue until balance, or near balance, was reached and, failing that, for a ten year period. During 1989, the Commonwealth indicated to the State that it did not wish to renegotiate the agreement because the original purpose had been achieved. The Commonwealth also stated its willingness to proceed with the transfer of land outstanding, subject to negotiation on price. This included 6.5 hectares of Defence land at Middle Head. When the 6.5 hectares of land at Middle Head is no longer required for Defence purposes, it will be transferred to the State in accordance with the terms of the original agreement. Department of Defence: Georges River (Question No. 2302) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 September 1997: (1) Does the Minister's Department have agencies, instrumentalities or installations bordering the Georges River, NSW; if so, do they use the river for disposal of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent. (2) How many persons are employed at each establishment identified in part (1). (3) Is action being taken by the Minister's Department to stop the instrumentalities, agencies or installations from polluting the Georges River; if so, what. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following Defence installations border on, or are close to, the Georges River: (a) Holsworthy Training Area; (b) School of Military Engineering which includes a nearby Land training area known as 'Camp Sapper'; (c) Sydney West Office of the Defence Corporate Support Organfsation; (d) old Holsworthy Sewage Treatment Plant; (e) East Hills Barracks; (f) Lamia Barracks; (g) Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre; (h) Sydney West Regional Estate Centre; and (i) Holsworthy Barracks. In addition to these installations, the Department of Defence also leases a small area of land, which is adjacent to the Georges River, to the Boy Scouts Association of NSW. With respect to the disposal of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent, each Defence installation collects stormwater which eventually flows into the Georges River; however, only the old Holsworthy Sewage Treatment Plant uses the river for the disposal of effluent and this will cease in the near future pending the augmentation of the western Sydney sewage treatment scheme. (2) (a) Holsworthy Training Area-8 (b) School of Military Engineering-282; (c) Sydney West Office of the Defence Corporate Support Organisation-237; (d) old Holsworthy Sewage Treatment Plant-4; (e) East Hills Barracks-19; (f) Lamia Barracks-54; (g) Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre-950; (h) still Sydney West Regional Estate Centre-25; (i) Holsworthy Barracks-2100. (3) Yes. This action includes: (a) upgrading sewage reticulation and trade waste facilities prior to decommissioning the old Holsworthy Sewage Treatment Plant and the consequential diversion of sewage into Sydney Water's western sewage treatment scheme; (b) integrating stormwater systems; (c) improving procedures in relation to accidental spills; (d) developing environmental management plans; and (e) aUditing existing waste disposal practices. Department of Transport and Regional Development: Georges River (Question No. 2303) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 1 September 1997: (1) Does the Minister's Department have agencies, instrumentalities or installations bordering on the Georges River, NSW; if so, do they use the river for disposal of waste, chemical, debris or effluent. (2) How many persons are employed at each establishment identified in part (I). (3) Is action being taken by the Minister's Department to stop the instrumentalities or installations from polluting the Georges River, if so, what. Mr Vaile--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes; Bankstown Airport, one of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) airports, is near the Georges River. Bankstown does not use the Georges River to dispose of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent. (2) Approximately 2800 people in various businesses across the airport. (3) Bankstown Airport has an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in place covering environmental interaction and potential impact of the airport on the environment. In general, the scope of the EMP covers these activities occurring within the Airport boundaries other than those associated with aircraft movements and operations. The Georges River, and its close proximity to the airport is addressed within the EMP, and steps have been taken to ensure that aviation activities do not have an environmental impact upon the Georges River. Under the EMP, tenants are audited every two years to determine any impact they may have on the local environment, storm water discharges and ground water are regularly monitored, FAC staff are trained on environmental issues annually and pollution absorbent booms have been installed at all stormwater outlets in order to contain any contaminants that may accidentally enter the stormwater system. Royal Australian Air Force: Personnel (Question No. 2334) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (I) Did 46 RAAF personnel accept invitations to attend the 1997 Melbourne Grand Prix; if so, what was the rank of each person. (2) Did 38 RAAF personnel accept invitations to attend the 1997 Gold Coast Indy; if so, what was the rank of each person.

Additional tickets to these events may have been received by Air Force personnel but the number, distribution and whether they were used was not recorded. Royal Easter Show: FIlls (Question No. 2335) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) What was the cost of the F-Il1 fly past at the 1997 Royal Easter Show in Sydney. (2) Who authorised the fly past. (3) From where did the aircraft used for the fly past originate. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The fly past was conducted by an FlA-18 aircraft at a cost of $5758. (2) Air Commander Australia. (3) RAAF Williamtown. However, the aircraft was in the Sydney area on a separate task. Greenhouse Climate Change: Survey (Question No. 2340) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Has the Government commissioned studies, or sought advice, on the economic cost to Australia's rural industries if greenhouse climate change was to cause global surface temperatures to increase by 2 degrees C; if so, (a) what were the results and (b) will they be published. (2) If work has not been commissioned, nor advice sought, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Listed below are research projects commissioned by the Department of the Environment which bear on the economic impact of a 2 degree C rise in temperature from climate change on Australia's rural industries. The projects include impacts associated with a specific 2 degree C rise in temperature. The estimated costs from the impacts of climate change are, however, generally calculated for a range of temperatures (e.g. with temperature increases from 0.5-2.0 degree C or from 1.0-5.0 degree C). Projects are still in progress, but it is expected that results of each project will be published in due course. a. Potential impact of defoliating insects in tree decline under climate change. b.
