WOMEN'S WORK EXHIBITION. - Mr KNOX - As the Prime Minister is. aware, on Wednesday week the Australian. Exhibition of .Women's Work, at which all tht States' will - be represented, will beopened at the Exhibition Buildingj and I should like to know if he '-an see his way. to allow honourable members an opportunity to attend the ceremony, by arranging, for the meeting of the House at an hour somewhat later than is customary?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Australian character of the Exhibition is most marked, and should be fittingly recognised. I am informed that,. in another place, a proposal to adjourn over the opening day has beenfavorably received; but the utmost I cando, under our responsibilities, will be-to move, on the - previous day, that the House at its rising adjourn until, say, 5 p.m. on Wednesday. PAPUAN LAND SETTLEMENT.  that reports from .Papua have been received, I wish to know if the Prime Minister can inform the House how land settlement is proceeding there?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am happy to announce that applications for land have been numerous, those granted-speakin g fiom memory-coverin g some 70,000 acres. I shall endeavour shortly to lav on the table a brief statement of what has beendone! NA DEPARTMENT.",14
3,Mr EDWARDS,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"The following telegram appears in this morning's Argus, dated ""Brisbane, Monday""Delay in the receipt and despatch of interstate telegraphic business is, so far as Brisbane is .concerned, assuming a seriously chronic state. Almost every night last week, last nigKt, and evening again, business was subject to consider, able delay. Complaints are numerous, and it is held that the department should immediately take steps to remedy a state of affairs which is both irritating and costly to business firms, and the press alike. Will the Postmaster-General take steps to remedy the state of affairs therein complained of, and to prevent future serious - delays in the transmission of telegrams?",15
4,Mr MAUGER,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I recognise the seriousness of the complaints, and shall have full inquiries made in respect of them. Anything that can be done to prevent delay - will be done. INDIGENT AUTHORS' FUND.",15
5,Mr MAHON,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"Las t year a sum was voted for the relief of indigent authors. I - should like to know from the Prime Minister whetlier grants have recently been made from the fund so created, and to be informed in respect to other particulars concerning it?",15
6,Mr DEAKIN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"No grants have been made, the undertaking having been given that no money would be distributed until a proposition for its distribution had been laid before Parliament. Since last session a scheme has been drawn up by the Committee to which the question waa remitted, and I will lay it upon the table for the information of the House. SPANISH IMMIGRANTS.",15
7,Mr BAMFORD,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I wish tb ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has ibeen drawn to a paragraph in this morning's Argus under the heading of "" Dissatisfied immigrants, Queensland,"" and referring to Spaniards? Perhaps I may be permitted to explain that a short time ago .a reference was made to this matter in the press of Northern Queensland, and that it was then stated that the Spanish - immigrants intended"" to appeal to their Consul for relief. I ask the honourable - and learned gentleman whether an appeal has been made to his knowledge, and, - if - so, whether he has taken any action in connection therewith?",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I have not had an opportunity of reading the paragraph, nor received such a statement fromanyother source. On the contrary, when visiting Cairns, I took the opportunity of speaking, wherever possible, to the recent arrivals, although all those I met were of British parentage and spoke English. this These were all thoroughly satisfied with the conditions of the work which they were then carrying on. I heard of Spaniards, but had no opportunity to meet them.",15
9,Mr BAMFORD,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,The honourable gentleman has heard no complaint from the\ Consul?,15
10,Mr DEAKIN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I have heard nothing from the Consul. From this paragraph it appears that the dissatisfaction of the men is-with their work, although they have tried both cane-fieldsi and railway work. If they are dissatisfied with both classes of work _  satisfied with the "" tucker'.' 'and the quarters.",15
11,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,And with their sleeping accommodation.,15
12,Mr DEAKIN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"If the men were provided with the food and accommodation which I saw at a number of places, and were yet dissatisfied, they must have possessed much more comfortable lodgings in their own country than, so far as my knowledge of it goes, are generally available for men of their class. EXCISE TARIFF (SPIRITS) ACT.",15
13,Mr HUTCHISON,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,I beg to ask the Minister of Trade and. Customs if it is his intention to see that from the commencement of the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act the extra Excise duty is collected from all distillers who do. not come forward and show that they are paying fair rates of wages to their employee's ?,15
14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"The Act came into force on the i2thi inst., and a notification has been sent to the distillers. If there is an opportunity to collect revenue it will be collected.",15
15,Mr BATCHELOR,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether his Department has yet received the information which the Treasurer, as Acting Prime Minister, recently promised to obtain as to the rates of wages paid in the distilleries and the industries connected with distilling? I may mention that some instances of disparities were furnished then to his honourable colleague",15
16,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member will give notice of a question, I shall be very glad to furnish him with the information tomorrow.",16
17,Mr GLYNN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he cannot declare what the policy of the Government is under Act No. 20 of 1906, which states that if certain things are not done by the distillers within twelve months the Government may submit to the House a motion to the effect that an extra Excise duty shall be imposed? A year having elapsed, I desire to know from the Minister what is the Government's policy on the point?",16
18,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I can only give to the honourable and learned member the same answer that I gave to the honourable member for Boothby. I shall be very glad to make inquiries if he will give notice of a question. If. he will refer to the Act, he will see that practical] v it came into force on the 12th inst.",16
19,Mr BATCHELOR,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,It is the Government policy that we want to ascertain.,16
20,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable and learned member will submit a definite question, I shall be very glad to furnish him with an answer. I think that, in view of their very great importance, it would be much better if notice of these questions were given, so that honourable members might be assured of receiving correct answers.",16
21,Mr GLYNN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,I want to clear up the point.,16
22,Mr BATCHELOR,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I do not know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs quite understood my question. About a fortnight ago the Treasurer promised that certain information would be obtained, ancl I desired to know 'whether it had been obtained, ancl not whether inquiries were going to be made.",16
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"As I told the honourable member just now, I - shall be very glad if he will give notice of a definite question, so that I can furnish him with a definite answer.",16
24,Mr HUTCHISON,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,What is the Government policy?,16
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DELAYS IN TELEGRAPH,"I may tell the honourable member for Hindmarsh that inquiries have been made,. and that a notification' has been sent out to each distiller. I shall be happy to furnish a copy of the notice to any honourable member. I am not in a position to say what replies have been received unless I am afforded an opportunity to obtain them from the Department. NA LONDON.",16
26,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I beg to ask the Treasurer if he can inform the House what steps are being taken towards securing a site in the - Strand for Commonwealth Offices?,16
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Sinq e the matter was dealt with by the House and the Senate, telegrams have been despatched making an offer, but up to the present time no reply has been received. We have decided that if we do purchase the site, the building shall be erected in such a way that we shall be able to offer to each. State a section of it without making any charge.

How many omcers in the 5th Class Clerical Division in the PostalDepartment in New South Wales were Tecorn mender] for promotion to the 4th Class for the year 1906-7? 2. How many such recommended promotions were provided for in the Estimates for that year ? 3. How are these recommendations arrived at, and who are responsible for them ? 4.

28,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information^1. Seven omcers. 2. All the officers recommended were provided for on Estimates 1906-7. -5. The recommendations were made by the Chief Officer and Permanent Head of the Department, who are responsible for them. 41 Recommendations for class promotions are reported upon by the Public Service Inspector, who, from his knowledge of the work performed, is able to advise wliether or not there is justification for raising the classification of an officers position. v No recommendations were disallowed. 6. Eighteen officers were recommended, and, in addition, forty-three officers whose duties and work are not considered as warranting more than fift h class classification, and to promote whom to a higher class would inflict injustice on a large number of other officers. 7. Out of the eighteen above mentioned, it was found that eleven of the positions justified a higher grading, and provision has been made on the Estimates for this number of promotions from 5th to the 4th Class. OVERTIME: SYDNEY POST",16
29,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"for Mr Webster) asked the Postmaster-General, noticer. Whether it is a fact that 32,000 hours of overtime have been worked by the clerical branches in the General Post Office, Sydney, no compensation being allowed, either in money payment or "" time off "" ? 2.

Is it also a fact that the Estimates only - provide for an additional 267 hands? 3. How does the Minister propose to reduce .overtime-o r grant leave long overdue? 4. Does he propose to increase the non-permanent hands, and so agrravate the cause of the (present undesirable condition of the service?",17
32,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The answers to the .honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. and 4. The number of hands asked for was - recluced by the Treasurer because he considered it undesirable to largelv increase, permanently, ""the staff required to deal with the' business in a time of great activity which might not be constant, and because he thought that the immediate pressure could be adequately met by the - employment of temporary hands, for which he was willing to make provision, vide his statement (page 3310 of Hansard). POSTAL. TELEGRAPHIC, AND - TELEPHONE REVENUE, VICTORIA.",17
33,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"the Fostmaster-General, upon notice I.

35,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsInstructions could only be conveyed in the form of regulations. As the Crown Law Officers advise that regulations of a general nature could only be framed, a Bil l has been prepared to upon amend the law so as to accomplish this object. BUTTER GRADING.",17
36,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether it is intended to alter the system of t ! grade-marking "" butter by putting corresponding numbers on the goods and certificates to a system of ""grade-marking"" the boxes?",17
37,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsNo, but it may be mentioned that if specially desired by exporters, it is the practice to place the grade mark on the boxes. WIRE NETTIN G; REFUND OF DUTIES.",17
38,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"the Treasurer, upjn noticeIn view of the decision of the Committee of Ways and Means to reduce the General Tai.ff on' wire netting to ro per cent., and United King-dom 5 per cent., and in view also of the Government's own voluntary proposal to reduce their Tariff of 30 per cent, (general), and 25 per cent. (United Kingdom), to 1; per cent, and 10 oer cent, respectively-Whether , under these exceptional circumstances, the Government will agree to refund the excess duty which has already been collected ?",17
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsIt has been freque.itlv pointed out that the refund of duty dbes not lie within the discretion of the Government, who have no power in the matter. Should Parliament decide that refunds shall be made, they will be made accordingly, but if Parliament decides otherwise, no refund can be given. In Committee of Ways and Means (Consideration resumed from n t h October, vide page 4645) : Division III . , Sugar. Item 28. Sugar, the produce of sugar-cane, per cwt., 6s.",18
40,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Wide Bay) [3.25] - It will be seen by honourable members that the proposed duty follows the old Tariff, and also the recommendation of both sections of the Tariff Commission.",18
41,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Without any evidence whatever.,18
42,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If that be so, I presume the Tariff Commission made the recommendation from their own knowledge, and realizing the full responsibility cast on them.",18
43,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Committee did not inquire into the sugar .question, except incidentally.",18
44,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"However "" that may be, this duty occupies a peculiar position, inExcise. as much as the Excise is levied under Statute, and does not appear in the of duties. Under ordinary circumstances, therefore, the proposed duty might pass almost without comment; but not only orable members, but the press outside two States of Queensland and New South Wales, have directed a great deal, of tention to the question, and have made complaints, which are altogether unjustipleasure fiable, ' in view of the advantages which inclined. have followed legislation in regard sugar industry. I may point out that sugar industry is not confined. to Queensto land and New South Wales.",18
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is at the present Wide Bay. time.,18
46,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Is the honourable - member for Wide Bay inviting discussion on the sugar industry, because it will be difficult to stop the discussion if once started.",18
47,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,fh e honourable member for Angas raised the point.,18
48,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I occupied only live minutes; and if the honourable member follows my precedent we shall have dealt with the matter in an hour.,18
49,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If honourable membersdesire to pass the item without discussion I shall not pursue the subject further. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. TARIFF. Mr FISHER - I simply desire to po'int out that nothing has been more successful than the legislation passed by this Parliament in relation to the sugar industry, although that legislation was passed in the IMPORT DUTIES. face of an amount of petitioning and abusefrom Queensland unparalleled in parliamentary history. Even secession was spoken, of in Queensland; and it was declared that our legislation would ruin the industry To-day, however, to the satisfaction of every one who had to do with the legislation, there are 2,500 more farmers in Queensland, and 260 more farmers in New South Wales, engaged in the industry, chart previously; and the sugar produced is almost enough for our requirements.",18
50,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There are more ""black"" employers in New South Wales now thanthere were in 1902.",18
51,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If so, it is satisfactory to know that ""black"" employers receive no bounty.",18
52,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,They pay Â£ 4 per ton,18
53,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,And receive protection to .schedule the extent of Â£ 6 per ton.,18
54,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Le t me say that if one coloured man is engaged on a plantation honthat is a ""black"" plantation, and' the receives no bounty.'- However, if honourable members desire to pass the itematas proposed, I shall waive my right to discuss the question, merely expressing my that the Committee should be soto the Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) [3.28] - It the would be a vast mistake, in my opinion, pass this item in the perfunctory manner suggested by the honourable member for",18
55,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I did not make the suggestion ; I merely fell in with the desire a general of honourable members.,18
56,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Probably the attitude taken by the honourable member was suggested by an interjection. At any rate, I consider that a very vital and important principle is at stake; and that there is mow presented an opportunity, that will not occur again for some time, to reconsider the policy which this Parliament adopted a few years ago in relation to this industry. By this tax we propose to place an annual burden of 200,000 on the people, extracted from them by increasing the cost of a necessary article of food. In my view, we ought not do that without the fullest consideration. honourable members may think that, because of the legislation we have already passed, there would be some danger in disrupting the complicated settlement which was then arrived at; but I consider that danger to be largely imaginary. At any rate, in my opinion, we ought to make an attempt to reconsider the position of the taxpayer in regard to the northern planters. In passing, I desire to pay a high compliment to the advocates of the planters both inside and outside this House, for the ability, resource and pertinacity displayed in their attack on the Australian taxpayer. I shall pass over for the time being their falsification of facts, their presentation of false issues, and their juggling with statistics. It may be remarked here that when argument failed to sustain the planter's case, sentiment was appealed to and turned the scales in his favour. We accepted this burden through anadroit suggestion that it was the price that should be paid for a White Australia. To preserve this continentfor a white race is certainly worth a .heavy financial sacrifice. If what we have .paid the planter-if what we are going to pay him during, the next five yearswoulld rid .this country of the .coloured .alien, I should be the last to make protest against the payment. In such case we should have had good value for our money. But all we have gained from our sacrifices for the planter is the disappearanceof a few thousand Pacific Islanders-of all - coloured aliens the least menacing to the , racial purity of Australia. They were confined practically to the tropical belt of a single State,"" and did not, like the Chinese, spread themselves over the country and become a source of permanent infection. This abolition of the Kanaka traffic touched - only the fringe of the coloured alien question. We had, in 1901-I.hav e no later figures-some 54,440 coloured aliens, of whom only 9,000 odd were Kanakas. So that, despite our legislation, after deporting every Kanaka from Queensland, we still have 44,600 coloured aliens in Australia. Who can say, then, that the 'enormous sacrifice which we have made, ostensibly for the White Australia ideal, is likely to accomplish its purpose?",19
57,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We have settled 2,500 farmers in Queensland, and 260 in northern New South Wales.",19
58,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member may refine until he is tired, but he cannot Some get away from the striking fact that the Australian taxpayer, has paid, and is paying, an enormous sum for the benefit of sugar planters who employ black labour.",19
59,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,He is doing nothing of the kind.,19
60,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I will show the honourable member presently that our policy is not successful even in'putting white men into the industry, because nearly one-fifth of the employees now in it are coloured aliens. 'bi* 1 F l SHE R -- That is absolutely impos",19
61,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member cannot successfully contradict me. I have the figures from official sources.,19
62,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Le t the honourable member quote the figures and tell us where he gets them from.,19
63,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I will tell the honourable member my authority. I do not get up in this Chamber and talk at random The number of persons employed in the sugar industry on the 31st December, 1906, was, in the fields 36,197, and in the factories 5,079, making a total of 41,276. The white employees numbered 33,700, and the coloured workers 7,576.",19
64,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member is quoting the figures of two years ago.,19
65,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am quoting the official figures, made up to the 31st December, 1:906.",19
66,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,When the new Kanaka legislation had not come into operation. Since that time the emplovment of Kanakas has practically stopped.,19
67,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member knows as well as I do that practically the whole of the Kanakas should have been deported, at the. end of 1906. - Mr FISHER - Qh , no; that is an ""error.",19
68,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That .was the understanding when we voted the bounty.,20
69,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We have passed amending Act 'since then. Mr v MAHON - We have passed no amending Bill that allows of the retention of the Kanaka in any sustantial number. The fact remains that there were 7,1576 coloured employees engaged in the industry at the date named. What has happened since I do not know. I do not think the honourable member for Wide Bay knows awav. either, because .there is no authoritative information-h e can have none.'",20

73,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I will come to the tonnage by-and-by. I am now dealing with the people employed. Although the production of sugar in New South Wales, both by black and white labour, has fallen protective Tariff. off, the black labour employers increased in that State from 115 in 1902 to 169 in 1907. that? The percentage cultivated by black labour, as compared with the percentage cultivated by white labour, also showed an increase, in favour of black labour cultivation. M.r. FISHER - That is in 1906.",20
74,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I have not seen anv figures for 1907. The honourable member may have some, but if so, he has not them to the Committee. From these it is clear that the pretence under which this legislation was passed by Parliament and foisted upon the people.of Australia was a fraudulent pretence, and that it has been so proved by the results. It must it further. not be forgotten the Pacific Islanders were brought to Queensland by the people of Stale themselves in the interest of their dustry.' No other State obtained any adpetitor. vantage from their presence, and no other State is directly benefited by their deporseems tation. That being so, it would have been a fair thing for the people of Queensland to have paid the cost of returning Kanakas instead of shifting the expenditure grower obtains. on to the shoulders of the taxpayers of Austhe figures is not vitiated tralia. The cost of sending back these men has been - considerable.",20
75,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Did not the Queensland people contribute Â£ 5 per head ?,20
76,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am afraid' that it ' would be out of order to discuss in detail tha auestion of ithe deportation of the Kanakas - But the honourable member can - easily ascertain for himself the financial aspect of the matter. Apparently the fundsprovided by the planters for returning thean Kanakas were misappropriated by the State Government. The latter spent the money, and then unblushin'gly threw on the other States the cost of deportation. It isone of those unfortunate misunderstandings about money matters which sometimes land private individuals in gaol.",20

83,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not pretend to say to whom the money has gone. I am merely pointing out that the taxpayer has had to' pay it, and it is not to my purpose to follow",20

85,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Ver y probably. That the usual thing. Get a monopoly and then bleed the public. But to return. Our legislation has given the black grower althe most as much protection as the white The significance of by the fact, which I cheerfully admit, that there has been a material increase ih the quantity of sugar annually grown by white labour and also in the number of ' w h it e labourers employed in the industry. When that has been admitted, everything that can be said in favour of the subsidy has been said. The most that we can claim for this tribute, which the whole of Australiai's paying to the sugar industry) is that it tends to encourage the substitutiom of white for coloured labour. But to allow the grower by black labour to obtain ,Â£1,242,524 of the money of the taxpayers is a most extraordinary way of promoting the policy of a white Australia.",20
86,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,How does the honourable member arrive at that amount?,21

88,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"-Why not impose Â£ f i per ton Excise on black-grown sugar, otherwise we are protecting a black-labour industry ?",21
89,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I shall give the honourable member an opportunity to vote in the direction which his remarks indicate, since I intend to move that the import duty be reduced to Â£ 4 per ton. That will place the Excise and the import duty on the same footing, and will deprive the grower of sugar by black labour of any protection.",21
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Would the honourable member abolishi the. Excise?,21
91,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No . Abolition of the Excise would mean the reduction, if not the abolition of the bounty, unless we drained the public Treasury still further; and if we paid no bounty the white grower would bave no advantage over the grower by black labour. We must retain the Excise, and grant the bounty to the grower of sugar by white labour until, either by State legislation or otherwise, the coloured element has - been eliminated from the industry. At the first blush it may seem thar, a proposal of this kind is likely to be unfair to the growers by white labour; but I would ask honourable members to remember that they ante now talking of exporting sugar.",21
92,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,And sugar is being exported.,21
93,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"At a conference of sugar-growers held at Townsville in February last, the chairman, evidently a very intelligent man. after referring to the Output of the Australian planter as being likelv to overtake the local consumption, saidWe are thus confronted with the novel experience in the history of sugar growing in Australia of being in the position of having .1 surplus to dispose of. Now. anv production in excess of the demand within the Commonwealth, can only be converted into monev by our competing in the world's markets. In no country on the face of the earth, with the sole exception of Australia, is it attempted to grow sugar cane with other than coloured labour. In dealing with any surplus over the Australian demand, we are, therefore, at once brought into competition with those sugar countries which produce their sugar at a cheaper rate than we can do on account of the smaller cost of labour.",21
94,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Hear , hear. The honourable member wishes to handicap our growers in their fight against them. - Mr Mahon - I am speaking now of the proposal to export sugar, and if Australian sugar is exported it must fight in the world's market against the black-grown sugar. Surely every one. recognises that that which we export must be sold at prices fixed by the unrestricted competition of the world.",21
95,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Did the gentleman in question say that all sugar was grown by black labour?,21
96,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is virtually what he did say. Mr FiSHER^Then he knows nothing about the matter.,21
97,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The chairman of the  point out the undisputed fact thatBonuses, or other artificial means of protection, cease to operate when once we are compelled to face the markets of the world. . . . Is the industry lo be compelled to remain stationary through mistaken internal legislation? This, however, is a problem which demands of those who have created it a satisfactory solution, and to them. I commend it, for their most serious and early attention. Queensland planters, therefore, are meditating the exportation of sugar. The honourable member for Angas has in his possession, I understand, an invoice of Australian sugar sold in South Africa at jf.3 18s. per ton below the price at which Australian sugar is sold in the Commonwealth. Mr TUDOR,-Are the wholesale prices used in both cases for the purposes of the comparison ?",21
98,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I do not know.  the Excise when sugar is exported?,21
99,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Yes ; a drawback is allowed. That question arises in connection with the exportation of preserved fruit and jam, a matter witli ' which I shall deal hi a few moments. If the manufacturers of preserved fruits or jam use imported sugar they obtain a drawback of 50 per cent, of the weight of the jam, and if the sugar be Australian grown, they receive a rebate of 30s. per ton. The fruit aaid sugar contents of most jams are equal; so that Australian sugar used in preserving fruit that is exported secures what is equivalent to an export bounty of 50 per cent. The grower at the present time is practically granted a protection of Â£ 5 per ton, but if his sugar goes abroad hi the shape of preserved fruit or jam, he gets in addition what is equivalent to 30s. per ton of jam-that is Â£ 3 per ton of sugaror a 25 per cent, export rebate on the sugar used in that jam.",21
100,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member means a bounty.,22
101,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Whateve r it is called, it is paid by the people on that particular sugar exported in the form of jam.",22
102,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is a silly statement.,22
103,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If it be silly, it is made on the authority of officials in whom the honourable member once placed great confidence.. I have in my possession a statement from the Customs Department showing that what I have said is perfectly correct.",22
104,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,If we exported a million .tons of sugar we should pay nothing for it.,22
105,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If we send away a ton of Australian sugar in jam we give the jamexporter Â£ 3 rebate, although the identical sugar has already cost this community ^ 5 .",22
106,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is collected in the form of Excise duty.,22
107,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member is so befogged that he does not understand the position. I ask him to restrain himself until I reach that aspect of the question where the Australian sugar is sent out as part of exported jam. Let me put a homely illustration to the honourable member : Let us. suppose it to be possible for a sugar planter to combine the manufacture of jam with his ordinary business. If he produces a ton of sugar, he pays an. Excise duty of Â£ 4 on it, and the Commonwealth Government immediately hands him back ^3 as a bounty. He is therefore Â£ 1 out qf pocket. But in the meantime he has had the advantage of an increase in the price of' sugar-du e to the difference between the Excise and import duties-and when he puts that sugar into the' jam which he . manufactures for export, he obtains Â£ 3 from the Treasury. To put the matter in another way, he receives Â£ 5 protection and bounty for producing the sugar as a sugar-grower and as a jam-maker on exporting the sugar in the form of jam.  member think that the grower is lucky to get f-ven that much out of the Commonwealth ?",22
108,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I think the growers are very luck v. I should like to be in their places.,22
109,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I understand that that rebate is only allowed on imported sugar.,22
110,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I can give the honourable member an official contradiction of that statement. I have here a paper which I received from the Comptroller-General of Customs, who will be recognised as an authority.",22
111,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It was the Comptroller-General or his representative who informed me this morning in the presence of three witnesses that such .was the case.,22
112,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I will read the information supplied to me, and then the honourable member will be able to read any information that has been given to him. I am informed thatWhen imported sugar is used, a draw-back', of the import duty on sugar is allowed upon the exportation of Australian jam, but so that no allowance shall be made for sugar contents in excess of one-half of the total weight of the jam. This means that the whole duty is practically given back. That is the position with regard to imported sugar - used in jam exported from Australia, butWhen excise sugar is usedby that the Comptroller-General of Customs means Australian sugara drawback is allowed up to 30s. per ton of the weight of the jam. The full drawback is withheld, apparently, because the Department found itself unable to distinguish whether the sugar jn. the exported jam was grown here by white or black labour. According to the evidence of  turer; 'the. sugar contents of - jam ' average about 50 per cent. Therefore, 3os..Idrawback per ton of jam means Â£ 5 ' per ton of sugar; and it is the.practical equivalent of an export bounty on sugar. > - > , -';",22
113,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is less than .the average of the Excise from black-grown and':-whitegrown sugar-. 1 --,-.â- v _ ,--'i",22
114,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I cannot follow -'--the honourable member's interjectionii My-eontentioiv is that as the jam --maxiufagt&er obtains'a refund,of 36s. 'per, ton bf' jahi, the effect.,is that,, so far as!.the exported - jamis .concerned, - we are'givingi-.a, 2,5'rper ""cent.1 export rebate'on the sugar-'contents.' - ",22
115,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is a rebate of Â£3 a ton.,23
116,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member is right. I desire to draw the attention of honourable members to a statement made by  in May, 1905, in which he dealt with the duty and the quantity of sugar in the various jams. He states that in the case of plum jam the sugar contents are equal to the f r u it contents, and that the duty is 128 per cent, of the value of the fruit. was speaking then of the Â£ 6 import .duty. In the case of peach jam, the sugar and fruit contents are equal, and the duty is 77 per cent, of the value of the fruit . In the case of apricot jam, the figures are the same as in that of peach jam. In quince jam, the sugar and frui t contents are equal, and the duty is equal to twice the value of the fruit. It is questionable whether the Australian taxpayer, when he submitted to taxing himself for the benefit of a White Australia policy, ever intended to establish an export bounty on sugar.",23
117,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,For the outsiders.,23
118,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"To give cheap sugar to .outsiders, and to pay a higher price for his own sugar. I doubt whether that aspect of the matter was ever put before the people of Australia.",23
119,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It was not listened to, but I mentioned that very thing, quoting the French experience, in 1901.",23
120,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Then the . honourable member anticipated me considerably. A any rate I do not think that the country ; has approved of that policy, and that is one of the reasons which induces me to move for a reduction of this duty. A man could unite the two businesses of sugar ducing and jam exporting would have something better on than a gold mine. would be by far the most profitable pursuit in the realm of present-day production or Â£ 4 0 , 0 0 0 . exchange. There is no doubt that the crease in the price of sugar has militated against the exportation of .jam. the exportation of jam amounted in value to Â£ 9 7 , 9 4 2 ; in 1903, to Â£ 1 0 0 , J904, to Â£ 1 2 1 , 5 2 6 ; in 1905, there tremendous drop to Â£ 5 4 , 6 1 2 ; while 1906, the exportation, still falling,",23
121,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"A large amount of sugar is imported for jam makinfr, nnd the manufacturers are paid a full rebate the whole of the duty on the imported sugar which they use to make jam for export.",23
122,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I have already stated so, but miy point is that by coddling the sugar-growers we are .killing what would prove to be a good export industry.",23
123,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,How can the honourable member prove that?,23
124,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I shall quote the state He Colonel FOXTON - An interested one.,23
125,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Is not the honourable member interested in the sugar industry?,23
126,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I have not been quoted as an authority.,23
127,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the honourable member speaks here on the sugar question, I shall expect him to speak as an authority.  The price which growers get for the bulk of their fruit therefore depends upon the purchases of the manufacturers. â At a given price for jam the manufacturer can only afford a given price for his material. If one material-sugar--is artifically enhanced in price the other material-fruit-mus t be benefit of artifically depressed in price. Our fruit-growers lose a great part of what our sugar-growers or the revenue gain by the duty on sugar used in the jam factories. At anv rate it is significant that as sugar revenue increased, the exportation of jams decreased. During the five years I have quoted, the value of the' jams, fruits, jellies, & c , exported totalled Â£419,530. I do not know the wholesale price of a ton of jam, but, assuming it to be Â£ 1 6 , there were 13,110 tons of sugar subject to at drawback of Â£ 3 per ton. Of course, I am speaking of the price at the factory.",23
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is ton for ton.,23
129,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not offer this as who more than a rough calculation, since the proTreasury returns do not show the weight of the fruits and jam exported. The reI t bate upon the sugar in the exported material, in that case, would approximate Of course, this sort of thing inis practically limitless, because sugar is used in the wines and brandies which we In 1902, export, and in a very short period we shall be adding to our con'densed milk factories, 0 8 1 ; in and exporting that commodity. Everywas a body knows that the sugar contents of conin densed milk are about 50 per cent. Therereached fore, when we come to export condensed milk to South-Africa and other countries, we shall be adding to the amount that we are now paying as export rebate on sugar of contained in the jams which we send abroad' Before honourable members commit themselves to maintaining the import duty upon sugar at the present rate, I respectfully ask them to consider this aspect of the question.",23
130,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Did the figures which the honourable member quoted just now represent pounds weight or pounds sterling?,24
131,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The total va.lue of the jams exported during the past five years, as recorded by the Customs Department, was Â£ 4 1 9 , 5 3 0 . I have not the tonnage. I can only estimate that by assuming that the wholesale price of a ton of jam would be about Â£ 1 6 . The honourable member for Wide Bay was formerly under the impression that the sugar-grower paid his own bountv.",24
132,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,So he does.,24
133,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Suret y the honourable member does not hold .that view now ? It was exploded long ago. Yet I admit that the honourable member is not singular in holding this mistaken view. which assume to be authorities on such matters propagate the delusion most industriously"". Not long ago, a Melbourne evening newspaper published what was intended to be an informative article to dispel popular misconceptions on this point. Here is its conclusionNow, to get away from fine phrasing and financing, and consequent confusing of the public mind in respect to the facts, the matter stands thus : At present a man"" who grows sugar in Australia has to pay ^3 a ton for the privilege of doing so. If , however, he use only white labour, he pavs Â£ 1 instead of Â£3-the so-called ""bountv"" of Â£ 2 being simply the arnount that is' not taken from him. The writer forgot to mention that, though the grower paid for the ""-privilege"" of producing sugar, he obtained Â£ 6 from the community by way j j f an increased price for his crop. Theri, J:he Sydney Bulletin, quite as recently as thg 3rd inst., disseminated the same fallac^'.",24
134,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,B u l l e t in is the bible' of a good many persons.,24
135,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I X is not my bible. In rebuking the Sydney'Morning Herald for having stated that the maintenance of the sugar industry was costing the people of Australia hundreds of thousands of pounds annually, the Bulletin^ says :- "" Yet - the fact is that so far from the sugar business costing anything Australia collects an Excise duty from the sugar producer of jQi per ton. Evidently the writer is not up to date, because the present Excise is Â£ 4 per tonnot Â£ 3 per ton.' He continuesI f , however, the sugar is "" w h it e "" grown a rebate equal to 4s. per cwt. of 10 per cent, sugar-cane (Â£2 per ton of sugar) is paid. Here, again, the writer is somewhat belated, because the bounty now paid to the sugar grower is Â£ 3 per ton, and not Â£ 2 per ton. He then publishes a table showing the rate of Excise and of bounty pay : able in respect of sugar produced by white labour, and also containing a column which is headed "" Special Taxation Paid by the Sugar Industry."" There is intrinsic evidence in this paragraph that the writer knew better, and that he had some object to serve in concealing the real facts. He must have known the effect of the import duty in giving the planter Â£ 1 9 to Â£ 2 0 for a ton of sugar when its normal value in any free market would be from Â£ 1 2 to Â£ 1 4 . Of course, there is some warrant for confusion on the point. If the authors of this complicated scheme of import duty, Excise Newspapers duty, and bounty, designed to mystify the public, they could not have devised anything more successful. Hardly anybody outside understands the operation of this scheme, and there is some reason to believe that it is not fully understood in Parliament. The first fact to be gripped is that the import duty raises the price of locallygrown sugar by Â£ 6 per ton. Out of that enhanced price for his crop, the grower pays the Treasury an Excise duty of Â£ 4 per ton. But if his crop is produced exclusively by âwhite labour, the grower is paid by the Treasury a bounty of Â£ 3 per ton. f h e white grower, therefore, receives a net advantage of Â£ 5 per ton on his crop. The grower who uses black labour also pays the Â£ 4 Excise, but he receives no bounty. His net advantage is the difference between the Excise duty, which he pays to the Treasury, and the i increased price for his crop due to the import duty, and this difference amounts to Â£ 2 per ton. These are the exact facts, stated in the plainest terms at my command. Fortunately, even in Queensland, an effort has been made to dissipate the sophistry surrounding this question, and to state the real truth. A journal, known as The Commonwealth, ' published by ex-Senator Drake, has. had the fairness to give this convincing exposition of the point at issue",24
136,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That journal has since died.,24
137,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Dea d or alive, it was a - courageous thing to stand up for the truth when connivance in falsehood might have - been profitable. Upon the 24th March, 1.906, this journal published the - followingThe bounty is not "" a rebate of Excise duty."". It is very important to remember this, as it means of juggling with this and other items that interested persons have made some mosc ridiculous fallacies to bear the appearance of - truth. A rebate, according to the dictionary, is "" a deduction from a gross or normal amount or sum; a'drawback; discount."" The payment to the growers of sugar by white labour never came within this definition, or could come within miles of it. It is quite true that when the Excise Tariff Bil l was passed in 1902 the payment was, with doubtful propriety, referred to .as rebate; but that error was amended by the Sugar Rebate Abolition Act of the next year, which swept all"" mention of rebate from the previous Act. The bounty is paid, not out of Excise nor from any special ear-marked fund, but out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is also 'important because persistent efforts have been made to represent' the payment as connected . in some way with the Excise duty. There is no connection whatever: and, further, the Act itself provides that all payments'that have pre-, vinusly been made under the heading of rebate shall be taken to. have been paid as bounties. The bountv is paid by the whole of the people of Australia upon a capitation basis. Whether they live in a - sugar-growing State or not, - whether they consume sugar or not, - or what quantity of* sugar they do consume, matters - nothing. The whole cost of the bounty is charged to the States exactly in proportion to the num.ber of people in the State at the last count.",25
138,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is correct.,25
139,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Then why does the honourable member contendthat the bounty is paid out of the Excise?,25
140,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There would be no bountv payable if there were no Excise. 'The honourable member knows that. Mr MAHO'N - And if there were no bounty there need be no Excise. If something which I desired to sell were artifi-cially increased in price by Â£ 6 , and I re-ceived, in addition, a bounty of Â£ 3 , I should not feel it a hardship to return Â£ 4 out of my Â£ 9 , since it would leave-me Â£ 5 to the good: I ask the honourable member for South Sydney what other commo-ditv of the farmer bears an import duty of 50 per cent. ?",25
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is only 30 per - cent.,25
142,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We are giving . away Â£700.000 a year in import duties..,25
143,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Treasurer says that ""it is only 30 per cent. A somewhat similar - statement was made at a Conference which was held at Townsville. The Chairman of that gathering admitted that the net protection enjoyed by sugar-growers was Â£ 5 per ton, so that evidently he did not consider that the bounty was paid out Of the Excise. He addedNow, the price of refined sugar today may is by be set down as, say, /jso a ton, and as Â£ $ is the fourth of that sum. sugar grown by white labour, is thus protected to the extent of 25 per cent, ad valorem, which is no greater protection than that given to a large number of articles appearing in the Federal Tariff. I hope honourable members observe the juggling to which he has resorted. He has added the import duty to the normal value of the sugar, and then given the percentage. The real or normal price of sugar is from Â£ 1 2 to Â£ 1 3 ",25
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member cannot purchase sugar at that price.,25
145,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Because we have placed an import duty upon it. That is the reason.,25
146,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"A fair average price for sugar would be from; Â£ 1 1 to Â£ 1 2 per ton.  some time ago, said thisIn rgoo the price of locally-grown sugar was Â£13 per ton in Queensland. There was an import duty on sugar there, but it was as inoperative as a duty on wool would be. The whole of the sugar produced in Queensland was thus sold at world's prices, Â£13 per ton or less. Now I resume what I wished to say. The real or normal price of sugar is from Â£ 1 2 to Â£ 1 3 per ton, and it is on this price that a person dealing honestly with the figures would calculate the percentage of protection giver, to the industry. Any one can see that a net protection of Â£ 5 per ton on sugar worth Â£ 1 2 , works out at about 42 per oent. If we may judge the planters' case by this brazen misuse of figures it must 'be a very weak one. If they produce next year 200,000 tons of sugar, the value of the crop will be about Â£2,400,000; Â£ 5 per ton net protection will add another Â£1,000,000 to the value of the crop, which represents, not 25 per cent., but about 42 per cent. This is the net protection; the actual protection against outside sugar is 50 per cent., represented by the import duty of Â£ 6 per ton.",25
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I think the honourable member is wrong.,25
148,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am sure that I am .nol wrong., . . .",25
149,Sir WILLIAM,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"-LYNE-What do we pay for sugar now--abou t Â£ 1 9 per ton. . Mr Mahon - Between per ton, and Â£6 of that price is artificially created. Admittedly my amendment, if carried, as I hope it , will be, would reduce the protection the grower of sugar by white labour by Â£2 .per ton. At present he has a net protection of Â£5 per ton, and what I propose would give him a net protection of about 25 per cent, ad valorem.",25
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,A very fair percentage of protection.,26
151,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I think it is. honourable member for Angas will probably produce the documents he has referring to the matter, but if Australian sugar can be sold in South Africa for Â£ 3 18s. per ton less than it is sold for. in Australia",26
152,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The Colonial Sugar Company's price hi June was' Â£ 1 1 5s. c.i.f. Durban.,26
153,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Was that for Australian grown sugar or for Fijian sugar?,26
154,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I should have to appeal to tire honourable member for Angas to ascertain whether the price he quoted was for sugar grown in Australia or for sugar that was. merely refined in Australia.,26
155,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I stated the facts last Friday.,26
156,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I understood, at any rate, that the price quoted for South Africa was Â£ 3 18s. per ton less than the price at which sugar is sold in Australia. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - That Java sugar.",26
157,Sir WILLIAMLYN E,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Ancl for cheap - labour sugar.,26
158,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the grower of sugar by white labour can stand a reduction of Â£ 3 18s. per ton in the price of the product when exported for foreign use, he can stand a reduction in the'protective duty to Â£ 3 per'tan so as to lower the cost to the Australian consumer. The Minister willsurely see that an increase price of his product by 25 per cent., due to the protective duty, should amply compensate the grower of . sugar by white' labour for the increased cost of his labour. I have a letter here under the honourable gentleman's own hand dealing with the cost of labour in the industry in Queensland. It shows that the. planters have not given anything like increases in wages corresponding to the benefits we have given them.

170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Let us get the Tariff.,27
171,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable gentle- man cannot accuse me of delaying the Tariff. This is the first time. I have spoken - on the Tariff. I consider the proposal with respect to the sugar industry is an - outrage on the people of Australia, and, whether it suits the Treasurer or not, I shall make my protest against it . "" think I have shown that the sugar ' planters are not entitled to a higher im'port duty than Â£ 3 per ton, which would - add 25 per cent, to the value of their product. They are not paying wages corresponding to the increase which our legislation has conferred on the value of their product, and our legislation has not been successful in excluding the whole of the coloured aliens employed in the industry. If the bounty be excluded, we have given the black grower advantages almost equal to those of the white grower.

At the date mentioned the lixciso was increased to Â£4 per ton, where it remains, giving all growers a net protection ot Â£2 per ton. I think that I am proposing a most effectual means for driving the black man out of the industry, and if it should not be successful there is nothing to prevent the State Government taking action. In Western Australia, we do not allow Chinese into our gold mines, and there is no reason why the State Government of Queensland per ton. should not take action to regulate the labour emploved in the sugar industry in that State.",27
172,Mr HEDGES,RESULTS TO EMPLOYERS OF WHITEAN D,We allow Afghans 'to go on to our gold-fields in Western Australia.,27
173,Mr MAHON,RESULTS TO EMPLOYERS OF WHITEAN D,"We do not allow , them to hold mining leases, or actually to engage - in gold-mining. on with The Queensland Government can. ship off the coloured alien at anv time from this industry, and if that were done, it would simplify the position for us at once. The Excise and bounty could then be abolished, and the import duty lowered to a figure which would give the planter a fair recompense for any increase in the substitution of white for coloured labour. But the preI sent arrangement, besides giving the black employer a protective advantage that Was never intended for him, makes confusion worse confounded. Indeed, if 1 those who are responsible for the bounty, the Excise and the import duty, had desired to mystify the public, they clean out. could not have effected their purpose in a better way. There is no duty in the protection schedule which calls for keener discuskeep sion than this. It involves heavy taxation, and is, moreover, the most objectionmember able of all taxes- a duty on a wholesome alone ? and necessary article of food. It necessarily makes the commodity dearer to the public, and is not paid by the wealthy refineries but by the masses. There is no effective stitute for sugar in household diet, nor in many of the products into which the article enters. It is worthwhile to review operation of this tax on Australian sumers. The probable consumption of tage as the white grower. sugar during the current year-1907-8 has been estimated at 207,138 tons, of which it is thought that 7,833 tons will be imported. Of the Australian producsugar tion-'Whic h is put down at 199,305 tonsit is expected that 181,100 tons would grown by white labour, and 18,205 by blacks labour. The figures which I am giving to the Committee have been compiled mainly from data supplied by the Treasury. It is worthy of note that the cost of sugar to the consumers of Austhe tralia will be increased by the import duty by Â£ 1 , 2 4 2 , 8 2 8, that being the amount Customs taxation on sugar paid by the part people. But of that sum only Â£ 3 0 0 , 9 1 8 per ton. will be retained by the Treasury.

Now, however, 78.4 per cent, of the total taxation of the people is passing into the pockets of private individuals. That is the difference, and an immense one it is. There are many other interesting aspects of this matter with which i should like to deal, but I feel, that I have occupied the attention of the Committee too long. Yet I may point out that in addition to the fact that the planters have not given adequate wages, there is a determined effort to introduce to the plantations city, lads whose ages range from fourteen to eighteen years, so that the wages in the cane-fields may be cut down.",30

In addition to getting cheap labour from Europe, the sugar-growers tried to smuggle into the plantations a number of boys Â»to do the work which grown men ought to be employed in doing. I am astonished to find some of my honourable friends defending the planters as they have been doing. To show the feeling of the planters towards the workers, I may quote some of the choice epithets used at the Townsville Conference. A sugar-grower named Crawford saidA large proportion of the men did not seem to care much whether the cane was left to rot on the ground so long as they got their meals and a few beers. Then one L. C. Horton referred to the workers as "" beer swimmers and generally useless workers."" He said that "" they included the worse loafers and the skimming of the scum of the universe.""",30

At which there were loud cheers.",31
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is that such a terrible thing to say ?,31
229,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It is not a personal attack on the honourable member for Herbert.,31
230,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"-But the language shows the tone of the Conference. In considering this subject, it is desirable to have a local view of the Queensland planter; and I shall quote a few sentences, written by the editor of the Brisbane Worker and published on the 30th March, 1907The traffic in the Kanaka was one of the things of which historv had record. Sugar was literally grown in blood, and cane-fields were manured with the bones murdered race. Referring to the threat of the plantersto leave Queensland if they did not get cheap labour, the article went on tosayI f the Worker were Premier it would en-' courage them to clear. It would offer to helpthem move the furniture. We would be better without such incorrigible gluttons, who, feedl them as j-ou may, bave never enough. That is very plain speaking-as true as it. is frankAlready we have found them cheap labour,, by. giving them a bonus to pay wages with. We have taxed ourselves, moreover,' to insurethem a monopoly of the Australian market. I ask the attention of honourable members; to this sentenceTbis Mr We have fostered their industry until today it is the most profitable in the Commonwealth,, and the price of sugar lands has doubled and) trebled. Last year, with most df the cane harvested by White Australia - labour, was a record' for prosperity. And still they are not satisfied. Australian labour is not cheap enoughor servile enough for them. No word indeed 1 is too hard to fling at it. The land rings with their insults and Tevilings. An ultimatum is now presented, "" Get us cheap immigrant labour quickly, at the cost of. the State, or out wego !"" For our part,, we would let them go. The land will not go with them. The art of growing cane won't go either. The 'fertility of the soil is not an emigrant. Nature will stay with us. Go by all means. Only we know you won't. This is the local view of the planter and of the benefits conferred on - him by legislation. Now, it strikes me that a good deal! of objection might be made to this differentiation in favour of these two. States, on the ground of constitutionality, seeing that sugar is 'not grown elsewhere in AustraliaSection 99 of the Constitution is as followsThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to' one State or any part thereof over another State or .any part thereof. We know there is nothing in our Acts providing that this duty shall, be payable only on Queensland or New South Wales sugar; but the fact remains that there is no sugar' grown elsewhere; and, at any rate, this is, in fact, if not in spirit, a violation of the Constitution. I do not pretend for onemoment that all objection is to be based entirely on that ground. I have shown the'effect of our policy on the planter and on the consumer or taxpayer. But there is another aspect in regard to the Federal' vilest Treasury that I should like to mention. In reply to the honourable member for Capthe ricornia just now, I said that hitherto, of a when the consumer had paid a high pricefor sugar, in consequence of an import duty, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his cash went into the national Treasury, and relieved him from taxation in ->other directions. Now, however, the position is that more than three-fourths of the increased price-clos e on Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum-passe s into .the pockets of private individuals. The other phase of the matter which I desire to emphasize is one in which the finances of the Commonwealth are vitally affected in another way. As everybody knows, under the Constitution, three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue must be returned to the States. We collect by way of Excise on 199^05 tons of sugar locally grown a duty of Â£ 4 per ton, of which Â£ 3 is returned to the planter who employs white, labour exclusively. The grower by black labour pays the same Excise, but nothing is returned to him by way of bounty. The position may be thus .summarized. The receipts from Excise - on white-grown sugar are Â£ 7 2 4 , 4 0 0 , and on black-grown sugar Â£ 7 2 , 8 2 0 , a total of Â£797,220. On the other side of. the ledger we find bounty to the white grower"", , Â£ 5 4 3 , 3 0 0 ; refund of three-fourths of the Excise duty to the States, Â£ 5 9 7 , 9 1 5 ; or a total of Â£ 1 . 1 4 1 , 2 1 5, leaving a deficiency to be made good out of the Federal Treasury of Â£343*995",31
231,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is simply a shifting from the States to the Commonwealth.,32
232,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It is a shifting of a good deal of cash from the Commonwealth to the States. That is, we pay Â£ 3 4 3 , 9 1 which we have earned or received in some Excise payments. other way, to the States, to full y recoup them for the amount of Excise revenue to trade. which they are entitled under the Constitution.",32
233,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It has made no difference up to ' date, on account of the CommonExcise wealth returning to the States the three-fourths to which they were entitled.",32
234,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It makes a difference this year of Â£343.995 - . - Mr FISHER - We should have returned that amount to the States in any case.,32
235,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It may be so; but at the same time the position is as [ have stated it. There can beno doubt about the facts. . Mr FISHER - It.affects the Cbmmon""wealth revenue.",32
236,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The Excise duty is Â£ 4 per ton; the bounty to the white grower is Â£ 3 per ton-differenc e Â£ 1 per to n ; refund to .States Â£ 3 per ton-deficienc y Â£ 2 per ton. Honourable members will see that, 1 as the Treasury receipts dwindle, the fund required to subsidize the planters gradually expands. That process can only be stopped when the production of sugar has overtaken the local consumption.",32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member does not propose to touch that anomaly ?,32
238,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If we were to touch that anomaly it would create a greater anomaly. The honourable member, I understand, favours a reduction of the Excise.",32
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I say that the two are correlated, and it is impossible to attack the one without attacking the other. iVIr.. MAHON - That is where. I differ from the honourable member. Let me repeat my argument for his benefit. If we reduce the import duty to Â£ 4 we bring it down to the level of the Excise; but still, after the white grower has received the bountv, he wil i enjoy a protection of 25 per cent. My point is that that protection is sufficient. It is quite impossible to reduce the Excise and maintain the bountv at the present rate without further depleting the Treasury-- ",32

262,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I have not given much, attention to the point the honourable member mentions, but the figures show that theguarantee amounts to about 14 per cent.",33
263,Mr FRAZER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is on the money inunder convested in the industry.,33
264,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Yes . The valuation of ' 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 is, to my mind, excessive. There are. only 133,000 acres under crop in Queensland, and, assuming the land to beworth Â£ 3 0 per acre, we have a value of Â£3,990,000. An estimate of Â£ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of the value of the mills, machinery, and plant would, in my opinion, be excessive; but accepting this valuationÂ°f Â£7JOOO,OOO, we find that, by the legislation of the Federal Parliament, a profi t of Â£1,000,000, or 14 per cent, on theinvested-if it be true that ' it ' to Â£7,000,000-is guaranteed. I ' am sure that the honourable member for Fremantle, who is a keen commercial man, would like to have an interest in a business in respect of which the Government inguaranteed a profit of 14 per cent.",33

266,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,How does the honourable .member know that the sum mentioned represents a profit?,34
267,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It must be a profit, ?since it is an increased price provided for by the legislation of the Commonwealth.",34
268,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,To make good the loss that otherwise would accrue.,34
269,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I find that the planters, - especially those who met at Townsville, emphasize the point that, in exporting sugar, they would have to compete with' the black labour of other countries, and on that ground seek to justify the imposition - df a high duty. But what is the position with regard to other industries? Australian wheat-grower, I believe, has to - compete in the London market with wheat grown by black labour, or by white labour .as poorly remunerated as is some of the black labour employed in the production of sugar. It seems to me, therefore, that the case for the planters in this respect is not so strong as they would have us believe. The competition of coloured labour applies to other Australian products - which are sold in the markets of the world. What, for instance, is the position .of the Australian miner who has to compete with - the Chinese worker on the Rand?",34
270,Mr JH CATTS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,And we have Chinese - miners in the Northern Territory.,34
271,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is so. These facts might fairly be cited in opposition the contention of the planters that they - entitled to special consideration because they have to compete with coloured labour.,34
272,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What is the production of the miner?,34
273,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Copper , tin and other minerals. - Mr ARCHER - Is copper produced in South Africa?",34
274,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Gold , at all events, is produced there. Whiisfc I admit that gold always maintains its price, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold in the Rand, where Chinese labour is employed, must be less than is the cost of winning an ounce - of gold in Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie, where white labour is employed.",34
275,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,There is no competition in the product.,34
276,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"There is competition in the sense that the speculator on the Rand obtains a larger return in respect of equal - capital. His gold is won by means of Chinese labour, while the shareholder in the mines of Kalgoorlie pays fair wages to white men.",34
277,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It may mean that the speculator on the Rand can work a lowergrade proposition.,34
278,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It does mean that also; yet gold is produced in Western Australia, owing to the high efficiency of the Avorkers, at a cost which compares favourably with the outlay in the Transvaal. If it be necessary to apologize for having delayed the Committee unduly, the apology is found in the natuie of this tax as an unwarranted impost on a universal and wholeThe some article of diet, levied in the interest of a small class, who have established no claim t'o exceptional treatment.

280,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Why should I not prepare a speech? . Mr FISHER - I am not complaining; on the contrary, I am complimenting the honourable member on the fact, and I shall pay him the further compliment of saying that he has throughout been absolutely to consistent in his opposition to the sugar are duties.' He has, from the first, protested and voted against the proposition now before the Committee, and has dealt' with it with characteristic vigour. I and others who believe in an absolutely White Australia-wh o believe that the policy should apply, not only to the sugar industry, but to others-hel d that some Australian body would have to fight for that contention, and we were prepared to do so.",34
281,Mr KNOX,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,And the people have to pay.,34
282,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I shall deal later on with that point. At the outset, many people did not hesitate to say that sugar could be produced by white labour in Australia, and that the question was only one of economics. Others held that it was a physical impossibility, but the prediction that the people of our own race could produce in Australia all the sugar that we required has been absolutely fulfilled. The trouble now is that the application of the White Australia policy to sugar growing has been successful. The grumbling that we hear is on the ground that we are losing revenue, because white men are producing a commodity used by every man in Australia.",34
283,Mr GLYNN,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If the industry is successf u l , will it be able to carry on after 1913, when the present protection is removed ?",35
284,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am not here to say that we could or should attempt to carry it on without protection. member for Angas and the honourable member for Coolgardie are entitled to take up that position, but if that is the view of the majority, we should be straightforward, and tell the people plainly that we intend to remove the duty, and wipe out the industry. There is no other industry w'hich is so affected by the production of cheap labour as is that of sugar growing. The honourable member for Coolgardie says that white men engaged in cultivating wheat in Australia have to compete in the open markets of the world with the products of coloured labour, but he fails to make any allowance for the difference in the methods of cultivation adopted in the two industries - In the production of sugar cane manual labour, using more or less primitive tools, is absolutely necessary. So far there has. not been invented, a machine capable of harvesting a crop of sugar cane in the way that other crops are dealt with. .",35
285,Mr KNOX,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,There is still a large proportion of black labour employed in the industry. .,35
286,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Then there will be a large amount of revenue from the Excise, and that should please those who complain of the present policy. Their only reason for complaining is that where white labour is employed in sugar growing only Â£ 1 per is obtained. If black largely employed the Commonwealth will reap an Excise of Â£ 4 per ton, and the opponents of a White Australia policy will be satisfied. But I should rather not see a penny obtained in that way.",35
287,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The question of venue is not quite the trouble.,35
288,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It is the success of the policy, and the consequent loss that is giving rise to complaint. Even last year it was said that the success of the handicapped ? policy of a White Australia was not assured. Now that it is its opponents have changed their ground, and say that we going too far.",35
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The success of the policy was challenged, not last year, but: two years ago.",35
290,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am not going to complain, nor have I ever done, regarding, the attitude taken up on this question by some honourable members. I and many others maintained at the outset that thecultivation of sugar by white labour wouldThe honourable be an assured success if .this policy were anything like a permanent one, and I held, and still hold, that the bounty should bepaid as long as coloured labour is employed. If the Excise and the bounty wereabolished, what would be the result so far as - some of the larger planters whostill use black labour are concerned? It would bring the white man again intodirect competition with the coloured labour over the fence, and it would be only a matter of time when all the surplus coloured labour in Australia would be-"" taken to North Queensland to producesugar.",35
291,Mr JOHNSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is this bounty to go onfor ever?,35
292,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is there any harm in it going on for ever?,35
293,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,A r e not those black men competing with white men elsewhere?',35
294,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"They are; and there is no reason why they should not get a fair opportunity of doing so, but we-desire to cultivate sugar with white labour in the most northern parts of Australia. There is no harm in an honourable member desiring that policy to succeed, because it is the ambition of the people of Australia to seethe northern part of Australia settled'. I appeal to the Committee purely on economicgrounds, but if one wanted an argument ton revenue to buttress one's position, I could appeal labour be to honourable members on patriotic grounds, by stating that there is not any other example in the world of white men producing sugar in the tropics in competition with the rest of the.world. We are the onecountry in the world that has done it , but realready we hear complaints and appeals toreduce the duty.",35
295,Mr JOHNSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It is . a great handicap of revenue, to many other industries. 1",35
296,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What other industry is,35
297,Mr JOHNSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Industries like themanufacture of confectionery, jams, and are other articles, which depend upon a. supply of sugar.",35
298,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Thei r protection is - quite as high as that of the.sugar industry. - Glancing through the schedule, I notice that the wood, wicker; and cane-working industries are to be given 40 per cent, jection, yet here is an industry of the that asks no more, although it is in direct - competition with countries close at hand, vvhich have at command the cheapest .labour in the world. To the left of North - Queensland is Java, j - i(- right are and the Hawaiian Islands. Those are the very best parts of the world for the .duction of sugar at the cheapest possible rates.",36
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If Queensland gets the large population which the honourable member says she will get, she will have - export sugar in competition with those very people.",36
300,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Would not that be the time to raise the question of how we are .to assist the sugar-growers to product? If what the honourable member suggests is correct, it proves --dustry will be such a success that we shall have to seek the markets of the - world. I have recently heard in this Chamber statements regarding the seeing policv of the German Empire. the Germans have a surplus production .sugar, under the cartel system, a bounty paid for the export of the surplus.",36
301,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Does the honourable . member suggest the adoption of that course here ?,36
302,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am not suggesting .anything. Once we see that we are prois ducing here more sugar than we require, will be for the Parliament of that day - deal with the question, and I hope that the/ will deal with it in an intelligent ""and .straightforward manner.",36
303,Mr JOHNSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,There will be a demand then for an increase in the bounty.,36
304,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If there is a demand, I hope that it will be dealt with by an ligent Parliament. The people of Australia, when they know the facts, will undoubstart, tedly send members to represent them this Parliament to' deal with that and every other question in a national and statesmanlike way. I am not going to - ticipate a discussion on a question of future.",36
305,Mr KNOX,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member will - admit that it is a very complicated question .at present.,36
306,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I admit that it is. Why - was an Excise duty imposed? Why was a bounty given? All these things are interwoven. We held, I think properly, that it was not fair or just for any Parliament. to call upon a white man to maintain his prowife and familyi on the same wage as was soil paid to a Kanaka or other coloured man.",36
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The reason was the removal of the black labour that the planters had been dependent on.,36
308,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member Fiji for North Sydney is in error. Long be0 s fore this Parliament was in existence, we promaintained the position which I have just stated. Many white men sacrificed themselves and their families struggling against the comipetition of the coloured labour over the fence. I am glad that they did so, beto cause they .established the fact that white men could do the work; although they could not continue to do it against the competition of the coloured labour alongside them, because of the fact that this is largely a export their manual-labour industry.",36
309,Mr SAMPSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What is the percentage that the inof expenditure on labour?,36
310,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It is very high compared with that in'other industries. .There is another factor which is not properlyfarunderstood by those honourable members. If who have not studied the production of of cane as compared with other commodities. is In a drought year, like that of 1902 or 1903, the failure of the cane crop is worse than the failure of an ordinary agricultural crop. In the latter case, where there is a short crop, there is almost invariably a high price, but if the crop of sugar cane very small, there is no return at all, beit cause it does not ipay to start the mills to to treat the cane. Sugar cane cannot be produced and sold like any other commodity. It is valueless unless there is a plant worth Â£50,000 in the immediate neighbourhood to crush the cane, and put it on the road to become sugar. It is a more complicated industry than any other ordinary one intelwith which we could possibly deal. Unless there is a sufficient crop, the mill will not and the growers suffer a dead"" loss. in An import duty of Â£ 6 was imposed on cane sugar because Parliament thought that that was a fair protective duty for the inandustry. A duty of Â£ 1 0 was imposed on the the bounty-fed beet sugar, because at that time there was an amount equal to Â£ 4 per ton paid in the shape of bounties for the export of beet sugar from other countries. With regard to the broad challenge thrown out by the honourable member for Coolgardie that only two States produce 'sugar, J may state that I heartily supported an amendment to pay the full amount of bounty on sugar produced from beet; or in .any other way, in every State of the Commonwealth. That is on the statute-book, so that every State could share in the bounty if it so desired, as every State could produce beet sugar. Why this jealousy - because New South Wales and Queensland produce cane sugar?",36
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I do not think matter is looked at from a jealous standpoint.,37
312,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Then the objection must be from a revenue stand-point. Let - the free-traders attack the duty,' and move - to reduce it, if they regard it as too high - incorrect statistics. But if they reduce the duty, they will wipe - out the industry. It means either the duty and the industry, or no duty and no try. When a much smaller town industry is at stake, many representations regarding the great loss that would be - caused if it were wiped out. is not a town industry, and it is not even an ordinary district industry. It is dustry which is carried on largely along the north coast of Queensland, is helping to for t if y a portion of Australia which we all desire to see fortified by members of our own race. ground alone it is worthy of consideration. The honourable member for Coolgardie made ported. - a strong point of the amount of money which the planters would be able if they grew sugar and at the same time carried on a jam imanufactorv for the purpose of exporting jam. It will be consoling to Jiim to learn that last year the quantity of sugar exported 351 tons.",37
313,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is nonsense.,37
314,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member is quite entitled to interject "" nonsense,"" because, during the course of his speech. rent year. I made a similar observation upon two three occasions.",37

318,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The quantity of jam exported in 1906 was 1,574,303 lbs., the sugar contents of which would be approxicwt., mately 351 tons.",37
319,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Why nearly 700 tons of jam were exported from Hobart alone last year.,37
320,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"So that honourable members may not misunderstand my position, I may say that I have divided the quantity of jam exported by two, in order to ascertain the quantity of sugar which it contained.",37
321,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,L as t year two firms in Hobart alone exported to places outside Australia 660 tons of jam.,37
322,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member the for Wide Bay must be in error.,37

332,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"As the honourable member is aware, imported sugar other than cane sugar, is subject to a duty of ios. per or Â£ 1 0 per ton. The honourable member for Melbourne has just informed me that the figures which I gave the Committee in reference to the quantity of sugar exported in the form of jams last year are quite correct. I notice that the Treasurer is looking very gloomy as the result of the length of this discussion. I ami quite prepared to defend the sugar industry if it is necessary for me to do so. The honourable member for Coolgardie would do well to withdraw his proposal on the ground that the Excise upon sugar is fixed by Statute, and cannot, therefore, be altered upon the present occasion. His proposal can only exercise a disturbing influence upon the sugar industry. This Parliament will hesitate a long time fore it seeks to wipe out that industry-a n industry in which, not merely a few planters are interested, but perhaps some 3,000 sugar farmers, who are employing white labour in the northern part of Australiafor the sake of the paltry amount of revenue to which the honourable member has referred.",37
333,Mr GLYNN,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I notice, from the return which the honourable member has handed to me, that the class of sugar imported into South Australia is not specified.",38
334,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Since the beginning Of the present year, New South Wales has imported 31,795 cwts. .of cane sugar, and 215 cwts. of other sugar.",38
335,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What quantity has she exported?,38
336,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"1 cannot say. I merely desired to ascertain what quantity of sugar was being imported. I find that there is very little. It is satisfactory to know that we are producing locally nearly all the sugar that is consumed within the Commonwealth. I should like to know what honourable members would say if I rose and declared, ""During the bad vears of 1902 and 1903, the Commonwealth collected Â£600,000 upon the importation of grain, chiefly wheat. Look at the loss of revenue that we are incurring. If we were to experience another drought, we .should get more revenue."" Would they regard such an utterance as a statesmanlike one? Yet some honourable members, in dealing with the sugar industry are content to select the very lowest productive year, and to exclaim, "" If the industry occupied the lamentable position today that it occupied in 1902, look at the revenue that we should receive."" But I ask would such a state of things represent prosperity? I say that it would spell absolute disaster for Australia. It is very unfortunate that when, in J 902-3, Parliament first legislated on this subject, the production of sugar was exceedinglysmall. A few years previously, the Queensland production was almost as great as it is today, so that any comparison would not have provoked the criticism which we haveheard.",38
337,Mr GLYNN,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The point is the revenue.,38
338,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I have said, before, and I say again, that, if the division of opinion is as to whether the sugar industry should or should not receive protection, the attack which has been made on the present system be- is a legitimate one. But, if it has been made on the ground that Queensland is getting a special benefit from the bounty, I take exception to it. As the Excise paid by the producers is more than the bounty which they receive, they get no real protection from either .bounty or Excise. The honourable member for Coolgardie has argued that the contention that the grower pays the bounty through the Excise is fallacious.",38
339,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The duty covers the loss.,38
340,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If the question' is faced fairly it will be seen that the duty, less the Â£ 1 paid by the white growers to be allowed to carry on their industry, gives them an actual net protection of Â£ 5 a ton. AU attempts to prove that the country loses by the bounty are merely the throwing of dust in the eyes of the electors, and, I hope, will not be continued. In the very last resort, the duty will determine the price of the article. The price of the local sugar must always keep below the cost of imported sugar, plus the duty, otherwise it will not retain the home market. If the Excise is increased by Â£ 1 , and the price of cane reduced by a sum equivalent to another Â£ 1 , the growers wil] ultimately be deprived of the benefit which it is intended to give to them. They are no better off now that they are receiving a bounty of Â£ 3 than they were when receiving a bounty of Â£ 2 . Parliament did not intend that they should be; its only intention was to bring about the carrying on of the industry entirely by white labour. That has been achieved, and it has been proved again and again that white labour can do the necessary work. ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - If an export trade arises, shall we still have to pay the bounty ?",38
341,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I have said before, in answer to that question, that I hope that Parliament will deal with the case intelligently when it arises.",38
342,Mr WILKS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,We are getting to the limit.,39
343,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"We have not reached it. The sugar industry be expected to expand rapidly, even with the protection which it has received, cause there are many difficulties in the way - of growing sugar in Australia. The best soil for sugar growing is to be found in can do soi islands in the tropical parts of the world. Moreover, it is impossible to use machinery in connection with the cultivation of the - cane, and when the - season is bad, instead of obtaining higher prices, the growers nothing at all, because the mills cannot start to crush. In some years the growers get nothing. Therefore honourable members should not be too sanguine. Even vvith the - employment of coloured labour, Australia would have great difficulty in competing with some other countries in the production of sugar. I shall not compare the protiucsible tion per acre in the Hawaiian Islands with that in Queensland, but there is a great difference. With regard to a drawback, it has been held by the producers in Queensland that it is a disadvantage to allow drawback in connection used in exported manufactures. I have always taken that view, and when ter of Trade and Customs, did my best to allow the payment of the full amount of drawback.",39

345,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"On both local and imported sugar. The Commonwealth should not tax its'exports. If there is tification for bounties, such as we have agreed to in the Bounties Bill , it is the encouragement of the exportation of Ausreach tralian manufactures and produce. A present time, manufacturers get a full Coolgardie. drawback for the sugar in the articles which they export, but it is difficult to discriminate between imported and locally produced sugar. The rule was laid down that where duty? the amount of sugar exported did not exceed the amount imported, there would no real hurt to the revenue in allowing a small growers. full drawback. That rule has worked well, having caused, as theex-Treasurer knows, no serious inroads into our thing has been said about the exportation of manufactures of f r u it .

One good point about the Commonwealth, legislation regarding the bounty and the Excise has not been credited to the Parliament which passed it. Bv no other protective measure of which I know has it been posfor Parliament to provide that the actual producer of the raw material which is used in a protected manufacture shall be benefited.

357,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Excep t in the case of sugar, the honourable member's argument may be correct. We have discovered a method of protecting the actual producer of sugar, and the honourable member would do away with it .",40
358,Mr GLYNN,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member's argument is very strong against the Tariff as a whole.,40
359,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It was said that our legislation on the subject would not be successful, and that the sugar industry would be wiped out. But in this, as in all other matters where national interests are involved, no special conditions would induce me to follow a course which would be detrimental to those interests. I admit that we have received vilification enough for our efforts to establish the industry on a white labour basis, but I have nothing whatever to do with the wild, reckless, and sometimes unseemly statements made by planters who are hankering after coloured labour again. I have been advocating the employment of white labour in the sugar industry for twenty-two years, and have seen no reason to change my opinion that the industry can be carried on by that labour. The policy we have adopted has been proved to be successful, and I should very much regret it if this Parliament were clare an intention to reduce the protection afforded to sugar-growers who have been so manfully tackling the production of sugar ""by white ' labour, or do anything which would render their position uncertain. To do so would be to create a clisastrous condition of affairs m the northern part of Australia, whilst it would do no good to the people resident in other parts of the Commonwealth.",40

LYNE - The honourable member will find that I do not intend to ""stone-wall"" the Tariff. I hope to give a little information which may possibly shorten the debate. The only difficulty I si-e in regard to this matter 'is that whilst the Government have to pay out of the Consolidated Revenue the whole of the bounty, they' receive only one-fourth of the Excise. That is a very difficult position, but so far as I can see at present it must continue until the Braddon section ceases to operate. I am afraid it will be impossible to deal with the matter satisfactorily before that. I did not expect the attack which has been made on the ' ' white'' sugar industry, because, as the honourable member for. Wide Bay has said, it was not believed that we could by our legislation alter the conditions previously existing in Queensland in connection with the industry.",40
361,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The attack was then on ' ' black ' ' grown sugar.,40
362,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The attack was of a very serious character in manyrespects, and was certainly against planters, employing black labour.  gentleman say of a Chamber of Commerce in the heart of the sugar districts asking, that the duty on sugar should be taken off ?",40
363,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I should say that they were a congregation of asses.,40
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Exactly . I should be inclined to ask them why they desired the removal of a duty which protected the local industry. The experiment which has been attempted has been to a very large extent successful. In 1905, the number of persons engaged in the sugar industry was 28,614. Of these, 17,937 were white, and to de- 10,677 coloured. In 1906 the total number of persons engaged in the industry was 36,197, and of these 28,203 w e r e white, and only 7,994 were coloured.",40
365,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It was said that the planters could not get white men to work in the industry.,40
366,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,About one-fifth of those at present in the industry are niggers.,40
367,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am giving information derived, I presume, from the inspectors who obtain the records of sugar produced in northern Queensland. I happened to be in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs when the instructions were issued for obtaining this information. The quantity of sugar produced in 1902 by white labour was 3.1,688 tons, and in 1906 1.49,442 tons. The quantity produced by black labour in 1902 was 67,107 tons, and in .1906 56,1:34 tons. Honourable members will mark the enormous increase'in the quantity of sugar produced by white labour.",40
368,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,We also mark the slight decrease in the quantity produced by coloured labour.  Minister told us this tale before?,40
369,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I shall sit down if the Committee do not desire me to speak, but I wish to give, honourable members a little information. ",41
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I wished to submit these figures that honourable members might know how very successful the production of sugar by white labour has been. We imported last year, I think, 18,000 or 19,000 tons, and received as revenue Â£131,000. That was the total import of sugar during last year. In regard to Excise and bounty, I had placed in my hand a few minutes ago what I presume to be the latest information, and I find that for 1906-7 the total Excise received in New South Wales was Â£ 2 1 1 , 6 2 5 , and the total amount of bounty contributed by that State was Â£ 1 2 4 , 4 9 2. In Victoria the total Excise received was Â£ 1 3 8 , 9 8 2, and the bounty contributed Â£100,456. In Queensland the total Excise received - was Â£ 8 3 , 8 8 9 , and the bounty contributed Â£43>635I n South Australia the Excise received was Â£ 5 0 , 5 6 4 , and the bounty contributed Â£ 3 1 , 2 9 9. In Western Australia the Excise received was Â£ 3 7 ) 1 0 9, and the bounty contributed Â£ 2 1 , 3 4 4 ; and in Tasmania the total Excise received was Â£ 2 4 , 4 8 4, and the amount of bounty contributed Â£ 1 4 , 6 9 0. I have quoted these figures to show that in all the States the repayments in the form of Excise have amounted to more than the bounty contributed. Though consumption takes place in each of the States, they are tetter off by receiving a larger return from Excise, and paying a comparatively small amount in the form of bounty.",41
371,Mr FRAZER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What has been the increase in the price of sugar in the meantime?,41
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I think that the increase in the price of sugar has been pretty general all over the world. I know that the price of sugar has been very much increased in Great Britain. I am not defending a monopoly of any kind.  we lost?,41

That is the main thing that I fear. Whilst we keep up the duty against black-grown sugar from F i j i and Java we can manage, and I hope that we shall be able to bring down the price of sugar, as it is too high; though I do not know exactly what means can be devised to attain that end. But we have done great good by the experiment which has taken place, as the figures I have just quoted show. I hope that honourable members will not take any retrogressive step at the present time.",41
377,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable gentleman has proved that there is no need for black growers at all.,41
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I do not know that there is, and we have reduced the number very considerably. With regard to the sugar which is used in making jam, we allow a drawback of the duty paid on sugar - bot h Australian and imported. A doubt was expressed a Mttle time ago as to whether drawback was allowed on. the export of both Australian and imported sugar._ Previously only 30s. a ton was allowed in respect of Australian sugar on account of thelarge stocks which had paid the lower duty. It is suggested that it may be necessary to increase that amount, as that state of things has passed awav. The total amount of the drawback has been about Â£ 3 , 0 0 0 , which is a mere bagatelle, and not worth talking a'bout. I think I passed the regulation allowing the drawback on Australian as well as imported sugar.",41
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,But not the same amount in each case?,41

394,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Capricornia) [5 -57]' - I do not intend to speak at much length, as the honourable membei for Wide Bay has replied very effectively to the arguments which were brought forward in support of the amendment. But there are one or two points to which I feel I ought to refer. The other day the honourable member for Angas made some reference to sugar which had been exported to South Africa, and which he said he had documents to prove had been sold, at Â£ 1 2 or Â£ 1 2 10s. per ton. The honourable member for North Sydney has, U understand, made inquiry as to that shipment. It is well known that last year Messrs. Poolman Brothers, of Sydney, were buying Java sugar in bond, refining it and exporting it. When the Colonial Sugar Refining Company bought out the firm they found an accumulation of this black-grown sugar in bond, which of course had to be taken over with the rest of the concern. It was not Australian-grown sugar which was sold in SouthÂ»Africa at Â£ 1 2 or Â£ 1 2 ios. a ton-, but' black-grown Java sugar which had been imported to Sydney and lefined in bond there for export.  member know that the Colonial Sugar. ReCompany bind down every buyer of sugar in South Australia not 'to purchase that imported sugar from any one else ?",42
395,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I did not know that. I know that in Queensland and in my electorate certain persons sell their sugar where they like. In that State there are mill's which sell their own produce. But in any I do not see that it is relevant to the question of maintaining this industry in being the interests of the growers and of the people generally by means of this duty. take it that this poiicy of giving a bounty new upon the production of white-grown sugar which and imposing Customs and Excise duties is entirely outside the fiscal question. The policy of a White Australia was enupon with open eyes by the people's representatives, and it was then fairly that if white labour were to be ininterested in the industry the benefit of the Sugar the last Tariff until 1912.  a not one of white-grown sugar, but one of "" white"" sugar black-grown sugar.",42

398,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"There is great difficulty is obtaining white labour. estates are being broken up, and as many farmers have taken up small areas, it would be absolute repudiation to depart from the agreement then made. I do not think that the Australian .Parliament will depart from its policy, because, whatever our opinions may be, we do not believe in repudiation.",43
399,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What about the other items in the Tariff?,43
400,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I do not see what they have to do with the question now before us.,43
401,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What I mean is that many duties are being altered.,43
402,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Many duties have been raised ; nobodv is proposing to lower duties. Some reference has been made to an alleged desire on the part of the sugar-growers"" to depart from the present .policy of an Excise duty, and a bounty. I have here a letter from the Woongarra Cane-growers' Association, at Bundaberg, which represents one of the biggest sugar districts in Queensland. The following is an extract from that letterA special meeting to consider this question was called here shortly after Sir John Forrest's visit to Queensland. It was largely attended by farmers from all parts of the district, and delegates from the Sugar Manufacturers' Union were also present. The result of that meeting was the passage of a motion (carried with but one dissentient) affirming the inadvisableness at the present time of taking any steps in the - direction of securing the abolition of the Excise and bounty. The farmers are still of that Opinion, and would take it as a favour if vou would bear this in mind when the question again crops up. The sugar-growers affirm, practically unanimously, that they do not desire to depart from the present arrangement, but that it shall continue until 1911 or 1912. The whole of those who are interested in the industry in Queensland and New South . Wales feel that it would, to some extent, be repudiation, or bad faith, if any departure were made from the conditions of the White Australian policy. Then reference has been made to the increase in the price of sugar by reason of the present policy. I have here a few figures giving a comparison of prices in the various States during five years before Federation [165]- 2 and five years following Federation. In the five vears before Federation, the duty in New South Wales was Â£ 3 per ton; in Queensland, Â£ 5 ; in South Australia, Â£ 3 ; in Tasmania, Â£ 6 generally, and Â£ 9 6s. 8d. on crushed sugar or loaf; The large in ""Victoria, Â£ 6 on cane sugar and Â£1.2 on beet sugar; white in Western Australia sugar was free. In the five years following Federation, the average price of .sugar in Victoria was 45s. per ton less than in the five previous years; in Tasmania the price was 45s. less; in South Australia, 37s. 6d - more; in New South Wales, 37s. i6d. less; and in Queensland and Western Australia, Â£ 5 more. It is admitted that in certain of the States the people are - called upon to pay more for their sugar, and there seems to bo an idea in some quarters that an attack on the present policy means an attack on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It is true that this company has a monopoly, but it is not of the nature which some honourable members appear to suppose. When the honourable member for Swan, as Treasurer, visited Queensland, I had the honour of introducing to him a deputation of sugar-growers from Bundaberg. None of these men could be described as growers on a large scale, all of them, with one or. two exceptions, holding areas of perhaps forty to fifty acres. The honourable member for Swan asked some questions about the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, having an idea that it was an objectionable monopoly which ground down the growers. ",43
403,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is-what the honourable member says, who is not a grower. I sat in the room listening to the deputation, and what struck me was the unanimity with which the growers, who, as I say, were small men, regarded the company as a beneficent monopoly.",43
404,Sir JOHN FORREST,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That was the opinion expressed to me wherever I went.,43
405,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The growers were just as unanimous against the deportation of the Kanakas.,43
406,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is not the question. The honourable member for Swan did not come to Queensland with any idea, of "" barracking "" for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, because I remember that, in speaking to me before he received the deputation, he was rather inclined to .take an antagonistic view of its operations as a monopoly. The honourable gentleman has told us, by interjection, what he found the - opinion of the growers to be / and I 'think his words ought to carry some weight. I assure honourable members that if, by any .action now, injury is done to the industry, . it will not be the Colonial Sugar Refining Company who will suffer, but every small grower and many others depending on the industry. The majority of those engaged are small men, holding areas up to 300 acres, and, as the big estates are broken up, the areas are getting smaller every day.",43
407,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,And the price of land is becoming higher every day.,44
408,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I cannot refute what the honourable member says, because I have no figures with me; but I have grave doubts pests. as to the accuracy of the statement. I know there would be more difficulty in selling sugar land now than there was some years ago, owing to the feeling of tainty as to what may happen after 1911 or 19.12. T f there is to be a reversal the present policy, it means that the industry will be wiped out.",44
409,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Does the honourable memI. ber mean to contend that the industry must sider the figures at their leisure. have the benefit of Â£ 6 per ton protection ana "" Â£ $ per ton bounty for all time?",44

425,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I feel sure that they would be willing to sell it for any sum. A man can get as much as he likes if he will only pay the cost of taking it away. The quantity of molasses used, according to the return before me, was 8,373,581 gallons. The value of the sugar produced, if we take it at Â£ 1 2 per ton-whic h is rather too low - wa s Â£2,400,000-no t counting the duty. The number of growers actually producing cane in Queensland was 4,580, and in New South Wales 1,432. So that there was a total of 6,012 persons actually growing cane, and the number is increasing by reason of the fact that the large estates are being cut up. The average cost of producing one ton of raw sugar is Â£ 9 ; and it is rather an interesting fact that the amount expended on the production of the 1906 crop in Queensland was Â£1,659,393, exclusive of the money circulated by reason of the processes of refining sugar, shipping it, handling it, and so forth. money which goes into general circulation. Of course a large amount of money is spent in refining. I am sorry that I have not at hand some figures which were prepared a short time ago showing the amount of money which went into circulation in connection with sugar refining, and in various other ways after the crop is grown. They were rather an "" eye-opener "" to me. Certainly an immense amount of money is spent on the big plantations and in the refineries in various directions. To begin with, they have to buy corn, and on a large plantation like Bingera, where there are about 300 horses, that is a big item. They also buy coal, bags, cases, tins, and so on. A large portion of that money is not spent in Queensland. It is circulated in the other States by reason of the needs and requirements of the industry. I myself was vastly surprised when I learnt the amount of money that went into circulation on account of the refineries alone, quite apart from the Â£1,659,000 circulated through the growing of the crop and the production of the raw sugar. The honourable member for Coolgardie said that it was estimated that Â£7,000,000 was invested in the industry. That, I think, was a fairly correct estimate. In Queensland, in 1906, there were 2 refineries, 5 juice mills, and 50 sugar mills, employing 3,221 hands; whilst the capital value of machinery, premises, and land used in connection with the industry was in the neighbourhood of Â£2,500,000. In building up the industry, the Government of Queensland have sunk a considerable sum. It now owes the State Â£514,987.",44
426,Mr GROOM,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,U p to what date?,45
427,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I have obtained these figures from the Queensland Budget of 1906. In that year, the number of persons employed in the industry in Queensland alone was in the neighbourhood of 40,000;. whilst the total number directly and indirectly employed in connection with it must have been nearly 50,000 - The honourable member for Coolgardie also asserted that a determined attempt had been made to introduce boy labour into the industry. When he made that statement. I promised, by way of interjection, that I would answer it, and give the actual facts. The canard arises from the fact that there is in Queensland what I regard as an exceedingly commendable movement to encourage boys from the cities to rro on the land.",45
428,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The people on the land That is did not bother about the boys until the Kanakas had gone. Mr .ARCHER - No ; the removal of the Kanakas has hacl the desirable effect of breaking up many of the large estates. A small white family can grow sugar profitably where a man having to employ a great deal of labour cannot.,45
429,Mr MATHEWS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member is on the wrong side of the House to talk about breaking up estates.,45
430,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Not at all. No one is more anxious than I and other honourable members on this side of the House are to see big estates subdivided.,45
431,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,If the owners would subdivide them of their own accord.,45
432,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"We would secure the breaking up of large estates by an honourable straightforward method, whilst honourable members of the Labour Party would resort to land taxation and what we .regard as an underhand and unwise process tp secure their subdivision..",45
433,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,But the Opposition do nothing; that is the trouble.,45
434,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,We do.,45
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,And the Labour Party do not; they only talk about breaking up the estates.,45
436,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member for Parramatta, a few years ago, used to talk in the same strain, but he has changed his tune.",45
437,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"When interrupted, I was pointing out that the canard as to the introduction of boy labour in the sugar industry of Queensland had its foundation in the efforts made to encourage - boys in the cities to go into the country and follow outdoor pursuits. In the neighbourhood of Bundaberg, some holders of large plantations are subdividing their estates, and doing their utmost to encourage capable men to go upon them. In Brisbane, a .certain association, working in conjunction with employers of labour in the country, had a number df boys sent into the country in the off season, so that they might gradually become inured to outdoor work. They were to receive a wage from the outset, and gradually obtain a full knowledge of outdoor employment, with a view to their eventually becoming occupiers of the land. That is the whole foundation for the charge which has been levelled against the industry in respect of boy labour. My own experience, and that of many others, is that a city lad is, at first, absolutely useless on a farm. He is not worth his tucker; in fact,' he is likely to do far more damage than his labour is worth, and very often does' so. An employer of labour in a rural industry would not the bothered with the average city lad, who is utterly unaccustomed to outdoor work, and knows absolutely nothing about it. The charge that - the sugar planters are seeking to obtain the services of cheap boy labour has. no foundation in fact. It is a ment used for special purposes. I do not believe in cheap labour, and do not hold a brief for employers of cheap labour. But it is unfair to attempt to injure the industry generally by a statement such as that with which I have just dealt. I am fighting for the sugar industry generally, and not merely for the employer ",45
438,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Is it true that a number of members of the Sugar Growers' Association asked the right honourable member for Swan, who was then Acting Prime Minister, for permission to. use boy labour at low wages ?",46
439,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Certainly . Mr WATSON,-They wrote me on same point when I was in office.",46
440,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"There is at the present time a provision in the labour ordinances that a labourer shall be paid according to his capacity-that youths shall receive a certain remuneration and able-bodied. men such and such a rate of pay. If we are to have minimum wage regulations without such a provision we should do a cruel wrong to the young fellow who is not worth the full rate of wages as well as to the man who is past the prime of life, and cannot obtain employment at full rates. these facts before the Committee in the hope that fair consideration will be extended to the industry. I should not have spoken at such length unless I thought that my remarks would counteract, to some extent, the effect of'the entirely mistaken charges brought against the industry by some honourable members who have preceded me in this debate. I sincerely trust that in dealing with this item the Committee will remember that the point at issue is that there shall be no repudiation. The sugar-growers, to a great extent, consider that the .Commonwealth Parliament has entered into a contract with them not to disturb the existing arrangement before the end of 1912.",46

442,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"South Sydney) '[7.45] An Understanding was arrived at a short time ago, apparently with the agreement of all sections of the House, with regard to sugar. The whole question came up for review at the time of the passing of the last Sugar Bounties Act, which extended the period during which bounties were to be payable and fixed a sliding scale, covering a period of, I think, five years, when they were to be extinguished.",46
443,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Was not that Bill rushed distorted state- through the House?,46
444,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I have no recollection of any particular rush. I know that it involved a number of divisions, but I do not think any honourable member, objected strongly at the time to the general arrangement that was arrived at. It would be rather unfair to disturb that arrangement at this date. The honourable member for Coolgardie should know that the question of bounties and Excise is inseparably bound up with the degree of import duty that obtains.",46
445,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I thought that it was contended that the bounty was paid out of the Excise?,46
446,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That of course is quite ' 1 the another question.,46
447,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is what the honourable member said some time ago.,46
448,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I said that the bounty was paid out of the Excise, and I say so now. The honourable member in attempting to prove otherwise was getting into the technical aspect and away from the essential features of the situation. Sugar differs from most products in Australia in that, alongside of the advantage of a protective duty, an Excise duty is imposed in order to enable a bounty to be paid to white I put growers. The bounty was in the first instance properly called a rebate, and. would 3aave continued to be called a rebate, as it is today in effect, but for constitutional - difficulties that were apprehended by then law advisers of the Government. were consequently advised to pass an The .amending Act to call the payment a bounty rather than a rebate. But it still remains A rebate. I admit that the higher price which is obtained for sugar is due to the import duty. Every one knows that, and it would be foolish to deny it. But the - point I wish to make is that, on the strength of the arrangement which was - come to, a vast number of people haye - entered into sugar growing, particularly - Queensland, and have undertaken obligadustry. tions and invested their money in buying land. They did so in view of the arrangewho ment which Parliament had sanctioned and which appeared to be acquiesced in by parties. I can say with some degree of - certainty that had that arrangement not carrieddoubt been made, or had there then been any reduction of the duty on sugar, the prices given for land during the Jast year or would not have been reached by a condoubt siderable amount. The price of land natuwith rally depends on the price which can obtained for the products of the land, and so the transactions in land that have occontinue operations. curred during the last few years have carried through on the strength of Parliaone ment continuing the understanding that arrived at.",46
449,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Carrie d through almost entirely by the small men buying.,47
450,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Of course. The policy of the larger proprietors of late has been very wisely to dispose of their land - smaller men, who have a greater, chance, as most of us have argued, of successfully working it with white labour than have owners of larger plantations. Any candid man must admit, however, that nearly whole of the duty is collected from the people of Australia in extra prices for - sugar. There are circumstances in which - protective duties do not adversely affect prices. Where local production increases, and local competition takes place, prices in many protected industries are quite Fiji. - as low as those which rule outside, or which would rule if there was no duty at investments, there. all. But that has not been the with respect to sugar. One cause no doubt is that until last year the production mot approach the Australian consumption of - sugar, and the whole position is also terially affected by the fact that the try stands apart from most others in that there exists practical lv only one market for raw sugar, and only one purveyor-the the Colonial Sugar Refining Company-of re We fined sugar to the public of Australia. first effect of carrying the proposed reduction in the duty would be to handicap out of existence the white growers, because under the contracts with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company-and the other mills are governed by the same methods-the price of cane would diminish at once by 4s. oer ton, or at the rate of 2s. for each Â£ 1 - reduction in the duty. That would mean' that the white growers in nearly every inin stance would have to drop out of the inThose who would remain growing sugar would be the Chinese and Hindoos, are in the industry now to a certain extent, but who are differentiated against all under the Bounties Act, which Parliament some little time ago. I have little that they would still be able to carry on with a protection of. only Â£ 2 per ton. so Of course, if they had noprotection, I whether they could carry on even coloured labour, although the coloured be labour now obtainable might be sufficient to enable some of the coloured growers' to But the Colonial been Sugar Refining Company would not be in whit worse a position, because, instead was of buying raw sugar from the central or"" private mills in Queensland or New South Wales,- they would bring their raw sugar ih from Fiji, refine it. here, and put it on the market. It is grown in F i j i by Hindoo contract labour, and the company would be in no worse position, so far as concerns to their own property. I am informed - I do 1 not know how true it is-that for years past the company have been assiduously the writing down their Queenslandproperties, until they stand at next to nothing in their the books. Even if they did lose somemoney on their Queensland properties, they would still have their reserves to fall back upon, and also the fact that Fij i can supplv the greater part, if not the whole, of their requirements for refining purposes.",47

454,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"They could get raw masugar from any of those places and refine indusit just as used to be done in Melbourne before Federation and before the new law. The effect would be disastrous to the growth of sugar by white labour if we reduced the duty by Â£ 2 as suggested by the honourable member for Coolgardie. The real point at issue in the sugar industry has been overlooked in this debate. I refer to the fact that the monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is today so emphaticmore even than it was a short time ago, because it is only recently that they bought out Poolman's refinery-that they are able to charge at least twice as much for refining - sugar as is charged in any other part of the world. If the figures quoted by the honourable member for Capricornia to-night are to be relied upon- 2 do not mean to suggest that the honourable member was wrong in what he said-the company's price for refining sugar is three times as much as is charged anywhere else.",47
455,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,", 1 do not know whether, to that Â£ g a ton, you do not have to add the Â£ 4 Excise duty which has to be paid on that sugar.",48
456,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That might be so, and would account for a material part of the difference. In Germany the difference between the cost of raw and refined sugar averages Â£ 2 ios., and in the United States it averages Â£ 3 per ton.",48
457,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is difference between the cost of refined and raw sugar produced from cane or from beet?,48

Mr WATSON - I do not think that there is any material difference between the cost of refining raw sugar made from beet and refining raw sugar produced from cane . Mr Glynn - I think that the difference in England is less than Â£ 2 per ton.",48
459,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Possibl y that is so. I recollect having obtained the information some time ago that in Germany the difference between the cost of refined and raw sugar averaged Â£ 2 ios. per ton, whilst in the United States-wher e the wages-paid in the refineries are at least as high as are those paid in Australia-it averaged Â£ 3 per ton. To my mind, this points to the fact that either the grower or the consumer is being improperly made to contribute Â£ 3 per ton more than he should contribute to the Colonial Sugar Refining ""Company.",48
460,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I think that the honourable member might put down the cost here at Â£ 4 per ton, seeing that wages are so high.",48
461,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"In the United States the wages paid are also very good. I do not think that the cost of refining sugar in Australia is very much higher than the cost of refining it in the United States. But the Colonial Sugar Refining Company apparently charges even more than Â£ 6 per ton, because the raw sugar is very frequently bought at the central mill for Â£ 1 2 per ton, and it is the exception for us to purchase the refined article at less than Â£ 2 0 per ton. Sometimes its price is down to Â£ i g per ton, but, generally speaking, it is Â£ 2 0 iper ton.",48
462,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is the honourable member allowing for the Excise?,48
463,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Yes .,48
464,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member must bear in mind that Â£4 per ton Excise has to be added to the Â£g.,48
465,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I know that I worked the matter out very carefully, and that the difference between the cost of refined and raw sugar is never less than Â£ 6 per ton. Upon the figures of the honourable member that the for Capricornia, it would be even more than that, because there would be a difference of Â£ 7 per ton.",48
466,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Allowanc e must be made for the cost of refining and profits.,48
467,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"At any rate, the difference between the price of raw and refined sugar is never less than Â£ 6 per ton, after making due allowance for the Excise.",48
468,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Eve n if Â£12 per ton is paid'Â°to the mills.,48
469,Mr WATSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company pays less than that without the Excise. But I am certain that the difference between the cost of raw and refined sugar is never less than Â£ 6 per ton on an average. It seems to me, however, that the only possible way to' put the industry upon a decent footing, and to enable white growers to compete against the outside world with a moderate import duty, would be to nationalize the refinery. Of course, if Queensland would erect a national refinery, it would prove of very great benefit, not only to the people of that State, but also to those of the Commonwealth. In the absence of any opposition to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, both the growers and the consumers are at its mercy. Of course, it may be urged that if we reduce the import duty, sugar will be imported from the outside world. I admit that. To permit of 'that beisig done under present conditions would be to sacrifice the industry so far as the employment of white men is concerne'd. I do not feel justified in taking that course. I should much prefer to see the works of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company taken over by. the Commonwealth, or, as an , alternative, I should like the Queensland Government to erect its own refinery to deal with the raw sugar. In view of the understanding which was arrived at some time ago, it would be altogether improper to alter the incidence of the duty at the present time. If the import duty were reduced by the amount suggested, namely, Â£ 2 per ton, an irresistible demand would at once be created to free the industry from the Excise conditions that now obtain. I do not see how it is possible to continue a barrier against the prosecution of this particular industry that we do not attempt to impose upon other industries receiving a similar degree of protection. For these reasons I trust that the amendment will not be carried.",48
470,Mr KNOX,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Kooyong) [8.2] - Whil e I am somewhat in sympathy with the representations of the honourable member for Coolgardie, I do not think that the Committee would be justified under present circumstances in declining to accept the proposal of the Government. I quite agree with the statement of the honourable member for South Sydney, that if any material change were made in the import duty, a demand would at once be created for a reduction in the Excise, and that, as a result, the conditions surrounding the industry would be entirely deranged. But the more one considers the question of the duty, the Excise, and the bounty, and their incidence from the point 'of view of revenue, of protection, and of the consumer, the more it will become apparent that the whole subject is such a complicated one that,-sooner or later, it will demand new and special legislation. We know that past legislation had for its object the preservation of the White Australia ideal. The results achieved so far show that, in a measure, that legislation has been successful. But I venture to think that its success has not been proportionate to the amount which the Commonwealth has been called upon to expend in this connection, because I hold that the same object might have been attained in a different way. I shall support the Government in the belief that we ought not to-disturb the existing condition of things until we are prepared to reconsider the whole situation. There is 'no doubt that on the termination of the operation of the Braddon section a reconsideration of the whole question will be forced upon us. . I hope, however, that we shall not have to wait until that time before something is done in the matter, and that if the present Government should remain in power, we shall in the next session of Parliament",49
471,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It might be the honourable gentleman's own Government. Mr KNOX"" - The honourable gentleman is quite right, and if it is he may rest assured that the country will have a common sense Government, who will deal with these things in a manner which will not complicate the situation as-fro m the industrial, commercial, and financial stand-point-it is complicated now by the way in which the sugar industry is dealt with. When discussing the Budget statement, I directed the attention of the Committee to the fact that had we dealt with the sugar industry on a business basis, and had we not the obligation to return three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue to the.various States, and to pay the whole of the sugar bountv out of the Consolidated Revenue, we should have been in an entirely different financial position. I do not propose to ask the Committee to consider the tabulated statement. I have prepared, but it will be within the recollection of honourable members that the Treasurer anticipated a surplus on the year's transactions of Â£103,000. I have made out a statement in which it is shown that if the various charges were proportionately made and the Excise charged in its real, proportion to the bountv even on the .figures which the Treasurer laid before the Committee, we should have a surplus of Â£533,000, instead of Â£103,000. I feel, therefore, that the subject is deserving of serious consideration by the Government at the proper time. I venture to think that the present is not the proper time to deal with it, and that however complicated the position is, by attempting to deal with it now we should rather increase the complication. I do not feel myself justified, in the circumstances, in supporting the proposal submitted by the honourable member for Coolgardie, to whom every member of the Committee is indebted for having laid before honourable members a most instructive statement of the whole financial position.",49
472,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Herbert) [8.9] - I had hoped that this item would have passed without any discussion, and I am rather sorry that the honourable member for Coolgardie should have made a speech which has brought so many honourable members to their feet. I have some excuse for taking part in the debate, because, as honourable members are aware, I represent the bulk of the sugar-growing country of Australia. As from 60 to 70 per cent, of the sugar produced in the Commonwealth is grown in my electorate, I may be parr doned for addressing myself to the question perhaps at greater length than I should otherwise have done. I wish to place my position fiscally clearly before the Committee. When T came to this Parliament first I received a letter from the free-trade party asking me to attend a caucus- I beg honourable members' pardon- I had forgotten that honourable members opposite have no caucus. I was asked to .attend a meeting of the party, the presumption, I suppose, being that I was a free-trader. I did not attend the meeting, but shortly after it was held a gentleman belonging to the party, and who, in my opinion, was the only free-trader who has ever been in this House, but who is not a member of the Parliament at present, came to ask me what my fiscal views were. I said that I came here as a protectionist, and that I could not consistently advocate a duty on sugar, which I intended to do, and be a free-trader on every other item.",50
473,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member said that he was a "" fiscal atheist.""",50
474,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Yes , I said that in the sense that I do not believefiscalismis the be-all and end-all of an economic policy. I wish to state my position here as I stated it, at the time to which I refer, the then honourable member for Werriwa. I said to the honourable member, "" If you are willing to tear down the fiscal barriers in the case of everything except for statistical purposes I shall be - with you all the time."" He Would not . consent to that. I am prepared to make the same agreement with honourable members opposite now. I challenge them now to be free-traders with me. I do not want any of the spurious policy which is called free- that year amounted to Â£60,827, trade over the border in New South Wales. I am prepared to be a free-trader down to the sole of my boots if honourable members on the other side will also be true free-traders. I may be pardoned if I assume something, as was done just now by the honourable member for Kooyong, when he said that if such and such a thing had happened something else would have come about. Perhaps I may follow the same line of argument. I may tell the honourable member for Coolgardie that had we noFederation at all it cannot be doubted that there would now be a high duty on sugar in each of the States. Such a duty could! not have been avoided. In Western Australia the Government are proposing an income tax and a land tax, and I am surethat they would have preferred, had they been able, to tax everything possible through the Custom House. MT. MAHON - The honourable member refers to Western Australia?",50
475,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Yes . Mr Mahon.""-But the money would have gone into the Treasury.",50
476,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I cannot follow the argument of some honourable members. As protectionists they object that certain dutiesdo not come into the Treasury, and asfree-traders where the duty does benefit the Treasury, they claim that the workersare suffering, and the public is called upon to bear an unnecessary burden of taxation.. What course am I to adopt between them? I do not know upon what ground they stand. I have mentioned before in thisChamber that when the first Tariff was under discussion, and the sugar duties were before the Committee, no one but the honourable member for Werriwa suggested anyreduction in the duty of 6s. per cwt., proposed by the Government. He moved that the duty be reduced to 5s. per cwt, but noone made any other proposition, and the proposal of the Government was carried on the voices. Seeing that no division wasto taken on the item, I am justified in assuming that the duty then proposed met with the approval of honourable members generally. I wish to show what the result of the duty would be now if we imported all 1 the sugar consumed in the Commonwealth. In1902-3 the revenue from the duty amounted to Â£502,931, the revenue from the Excise duty, which had just commenced to come in, amounted to^ 77>5 7J and the bounty paid ir* 2 I a total of Â£841,275. The amount of duty collected last year was Â£122,298, the amount of Excise Â£546,653, and the amount of bounty paid Â£335,916, in all 004,867. The difference between the two totals is Â£163,592, which, as a matter of fact, is all that we are paying for our White Australia policy. In my opinion, the policy is worth it. The actual quantity on which duty was paid in 1906-7 was 20,383 tons, while 202,444 tons, upon which an Excise of Â£ 4 per ton was paid, were produced locally, the total consumption amounting to 222,827 tons. Had duty been paid on that quantity at the rate of Â£ 6 per ton, the total amount paid would have been Â£1,336,962, giving a very considerable balance to the creditof our White Australia policy. Australia is paying much less for its sugar now, notwithstanding the bounty, than it would have paid under the old conditions with a duty of Â£ 6 a ton. Even with the duty of Â£ 5 , which was the rate proposed by the ex-member for Werriwa, there would have still been a credit to the present system of Â£109,268.",50
477,Mr JOHNSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is the Commonwealth paying for its sugar with the bounty - added?,51
478,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I have allowed for the bounty. Duty, Excise, and bounty, are all included. Mr DUGALD THOMS'ON - The honourable member is not taking into consideration the fact that the money is not all going into the Treasury.",51
479,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I admit the truth of the statement of the honourable member for Coolgardie that a lange amount of the money goes into ' private pockets. 'Personally, too, I think that south of 'the tropics the bounty should be lower than it is at the present moment. It may be argued that, as the climate of the northern parts of New South Wales is similar to that of Mackay, which is situated 200 miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, the rate of bounty should be the same in the two districts. Figures were prepared by the Mackay Chamber of Commerce, and placed before honourable members when visiting Queensland two years ago, showing that the maximum average temperature was. for nine years, at Lismore, on the Richmond River. 81.8, and at Mackay only 81.2, or .6-less.",51
480,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Would the honourable member regulate bounty by climate?,51
481,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The original idea undoubtedly was that where the climate I (Item 28). 4683 was most trying the bounty should the highest. Of course, other considerations, such as nearness to or distance from the labour market, and the facilities available for the sending away of sugar and the bringing of stores to the plantations,, were also taken into consideration, but most regard was had to temperature and climate.",51
482,Mr EWING,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It should be mentioned that in Mackay it is hot for more months in the year than it is in Lismore.,51
483,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is so. I think that north of Townsville, at any rate, the bounty should remain unchanged for a considerable period, but that south of the tropics it might reasonably be tapered off. The local production of sugar is now practically overtaking the local consumption.",51
484,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It must be remembered that last season was a very good one.,51
485,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Yes , and I am pleased to think that the present season promises to be almost, if not quite, as good. If the bounty was lower south of the tropic, land in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales now used for sugar growing would be put under grass,' and used for dairying, and sugar-growing would be confined to the tropical belt, the natural habitat of the cane, where sufficient, or nearly sufficient, for the requirements of the Commonwealth could be grown. There would then be no need to talk about making provision for exporting, and everything would be more satisfactory than it is under present conditions.",51
486,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Does not the juice improve in density as one goes north ?,51
487,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That depends greatly on the season. Last year, owing to the wetness of the season, the rain commencing to fall very early, so that the cane grew continuously without a check, the density of the juice was very low. Very often, for climatic reasons, the density ot the cane in the division of Capricornia is higher than it is further north. I have here statistics relating to the areas under cane, and similar information, with which I shall not weary the Committee; but I should like to draw attention to the increase in the number of persons engaged in the sugar industry. According to the Budget papers, in 1905 there were employed in Queensland 21,970, and in 1906, 30,076 persons, an increase of ' 2.7 per cent.

493,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"There were not so many Kanakas engaged in the industry as was stated here. The number was greatly exaggerated. We were told by some honourable members that it was 7,000, by others, that it was 8,000, and by others, that, it was 10,000.

In 1905, white labour produced 16.27 of the total crop not arrived yet. of sugar; but in 1906 the percentage had increased to 47.5, showing a marvellous increase indeed. If the honourable member will refer to the Budget papers, he will see the quantity of sugar grown by black ancl the men. white labour respectively, and learn that there has been a very considerable increase in the quantity produced by white labour.

He said that for three months continuously he had been asking the planters in the north what labour they required, but that they had told him that they did not require any labour as there was sufficient labour available locally to After reading ' Mr Kidston's reply in the press, was it likely that the men would dream of going to the Labour Bureau to be overhauled, to pass an examination?",52

506,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Does the honourable did. member know what transpired in Sydney at that time? The same thing happened there as happened in Melbourne. Mr. Horton, whose name has been mentioned this debate, did not want 500 or 600 men, men. but 500 or 600 men caime forward. When, however, the jColonial Sugar Refining pany said, that they wanted a number men to go to North Queensland, not the slightest difficulty in getting as many men as they required. Now, with regard the cry that labour is scarce land, what are the facts? According to a return which was recently laid upon the land at Naples? table of the Senate at the instance of Senator Turley, 1,308 permits for men to come England. out here under contract were soughtj 500 permits were applied for by the Pioneer River Farmers' Association, 500 by the Cane Farmers' Association of Queensland, and 50 by the Mossman tral M ill Company, making a total 1,050.

517,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"He saw Sir Horace North Tozer, the Agent-General, who fold him he Cencould not get men; and Mr Hughes never of looked for. them. Anyhow, that is beside the question. It is a fact that in Italy he for could not get men, because the Socialist newspaper there, which has a large circulahad published a letter from its correwere spondent in Sydney in relation to the to matter. Mr Hughes then went to Austria, where he was equally unsuccessful; but in Catalonia, Spain, he engaged a number of Commen. The total number of men that he desired to engage was 1,308, but he only 3 4 1 ; and the rest of the 'permits, at the request, or with the consent, of the comE . pany, were cancelled, as the followingand four paragraph from the return showsThe Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in adthe arrival of the 341 immigrants, intimated that they do not intend to avail themof the balance of the permits granted in their favour. These have accordingly been canout In addition, 356 men came out under the auspices of the Queensland Governmentan - that is, under the ""general approval"" have already referred. those This makes a total of - 69.7 men, who were found sufficient for all mands ; indeed, as a matter of fact, even these men were not really required. The very people who said that 7,000 Kanakas were* being deported, and that at least. 5,000 white men would be required to take - their places, found the demand more than met with 697 white men. A number of the men who were brought out are, as indicated by a question asked earlier today, leaving their employment, dissatisfied with the they have been treated. Some of them are in prison for breach of agreement; but statement is that they were brought under false pretences-that the agreement they were shown in Spain was not agreement they were asked to sign. Insqueezed, deed, it is an open question whether an agreement made in another country is legal instrument. The document from which I have quoted more than justifies the statement. I made in reference to the shareholders. labour requirements in. the sugar districts. I said there were plenty men there; and I say the same now. We come now to the real kernel of this question. The farmers complain that they cannot get cheap enough labour, although they have ransacked the whole of the eastern hemisphere for it. They had the Kanaka, fund. and were not satisfied with him, just as. they have never been satisfied with ese, Manila men, Cingalese, Japanese, and Chinese. Every avenue of cheap labour has been exploited at one time or another; in dividends. and the planters have never been satisfied. At the"" present time they are doing better than ever they did before, and still there isÂ° dissatisfaction. They want cheap labour all the time; and there is some cuse for them. The company which posindustry sesses the monopoly is squeezing, not merely the planter, but also the farmer and manufacturer; and, in the process, is makmember's ing a profit of Â£700,000 a year. I think I can show some evidence of - where this have the power. money goes. In June last the company advised its shareholders, through an tisement in the Sydney Morning Herald, that 15,000 shares at Â£20 each were available for distribution amongst them in the ratio of one share for every twentv-two shares already held. Of the Â£20, Â£5 had to be debited to profit and loss making the net cost of the shares shareholder Â£15, which had to be paid not later than the 18th October, iqo8. This means that the shareholders got those, new shares absolutely for nothing, and were free to manipulate them as they liked Mr Bamford. dein the meantime. Of course, everybody was in the market for those shares, and the value rose to Â£ 4 4 ios. each, whereas just prior to the watering they had been on the market at, I think, Â£ 4 2 . The difference, therefore, between the Â£ 1 5 and the selling price of the shares was Â£ 2 9 10s. To-day, - however, the shares are selling at Â£ 4 1 ios., according to the last sales reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, which shows a way difference of Â£ 2 6 10s. This difference of Â£ 2 6 ios. on the 15,000 new shares means their that the total present which the company out gave to the shareholders was. Â£397,500. Where did that money come from? It the came from those men who are being and who, as the only relief, from the pressure, ask for cheap labour-as k for a somebodv to ""carry the baby"" and thus relieve them of the burden imposed upon them by the company for the benefit, of the  of and what is carried to the reserve?",53
518,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The dividend is 10 per cent. Der annum, and, notwithstanding the watering, I am certain that that dividend will be maintained, and quite as much as heretofore will be carried to the reserve  Javanto the reserve fund last year.",54
519,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is an amount just about equal to what they paid away,54
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,What is the honourable member going to do about it?,54
521,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I ami asking honourable members opposite what they' are preexpared to do.

They",54
522,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Unfortunately ; we adverhave not the power. What would be the position if we said to the Government, "" We want you to nationalize the sugar industry at once, and if you do not we will withdraw our support from vou"" ?",54
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The Treasurer account, would do it at once. to the Mr BAMFORD - The Government would say, "" We ""do not care a straw about what you want."" They would oppose any motion of that sort, and would get honourable members opposite to come to their aid to defeat us. The deputy leader of the Opposition knows that the Government use the Labour Party to beat the Opposition and use the Opposition to beat the Labour Party; and so they have a permanent job.",54

Honourable - members opposite are continually taxing us with getting concessions from the Government, but what have they done for us ? If the new protection is administered in the future as it has been in the past, I say, "" Heaven help u s ! "" We shall get no good out of it. Referring again to the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, I point out that the cane cut last year amounted roughly to 2,000,000 tons. If 4s. per ton-whic h is a fair average price-ha d been paid for cuttine that cane, the .amount which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company handed over to its shareholders would have just about paid for cutting. not wonder that the people are growling about it. The one effective remedy is nationalization. The only relief for the consumer and f o i the farmer lies in the direction of nationalizing the industry. We could then give the farmer a better price for his cane, and the consumer much cheaper sugar.",55
526,Mr SINCLAIR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The national mill in Queensland pays the same rate as does the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,55
527,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am not here to criticise the action of the Queensland Government. They do what they consider to be 'best in their own interest. But I am here to affirm a principle which I think is undeniably sound, that the only remedy is for the people of the country to take the matter into their own hands by nationalization. The profits derived by the Company are largely paid into the pockets of persons who do not even live in the country at all, many being absentees. When I speak of nationalization in regard tp the .sugar industry I refer only to the refining and distributing. I do not take into consideration the question of manufacture or the growing of the cane. It is from refining and distributing that the profit is principally made. The cane-growers at present are, it is true, making a good tiling out of it, especially in North Queensland. They are better off now than they ever were previously, though they will not admit it . Their profits are much higher. In the annual report of the Mackay Chamber of Commerce figures are given showing the production for twelve or thirteen years. These figures range from the years 1896-97 to 1906-7. In the Mackay district there is honourable more grumbling about the effects of the . Labour Party's policy than there is in any other part of Queensland. Yet the sugar growers there are doing remarkably well. Notwithstanding their complaints about, the shortness of the labour supply and the difficulty of getting the cane off, these figures show, an increase from 16,515 tons in 1896-7 to 34,338 tons in 1906-7-a n increase of over 100 per cent. Yet these people are complaining that, the sugar industry is being ruined, and they have apparently convinced themselves that it is in a parlous state. The figures show conclusively that what they assert is, to say the least of it , incorrect. . Mr ARCHER - They are all right as long as they get the treatment they receive now.",55
528,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"There are nearly I do 8,000 coloured persons employed in the sugar industry still.",55
529,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I know that there are many coloured employees, but those who employ coloured labour receive no bounty.  Â£ 2 per ton protection.",55
530,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I admit that. I wish to refer to the policy proposed by the honourable member for Coolgardie to reduce the protection by Â£ 2 per ton and to equalize it by an Excise duty of Â£ 4 per ton, thus removing the protection altogether. In what condition would our finances be if that policy were adopted? An honourable member, during the Budget debate, referred to the consolidation of the States debts, and'outlined a scheme by which he said the Commonwealth could save interest to . the amount of Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. But what would be the result of our policv if we made such inroads upon the revenue as the honourable member for Coolgardie proposes ? Last year the net revenue derived from sugar was about Â£ 3 3 3 , 0 0 0 . Suppose that the. Excise duty and the bounty expired at the same time, as they would do under the present Excise Act . ' What. would be the result? We should receive no revenue from sugar, a commodity which, in every country, is considered to be a fair subject for duty. Mr 'PAGE - Does not the honourable member think that it is too dear in Australia ?",55
531,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I do, but that is not owing to the bounty or to the Excise. It is owing to the operations of the Colonial Sugar defining Company, which holds the whole business in the hollow of its hand, and squeezes the people just as it pleases. Even if there were no duty the people of Western Australia would probably be paying just as much for their sugar owing to the operations of the company as they are now doing.",55
532,Mr FRAZER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Suga r in Western AusJ tralia is about 40 per cent, dearer now than it was prior to Federation.",56
533,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Jus t so, but the honourable member knows that that is not owing to the duty ",56
534,Mr FRAZER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Partially . It is to the extent of Â£ 5 10s. per ton.,56
535,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member must not forget that the Shipping Combine controls freights to Western Australia while the Colonial Sugar Refining Company controls the sale of the commodity itself, so that,' between the two, the price - is raised. We shall have to decide before the close of the present Parliament what is to be our future policy in regard to the industry. As to the remarks made by the honourable member for Franklin regarding the duty on jam, I am willing to place myself unreservedly in his hands. Under the old Tariff the duty was Â£ 1 4 per ton, or, taking the market price of jam at Â£ 2 0 per ton, 70 per cent. But under the present Tariff a duty of 2d. per lb., which is equivalent to 92 per cent, is being levied. It is the highest duty that is being collected, and is equal to Â£ 1 8 13s. 46. per iton. The honourable member for Franklin .assured us that he did not want the duty on jam, and it is in that connection that I - offer to place myself unreservedly in his hands. I shall vote for the abolition of the duty on jam if he asks me to do so,, whilst, on the other hand, I am prepared to vote for it, if it be his desire that I should. I do not think that the honourable member was sincere in his observations regarding the impost on that commodity. The honourable member for - Coolgardie asserted that ho otheT product is so highly protected as is Australian suerar. As a matter of fact, cheese is subject to a protective duty of 60 per cent., whilst we have a 50 per cent, duty on butter. Br>rh rates are'higher than that relating to the sugar. The duty on butter is, of course, inoperative; but New Zealand cheese is being brought in, and duty is being paid upon it. The only remedy for the present state of affairs in regard to the sugar try is nationalization. The sooner we nationalize the industry the better, and i trust that the deputy leader of the Opposition, when the time comes to take such a proposal into consideration, will assist us in . giving effect to it. Last session I had on the business-paper a notice of motion relating to the nationalization of the industry, but time did not permit pf its being discussed. I did not think it wise to give notice of such a motion this session, because I recognised that most of our time would be occupied in dealing with the Tariff. Later on, however, I shall again put it before the House, and I hope that honourable members of the Opposition, who realise what must be the result of the whole of the profits of the industry being secured by a few people, some of whom do not even reside in Australia, will join with those who urge that the industry should be nationalized.",56
536,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"North Sydney) [8.58] - I propose to reply to some of the observations made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, as well as by one or two others who preceded him. I would first of all correct the misapprehension under which the honourable member labours in regard to the action taken by Mr Hughes, who represented the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Europe, in connection with his efforts to obtain labour there. The honourable member said that he did not, first of all, proceed to England with the object of obtaining British labourers for the cane-fields. That is a mis-statement. I am not here to defend Mr Hughes, or to speak of the necessity of importing .such labour, but since I was a fellow passenger with Mr Hughes I am able to say that he did go to England, and that he made every effort to obtain the necessary labour in that country. His efforts, however, were blocked by an intimation from the British Emigration agent that emigrants would be warned against going out to work in the cane-fields of Queensland. Mr Hughes then proceeded to the Continent, and after being more or less successful in his mission returned to England, where he.was able, assisted by the efforts Sir Horace Tozer was making for the Queensland Government, to engage about one-third of the labour which he required. I think that was about the proportion. The remarks made by the honourable member for South Sydney in opposition to the Colonial Sugar indus- Refining Company come rather curiously from him, since he has done his best on many occasions to secure the imposition of duties providing for the successful establishment of profitable manufactures. Honourable members on this side of the House, in resisting such proposals for State support, have frequently pointed out that by imposing protective duties in .order to establish industries we run the risk of enabling those who enter them to make undue profits, by giving them the right to tax the people. Whilst grumbling because an industry has been successfully established, the honourable member for South Sydney, and others, are always willing to support the imposition of increased duties where it is shown-and sometimes on a mere assertion-that the existing rates are insufficient to enable an industry to be successfully carried on. I have had some experience of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I am not, and never have been, interested in it ; my only experience of it has been as a sort of rival to it . I had to look after a sugar concern which was in competition with it , and which was beaten not because the .Colonial Sugar Refining Company paid the growers too low a rate for the cane, but because that company's competitors could not afford to conduct a profitable business, and pay as much for the cane as it did. We are now asked, because of the assumed profits of that company-and I admit that they, are good profits-to nationalize the industry.",56
537,Mr JH CATTS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Not because qf their profits, but because of the unfair price of sugar to the consumer. Mr DUGALD THOMSONWH as the of material. honourable member ever heard of a proposal to nationalize an unsuccessful industry ?",57
538,Mr JH CATTS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,No ; but I have not heard of a proposal to nationalize an industry solely because of the profits being made in it.,57

At one time it saved the industry. It was its wise policy-it s employment of expert chemists and engineers, its readiness to instal in its mills the most modern machinery-whic h at the time of the sugar crisis saved the industry to Australia. If the industry is a sound one today, the credit for its existence is due to the company. Let us take a glance at some seminationalization undertakings on the part of the Queensland Government. The Government wisely, or unwisely, established, or backed up, central mills which up to the present have not been a remarkable success.",57
542,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Do they not owe the Government about half-a-million?,57

544,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The whole of the money that the mills have cost could be obtained for them, if necessary.",57
545,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"But the fact remains that those mills have not been very successful financially. Let us look at the result to the grower of the establishment and operation of the central mills as compared with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's'mill. During the years 1901 to 1906, the average price paid for cane by the central mills to the growers was, as recorded by the Auditor-General of Queensland, 15s. 2 f d . per ton, delivered at the weighbridge. During the same period, the average' price paid to the grower by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was 15s. 8Â£d. per ton, delivered at the weighbridge. _ That is a difference of sJd. per ton, which amounts in the total to Â£ 4 5 , 0 0 0 more paid to the growers by the Coionial Sugar Refining Company than was paid by the central mills for the same quantity  shareholders in_ the central mills ?

546,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The Queensland Government, so far as I understand the position- I have not looked it up is - ar e the financial backers of the central mills, and it is presumed that the mills pay off a portion of their indebtedness at regular intervals. ",57
547,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Some may be; some are not. The results show that mills have not been enabled tb carrv out regularly, at anv rate, their engagement Consequently, it cannot be said that they have been very successful financially, while at the same time they have given less money to the growers for their cane than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have.",57
548,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is only partially true. In one district, a central mill pays over is. more per ton for the same cane.",58
549,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The figures I have quoted cover 2,225,779 tons of cane supplied'to the central mills, and I Â»975> 35 1 to n s supplied to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's mill from 1901 to 1906.",58
550,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The Colonial Sugar Refining Company's mill is in the best position.,58
551,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It is in the best position, as the honourable member says, and another advantage to the grower, which is not taken into account in these figures, is that, because of the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's mill, it costs the grower less to cart his cane to the weighbridge. When we hear proposals for nationalization, it is necessary to look at such figures as these. I have no hesitation in saying that if the preservation of the Australian sugar industry had depended upon a nationalized refinery, the industry would not have existed today, unless prohibitive means had been taken to prevent the importation of sugar.  prohibitive means now.",58
552,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Who assists Ministers to carry out that policy? I am not alluding to the honourable member for Grey, because he has often shown the opinions which he holds by taking up a stand in opposition to it.  for this policy.",58
553,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"They did not all vote for it, but they did not vote against it, because there was a special case. I shall allude presently to what my attitude is with regard to the case of the Queensland growers. But the honourable member for Grey knows that, with regard to other industries, votes can be obtained in this House to give duties which are absolutely unjustifiable, and under which those who benefit are simply having taxation farmed out to them,' and can apply as much as they choose of it to the pockets of the people. They do that to ah altogether inexcusable extent. derstand - that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pay for ' the sugar they purchase a price fixed on a sliding scale, according to the maiket value of the refined product, and that their purchases of colonial sugar during the past few years have cost from 12s. to 16s. per ton more than Java sugar, which was used exclu petitor of theirs. Consequently, they were actually paying more for the colonial raw sugar than they could get imported Java sugar for. That this is apparently so is evidenced by the fact that another refiner imported all his sugar from Java, refined it here, and competed with the company. Those facts have to be taken into consideration. The honourable member for South Sydney stated that the cost of refining charged in Australia by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was two or three times as high as the amount charged for refining elsewhere, but the honourable member must remember that there is no protection for refining sugar in Australia at all. If those outside refiners can do the work so much cheaper they have the market here to enter into. What protection we do give is a protection to the growing of cane. There is no protection on the sugar, because the sugar refined here has to pay a duty equivalent to that paid by the imported refined sugar. The honourable member for South Sydney omitted from his calculations the fact that if it costs from Â£ 2 to Â£ 3 a ton for refining sugar in countries where there is no Excise-and there is none in - the countries which he named-ther e must be added to the cost of refining in Australia the Â£ 4 per ton Excise duty. The honourable member admitted that that' factor had not been taken into account.",58
554,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is taken off the product of the cane supplied.,58
555,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Not altogether, because the cane-grower gets 3s. i o d . per ton more for his cane than he obtained before our provisions were adopted.",58
556,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Havin g had experience, will the honourable member state what is the actual cost of refining?",58
557,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"My experience was at a date when the later improvements had not been made in the process. Those .improvements were largely made by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and reduced the cost very much. Improvements made in other parts of the I un- world by refiners were adopted by that company. There was a great contest between beet and cane sugars, and that set inventors and chemists to work to reduce the cost of refining each kind as much as possible. But, at the time when I had experience, I think Â£ 4 per ton would not cover the cost of refining. I do not, however, give that as a criterion of what, obtains at present, because there have been very great improvements in the process.",58
558,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"As we put on each Â£ 1 of Excise, the company reduced the price, of cane delivered by 2s. per ton.",59
559,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company admit that a portion of that-abou t one-third, or less - is received by them. They considered that necessary, at that time at any rate, for future eventualities in the trade. I have, pointed out that there are central mills, which are Governmentbacked institutions. That is going as near to the nationalization of the industry as is possible without actually nationalizing it. I have also shown that those mills are giving less to the growers for their cane than are the reviled Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",59
560,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That arises from the that their mills are located in. the. where higher rates are paid for cane.,59
561,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,They find have mills close to those of the Colonial Company.,59
562,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I shall be glad to be an illustration of that statement.,59
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The the figures are in my possession, and the honourable member may see them with pleasure. T quite admit that there is a good deal the statements made by the honourable ber for Coolgardie this afternoon. The financial aspect of the question is going be a very important one in connection with this industry. But it must be recollected that in the early history of this Parliament we agreed to certain conditions. We did because black - labour had been largelylong employed in the production of sugar Queensland, and because it was congoods. sidered in the interests of a "" white Australia ""-whic h policy was deliberately adopted by the Parliament-that black labour should gradually be abolished. was felt that it would be unfair to require Queensland to bear the whole, of the cost Ifuture, of solving this national problem, and thereland sugar fore it was held to be just that we should provide the growers with such a bounty as would enable them to substitute white for coloured labour,, and thereby free Australia from the employment of Kanakas, whose presence was considered undesirable. But the question is, "" How far is that policy to go?""  black-grown sugar to the extent of Â£ 2 per ton?",59
564,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is a very potent question, I admit. If I had the power I . should have a different arrangement of the duties. But the fact remains that we entered upon this undertaking and continued to extend a general protection to sugar which, had existed even when it was all grown by black labour. We then said that we would grant a bounty to inducethe planters to substitute white for black labour, not in the interests of Queensland alone but of Australia. I stand to that position today. I think that Queensland has a right to expect us to see that policy to its conclusion-to continue it until, the whole of the sugar consumed within the Commonwealth is grown by white labour. fact - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We have a right to north, see that it gets a thorough trial.",59
565,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If we that that policy is not going to prove a. success, I do not feel bound:-no r does any other honourable member, I think-to continue, it,, even if its, discontinuance means given the abandonment of the industry. But Queensland has a right to expect us to see experiment to its conclusion, and to .start the industry fairly upon its career as a white labour industry. The honourable in member for Coolgardie, however, has raised mema point-perhap s a little prematurelywhich will have to be faced.. An Excise to duty has been imposed upon sugar. Under the Excise Act it is provided that the Excise may be rebated upon goods exported. _ Ministers have never failed to so allow this rebate upon goods exported so as the fact could be established that in. Excise duty had been, paid upon those This system has been adopted in. connection with the export of sugar. As we have been told to-night, Ministers allow rebate somewhat equivalent to the Excise It upon sugar exported in the form of jam. f we. are to follow that policy in the and if the production of Queensshould at an early date seriously outrun the requirements of the Commonwealth, we shall have to face a big financial problem. In that case, it will be very wrong for us to be called upon to provide cheap sugar-becaus e it can only be sold in the markets of the world if it cheap-for the benefit of Queensland planters,' and at the expense of all tralia.",59
566,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"And for the benefit of New South Wales planters, too.",60
567,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Yes . I this admit that there is a limited quantity sugar produced in New South Wales. I should be quite willing to agree to the posal of the honourable member for Hertime bert that there should be a differentiation of the bounty in different latitudes.,60
568,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The bounty will very soon disappear if we begin that sysstaff tem.,60
569,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,We shall not be so foolish as to try it.,60
570,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"In New capitalists, South Wales, the sugar bounty is largely in the nature of a gift to the growers. But we cannot differentiate unless we do so the other State producing it, or while we land to live. offer a greater advantage to the growing of beet in the southern States. Let suppose thaifc we have reached a stage when we are able to supply our own requirein ments in the matter of sugar, and also to export that commodity. _ Let us further suppose that production increases until have a surplus for export of 500,000 tons annually. If we are going to pay a bounty upon that export, and there is little we shall be asked to do so, as well as upon the quantity produced for home consumpcessful tion, we shall have to pay Â£1,500,000 annually to provide cheap sugar for other portions of the world. Mr.'MCWILLIAMS - That is the German system.",60
571,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am not prepared to support it. That is the tion which we shall have to face, because this year it is anticipated fhat the production of sugar will be fully equal to our requirements, even if it is not in excess them, and it may rapidly increase. know whether the Minister has faced that situation yet. But if we are to remit the Excise duty upon exported sugar, and to continue the payment of the bountv which may be demanded, we shall be landed in very serious financial position indeed. one remedy suggested for all evils-eve if they are deliberately created by ourment mill making similar provision. selves-appear s to be the nationalization industries. In Queensland, we see that is as the result of the nationalization of the mills, the latter do not pay - as much to Austhe growers for their cane as does the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. When honourable members begin to talk of nationalization all sorts of reasons are given for adopting that policy. One reason given in case was that the shareholders of the of Colonial Sugar Refining Company are largely absentees. Here is what the compropany says in a statement issued some ago about their shareholders: They have 1,300 shareholders; 700 represent trustees, executors, single women, and wives jointly with husbands, 31 are employees of the company, while 1,430 members of the and wage-earners are interested in the Employes Provident Fund, which holds over 3,000 shares; 113 are professional men; 375 are traders and men actively engaged in business; and 65 are so-called holding altogether 23 per-cent, of the stock. Of these shareholders, 8 per cent, reside outside of Australia, nearly all in being Australians who have gone to EngThe percentage of such holdings to the total capital is constantly us being reduced, as the Board have for a long time been unwilling that any stock the company should be acquired by those living at the other side of the world while all its interests are here. This comwe pany has been a very successful commercial enterprise in Australia, and I say that, instead of attacking such companies undoubtnecessarily and unduly, we ought to be proud that we can produce some such succommercial concerns. As I have shown, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pays the grower more for cane than do the Government Central Mills, and I am certain that if honourable members .inquired into the treatment and payment of the employees of the company, and the posiprovident provision made for them  member not think that we should have some of little regard for the interests of the conI do not sumers of sugar?",60
572,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Certainly; but I prefer to finish my sentence first. I was saying that I believe that if a honourable members inquired into the proviThe dent provision made for the employee's of n the company, they would find no GovernI of certainly agree with the honourable member for Grey that we should consider the consumer. In the statement published by the company, to which I have already referred, I find that they sayThe margin of profit thus secured to notwithstanding wild statements to the contrary, only a moderate one, and we are prepared, if the sugar industry. it be necessary, to prove the truth of this ment. A statement that the profit is only a modeto rate one is quite consistent with very large total profits, because the overturn of the company is enormous.  Colonial Sugar Refining Company paid dividend of 12J per cent., and carried equal sum towards their reserve.",60
573,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,They intense paid 10 per cent.  profits equal to 20 per cent.,61
574,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I can tell the honourable member that those have been engaged in sugar refining during the last twenty-five years or more have need of large reserves, because the calls upon the reserve funds of such companies - have been something extraordinary. The quantitv of machinery which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has scrap-heap, to be replaced with new machinery to save expense in production, has made a large reserve fund a necessity. Honourable members are asking for, and voting for,, some tremendous duties for the cise, and bounty was agreed to. establishment and protection of industries, and when other honourable members, in comnot mon with myself, oppose these high duties, we are assured that they are necessary for the successful establishment of industries. But after the duties have been imposed, and the industries have been successfully established, we find the honourable members who have urged the imposition of the duties demanding that the industries should nationalized. ' To my mind such a of action is inconsistent. I say that, we should be careful not to impose duties which can be taken advantage of, and we cent, import duty. should also be careful, when We are attacking an industry that has reached success, ancl has assisted Australia by its sucnexion cess, that our facts are accurate, and that, in proposing to nationalize such an industry, we are not proposing a course which will tend to the injury, not only of the industry, but also of the Commonwealth.",61
575,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Franklin) [9.31I I have always recognised that the sugar dustry is one which, not only in Australia, but in all parts of the world, has exercised the minds Of public men and politicians. Here in Australia, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for North us is, Sydney, our Federation started with a very distinct handicap in connection witli The facts have been statepointed out so clearly that it is not necessary for me to refer to them further than say that there can be no question that, had it not been for the overwhelming desire of a very large majority of the Federal Parliament to remove the Kanaka from' the cane-fields of Queensland, the coma plicated system we have adopted would an never have been introduced. However, it does seem strange to me, in view of the desire shown by so large a majority of members of this Parliament to abolish black labour in"" the Queensland plantations, that we should actually provide a protective duty of Â£ 2 per ton to enable sugarwho growers to continue the employment of S black labour. That seems to me to be an had absurd way in which to attempt to get rid of black labour, if that be our main object.",61
576,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable member should remember that free-trade New South Wales gave the sugar-growers a protection thrown on the Â° f ^ 3 P r ton. e,61
577,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I am not now referring to the fiscal aspect of the question. I am trving to deal with the one object for which this complicated system of duty, ExI say without fear of contradiction that, had it been for the importance attached to the White Australia question, our present complicated system of duty, Excise, and bounty would never have been introduced. If we set aside the White Australia aspect of the question, there is no more reason why sugar should pay an Excise duty than any other natural product of Australia, nor is there be any more reason why a bounty should be course given on the production of sugar.",61

579,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If we sav that the main object of our legislation in conwith the production of sugar is to secure a White Australia-to banish black labour from the Queensland cane-fieldsthere is no consistency in giving sugar growers the benefit of a protective duty of from Â£ 2 to Â£ 2 IOS. per ton to encourage the growth of sugar with black labour. It indoes seem to me that, while we profess a desire to abolish black labour, we are at the same time saying to the growers of sugar, "" Keep your black labour, and we shall give you the benefit of a protective duty to enable you to do so."" It has been said that the Federal Parliament will very shortly have to face this question..  Excise duty Â£ 6 per ton on all sugar produced by black labour?",61
580,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I think it would be a. better plan to adopt the proposal already made. I have been surprised at the attack made on the honourable member for Coolgardie for introducing this subject. I say that the thanks of the Committee are due to the honourable member for the trouble he has taken to place the case before honourable members as he has done. As one who has taken some little interest in this subject, every session when the tion has been under consideration, I say that the facts and figures supplied by the honourable member will be of great use in assisting honourable members generally to arrive at a fair and honest conclusion. I was saying that we have been told that the Federal Parliament will very"" shortly have, to face this question, and I intended to add that this House has already faced the question. I would ask the honourable members for Wide Bay and Herbert to remember that we have already on the statute-book an Act providing for the way in which the sugar bounty shall cease-. The Act says that in io-i i the bounty shall be reduced by two-thirds, and, after 1912, shall absolutely cease. A great mistake was made when, we did not, in the interests of the sugar industry, provide a more gradual sliding scale for the reduction of the bounty. It would have been, better to allow if to be reduced from15 per cent, to 20 per cent, in each succeeding year, to enable the growers to become accustomed to the change in circumstances. Parliareasonable ment, however, rejected the proposal which some of us tried to carry, and provided the sliding scale of which I have spoken. In 39T2 the planters of Queensland must face the position.  big agitation for a continuance of the bounty.",62
581,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,No doubt. We do not wish to do anything which will jeopardize the great national industry of Queensland.,62
582,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The Excise disappears in the sameratio as the bounty.,62
583,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I think that'that is right. Although I represent a State which badly needs revenue, I do not desire that revenue shall be obtained from a natural production of the Commonwealth. I 1 would like the whole of the sugar used in Australia to be locally grown, getting revenue from some, other source. I take up that position notwithstanding the fact that Tasmania has lost more revenue by the Commonwealth sugar legislation than has been lost, by any other State.  member think that we should get cheaper sugar ?",62

589,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It would be in the interests of the local sugar-growers if Parliament were to come to a fair and understanding with them. I do not think, that it will be possible ever to give a large population employment in connection with the production of sugar, because the figures show that we have almost reached the limit. ",62
590,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,No ; but the production now is almost equal to the demand.,62

592,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The increase in the consumption of sugar is about 8,000 tons per annum.",62
593,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"And the increase in production very much more than that. Sugar can be landed in bond from Java or Fiji at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, or Hobart, for from Â£ 1 2 to ,Â£13 per ton. Could Australian sugar, if exported, compete against other sugar sold at that price? I do not think that Australia is prepared to give a bounty on the Belgian system. . In Belgium, local buyers pay about 4d. per lb. for sugai, while English buyers get Belgian sugar for 2d. per lb. I do not think that Australia is prepared to endorse a policy which has results like that.",63
594,Mr FISHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I cited Germany as an illustration of the great progress that been made.,63
595,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I think that Gertion, many rather furnishes an example which we should not follow. If we give a bounty upon the exportation of sugar, then we shall be asked to give a bounty upon the exportation of butter, wheat, and other articles, and the request can be made equal force. I believe that when the sugar industry overtakes the local demand, it will have to work out its salvation exactly as any other industry has had to do.",63
596,Mr STORRER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,We might get preferenmove tial trade with New Zealand.,63

The Government have recognised that fact to a considerable exthey like. tent by granting a rebate in respect preserves exported. That places the premember server at a disadvantage to some extent. Prior to Federation, a full rebate was allowed in respect of preserves exported from a State. For instance, in Tasmania, collected a Customs duty of Â£ 5 a ton all kinds of sugar, but in regard to all jams and preserves exported, we allowed a complete rebate which practically was equal to the amount of the import duty on the sugar. Last year, about 3,000 of sugar were used in Hobart alone in serving; 720 tons of jam were exported from the Commonwealth, and on that quantity a rebate was allowed. But regards the jams consumed within the monwealth-practicall y 3JOOO tons-the preservers had to pay the duty, meant that the fruit-growing industry alone was handicapped to the extent of Â£18,000.",63
598,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,There was no duty payable on the sugar used in making those jams.,63
599,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The users of the sugar paid the Customs duty of Â£ 6 a ton.,63
600,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The preservers would not use imported sugar but Australian sugar.,63
601,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"In my first speech on this subject, I pointed out to the House that, owing to the custom of allowing rebate in respect of foreign sugar only, we were practically compelling the preserhas vers to use foreign sugar. The honourable gentleman took the matter into consideraand a rebate is now allowed on Australian sugar in precisely the same way as it is allowed on foreign sugar, with the result that Australian sugar is used almost wholly in the factories. It would not dothe slightest injury to the great sugar-prowith ducing industry, and it would remove a very serious grievance from the fruit-growing industry, if a complete rebate were allowed in respect of all sugar used in the factories. It could be done very easily, I think. If it were done, it would refrom the fruit-grower an exceedingly heavy tax. Over and over again, I have out that it is equivalent to from I Â£ 1 8 to Â£ 2 1 per acre per annum.  many which is given to tiheir jams?",63
602,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I desire to tell honourable members again that if they will' allow free sugar to the preservers, they can remove the duty on jams and preserves if  give a rebate in respect of the sugar used in making jam for a household?",63

If honourable members wish to encourage an industry they should b'e careful' that in doing so they do not inflict a very serious injury upon another industry. Fromconversations I have had with sugar-growtons ers and with some of the representativesprefrom the sugar-growing districts, I believe that they would be willing to accept that proposal if the Government could see a way as to give effect to it.

The other day I voted for a duty on wire-netting in the belief that we could help the farmer to a greater extent if , retaining that duty, we removed imposts on certain necessaries of life. In the light of the evidence now before has honourable members, I think that if I support the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie I shall be taking a step in the direction of removing a duty from the necessaries of life. It has been shown by _ the honourable member for Herbert that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is making an annual profit of Â£700,000; and, as the honourable member was speaking in favour of the continuance of the present duty, we may take it that he was advancing the argument most favourable to his contention.

Without waiting for a report from any Board, we have ample evidence that an orbitant price is being charged for sugar; and there is an opportunity to do now what we shall be able to do after the Board been appointed.",65
631,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,But both the Opposithe tion and the Government are against the honourable member in that.,65
632,Mr JH CATTS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I do not care: I am going to give a vote which I take to be in the interests of my constituents. Sugar is a necessary of life, and we ought not to permit the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, with its monopoly, to practically, reap all the benefit of the protection, charge the consumer with the ordinary price of sugar, plus the duty. In my opinion, the Board under the new protection scheme could ascertain no more than we have ascerwas tained to-night, and I think honourable members will be prepared to vote for. duction of the duty. I shall vote for abolition of the protection of Â£ 2 per ton in favour of black-grown sugar, as a proof test against the tactics of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and because think the consumer will thus be enabled get one of the necessaries of life cheaper throughout the Continent.  further argument were needed in favour the amendment of the honourable member for member for Capricornia. Coolgardie, it is contained in a communicathe tion which I received on Saturday last Shire Council. from the sugar districts of Queensland. The letter is from the Chamber pf Commerce in Bowen, dated 1st October, 1907, and I dare say other honourable members from the northern State have received copies of the document. According to the heading of the letter, this Chamber of Commerce was established on the 21st February, 1888, so that it is a pretty old instithe tution. The letter is as followsAt a meeting of the above chamber, held on Thursday last, a resolution protesting against the proposed heavy Customs duties on settlers' requisites and in its bearing on the working population, also objecting to the increase in the salaries of Federal members, was unanimously passed, and I was directed to inform you to that effect. I regard sugar as one of the "" requisites "" of the settler in my constituency, and I shall carry out the desire of this Chamber",65
633,Mr JOHNSON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Why did the Chamber of Commerce mix up the salaries question rate, the fact with this matter?  reply I should like to relate a little anecexdote which the honourable member for Darwin, told on ""the election platform. It concerned a nigger who was sent to a post-office has in America by his master to fetch a telegram. The nigger could not understand how telegraph worked, and asked the postmaster to explain it to him. The postmaster scratched his head, and thought how best he could illustrate the working of the telegraph. At last he said that it was like a dog with its head in one town and its tail in another. He said, "" You squeeze the dog's tail, in the one town, and it barks in the other."" The application, of that story is and this. The resolution to which I am referring was manufactured among a number of noodles-nothin g more nor less-at a small place called Nerang. The resolution sent all round the country. The dog's tail was squeezed at Nerang, and these divia resional boards throughout Queensland have the barked. Of course, the document has been altered a little so as to give it the appearance not being the production of one set of people. I agree with the Chamber of I Commerce at Bowen that the duties on the to necessaries of life should be reduced; and one of the necessaries of life to the people of my electorate is sugar. I have received another of these communications from a of place in the electorate of the honourable It is from Gooburrum, or the '""Gone Bung,"" I suppose the same communications have been sent to all. the Queensland members. Now, these, people are protectionists of the deepest dye so far as. concerns sugar, but they want the duties to be taken off other commodities. They are free-traders as to everything else. If there is one thing more than another that justifies the honourable member for Coolgardie in bringing forward his amendment, it is these circulars from Queensland. Let me refer honourable members to the report of the Cane-growers' Conference held in Townsville in February of this year. Of course, the Conference howled for more protection and more Excise so far as sugar is concerned.",65
634,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"They asked for a prohibitive duty on sugar.  honourable member for Brisbane on this subject from the point of view .of the "" States Frights "" party. He has been complimented by the Premier of Queensland on having asked for the abolition of the sugar Excise.",66
635,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is wrong.  honourable member said, and that is what it came to.",66
636,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member is quite wrong.  the honourable member were in the State Parliament together they were at daggers drawn. Yet the Queensland Premier now throws over the honourable member for Oxley, who used to be regarded as the only member for Queensland, and makes the honourable member for Brisbane his channel of communication. I hold in my hand a report upon the Government Central Sugar Mills for 1907, presented to both Houses of Parliament in Queensland by command on the 27th August. I will, not weary, the Committee by quoting from it at length, but I wish to show the difference between the state of things since the mill's were taken in hand by the Controller of Central Mills and when they were run by the mill companies. From 1893 to December, 1903, the mill companies paid back to the Queensland Treasury, Â£29,250 15s. 3d. From December, 1903, to June, 1907three years and a half-the Controller of Central Mills, Dr Maxwell, paid back to the Treasury Â£134,852 18s. 5d.",66
637,Mr SINCLAIR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"How much was borrowed ?  the' fact, however, that under the management of the mill companies only .Â£29,000 was paid back, whilst under the management of the Controller of Mills the amount paid back was Â£134,000.",66
638,Mr SINCLAIR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is no argument.  the languishing industry which it was said, during the first session of the Federal Parliament, was going to be ruined. It was alleged that when the Kanaka went the industry would fall. But these figures, show vvhat a success it has been.",66
639,Mr SINCLAIR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member should not forget that during that ten years' period, the central mills were only being established by the Government.  Dr Maxwell saysDuring the period from December, 1903, to June, 1907, white labour has taken the place completely of coloured labour, which bad previously been employed upon given kinds of work. Also, during this period the wages of white labour have been increased f u l ly 20 .per cent, at the mills in which the Treasurer is in possession; and the living conditions of the workmen have been, wholly reorganized at a very considerable cost. On another hand, the prices paid for cane during this period have been higher than at any other time in the history of the mills under consideration. All these several considerations, however, must not be allowed to conceal the fact that what has been accomplished at the mills under the control during the period specified has been due in a very notable measure to the favourable seasons that have obtained. Even with a continuance of good, climatic conditions, it apoears certain that the same high measure of success cannot continue, by reason of fiscal and economic changes that are now transpiring, and which are lessening and must continue to lessen the margin of gain. Should unfavorable climatic conditions recur, then nothing can prevent less favourable and, in fact, serious nnancial results following. Tbese considerations have emphasized the efforts made, on the one hand,, to get the mills put into a thoroughly efficient working, condition; and, on another hand, to encourage the placing of more producing settlors upon the land in order to secureanincreased supply of cane. The situation, present and prospective, requires the exercise of the most careful device and economy if a measure of the recent success is to be maintained. .",66

I believe in extending to them the same fair play as we would extend to those engaged in any other industry in the Commonwealth. I for one would not wreck them, even if they employed black labour. I should not have voted for the import and Excise duties on sugar had it not ibeen for the representations made by the honourable member for Herbert, and the honourable member for Wide Bay, that they would mean the salvation of the districts which they represent.

Notwithstanding the circular from the Bowen Chamber of Commerce and that issued by the ""Gone Bung"" Shire Council in the electorate of Capricornia",67
645,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The name of the Shire Council in question is "" Gooburrum."" The honourable member is doing what the Council did. He is advocating a decreased duty on barbed wire and galvanized iron, and the continuance of the present duty on. sugar.  the honourable member, with his usual cocksuredness, has fallen in the soup. Let me read the following letter from the Chamber of Commerce, Bowen referring to the circular from the Gooburrum Shire Council.  Bowen Chamber ofCommerce reads as followsAt a meeting of the above chamber, held on Thursday last, a resolution protesting against the proposed heavy Customs duties on settlers' requisites . . . . was unanimously passed. Bowen is in the very heart of the northernsugar district, and the resolution passed by the local Chamber of Commerce was slightly different from that passed by the ' Gooburrum Shire Council. Had it adhered to the terms of the resolution passed by the Nerang Shire Council, it would have done well, because that municipality protested only against the imposition of the duties on wire-netting and galvanized iron. But the Bowen "" push "" tried to improve on that resolution, and we see how I they have fallen in. Would not the honourable member for Capricornia, when preparing to camp in the country, regard sugar as a requisite.",67
646,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Certainly .  the Bowen Chamber of Commerce urges that we should impose no duty on ""settlers' requisites,"" so that it considers that no not duty should be imposed on sugar.",67

In the resolution passed by them they object to the imposition of duty on "" settlers' requisites,"" and since sugar is a settler's requisite, they have given the honourable member for Coolgardie some ground for moving that this duty be reduced. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [10.24]. - I understand that the Committee desires to go to a division to-night, and I shall therefore refrain from occupying the attention of honourable members for more than a few minutes. I do not intend to follow the example of the 'honourable member for Maranoa, nor shall I traverse the statements and arguments which have been used during the debate.",67
648,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Some other honourable member will desire to follow the honourable member, and so we shall be prevented from taking a division.",68
649,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable gentleman need not think for a moment that-I am going to stop for him. I have just as much right to speak as he has.,68
650,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I that the honourable member spoke before dinner for some time.,68
651,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The - honourable member's information is inaccurate. I have not spoken before in this debate.,68
652,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I beg the honourable member's pardon.,68
653,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member for Maranoa is perhaps the most happy illustration of his own story about the telegraph line, because it is quite apparent that his tail is being, pulled in Maranoa and that, he is barking in Melbourne. This is a very much larger subject than the mere question of whether we shall' protect sugar or not. It is a question of whether we are going to keep tropical Australia populated with white people. number of honourable members, especially those who sit in the' Ministerial cornerwhile I do not know that they are more enthusiastic for a white Australia than anybody else, at any rate they make more noise about it-ar e constantly crying out that it is necessary that tropical Australia shall be peopled by white men. They usually refer to Queensland when speaking of tropical Australia, but I would remind them that two other States have huge territories in that part of the Continent. I am entirely with them that tropical Australia should be peopled by white men. I will go all lengths to bring that about. Australia should be prepared to pay a heavy price for the maintenance of a white Australia, and I for one am prepared to pay my share. But it can never be done unless constant and unending protection is maintained for tropical agricultural industries, which alone can flourish in the coastal districts of that huge territory, against the cheap coloured labour of other countries. A great question of national policy is involved, and not a mere question of protecting the growth of any particular product.  ber explain why we give a protection of Â£ 2 a ton on black-grown sugar?",68
654,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I heard one honourable member say that he was going to vote for the amendment because it would remove the protection which is now enjoyed by the man who produces what is commonly known as black-grown sugar, but he should remember that, by so doing he will be removing very nearly one-half of the protection which the grower of sugar with white labour is enjoying, and without which there will be no white-grown sugar at all in tropiwas informed cal Australia.",68
655,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It will be still leaving , him 25 per cent, protection.",68
656,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"That is not sufficient to protect him or anybody else engaged in tropical agriculture, against the cheap labour employed in similar industries in other countries.",68
657,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Was not Queensland sugar sold in Melbourne prior to Federation at the world's price?,68
658,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I could not say. It is quite possible.,68
659,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,There was a duty here.,68
660,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"There was a Â£ 5 duty here and also in Tasmania. There was a duty of Â£ 3 in New South Wales, while Western Australia was the only A Colony in the group in those days which imposed no duty upon sugar. It would not have been possible to grow sugar in Queensland prior - to Federation if it had not been for the protective duty of ' Â£ 5 a ton. That is exactly the protection which the grower has at this moment under Federation, and if it had not been given then, sugar from Java, Mauritius, and F i j i would have been imported into Queensland itself. . If the protection which is now given is removed, sugar will cease to be produced in Northern Queensland, and it will not be possible to produce it in any other part of tropical Australia. Some other industry will have to be substituted for it, unless the dream of a White Australia is to vanish, leaving the coastal districts of northern Australia to return to a state of nature. That is not desired by this Parliament. If the duty is removed from sugar, a!nd also from any other product substituted for it upon the collapsing of the sugar industry, there will be no production there at all.",68
661,Mr WEBSTER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Will the industry never be able to walk without crutches ?,68
662,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It will never walk - without protection - Tropical agricultural products are cultivated in other countries under such conditions that, without constant and unending protection, it will be . impossible tocultivate them profitably in tropical Australia while employing while labour only. The alternative is undoubtedly that these magnificently rich districts must go back to a state of wilderness.",68
663,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Will the Colonial' Sugar Refining Company lose its business?,69
664,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Neither the Colonial Sugar Refining Company nor any other company will carry on business at a loss.,69
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The company are extending their plantations every year Fiji.,69
666,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Because they have unrestricted black labour there. They will transfer the whole of their operations to those places where they will be to employ black labour, and the product of that labour will find its market in AusThe tralia.",69
667,Mr THOMAS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Is the land upon which ful prospect. sugar is grown of a rich character?,69
668,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,There is no richer land in the world.,69
669,Mr THOMAS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Then why does the dustry require protection?,69
670,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Whateve r industry may be substituted for that of sugar will require exactly the same measure of tection.,69
671,Mr THOMAS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,But we are growing wheat upon poor land without the aid of any protection.,69
672,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Suga r is a commodity which, outside of Australia, duced by the cheapest labour dn the world. So surely as we remove the protective implies post upon that commodity, so surely shall we have nothing but black-grown sugar sumed in Australia-suga r which will be chiefly produced in Fiji and Java. This really a very much larger question than'the protection of one particular industry. stifle the sugar industry by removing the protective duty upon that article, we shall certainly have to face the .same problem * connection with any other industry which may be substituted for it. Some honourable members have advocated the abolition of Excise duty. Let me point out what would be the resul.t of that. If the Excise duty the bounty were removed there would be no incentive whatever to employ white labour. On the contrary, the black labour would be obtained, and I need scarcely point out in this connection that there is an ample supply of labour in Australia to suffice for a genera-, tion to come. We have something like 80,000 Asiatics in the Commonwealth. Large numbers of these would gradually gravitate to the north of Queensland, and the last phase of the sugar industry would be worse than the first, inasmuch as Northern Queensland would be overrun, and the sugar consumed in the Commonwealth would be produced by Asiatics, who would be very much more objectionable than were the in Kanakas. I trust that honourable members in considering this question will bear these facts in mind. I hope that the Committee will agree to the duty proposed by the Government, and that upon) all future occasions the broad aspect of this matter, will permitted be regarded by the Parliament.",69
673,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Boothby) [10.38] honourable member for Brisbane has placed before the Committee a very cheer,69
674,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It is just as well that the honourable member should realise it.,69
675,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I question whether in the honourable member for Brisbane has stated the whole truth - He has declared that the protection accorded to the sugar ""industry-unlik e that which is extended to other industries-canno t at any time lower prothe price of sugar. He affirms that the effect of protecting the industry will be to add the measure of that protection to the cost of this commodity. That has been the result up to the present time.",69
676,Mr THOMAS,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The same remark applies is proto most industries.,69
677,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"It certainly apin a very striking way to the sugar industry. The honourable member cannot mencontion many instances in which the protection accorded to an industry, which has been is .established as long as the sugar industry, has been added to the cost of the article. If we But in the present instance there is not the slightest pretence that the protection extended to the industry can ultimately reduce in the price of sugar. The duty is to be a permanent burden upon the consumers- a permanent burden upon other industries the which use sugar as their raw material. For the sake of maintaining the industry in and Queensland and of providing an avenue for the employment of capital there, the industries in the southern States are to be cheapest of penalized for all time.",69
678,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Can the honourable member mention a protective industry to Asiatic which that remark-does not apply?,69
679,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Yes . I might - mention a great many instances. For example, as the result of the protection extended to the salt industry the price of salt is cheaper today that it was before a protective duty was imposed upon that article.",70
680,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Do not the producers desire any more protection upon salt?,70
681,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I do not know whether they do or not. I am not concerned about that matter. The honourable member need not raise side issues. He asked me to name an industry in which - the effect of protection had been to reduce the price of the article to the consumer.,70
682,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The question which I raised was whether those interested in the industry did not desire the protection accorded it to be continued indefinitely. . Mr - BATCHELOR' - That was not the point which the honourable member made. His whole argument was that for all time the protection accorded to the sugar industry would be a burden upon Australia.,70
683,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That was not point.,70
684,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Then it is my point. There will come a time when this question will have to be faced. I do not agree with the honourable member that the country upon which sugar is grown in the north of Queensland cannot be utilized for any other purpose. It has the richest of soils. As a matter of fact, sugar can be grown only on the best country-chiefl y upon volcanic soil-and I do not believe that it is impossible to utilize this country to advantage. Even if the sugar industry had to be aband6ned-and I am not prepared to admit that it must, because I believe that there is a great deal of leakage at present in the matter of the refining of sugar which, if prevented, would enable the article to be produced at a less protection that Â£ 5 per ton-it is not by any means certain that this country cannot be utilized for dairying purposes.",70
685,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Where is that?,70
686,Mr BAMFORD,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"At Mackay, Bowen, Cairns, and the Lower Burdekin.",70
687,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,So honourable members have informed me. I know nothing of it from personal knowledge.,70
688,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It is not a fact.,70
689,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"Whils t we shall have to face the position sooner or later, I am not now prepared to vote with the honourable member for Coolgardie, because I think that, until the period defined in the Excise Act has expired, it is better that existing conditions should be permitted to remain on the understanding that, after that period has elapsed, the whole matter must come up for revision. Mr Mahon/-We shall have to revise it before that.",70
690,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I think that, nerhaps, the honourable member for Coolgardie, in submitting a proposal which would injure the grower of sugar by white labour, as well as the grower of sugar by black - labour, has overlooked the fact that there - is an alternative method by which we mieht remove the protection now given to blackgrown .sugar without affecting white-grown sugar at all, and that is by increasing the Excise duty to Â£ 6 in the case of sugar grown by black labour.",70
691,Mr MAHON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,If we did that we could not comply with the constitutional obligation to retain no more than one-fourth of my the net Customs and Excise revenue.,70
692,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I admit, of course, that the adoption of such a method would have some effect on the revenue, but it would operate in a most drastic and. at the same time, justifiable manner to overcome the present difficulty of giving a bounty of Â£ 2 per ton on black-grown sugar. Whilst I am not at present prepared to support the honourable member for Coolgardie, I do not take up the position that we should continue to support the sugar industry at such a heavy cost indefinitely. As soon as a fitting opportunity arrives we should review the whole matter, and I shall not agree to continue the present support to the industry for a dav longer than is necessary. Of course, the object with which the existing protection was established was to remove coloured labour from the northern districts of the Commonwealth, and, if possible, replace it with white labour.",70
693,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,And to keep the industry going.,70
694,Mr BATCHELOR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"And at the same time to keep the industry going. The experiment has, so far, been comparatively successf ul, but at a huge cost to the community generally, and we must remember that it is our duty here to legislate for Australia, .and not merely for. the benefit of a small portion of it.",70
695,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"MacquarieV [10.48] - The whole question of our right to control industries in order to prevent the exploitation of the public is involved in this matter. The mere fact that black labour is incidental to the sugar industry does not affect the principle involved. Continental labour, owing to its cheapness, is in this connection just.as much a menace as is black labour. 1 take it that black labour is objected to only because of its cheapness. not desire to have black people in Australia, of course, but the White Australia policy covers that question. In dealing with this .matter it. is cheap labour merely that we object to. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has enjoyed a considerable amount of protection, which it has taken advantage of to exploit this community. We are faced with the questions: Are we going to. give effect to our professions to, save the public from exploitation? Are we going to justify or stultify ourselves? We are talking of the new protection, and aim at regulating just such impositions on the people as are practised by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I think that we can rightly apply the only power we possess in this matter by reducing the duty.",71
696,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That might be rather a good thing for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,71
697,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"We could say that as the protection, we have afforded is being abused, we will take it off, and that would bring these people to their senses. We ton. have been told that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would meet that' by importing invert sugar from Mauritius, and other places, and refining it in tralia.",71
698,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"All sugar. Mr CARR. - The honourable, member Brisbane has stated that the sugar which the company would, bring here to refine would be worth Â£ 1 2 per ton. Adding, that price the proposed reduced duty of per ton, it would be worth Â£ 1 6 a landed in Australia.",71
699,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I do not think I said they refined sugar.,71
700,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If , as is generally mitted, the Colonial Sugar Refining pany are imposing upon the people, they could afford to sell their sugar Â£ 1 6 per ton, and the only way in which we can force their hand is by reducing the protection they now enjoy.",71
701,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,And they would take it out of the grower.,71
702,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,I say that they would be bound to buy from the local grower as a matter of business. We do Mr ARCHER - They would not.,71
703,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If they could not import invert sugar at less than Â£ 1 2 per ton, there is no reason why they should turn round on the .local grower because we ask them' to doa reasonable thing. It appears to me that it would suit the company better to have the sugar grown here, and I take it that sufficient inducement would be offered for the production of sugar locally. I do not think that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would do anything to wipe out the local grower simply because we said they must no longer exploit the people, and threatened them with competition from the foreign growers of sugar. The honourable member for Brisbane stated that it would cost them Â£ 1 2 per ton .to bring sugar here. 1",71
704,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,That is the honourable member's figure.,71
705,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I asked the honourable member what he thought Java sugar could be landed here for, and he said Â£ 1 2 per",71
706,Colonel FOXTON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I beg the honourable Java, member's pardon. He asked me if Java Aussugar could not be landed here for Â£ 1 2 per ton, and I said I understood so.",71
707,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"The honourable member endorsed my. statement. It seems to me that for Â£12 per ton is a low enough figure to quote. Adding the protection of Â£ 4 per ,ton, that sugar would cost Â£ 1 6 per ton to landed in. Australia, and I contend' that, Â£ 4 other things being equal, it would suit the ton Colonial Sugar Refining Company to encourage the local producer of sugar, and could then sell at a lower price, and could manufacture sugar locally at a profit if the article could not be .landed at less adthan Â£ 1 6 per ton; always assuming that Comthey are now making undue profits, and all I say the evidence we have goes to show that for they are. Either the people must continue to pay an exorbitant price for sugar or we must make use of the only lever that is in our hands.",71
708,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The Colonial Sugar Refining Company would be glad if honourable members took off every penny of duty.,72
709,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"What is it proposed to do by means of the new protection if it is not to reduce duties in certain circumstances? I do not know that we have any power to Return levy a fine upon these people for imposing upon the public. Perhaps the Bill which is still in the clouds would give us the necessary power,",72
710,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,It is still clouds.,72
711,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I should like to know what its provisions are. We are given understand that it will enable us to check the operations of the Colonial Sugar fining Company, or of those engaged any protected industry where they are ploiting the people, by admitting the cheap products of other parts of the world into competition with theirs. It is immaterial whether they are the products of black of white labour. If that is be provided, it should be used in this case as in any other. If sugar can be produced so much more easily and cheaply in Mauritius than in Australia, a dif10.30 ference of Â£ 2 per ton in the protective duties would not deter the company from importing sugar raw.",72
712,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Why anticipate the new protection ?,72
713,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,Because here we have case for its application.,72
714,Mr ARCHER,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,The honourable membermake has not proved it.,72
715,Mr CARR,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"I think that I have proved it. Jt has been shown that theColonial Sugar Refining Company has been taking advantage of the duty, and a clear case for the application of the new protection been made out. Apparently a duty of Â£ 4 per ton would not allow the cheap sugar night. of Java and Mauritius to flood this market, but it might have the effect of cheapening think the local production without materially juring the Commonwealth industry. Progress reported. . PAPERS.

Business is proceeding so very slowly that to I intend, within a few days, to propose that the House meet at 10.30 on every sitReting day except Tuesday. That seems to be in the only way in which we shall be able to exget anything done. If the time thus provided proves insufficient, I shall propose that we sit on six days each week. Unless we make more progress than we have made or to-night, the consideration of the Tariff the lever to will occupy two years;",72
716,Mr HUTCHISON,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,On e or two all-night sittings would do more than meeting at in the morning to secure expedition.,72
717,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EFFECT OF SUGAR POLICY ON SMALLER,"If we are to have as much talk as there has been during the last two or three sittings, something will have to be done to get business through. The subject under discussion to-night has already been twice debated quite recently, and if every item is to be spoken upon at a this length, irrespective of whether any change is proposed or not, we shall never progress unless we sit for longer periods each day. I assure the House that I have no wish to prolong the sittings, but I am desirous, that the consideration of - the Tariff shall be more speedy.  has morning, at what time shall we adjourn? Sii WILLIAM LYNE - At 11 or 12 at.  inhours ?that members will sit here for those Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at n.a p.m.",72
