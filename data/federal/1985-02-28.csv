2,Mr SPEAKER,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this Bill and Orders of the Day Nos 2 and 3, namely, the Trust Recoupment Bill 1985 and the Trust Recoupment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1985.",13
3,Mr CADMAN,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"ln addressing this legislation yesterday, I was drawing attention to the problems which the interpretation of the Commissioner of Taxation had placed on numerous consultants and small business people when the Commissioner chose in Ruling No. IT 2121 to impose penalties and taxes on family companies and trusts in relation to income from personal exertion. This is a most deplorable matter. It has caused widespread disruption, great concern and real damage to many small business people throughout Australia. People who originally entered into arrangements whereby they could go out and seek work from a range of clients are being seriously disadvantaged. The Commissioner has levied taxes, fines and back payments to the extent, in many instances, of $40,000 or $50,000, which he has gathered through a process under existing legislation to convince people they should meet assessments dated before 28 May 1981. Mr Robert Brown-You know that the honest ones have nothing to worry about.",13
4,Mr CADMAN,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"That is not true; that· is far from the truth. If the Government believes that, if that is the Government's attitude, it will be condemned by every small businessman in Australia. What the Government is doing in fact is, by a back door process, forcing the unionisation, of many areas which ,are not currently unionised. It is denying access and opportunity for people of capacity, drive and good intentions for themselves their families and the people of Australia. Many of those individuals have been denied the opportunity of regular employment. They have been told by their former employers that the only way in which they will be able to maintain a regular income is by becoming a consultant or subcontractor to that company. They have.no option; either they lose their job or they become a consultant. In many instances they have gladly taken up the opportunity of becoming a subcontractor or a consultant, because it gives them a range of opportunities that had not existed for them previously. BILL 1985] However, the Commissioner, in his interpretSecond Reading ation of the Federal Court of Australia case of Tupicoff v. Commissioner of Taxation, has said that he is not concerned about the details of the arrangement. As long as that person has changed the process of his arrangement with the company which is providing the funds, that person will be regarded as an employee. That is a deplorable approach and a deplorable decision, and it is supported by the Australian Labor Party. It is a dreadful thing that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will not apply his mind and his skills to these matters, instead of'trying to trick the Caucus into accepting a larger number of banks than it thought Australia was going to get. He should apply his mind to the real needs of the nation, such as the, clearing up of the present tax fiasco. It has 'created great concern and disruption all around Australia because nobody knows what tax will be applied next. The Treasurer should apply his mind also to this decision made by the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner has said some incredible things in his ruling. He has said things about employers and employees that show a naivety, a lack of understanding, about working relationships within the community. Many i'ndividuals, having been forced to change their relationship with a company, have established bona fide private companies and have set up offices within their homes. They do not have the capital to rent professional offices and hire secretaries, or'in every instance to buy equipment, but they have established a proper process of business. Where will it stop? Already the Commissioner has said that he is chasing people involved ih industries such as mining, computers, insurance, motor vehicles, real estate and entertainment. There is not much more left. My friends in the building industry and in other important industries indicate that they will be next in line. The man on the tools and the man and his mate whQ go out with a skill will need to be very cautious in the way in which they approach their work from now on. The writing is qn the wall; the Commissioner will pursue people who are bona fide, legitimate small business people. These people have taken the big plunge, they have made the decision to go out on their ownsometimes coercion can work in more than one way because the Commissioner has taken the extraordinary step of writing to major contractors asking for details of their arrangements with subcontractors and consultants. It is extraordinary for the Commissioner to write to a head contractor and say: 'I want the details of your arrangements with your sub-contractors'. The Commissioner has a responsibility to gain tax from those who owe it, but he should be dealing directly with the individuals about whom he is concerned rather than the people who employ them or use their services. My friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) nods his head in agreement. I know that we agree in this area. I must convince members of the Australian Labor Party that they are cruelling every opportunity for small business and the fear that has been put through the whole of the small business community cannot be underestimated. This matter involves 250,000 taxpayers. That is a large number, and in many instances they and their families are being asked to pay as a result of assessment fines and charges which they cannot meet: They have no resources to meet those fines and charges. The Commissioner, in paragraph 6 of his findings, said: There are said to be advantages to the former in these types of arrangements in as much as there is no longer any obligation to take out workers compensation insurance and to make tax instalment deductions. In some cases the former employer has also sought to escape the obligations for providing recreation and sick leave. Why should any former employer be obliged to make those payments? It is not. an emp-oyer­ employee relationship; it is one between a contractor and a consultant. It involves a prime organisation. Surely the Taxation Commissioner must go back and look at these issues.' That is. a completely fallacious and biased statement written by somebody who does not support the concept of small business and individual effort. It is written by somebody who believes that there should be only major. employers and major up.ions, and if people do not fit into that category then they are not wanted in Australia. The steps taken by the Commissioner will destroy much of the sm·all business incentive in Australia. This is a dreadful thing t1:lat the CommiSSioner has done. One has only to read his ruling to see what a biased approach has been taken in this matter. Again the Commissioner has chosen a very unusual type of case on which to base his ruling. He has chosen the case of Tupicoff v. the Commissioner of Taxation in the Federal Court of Australia, a case in which all the factors of previous employment were carried on by an individual who called himself a consultant. I would like the Commissioner, the Treasurer and.honourable members opposite to investigate very clearly the circumstances of people within their electorates, within Australia, to establish how many actually reflect this Tupicoff arrangement. I suggest that there are very few indeed. Let me give but two instances. One of the draftsmen employed by a major Australian company was told that his employment was not further required and that his employment would cease at the end of one week's notice. In the same discussion he was offered the oppbrtunity of becoming a consultant the following Monday. He was told that he would be sacked if he did not become a consultant. He was.sacked anyway but he had the option of becoming a consultant or getting no work. He took up the consultancy and for almost one year worked consistently and solely as a sub-contractor for that employer. Gradually, as an individual, he picked up a diversity of work from other clients. It takes time to establish a business. It takes time to get out and make one's name known in the market place. It takes time to build up the contracts and to become an effective consultant operator for a draftsman, a real estate agent or somebody in the automobile industry. employer That is what the Commissioner has failed to recognise. In this instance the Commissioner is saying that the draftsman that I alP speaking of will be regarded as an employee fo'r a portion of his period of self-employment and, for the other period he will be considered to be self-employed. Imagine anything so ridiculous. A man who is establishing his own business for the first time is told-",13

10,Mr SPEAKER,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,15
11,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"As interesting and as divergent as the tax-exempt views previously expressed by the honourable two member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) might be, status they have nothing to do with the matter before the House. I am becoming increasingly offended at the intrusion into parliamentary business of matters which are totally irrelevant and which not in any way conform or relate to the business with which we are trying to deal. The legislation before the House, the three trust recoupment tax Bills, are a repeat of Bills .that were brought in year. They have a long history and I think tory is worth recounting. If we go back to November 1979 we see that the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), brought in some amendments to the was taxation Act to deal with trust accounts. The bates of that day are worth reading. On 14 November 1979 the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) had some comments to make regarding this matter and he pointed out that the then Treasurer had opened up a wide way area of tax avoidance by the removal of gift tax. He quoted from the then Treasurer's answer question on notice as follows: Abolition of gift duty is not seen as relevant to tax evasion practices which are, of course, illegal. To the extent that abolition resulted in the lifting of a constraint on the transfer of capital assets, it has, to a degree, tax avoidance that much less complicated and costly. In other words, the then Treasurer, by his own actions, had made tax avoidance easier, less expensive and open to more people. That really is the crux of the whole question. In 1979 the honourable member for Gellibrand said to the then Government: 'What you have done is opened up a Pandora's box'. The then Treasurer said: 'Yes, we have. It had made tax avoidance easier, less complicated and, therefore, more likely to happen'. In the same speech, the honourable member for Gellibrand said that the government of the day had brought in a train of anomalies which left open wide scope for tax avoidance. At that point the then Treasurer nodded his head, which was noted. In 1979 the Treasurer of the day said: 'Yes, I agree, we have brought in a lot of problems and of course we are addressing them'. So he addressed the problems in 1979 and he addressed them again in 1981, which followed a statement he had made in 1980. The amendments in 1981 related quite specifically to trust stripping schemes. Legislation had initially been enacted in 1979 and further legislation was enacted in 1981 to try to address the problem. In May 1981 the then Treasurer brought in legislation retrospective to 24 June 1980. He stated: In a statement on 24 June 1980, I foreshadowed legistax avoidance through attempts to exploit the status of various entities. As I said at the time, earlier warnings about the abuse of the privileged of tax-exempt bodies had gone unheeded . . . What are we doing today? We are dealing with transfers of assets to tax exempt bodies. So, four years later, almost to the day, we are still dealing do with the same call, its having gone unheeded. In fact, on the point of the retrospective nature of this legislation, it should date back to 1979, because the then Treasurer indicated then that there last were anomalies and tax avoidance would in fact that hisincrease in that particular area. The honourable member for Gellibrand and then shadow Treasurer said that if the Treasurer serious he should, in fact, date his retrospecdetivity from the time the practices were started. The point of this whole debate in the last two years has been at which point the legislation . should apply. The Government is making the point, as it has made for six years, that the only to really destroy the tax avoidance industry is to make legislation corrective and applicable from to a the time when the fraudulent schemes were started. That is the only way we can address the problem. Members of the Opposition are saying now 'When we find a scheme, some years after it has started, we will serve notice'. They would do made that after the scheme had been operating, and that would protect and encourage people to introduce those kinds of schemes. In 1979, in 1981, right through to now, loophole schemes, paper schemes, schemes which are blatantly fraudulent have been developed. The parallel drawn in recent weeks between morality and law is a very good one. We are talking about morality; the Opposition is talking about legalism. What we are trying to address is the incompetence in the previous Government's legislation that left these kinds of openings. The legislation before us really is an attempt to address the flaws brought in by legislation introduced by the previous Government over a number of years, flaws that.were able to be exploited by people engaging in these kinds of schemes, be it the cherrypickers scheme, trust stripping or a range of other schemes. The fact is, we are trying to remedy the errors brought into the system. I think it is worth heeding the warnings of the honourable member for Gellibrand in May 1981, when he stated that the tax Act already extended to 1,010 pages; three years previously it had been 695 pages. The tax Act increased in size by 100 pages per year under the previous Government. It has been greatly increased in size and incomprehensibility by the vast amount of tax avoidance legislation that has been passed in recent years also. The increased complexity not only makes it more difficult to understand, but also increases the scope for tax avoidance. In effect, the previous Treasurer, who trumpets in this House and around the countryside how much he has done about tax avoidance, has, quite clearly, greatly increased the capacity for people to avoid paying tax by introducing massive amounts of legislation which was incomprehensible, which was full of loopholes and which has been exploited. After he did that he said to us: 'But that was the law. I made those laws and I made mistakes but you can't punish somebody else. You can't go back and correct that'. For six years the Australian tabor Party has been saying that it would take the legislation back to when this scheme was started to serve warning on those people. People who engage in fraudulent schemes, in paper schemes and in schemes aimed clearly at tax avoidance by artificial means are acting immorally. Morality is not dated in time and it is not dated by a parliament; it is dated by a person's actions. Who in the Opposition will start defending the recent Irish court case which clearly flies in the face of morality on a legalistic principle? Which honourable members opposite will tell the Australian people that this Government should not try to bring back to Australia a man who has charges to face? Technically and legalistically that man does not have to come back to Australia as there is no requirement by law for him to do so because of the actions that were taken at the time of ,his arrest. Are members of the' Opposition going to argue the legalism of that and say that this Government should not persist with a moral case and return that man to Australia? The parallel is very close. The Government is saying that there is a moral charge to answer and a moral role to play. If we are to equate morality with the Opposition's incompetent drafting of legislation, God help Austnilia! We would be in awful trouble in the years ahead, particularly if the Opposition were returned to' government. The Australian people want governments to act ih a way that is moral. The Opposition wants governments' to act in a way that is tied to its own incompetent legislative drafting programs. I do not think the Australian people will wear that and I do not think they should. Over the last two years the Government has been saying consistently that it does not matter whether $lOm or $500m is involved as the principle of taxation equity, the principle of taxation equity, the principle of morality of the taxation system, has to be upheld. The way to do that is to issue the warning to tax avoiders that the Government issued when in opposition six years ago. Our spokesman of the day on taxation said that, no matter what the law says at the time, if a person engages in fraudulent schemes which are blatantly aimed at tax avoidance-schemes of fiscal nullity and the like-a Labor government would make the legislation retrospective to the time the scheme was started. The tax avoiders were told that they should not look for loopholes because if they find them a Labor Government would close them from the time they were found. How can the Government be expected to answer to the Australian people for loopholes in legislation which was passed by previous governments? The Opposition is asking the Government to wear the Opposition's inqompetence and it is asking the Australian people to accept the Government's wearing of it. The Government cannot and will not wear it and neither should the Opposition. I assure honourable members that the Australian people will not wear it. Most Australian people are locked into the pay as you earn tax system. Most of what we are talking about today is outside their realm of knowledge or capacity. The Opposition is suggesting that the Government apply morality to PAYE taxpayers but that it does not apply it to those who are not in the P AYE system. The speech by the honourable member for Mitchell was a superb example of distortion, confusion and virtual deceit in regard to the way the tax Act is. applied. If one were to apply the honourable melllber's parameters there would not be any P AYE taxpayers in Australian at all and every taxpayer v'{Quld be paying a lot less tax. One would then, of course, have to change completely the taxation'levels. The increasing burden on PAYE taxpayers is largely a result of the kind of thinking and argument presented in the honourable member' for Mitchell'sspeech. . Not only is the Opposition inconsistent but also its tax policy is contradictory. The previous Treasurer indicated in 1979, 1980 and 1981 that tax avoidance was increasing because of the changes to gift tax in particular. He had'opened up areas of avoidance that were hot there previously and he said that he would address them. In 1980 he made two calls for that to be done, both of which went unheeded. Finally, he brought in legislation that was retrospective by almost 12 months. It is sheer hypocrisy for him to criticise us when the effective date of his legislation "":!lS 24 June 1980 and ours will be 1 July 1980. We are addressing the same issues. Of course, the greatest irony is that back in 1981 the honourable member for Gellibrand read to the House details of a tax avoidance scheme operating under the trust fund system which was very similar to the schemes being addressed in this legislation. He outlined it to the House then and said: 'Here is an example that hali' been circulated, showing how it works. What is being done about this on'e?' tn effect, he gave notice then that we would take action on those kinds of schemes. The Australian Labor Party has acted absolutely morally for the last six years. It has warned the people of Australia, and more importantly the tax avoiders, that we would make our legislation retrospective. We twice sought a mandate for that principle and twice the people granted us a mandate that it was fair to treat fraud from when it was occurring. If the law does not cope with it, one has to make the laws retrospective to when "" the offences were committed. I suggest that the Opposition should think very carefully about the Irish case because the principles applying there now are exactly the same. On the Opposition's argument this Government would not persist with that extradition process because legally it has now been settled. If the Opposition wants to take that issue to the people, I think the people's judgments made in the last two years will be endorsed for many years to come. The fact is that one cannot separate morality from the law. The law must be based on morality. If one takes away the morality and applies only the. legalism, there is no longer a legitimate law making body. The tendency of the other side of , . the House is to escape the issue through legalism and symbolic posing about what the law stands for. To the people of Australia law is about morality. How can immorality be legalised? That is whattheOpposition would do. It would legalise immorality by its' own incompetence in framing legislation. We all know, and the Opposition admits, that these schemes are fraudulent, blatant and aimed solely at tax avoidance. Having admitted all that, the Opposition says that they are still legal and therefore moral. The fact is that those two issueS cannot be separated. The longer the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party .of Australia maintain the separation between law and morality, the longer they will stay on that side of .the House. These Bills are important Bills. They are setting a pattern, a precedent and a standard for Australia which' Australian people expect. I trust that this time both of the Houses of Parliament will accept that principle. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill. MrHOWARD (Bennelong) (10.29)-I move: Clause 5, page 6, line 39, omit '1 July 1980', substitute '12May 1982'. It is a very simple amendment. It merely substitutes 12 May 1982 as the date for the commencement of the operation of the Bill instead of 1 July 1980. The reasons for the amendment were outlined yesterday by me, on behalf of the Opposition, and have been reiterated in the course of the debate. In that sense, I do not think the Opposition's reasons need any recapitulation. I note that in the course of the debate no evidence has been adduced by the Government speakers as to why on this occasion, without any kind of warning, without any seeming justification other than a desire to demonstrate an alleged zeal in tackling tax avoidance matters, this Bill should run from 1 July 1980. As always in these debates, I listened intently to the contribution made by my friend, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is always entertaining on these matters. I do not always agree with him, but he is always entertaining. Mr Robert Brown-And informative.",15
12,Mr HOWARD,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"The honourable member may be informative, but he is not always informed. On this occasion, he presented what I found to be a fairly convoluted argument about how, if the recoupment legislation passed by the Fraser Government was justified on some odd notion of illegality of certain practices, so is the legislation before us. I point out to the honourable gentleman that just because a general antiavoidance section of the taxation Act may catch a practice does not of itself make that practice illegal. It simply means that that practice will fail and that tax sought to be avoided by that practice or that arrangement must be paid. I found that argument of the honourable member for Charlton very difficult to follow. Perhaps lam a little slow at the beginning of the session, but his argument seemed to be akin to a proposition that, because the intent of section 260 which, I think, was inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1936, was to outlaw all kinds of tax avoidance practices, a government would be justified in running any anti-avoidance legislation from 1 July 1936, simply because, through section 260, the Act purported to proscribe all manner of tax avoidance arrangements. I say with respect to the hOI).9J.ffab-e, ,lllemb,yr fo- <;:harlton. that 1,.fQW;l,-, that a difficult argument., "" Let me leave that aside. The difference between the Government and the Opposition on this matter relates purely and simply to the question of the commencement date. We see no reason for this Bill to have a retrospective operation. We have ' not been' given any really valid reasons by the Government in the course of the debate for its proposed commencement date. We have produced a very compelling reason for it to run from 12 May 1982. It was on that date that I warned all and sundry that the thim Government and, by implication, a subsequent government if it was of like mind on these matters would act legislatively. I recall that particular occasion: The announcement that I made' received very wide publicity, so there can be no argument or cavil from those concerned with these matters whether that is a legitimate date. In the course of this bate, no arguments have been advanced, no evianti-tax dence has been adduced, and no reasons have been given other than the normal, quite misleadport ing fulminations of the Labor Party against Opposition-these weird and wonderful claims about Opposition members being the friends of all these dreadful people who lurk around the corner and prey upon the weak and indefensible in our community. We have become very conditioned to that attack. I appreciated very much the reasoned contriaccepted bution that was made to the debate by the vote against the third reading of this BilL honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). The honourable member for Charlton is always reasoned and interesting, but the honourable member for Stirling made a very valube, able contribution to the debate, one that I preciated very much. But I have,to tell him that during the recent election campaign I found that this question of the Opposition-s attitude towards the tax avoidance legislation, that has been tactics. blocked in the Senate was not quite the winner the Government that it thought. In fact, the lic is getting pretty bored with the argument. By and large, the public has been convinced by a iety of sources, some within the Governlllent, that, whilst it may have been easy to persuade people six or seven years ago that tax avoidance was a problem, in our community, there is now a growing belief that the esoteric, artificial schemes have been effectively brought to an end. When people such ,as the former Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Trade (Mr Dawkins), the present and former Commissioners of Taxation and leading members of the legal and accounting professions run around saying so, it becomes obvilose ous that the arguments being advanced by the GovernmeI).t amo¥nt tQC\-P ,fllUCh beating of the ' """".,;., drum ,and ,are starting to wear a little thin. OJ;l behalf of the OppositiOll Is-y that if the Gover--' ment imagines that it is, onto some kind of electoral wjnner, with this is-ue, it is wrong. I say to those members of the Ausi-aIian Democrats who hllve voted with us on :tl;tisissue previously that they ought not to be concefI).ed about that part of their policy; they ought to be worried about their disastrous anti-American nuclear policies, which will do far more damage to the well-being of this country than the other attitudes they are adopting. I cannot condemn their attitudes on those matters strongly enough. Their attitudes on those issues are even worse than those of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. However, I recognise that that really does not have anything to do with this amendment. Let me say,'in conclusion, that the Opposition dewill give full and proper support to any legitimate avoidance measures introduced by the Hawke Government. In that vein we give our SUP"" fully for the prospective operation of this the legislation from the time that a"" warning was given. However, in accordance ,with the stance we have adopted as an opposition we see ,no reason at all, no evidence produced, no justification, no argument and absolutely no warrant at all for this legislation to operate from 1 July 1980. We reject that proposition. We will move an amendment in this Committee debate. If that amendment is not by the Government the Opposition will ' Mr RobertBrowo-Shame! Shame! , Mr HOWA,RD-It will oot be a shame; it will in fact, a further demonstration that we will apnot be cowed by the MCCarthyist tactics of the Labor Party on this issue. It ill-becomes the honourable member for Charlton or, indeed, anybO,dy else to adopt in this place these MCCarthyist It is a classic MCCarthyist tactic ,that if one for smears somebody enough, if one says something pubrepeatedly enough, loudly enough and to enough people, sooner or later some of the mud will stick. varPresumably, that is the tactic that the Government is embarked, upon. It is a tactic we will not be intimidated by. I am encouraged by the experiencethat I haqin the last election campaign in talking tp people about this issue to feel that they are beginning' to understand the proper stance that has been taken by the Opposition. They are starting to get a little bored by the rantings of the Government on this subject. I think the Parliame,nt is getting a little bored by those rantings. Frankly, I think the Government is starting to the debate on this issue., If the Government imagines that we will be pushed out of the ring by these rantings and I c6Iideinnatibns,: It is ' COill-. pletely wrong. J'ask tl1e'Oovernmeni to 'consider the fairness and the justice of our !imend inent , to' supportit and, in so' dOing, to pass an e'tfective piece of anti-tax avoidance 'legislation. However, if the Gbvetilmentis nofminded to accept it, the Opposition will, of coutse', in this and another place vote against the trleasure.",17
13,Mr ROBERT BROWN,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"Charlton) (10.39)I am, again appalled by the response the Oppositionis making to this 90estion, as I have been by the attitude it has adopted persistently over many years towards tax avoiders and tax evaders. The shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), has indicated that unless the Government is prepared to accept the amendment whereby this legislation would apply from 12 May 1982, instead of from th<;: date that the Government intends it to apply from, namely, 1 July 1980 it will oppose the legislation: That does not surprise me. Nor does it surprise me that the Opposition will be seeking the support of its allies in the Senate. Again, I prevail upon the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine in the Senate to improve their credibility on tax avoidance and evasion by voting with the Government for this legislation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the date the Opposition prefers for the operation of this legislation is 12 May 1982 because the day preceding that, 11 May 1982, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as the former Treasurer, issued a statement concerning thi(operation of these schemes. That is quite correct. I want to emphasise that the effect of that proposal would be to reduce very significantly. the amount of revenue that would be picked up. I know that in the totality of these schemes the amount of revenue is not very great; but there is a definite question of principle involved here. The former Minister for Finance, Mr Dawkins, had the effect of stopping these practices' when he made it very clear' in one of his statements that people could start as many schemes as they liked but this Government, while it had the power to legislate, would ensure on every occasion that the shysters and the smarties, who were devising these schemes to rip off the Commonwealth Treasury, would be pursued. These shysters are ripping off all the honest taxpayers, including the honest businessmen taxpayers-the ov-rwhelming majority of businessmen taxpayers in Australia, .whom the Opposition should be protecting- Instead Opposition members, are spending their time, energy and enthusiasm supporting, defending and protecting all the shysters. That is the role that Opposition members are adopting. They should get ;out into the community il!1d tty t6 d--'; fend their position before the genuine, legitirtulte Allstralian businessman.",19
14,Mr HOWARD,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,'We do: '1'1,19
15,Mr ROBE,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"T BROWN-Opposition members do hot even know them. They know the . shysters, bilt they do not know the genuine ones. If the Opposition were defending the genuine ones it would be making sure that their tax liability was reduced by picking up those thousands of millions of dollars from all the shysters-the ones it has been defending and protecting. The Opposition then prevails upon the independents and Democrats in the Senate to give their support. They gav-the Opposition their support before. Let me remind the Australian people, and the Parliament as well, just exactly what was involved in that. In order to follow up and tighten the bottom of the harbour, legislation, for which the Opposition was responsible, in order to collect the money that had been denied the Australian Government, and the Australian people, we introduct;d legislation according to a very clear mandate that we had been given by the Australian people in March 1983 and which was reaffirmed in December 1984. That was a mandate to pick up that money. The Opposition knows how much that was. Had we indexed that money as, we intended to do in the first place, we would have been picking up $840m. But in our largesse and our concern that the burden on these shysters should not be too great, we said we would not index it, we would only go for the real money value-the depreciated money value-that is, for $570m. Madam Chair, you well recall what happened in this place. The Opposition voted against that legislation. Opposition members did not have the numbers here to defeat it but with their allies in the Senate they got the numbers, so we did not pick up that $570m. We amended the legislation. We brought it back in again in order to seek to pick up $270m. They voted against it again and they got their allies in the Senate to vote agl;linst it and to defeat it. Finally, we amended the legislation again-'in fact, we emasculated it. All we intended to do then was to tighten up the Opposition's legislation and pick up about $35m when it should have been $840m. What happened? Opposition members voted against it .again in this chamber, and in conjunction and alliance with their ailies in the Senate they defeated that legislation again. That was an amount in real terms of $840m that should have gone into the Commonwealth coffers to reduce the burden of taxation on the genuine pay as you earn taxpayer and the genuine busin-s taxpl\yers who. have b.een Qel)ied and repudiateq 1 by ,this OppDsit-on"" \whic\l .""hIlS identified itself as a cDnservativeOppDsiti9/l{ ,ill!' tentDn applying its energies, ,whatever t-leJ1ts may be available to' it,/ ,its time anQswell,t, ,on defending the shysters-all the rip-Dff merchants.

It does not wash withnte:",21
23,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"With respect to the amendment the Opposition has moved, the issue it still has not addressed is the whole question of the structure of tax and the way the community accepts it. This is the point I made in the debate previously. I acknowledge the comments from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The issue which has to be addressed is, if we are going to have a tax system \Vhich works, it has to be seen as one in which there is equity. The problem which has arisen under our tax. system is simply that those who are committed to paying tax have no choice, while those who have been avoiding tax have been allowed to get away with it. That is the fundamental point, and that is why there is im element of retrospectivity in this legislation. (JJfllhe issue Whith theOppositioli hast() face up into' Is that, unless we can show the national Par"" lI-mertt""i'viaretrospectivelegislation, that'We are prepared to delllwiththose who sought through a blatbt'it contrivance to: avoid their tax obligations, We' Will have no trust from the, rest of the com. '""."""" 'i':' munity who are commi1ted to paying tax and who i,.1 ,'.:' wa:n1ito takepart!in theifinancial system. That is the obligation we have in this place. That is why in this legislation- as the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has said, if we are gOin'g to be serious about having an equitable tax system, we have to show with respect to this legislatiori that we are prepared to act against those people who have sought in a wilful and blatant way to avoid their tax commitments. That is why the element of retrospectivity is there. I say to the Opposition-and I think it will be demonstrated this weekend-that failure to do so means that we lose the support of the business cominunity. That has happened, because we acknowledge that the current levels of tax are a burden on the community. I think Premier Cain Will show in Victoria that he has the support of the b\isiness community. In effect, the problem we face is that if we do not show our determination to ensure that the tax laws are pursued and enforced, then the honest taxpayers have no incentive for being part of the system .. That is the problem which developed under the previous Government. This Government believes that the wayit is going about it in this legislation will deal with that problem, and that is why I oppose the amendment and support the Bill.",21
24,Mr DUFFY,TRUST RECOUPMENT TAX,"The amendment moved by the honourable member for BenneIong (Mr Howard) to omit 1 July 1980 and substitute 12 May 1982 is not acceptable to the Government. . I go back to where the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) finished, where he indicated that $9.5m of the $IOminvolved here would not be recovered if in fact the amendment was accepted. Only half a million dollars relates to the period 11 May 1982 to 28 April 1983. It is true,' as indicated by the honourable member for Bennelong, that when he was Treasurer on 11 May 1982, he announced: Should existing legislation be found inadequate to strike down any scheme of the trust stripping type, the Govern.ril-nt will Introduce appropriate remedial legislation. It would be effective from 11 May 1982. It .is worth tracing the history, because the honourable member for' Bennelong said this morning that there Was no prior warning and no justification for this Bill; except the zeal of the Government for stopping tax avoidance. The fact of the, matter is that there .was priorwarningaJ;ld, sec()ndly;the onfcorrect thing tha1 the honour"" able member for Bennelong did say was thitfihis Government certainly has the zeal' for stopping tax avoidance and will continue down that track;I' After the statement byihe forfiler Trea-l!Ter, when the Hawke Labor Government came to office, on 28 April -983 the then Minister for Finance, the present Minister for, Trade (Mr Dawkins), announced in unequivocal terms ,that this Government would employ retrospe,-t,iy() legislation wherever necessary to ensure that tax sought to be avoided under any blatant tax avoidance scheme that comes to light during its term of office will be collected, irrespective of ,when the scheme was entered into. As the honourable member for Charlton indicated, that has been the position of those noW in government for a long time. This Government quite clearly indicated that when it was' in opposition; in the 1983 election it was our position absolutely, and it was our position in the last elec-ion. I must have spoken to different people during the last election campaign because certainly the feeling I had out there in the electorate was not the one that the honourable member for Bennelong had. In fact, the reflection of .the views the people in the community quite clearly was that they had had a gutful of tax avoidance. T,hey were in fact prepared to say to this Government that the ordinary taxpayers of this country, the people who have no way out of paying tax, were not going to be treated in the way they had been in the past, when it was totally acceptable, and that this sort of contrived tax avoidance scheme was not going to be tolerated. In accordance with that policy, this legislation is directed at that new generation of trust stripping schemes which were entered into after I July 1980. After all, that is the date when it was first known that they were being used. I repeat that of the $ 10m placed at risk by that new generation of trust stripping schemes, $9.5m relates to schemes entered into prior to the former Treasurer's statement on 11 May 1982, and $O.Sm relates to schemes entered into after that date. '. There has been no indication that trust stripping has ,been carried on after 28 April 1983, the date on which the ,then Minister for Finance announced the intention of the Government to employ retrospective legislation against the blatant tax avoidance schemes. The reason there is no evidence of that, after the announcement by' this Government. of what it was going t,o do is that the tax avoidance industry believed ,what the Government was going to dOI'[,:he industry had not taken any notice in th- past, :,but it knew the-e was 'a government now in Qfflce which was fair dinkum about,that matter, which was not going to tolerate the blatant tax avoida,,--e which had gone on ih this country for so long.. ' The explosion of tax avoidance during' the period of the Fraser Government is one of the greatest scandals that has taken place in the history of this Parliament. Accordingly, the,au"" nouncement of the Government's policy on retrospective legislation 'was, completely effectiv,e' iIi stopping those scherries- The fact of the matter is that the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the existing law may not be adequate to coriJ.bat at least some variants, of the new generation trust stripping arrangements but this legislation will ensure that there is not the slightest p()ssibility that the scheme will succeed, and that the $10m, at risk will be recovered. This important legislation demonstrates clearly that this Government will move unequivocally to stop this type of practice in the future, and it will not be intimidated by this nonsense that because the legislation is retrospective we ought not proceed with it. The Government is committed to acting in pursuance of its retrospective policy, of thereby ensuring that the tax avoidance industry will: not operate again in this country. Amendment negatived.

COll"".,-rY people often have reason to raise quarantine issues of concern. I therefore believe it is important that they be made aware of the details of these changes in order that they will know to' whom they can direct inquiries. ' The importance' of effective quarantine ar'::' rangements cannot be understated. As .an island continent with natural barriers to the import',of. diseases and pests, Australia has remained orie,9(the few countries today free of serious animal plagues and plant pests and diseases. It is generally recognised that the spread of animal and plant diseases in other parts of the world has been increasing, which highlights the need for .an efficient and effective quarantine service in this country. Clearly, the increase over time in: travel, as a result in part of cheaper air fares, the increase in trade poses significant threats to Australia's position as a relatively disease-free nation. The rural sector is particularly concerned about the growing risk of the introduction of exotic diseases and pests of livestock and plants. The importation of such diseases or pests could have a devastating effect on our priedge mary industry. The fact that we do not have many of the disease problems known in other parts the world also provides significant trade oppormary tunities which would not otherwise be open to us. It is therefore essential, in order to protect existing primary industry and our export opporThere tunities, for us to continue to give quarantine very.high priority. .. The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources highlighted the problems to which have referred in its report which was published some timeago---;-1979. That Committee, chaired by Senator Andrew Thomas, recommended' the creation of an animal quarantine service to located in the Department of Primary Industry. The Committee made that recommendation for two reasons: Firstly, to reflect what it considered to be the. changing priorities of quarantine; secondly, effectively to lif\k quarantine to the agricultural .responsibilities of the Commonquarantine we.alth. What !ire the changing priorities to which the CQmmittee refers? They are based on the to changing nature of quarantine which is now priing marily concerned with preventing the entry of a,gric-1tu-a\p'es-s!ln4i-i---e-anq-ot hU,Ipan di-­ easesbycause the COlTIn:lIttee ,con-ldered that""llt: th-. port of . entry, .?:-¢a:?-' ,-re. now mor""e.·impo'-tl i' ant as v-c,t()rs of a-mal flnq plant diseases than as vectors of human ctiseases. The. Committee, suggestQd that exotic human diseases, are ra-e1y' discovered at ports orQnfl'Y; tl).ey tend to apPear later when Hie tniveI1er i-'-llt in thycommunity.. The Committee made a large !Humber of recommendations which Ido not intend to recount today, but it will be recalled that as a.result oHhis report a major publicity campaign .was launched , ,1', by the previous Government to increase the public's awareness of the importance.of maintaining Australia's relative disease free status. If my memorr serves me correctly',' that campaign involved the expenditure of about $750,000. I am sure the House will recall Harry BJtler;s role in presentinthose advertisements. The government of the day now responded to the recommendation regarding the transfer of plant and animal quarantine to the Department of Primary Industry by indicating that it would be considered as part of a subsequent review to be undertaken. of the administrative arair rangements. That was late in 1980. Today those and changes ar- being mad-. It just shows how slowly additional the wheels of government turn. The importance of having the policy-making divisions of animal and plant quarantine within the Department of Primary Industry relates to that Department's closer liaison with and knowlof primary industry interests. In my view, the increased prospects of cross-fertilisation of ideas of and concerns between. the Department of. PriIndustry and its quarantine sections will be to the advantage of both and will enhance the efour fectiveness of our. quarantine arrangements. has been a feeling in the bush that,by a having the plant and animal quarantine sections within the Department of Health, we did not have the advantage of the cross-fertilisation to which I refer. With the transfer to the Department of PriI mary Industry, the quarantine sections will now have direct and immediate access to th- full resources and information available within the Department of Primary Industry. Certainly one be would expect that the important and detailed feed-back of developments overseas available to the Department of Primary Industry would assist the plant and animal quarantine' sections now and; placed within that Department. I have !llready stated that a breakdown in ou.r arrangements . can have disastrous consequences for primary industry. Oqe has only look. to the relatively recent experienceS fo.1lowthe arrival in Australia of the sirex wasp and the lucerne. aphid. The lucerne aphid alone has cost priirJary iridtistrY'wmiarisOf - ollars-;,b-thin ' Io'st production 'iuid 'ill' 'dl.pita:l expen-it-re' in,volved in the re-sowitigOfilreasof Hunter River lucerne to new 'h:sistliHt,'va.tieties.Even now farinersstill have largti""areas to re-s(n-.l am particularly aware qf' 'ihis I problerribecauseit seriously' affectedthe'far'mers in my eleCtorate: Indeed, I know it affecfs'thdse'in adjacent electorates and electorates further away-in New South Wales and Western Australia. However, this example does bring home the need for our quarantine, people to be ,constantly on guard, and they are more likely to be effective with access to the fullest information possible. ' Another - xamplewpich highlights the need for us to be constantly on' guard was a matter I raised recently with the Minister for Health. In this case shIpments of citrus from the Unite,d States of America sent to New Zealand were found in New Zealand to be infected with bean thrip. I understand bean thrip is an insect which could attack our extensive lucerne and clover stands. To overcome a bean thrip attack would cost millions of dollars in research and replanting. The reason this shipment was of particular concern was twofold: Firstly, I understand that the ship called at some Australian ports before' travelling on to New Zealand with the infested cargo. Secondly, we also import citrus from the United States. Following this occurrence, I understand Australia now requires additional pre-export inspection and certification specifically for this pest. Icould go on forever with similar examples which concern' the primary industry sector. Another example which worries potato growers in my electorate and ele,ctorates in Victoria concerns the risk of importing a disease called potato cyst nematode from New Zealand. Apparently that, disease ,is not present in, Australia, ,but it is present in N- Zealand., Local growers in Australia are very concerned that strict measures ar,e taken to ensure that infected potatoes are not i-ported into this c-untry al1d that as it is a soil borne disease, other vegetable imports, packaging, and bags, such as onion and potato bags, which come into this country are clean., That, of course, leads to the question of how far we should go in ensuring diseases and pests are not allowed into the country. Obviously we cannot totally stop the flow of people or items of trade into the country. That, of course, is the only absolutely sure way that we can prevent disease from coming into this country. However, we can prohibit the import of particular products where the risk of disease or pest importation is too great. The question then becorries one of how low the level of risk has to be to be an acceptable risk. That is a matter which, cJ--f!-, 'most ,bejJdged, o- thefa¢ts:b(e-ch:i¢--(: --we ,<;()ilh-ties iU-- - uppos-d h-it,l,t- ,-n- '-uarMi, t1-- regulatlOn,- to InlpOSe an eff-ctlvebano- Impotts, I know our,own exports have beel! affecteb:Y'such bans.

' ' , ' , I am hopeful that areas of disagreement between producers and our quarantine service will be reduced by the transfer of responsibility to the Department of Primary Industry. The Opposition sees this transfer as a positive and long overdue move and supports the Bill. ' Mr CUNNINGHAM (MCMillan) (11.27)-\ too,' rise to support the Quarantine Amendment' Bill."" I commend the honourable' member for  It is a rare occasion in this House when honourable members on both sides support legislation such as this to the extent that this Bill is being supported here today. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Quarantine Act 1908 to provide for dual administration of the Act by two Ministers. The Quarantine Act has been in operation for a longtime and is well overdue for reform. In accordance with the administrative arrangements order signed by the Governor General on 13 December 1984, the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) will administer sections 8Aand 9 of the Quarantine Act, which relate to human quarantine, and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) will administer those parts of the Quarantine Act that relate to animal and plant quarantine. In place of the existing Director of Quarantine, the proposed amendment provides for two directors of quarantine, a Director of Human Quarantine and a Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine. Most other changes are consequential to the provision of the two directors of quarantine, or are necessary to identify certain provisions of the Act applying to human quarantine only cir to animal or plant quarantine only. The Bill also provides that the directors of quarantine may delegate their powers under the QuarantineAct. There are few countries in the world today as free of serious animal plagues, plant Pests and disease as our country. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, there has been .an increase in the spread of animal and plant disease in recent times throughout the world. Therefore, it is imperative that measures are taken to protect the, present Australian environment. The legislation is designed to put into'practice measures designed to do just that. The changes also give effect to the election commitments given by the Government and carry out the Australian Labor Party's p6licy to transfer animal and plant quarantine to the'Department of Primary Industry; a long ovetdtJereform. The rural sector in Australia has long expressed an interest in, seeing these el-men-s of qu'af-ntinc;l that. relate to agriculture being p1opclosely aligned with other agricultural activities. Recognition has been given' to the changing nature of quarantine, which is noW primarily concerned with preventing the entry of agricultUral pests and diseases. When the Quarantine Act was introduced in 1908 the major concern in those days was, of course, directed to human 'disease. Being an island continent has served Australia well. However, with the greater movement of people there ill an ever-increasing risk of the duction of exotic .diseases. As has been pointed out by other speakers in this debate, most of Australia's rural exports would be put at risk in the event of an outbreak of serious disease. The complexity of the process of risk assessment in animal quarantine can be appreciated if one considers the number of exotic diseases-or exotic strains of diseases already present, which can prove just as harmful-which threaten Australia and the wide variety of methods by which anyone disease may be introduced. The most obvious means of introduction include infected animals, infected animal meat or other livestock products, semen and therapeutic products. In addition, the introduction of a disease may be effected by veterinary or farming equipment, animal stables, food containers, animal feed, straw, hay, et cetera. The pathology.of the disease may render it very difficult to detect. For example, the sheep disease, scrapie, has an incubation period which may exceed four years; rabies may incubate for nine months. Disease may be harboured in animal products for extended periods. Newcastle disease, for instance, may survive in frozen poultry for 10 months. Swine fever virus has been known to survive in frozen pork for several years and the foot and mouth disease virus has survived on hay for periods of up to 15 weeks. The result of these factors is that animal quarantine ranges over a much wider area of trade than the laymen might appreCiate and as a result is frequently misunderstood or opposed by the community at large .. I refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources on the Adequacy of Quarantine from which much legislation has been drafted. The report made some 44 recommendations dealing with the Quarantine Act; thelocationofqUdtafltine within the Commonwealth's administrative""arrangements' arid othc;lr l,\d-inistratiye :Ilfr.angem,ents 'irelating, to quarantine. It lookeda,t.g-peralquarllntine, p-ant quarantine, animal, q-ar-q'tine lind ql.\arantineJacilities. A total of 44 recommendations were brought forward to' be aJted 'upori.' If honouraple members look at the' d'planatoryriotesof the Quarantine Amendment Bill wllich is before the House they will see that many of the recommendations in the report have' been acted upon by this Government in this legislation .. It was well and truly overdue. It is: in the Labor Party .platform and is something which. the Labor ,Party has ,been pushingforfor many years for the rural sector. Another interesting ;pointMs been made on page 64 of the report. When the report was being introput together ,the Depar-ment 'of Health,understandably, was in favour of maintaining the status quo but the Committee, in looking at quatantine, came down with a different opinion. I read a small section of the report, on page 64, which to me goes to some of the political matters in relation to this: The Department of Health has made the point that Animal and Plant Quarantine.is administered economically. While acknowledging this the Committee feels that the economy is nolan absolute virtue when one considers the resourCes at risk. Figures made available to 'the Committee suggest a net annual operating cost of quarantine of $6.5-7.0m, half of which is met from quarantine charges. This wasin 1979.The report coIltimJes: When set against a total Austra,Iian. agri-ultural prqduction in 1978-79- . it has grown dramatically since-;- , of $9892m (products of plant origin worth $4549mand animal products valued at $5343), this indicates that Australia is getting agricultural quarantine at bargain basement prices. . That was in a period when the conservative government was in power, the government that allegedly looks after conservative and. rural interests. The Committee was very scathing in its report about the amount of money that was being spent in relation to: the amount of. agricultu-al production.' ., I strongly support this legislation and in doing so comment on one other matter. Over the last few weeks, in the election atmosphc;lrein Victoria we have seen an outbreak of what. I would consider a serious disease-it has been highlighted in many cartoons on the front page .of the :Age-and that is foot in mouth disease affecting the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria.

"" "" , Mr EVERINGHAM, (Northern .Territory) !(11.36)-1 support the, Quarantine Amendment Bill. I accept that it: is generally conceded that the division of responsibilities' for quarantine is universally accepted as :being an 'advance. Obviously ,in most cases, a, - ivisio!1 of. - esponsibility would seem.to be a retr9g-ade step in l,I.d,ministrative term& but, quite <.:learly,h)lman, plant and animal quarantine are, all subject to their owri peculiarities. The Depa,rtment pf H-alth and the Department of Primary Industry will obviously have the particular concerns and specialties. Certainly we all hope that in this case a desirable result will be'achieved. The honourable me'mber for Barker (Mr Porter) and' the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham), in speaking in this debate, alluded to, pa-ticular instances where breaches of quarantine or breakdowns in the quarantine process have le- to serious hardship to the rural community of this country. I do not want to speak so much about particular examples of where quarantine has been broken, but rather from a northern Australian context to look at how quarantine procedures mig-t been-orce.d. <?f course we have a vastly dIfferent sItuatIOn In northern Australia from that which exists in the southern half of this continent. The thousands of kilometres of lonely northern coastline of this country lend themselves to illegal entry to Austra1ia. Over the years many instances have been documented where this has taken place. At least two-thirds of the coastline of the Northern Territory is Aboriginal land and, of course, people other than Aboriginals who live in those areas are'festricted from entering that land so that tends to make the coastline eveh more isblated than it would otherwise be: At times there ate'literally several hundred kilometres. bet.ween settlements. It is true that people who hve In. remote areas seem to be able to keep a pretty good eye on what is goirig on around them,even though to people who live in the cities it ma- seem t-at vast distahcesare involved. However, InfOrmatIOn does tend to spread quickly,Jor example, by aeroplane or .vessel. Generally speaking, somehow or - ther word does get around. There :are many old I\rubmany, m01:e new. air strips right along the nottheJ;J') c,oastliJ')e. There is;really no way that full sur.veHlance can ,be carried out! of all of; the airstfipsiand all of ,the thousands of miles of.coastlin.-i:rhere are many rum:ouq:d landings. , .,: The previou-;Government established a: system ot'surveillance arter a"" corisiderable outcry In the north of Austraiia 'and, as I recall'it, as a consequence of a ,drug runner's plane being fOrced down somewhere near Katherine. My i11lp!e-sio-;-it ,can only be an impres!\ion because, although I move around the north a great deal, one - as to gauge these things in a fairly subjective way-is that It certainly does not seem that any more aircraft are being used in coastal surveillance today. In fact, from my observations, there areperhaps rather fewer than there were some years ago .. But my impression in a general sense is that the situation has improved with the establishment of the Coastal Protection Unit within the Australian Federal Police, although, again'as I understand it, the responsibility was handed over without any additional manpower. However, I do not think that by any means the situation is ideal. In the north there has been a considerable argument about and support for a specialised coastguard force. But the most serious of the problems today is the ability to respond to sightings. It is all very well for a plane fiying overhead somewhere between Darwin and Nhulunbuy-a distance of some 600 miles or 800-odd kilometres-to be able to see something happening, either an intrusion of an aircraft or, niost frequently, vessels. But, if we ilreunable to respond effectively, what good are the sightings? It is true that these days the Royal Australian N-vy has bigger and better boats, with the Fremimtle class patrol boats, but there has been no increase at all, at least in my part of the world in the numbers of craft available. '. "" ,I refer to a particular case which involved a sighting of wooden vessels off the northern coast of Bathurst· and Melville Islands. The only response possible was to send out an 18-foot fibreglass emergency services dinghy, equipped with a hand-held spot light--':it was at night time-a compass and a radio . .In the event, when the dinghy reached the vessels, they were found to have on board,. amongst other things of course, shovels, axes andsl;eds of corn, which seemed to indicate at least the possibility that a landing was to be made along the coast. The pointis that prevention is not just better than cure in preventing .landings; it is also considerably cheaper in, the long run. If a sighting cannot result in the prevention of a landing, and the issue at stake is an exotic disease, such as the foot; in' mouth disease to' ,which. thehonoul',Rtile member fOl'MCMillan referred earlier j althougn I: would say that 'perhaps the Premier of NewiSolitn' Wales Could have be e n - + - , ""lV.,'! .

To clean up the introduction of disease through a landing would involve enormous, cost and resources in <;omparison with a prop-T:!il­ location right now of helicopter or hydrofoibfa"" cilities which could effectively respond, intercept and prevent such landings. The fact is that on the northern coastline, when duplication. we get away from centres such as Darwin, Nhulunbuy, the one centre in the Gulf, Karulllba, Thursday Island, Cairns, Cooktown and the pend Western Australian coastal centres, there is really nothing in between. Something, other than just planes flying overhead, has to be done, not so that we can just have sightings but so that we can enand force in northern Australia the provisions of this legislation, which I support.",28
26,Mr SNOW,PAIRS," Ruvice. moUr has it that some, years ago a horse was delivered into Australia and remained iri for Australia under circumstances which have been talked about unofficially but which no one will knowledge officially. I am not talking - bout ringthe world. ins; I am talking about a horse which allegedly came into Australia with an exotic dise-se. The disease was discovered, recorded 'and even notified. The potentially dangerous event was the alleged failure of that notification to reach all the required destinations in the time it should have taken, which is only a few hours. Notification did not reach areas of government which required the information until some weeks later. Irrespective of whether that is true, Australia was fottunate that no danger resulted from this sort of tardiness caused by the problems in Australia of too many departments being involved with animal health. The Australian Customs Service is involved, the Department of Primary Industry is involved and the Department of Health is involved. The Quarantine Amendment Bill now before the Parliament brings animal and plantquarandustries, tine under the Department of Primary Industry. hope this will mean a merging of animal and plant. quarantine, formerly under the' Department of Health\lwith the Burdaur'of'Ariimal Health in the De'partmentofPrimary<Industry, and the formation.ora health land quarantine service for plants' and animals,;, .' . - I'.,; : H)r all its talk about lQw-r government spendi-g, 'the pteviotisGovetiihient failed to ac- on a' .'

Governmehts were happy to allow 'representatives from both the Department of Health and t-e Department of Primary Industry to travel to meetings and forUms around Australia and overseas, with unnecessary costs to the taxpayer and inefficient ' Efficient livestock industries in Australia(Jeon' freedom from serious exotic animal diseases. Recognising the importance of Australian rural exports, our producers are spared the costs of lost production and disease control of endemic exotic diseases. This contrasts with policies in many other countries. The first defence against exotic diseases is the Australian quarantine serAn efficient and relevantly administered quarantine service, the type of service provided in this Bill, is essential if Australia's primary industries are to continue marketing acceptable acdisease free products; which are rare ehough in For oiJr exports to be disease free our importseven people, as well as animals and plants-must be free of diseaseS not yet in Australia, insofar as that is possible. We put this Bill before the Parliament at a time when more and more people go to and come frorn overseas destinations, always with the possibility of making contact, through footwear or clothing or goods bought, with exotic diseases. The failure to detect and efficiently act upon the introduction of exotic animal disease would have disastrous consequences for all Australians. The cost to Australia would be millions of dollars. The outbreak of foot and mouth·disease, Rift Valley fever and blue tongue disease would result in the immediate cessation of meat; wool and skin exports: It would cripple rural indevastate the economies in rural towns I and would reach the cities. Much of our standard of living is dependent on primary industry exports which still make up 45 per cent of total exports. J. am delighted thatithei,Ci!in Lab0rGo\'ern-: ment in Victoria has recognised, through its pcpartm-nt of Agriculture,·,tliqt,ialthOugh :the feral pig threat has not. yet peen great in that.8tate, a close watch must be kept on the possible spread of e-otic dise-se - nt9 Yi9t--is: ,through fe-al I>igs. :.If re-y\ected, the present XJRw-an GQv--nmentwlll co-operate, I understarid, by taking part in a feral animal control field day in May that I am proposing. It will be held near the Victorian border in the electorate of Eden-.--ma,ro. Of all the diseases we have talkedabolit today, foot and mouth disease is by ,far the most important because of Australia-S'footand mouth disease free status and the contagiousness of the virus; particularly in view. ofU-e .large numbers. of feral pigs and buffaloes in. Australia. It is an extremely important. consideration for the future of our rural industry. The feral pig, inparticula'r, can move very quickly over long distances. To appreciate the importance of keeping foot and mouth disease out of Australia, it is necessary to understand how valuable is our foot and ,mouth disease free status in the export marketing of ani 7 mal products. . Australia and New Zealand are the only countries in the world with foot and mouth disease free s.tatus and livestock industries significantly dependent on exports. Australian exports to major meat customers-the United States, Japan, Korea and Canada-,--depend totally on the foot and mouth disease free status of Australia and the importing countries. Australia - s major meat export competitors-the European Community, Argentina and Brazil, among others--;are countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic. The structure of the Australian beef industry is determined by the preferred access to markets in the foot . and mouth disease free countries. The Government is to be commended for introducing the Bill to Parliament. Moves can now, be made to inte-ate quarantine services with relevant technical areas in the Department of Primary Industry.",28
27,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"1 support the Quarantine Amendment Bill. The Quarantine Act was enacted in 1908. The changes that are to take place are very much for the gooc/, particularly the proposal to move the responsibility for livestock quarantine from the Department of Health to the Department of Primary Industry. I am sure livestock quarantine will be administered in a much more efficient manner by the Department ofPrimary- Industry. The changed procedures do. not .require additional funds. In fact, I believe that much duplication will be avoided: For that reason, the taxpayers of this country. may even save some money, for a change. 'liMy interest.in qUarantineg0es back a long way. i It is:jnteresting to note that when this country was first/·settled there ,were no cloven-footed animals here. There Were only marsupials, people and S(lIn-,,-ogs.,;r-elmimals that were here""such as ka,ngai,<?os, /lad. diseas- .peculiar to ,them. $ince settlement, we''"" Europeans ':"" I l;';' .. : : , -. ' hllVe introduced \' / , "" , ""', "" "" a rahgeof ammals to support our-elves. Terrible animals such as rabbits were introduced, presumably to support us. Initially, also, animals such as . the,red fox were introduced for the landholders to hunt: The redfox is presently spreading rabies throughout Europe. The foxes have spread throughout this country and are now nothing more'than a nuisance. They are covered in mange and spread that disease to sheepdogs. The fox is an'animal that we could well do without. I do not need:to tell the people of Australiahow much damage the rabbit has done over the years. Although we now have enormous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, we must remember that those animals are very vulnerable to diseases that we do not have here. The bluetongue virus, which affects sheep, is a major disease that we have managed to keep out of the country. The major di.sease affecting cloven-footed animals is foot and mouth disease. We have managed also to keep that disease .out of the country. An enormous amount of praise is due to the people employed by the departments as quarantine officers throughout the country. Australian- who travel overseas are always annoyed when the jumbo has to be fumigated when they arrive home, but .I can assure them - hat that is a very necessary burden and a very small burden. for us to carry if we are to keep these diseases away from our shores. We go to enormous cost to try to stop foot and mouth disease entering the country. The nearest country which has foot and mouth disease is Indonesia, where it. is quite rife. Indonesia is really only a swim away from Australia, so it is amazing that foot and mouth disease has not already come into the country. Tlte fact that it has not is basically due to the dedication of our quarantine officers and to the fact that people are prepared to declare their goods and not to bring in prohibited goods. Thus, we have been able to keep foot and mouth disease at bay. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Everingham) mentioned, the ever increasing smuggling of drugs into this country makes it much harder for us to stop foot and mouth disease entering. We should consider the enormous costs caused to the beef industry in Australia by the cattle tick. It was introduced from Indonesia through the Northern: Territory . and trav.elled rapidly through the sub-tropical<.l!egions to New South Wales. '.. "". '"""" ' My family has b-en associat-d with this a:re'-of interest for many years. My grandfather, Dr S. S. Cameron, has the Cameron Laboratories of the Victorian Department of Agriculture at Werribee named after him; my father is a veterinary science graduate of Melbourne University; and I have been brought up on the land and have dealt with livestock for many years. It is always ofintertl-t to me to see the tremendous work that the dep\lrtmentsdo in this area. I was fortunate enough to visit the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory installation in Victoria, where roughly $350m has been spent. A high security, high risk laboratory has been established there for research into these diseases, so that they may be kept at bay. This will help the livestock producers' of this country. Although the ANAHL installation is not the responsibility of the Department of Primary Industry but that of the Departmerit of Science, it is still one of the most important installationstha,t we have. I am one who did not support the introduction of live foot and mouth disease virus. I have never believed it necessary to introduce the live virus. The policy on both sides of the House is that the present policy will be reviewed in 1987. Foot and mouth disease is the major concern in all the effort and money that is expended in this area. It is to be understood that, if foot and mouth disease broke out, a tota,l slaughter campaign would· be imposed. If it broke out in a herd, as it did recently in the Northern Territory, Tasmania' and New Zealand, all animals within a radius of a certain number of kilometres would automatically be slaughtered. The animals just outside that radius would be inoculated with a live virus to help stop the spread of the disease once detected and proved to be such. That process would be carried out as quickly as possible. The samples would be flown to London or South Africa to be tested. Of course, once the disease was brought under corltrol, those inoculated animals also would be slaughtered. Thus, there has never been any reason, as far as I can see, for the introduction of live foot and mouth disease virus, other than ,so that a few scientists can dabble with it in experiments. I have always thought that they could go to some country that has foot and mouth disease. As previous speakers have mentioned, only a couple of countries in the world are free of the disease. The scientists have only to take a trip to Indonesia to do all the experiments on foot and mouth disease they want to do. The risk of live foot and mouth disease, ,virus ,escaping fr0m the ANAHL instal;"" ' 'lation, although slim, is t00 big a risk to take.; It is interesting· to' nhtlthe number of pass en. - "".'j"" gers who airive in Australia and whoh-ve lobe checked. Two and a half million people arrived in Australia last year. Roughly· ?OO,OOO people ciime by ship. Officers have, l<'>'check these people and ensure that no diseases are being imported. The other thing of note I mention today is the fact that for the first time since 1952 live pigs have been imported into Australia., Only yesterday an announcement was made that consignments had arrived. This is being 9qne through the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Stud cattle imports come: into Australia that way and 1 believe that is what is happening with the pi- .. Certainly many pigs have been imported. They will be spread throughout' Australia. Of course, these animals are very expensive, prize stud animals that will go into improving our,livestock throughout Australia. Not only pigs but also beef cattle have been imported into Australia, particularly, from America and Canada, iri the l!ist few. years. New Zealand, of course, has been used as a quarantine station for a number of years because it is free from foot and mouth disease. We have been importing live animals into New Zealand and Australian cattle breeders have been breeding cattle there. The time spent there acts as an incubation period for blue tongue and foot and mouth disease. The pregnancy period of a cow is roughly that of a human-nine months. Once the calves are born in New Zealand they can be brought to Australia. They are brought here disease free because they have served an incubation period in New Zealand. The deep freezing of semen has been developed by science in the last few years-human as well as animal semen. We read a lot today about in vitro fertilisation et cetera in humans. Of course, the experiments that are taking place on the human side of things these days happened many years ago with livestock, particularly with cattle. Australia has been at the forefront in the deep freezing of semen in liquid nitrogen. The semen is collected and processed in places such as France and England. Once the quarantine period has been undergone we are able to import the semen and rapidly improve the standard of our livestock. We have not had to import the live animal with the associated risk of its carrying a disease. I believe, that the eradication of wild pigs is most important. I applaud the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) for his endeavours since he has been a member of parliament to get the Government to move on this front. I am not one who believes that we cannot eradicate wild pigs; I believe that we can. lhave them running around the back bfmy property all the time. I go out and-hoot them eveiysecond night of the week, trying to keep their' numbers down. I,believe that w-,can achieve anything with a concerted effort WI(,have proved, this' with b,rucella and - ith lepto, which we have practi, caJly eradicateq, at enormous cost. Of course, it is not such a great cost when we consider the future. If we ever get an outbreak of foot 'and mouth disease it will be nearly impossible for us to control it while these huge numbers of wild, cloven-footed animals are running around Australia. The former member' for Gippsland and Ministet for Primary Industry, Mr Nil'on, was very keen to get a scheme going to eradicate wild pigs but it never came to fruition. I believe that the present Governm-nt is keen to"" start such a scheme. I certainly urge the.. Government in its efforts in that area. I do not believe that it is beyond US to do 'that. I believe that .we can do it with effort-of course, with the expenditure of money also. Perhaps once the. .current' programs of brucella and lepto eradication art< well and truly in hand we, as a nation, ought to look at the eradication of wild pigs. They now seem to affect every State in Australia. It is high time we tried to eliminate the problem. I also support the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Everingham) in his concerns about the surveillance,of"" our coastline. Being a Queenslander and representing a third of that State':""':':although none of it touches the coastline-I certainly spend quite a bit of time flying up and down our coast. Queensl,and has an enormous coastline. It is very difficult to maintain proper surveillance of it. Our native birds' are being exported in vast numbers. Wha- is going oilt of the country can just as easily come into it. phiviously I have mentioned drugs and people. The Torres Strait Act took a long while to come to fruition. A lot of it was tied Up with we Queenslanders ensuring that the quarantine in that area was up to scratch, and that prospe9ts bringing diseases across from New Guinea and Indonesia were not heightened at all and ,that continued to keep a very close watch in that area. I believe that we must help the Government by supporting. continued surveillance., We want see more patrol boats built. I know that there. been quite a reduction in the surveillance program but we must self that the program continues and improved. It is interesting to note the types of animals come into Australia. I think they represent a fairly good cross-section of members of this House! year, 63 circus animals came into the 'country.: thihk'some of them may have made it into' here! Thirty-five bees-there are a· :few queen bees bU,zzing around here--nd 1,734 cats and dogs Gaqieipto the country l-st year. "". "" ' : i Mr HUNT - Any,tabbies? ' Mr IAN CAMERON-A few tabbies. From New Zeahind came 2,800 head of cattle, Which highlights what I was talking about previouslythat New Zealand is used by Australia as a quarantine station: I wonder what else it might be used for now. After the kerfuffle that has beengoing on in the last few days, New Zealand may even stop our using it for quarantine purposes. Last year 79 head of cattle came from Canada and the United States of America. Nearly nine million fish came into the country. I know that we do not want some of the species. One of the species that was introduced, the carp, has practically e,aten every sort of native fish we ever had in inland Australia and has taken oyer every waterhole. We certainly did not want that type of species introduced.",29
28,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,The Chinese like them.,31
29,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"A fyw Chinamen came in, too. Forty goats were imported into Australia last year, and there are a few of those in here! The record shows that 82 guinea pigs, 2,757 laboratory ' animals and 226 pigs, which I have mentioned before, entered Australia last year. Fourteen primates-there are probably a few of them here, tool-came into Australia last year. Fifty-four , rabbits entered Australia. Of course they have multiplied. I do not know why we are still importing rabbits. I thought we would have had enough by now. Last year 127 sheep entered Australia. There are a few sheep here, too! I support the changes contained in the Bill. Certainly, as an oppOSition, we thank all the officers involved in this area. I look forward to working with them in the future.",31
30,Mr STAPLES,PAIRS,"The Quarantine .Amendment Bill 1984, which is before the House, gives effect to Australian Labor Party polof icy and an election promise by this Government. It again demonstrates the great concern that this we Government has for primary industry and for the . primary producers of this country, as well as for the health of all Australians. This Bill, in effect, to removes the anomaly of the Minister for Health has being responsible for plant and animal quarantine areas when, if anything went wrong, the Minister is for Primary Industry arid the Department of Primary Industry probably would be left carrying the that can. So, whilst the Minister for Health quite correctly retains responsibility for the human health Last and quarantine areas; I am sure that on this I occasion the Minister for Health is quite glad to see, the t-ansfer qf his responsibilitiel) for plant. animalqiJarantine to th .. primary industry fi..ld., c;' Before entering 'Parliament I worked on-niibai' diseases with the Commonwealth Scientific and ecution Industrial Research Organisation i- the Division of Animal Health in Parkville and may r:sily, health somewhat tongue in cheek, that, were it not for lieve the well-honed sense of judgment of the voters Diamond Valley at the time of the previous elecquarantine tion, I would probably now be working in the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory short-sightt:d at Geelong. It is a front line in exotic disease control. Having worked on diseases such as bluetongue and akabane as well as pleuropneumonia, I am aware of the huge losses that Australia has. susant tained because of the introduction of exotic, dis"" eases into this country. Today, with jet travel fast surface transport, we are obviously not isolated as we were when the Quarantine Act of 1908 was first enacted. We live in a very fast world where diseases may not be evident on rival because of the incubation period. The at which people and animals travel world presents great problems after their arrival on our soil. As has been pointed out, our long, inhabited coastline is a constant soft spot in vigilance to ensure that exotic diseases do not reach our shores. While the Department of Health is well set to ensure effective quarantine measures at points of access to Australia, and has shown itself conence sistently over the years to be a very effective ation, the problems of animal !!.nd plan't quarannately, tine are extensive and the points of access to Australia are not so easily or readily defined. viously, an effective quarantine service requires not only extensive vigilance, but also effective oratory, scientific and technological back-up erations. The Departmc::nt of Primary Industry, conjunction with the invaluable resources, skills and expertise of the workers at installations such Bill to the House. as the ANAHL at Geelong, are in the best position to provide this for us. The gross value of agricultural commodities produced in Australia in 1981-82 was in excess $12 billion. Obviously, without effective quaranfor tine, all that is at risk. It is at risk both estic consumption and for our export markets. important aspect of this Bill is the dual adminisfor tration clauses. Clearly there are aspects of quarsupport antine which require this interaction and I pleased to see that the Government has acted sponsibly and effectively to ensure that there no grey areas of responsibility for quarantine trol. However, the Toomer case, reported in the and , National Times laSt· weekjhighlightsa problem "" that can develop in thesei areas. Bill Toomer was ' ' effectively driven from the - ublic Syrvice because it was alleged that he wasbver zealousint.he exbf his duty.

Those who would attempt to short circuit regulations for financial gain or for speed of processing of their imports are very and they constillitlythreatenour iri-,' ' dustries and the, jobs and livelihoods of hundreds ',. ' of thousands of Australians. ' I believe that while speaking of the very import-' installation at Geelohg, ANAHL, it should be recognised that there has been continuing support and and co-operation from the Cain Government. as The siting and operation of this laboratory at Geelong is very important to the people of Victoria and to A,ustralians generally. Obviously the arpartnership between the Cain Labor Government speed and the Federal Government works for the around the benefit of us all. In relation to ANAHL, I wish to make particu· unlar reference to the workers at that installation our and to those in the Division of Animal Health in the CSIRO. Working with animal diseases is often dangerous to the individual worker and working up with human diseases is almost always dangerous, but it is through their constant efforts and adherto strict security regulations that we in this opercountry are protected day after day. Unfortupublic servants, including scientists, technicians, support staff and quarantine and health Obinspectors, are often subjected to ridicule and derision. I am glad that the honourable member for' labMaranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) saw fit to praise opthese people as well. We should remember the in quiet way that these officers do their job and the value of that job to this country. I commend this ' '",31

While-e are dealing whh the ques-ion ,of quarantine, it is interesting. to I.1ote that SO\.lth Australia's move to its 150th year celebrations next year will involve the State in hosting what will,be a major equestrian event. This event will put particular demands on the quarantine station at Torrens Island in South Australia, in the electorate of the Special Minister of State -(Mr Young). I am hesitant to digress, but I must ex"" plai,n. to. the House that the event is the sixth world three-day equestrian event and is being held at Gawler. The movement of horses into the State for this .event will. put additional demands on the Torrens .Island station because the incubation period of particular animal diseases referred to by the hOI.1ourable member for MCMillan, will need to be met if these horses are to enter Australia safely. I shall speak hut briefly to the provisions of the Billbecalll!e much cif what I would want to say has been said already. All Australians are aware of the fact that we have an enormous coastline37,000 kilometres-to be policed in thejnterests of quarantine. I was interested and astonished to discover in prl(paring these notes that even the Australian Capital Territory has its own share of coastline, which. I had not appreciated before,rtamely 35 kilometres at Jervis.Bay. I said in my opening remarks that South Australians are committed to quarantiI.1e, but I concede gladly' that all Australian are. more aware than they have ever been before of the importance of plant and animal quarantine to the future prosperity of our nation.

"" I "" .1, r'-- 'pleased to see' the issue of quarantine in relation. to animals and plants being put into a separate section under the Department of Priml,lry,I114 ustr y. This Bill(ulfils a promise that both par.ti-shad madeto the elec,torate prior to the election. It is entirely appropriate that the question of plant and animal quarantine be under the Department of Primary Industry because it has a good deal more sympathy for and empathy with particular diseases that affect primary producers. The!honourable member for Barker has outlined those diseases and I do not wish to go into them now. I wish to make three brief points. First, I alert both the Minister and the House to the need, as I see 'it, to tighten import inspections. The member for Barker has rightly said that it is abhorrent to use quarantine as a trade barrier and I believe that most people in the House would endorse that sentiment. But, of course, there is an enormous influx of tourists and of primary industry products into' Australia and, as a result, there is a need to tighten our current import inspection procedures. I think of the illustration of .the amount of citrus fruit now coming into Australia. I am aware of. the number of representatives of citrus growers who have approached the Minister for Health, the honourable member for Barker and me seeking an assurance that· those diseases which might be endemic in citrus entering Australia are carefully policed to see that they do not put the citrus industry in Australia at.risk. I am also aware of the enormQus explosion in. tissue culture and of the amount of plant material coming into Australia for nursery work. There is a need for, tightened import inspection procedures in that area; We are all aware of the increase in the number of imported foods and the fact that much of the pure food legislation is currently a State responsibility. The second matter I would like to mention is that since Australia, especially South Australia, enjoys aurtique status as a fruit fly free and generally disease, free area, we ought to be making greater, use of our advantage. I press the Government t6 ensure greater tecognitionoverseas of the certifiable fruit fly free and disease ftee status that Australia, particularly South Australia, enjoys. While it is abhorrent to Use import restrictions as a trade barriet, iUs every i bit as abhorrentto be denied'markets, if one is an exporterendeav0uring,to get into an ,overseas market. Therelaremarketsbeing denied to South Australian producers siqJply because people choose to use imporL - e­ strictions in their countries to make it more difficult, for South Australian producers to enter them. ",32
32,Mr ANDREW,PAIRS,"Yes. Finally, I plead with the Minister not to allow the ,nervous Nellies ill his Party to restrict what ought to be some adventurous work being done in the area of fumigation and sterilisation. We are all aware of the risks inherent in the continued use of EDB as a fumigant, but there are some exciting possibilities for fumigation and sterilisation procedures if we are prepared to turn to gamma radiation. I do not wish people to be blase in their approach to gamma radiation, but I urge the Minister not to allow those nervous Nellies who may surround him to discourage him from undertaking the sort of adventurous work that ought to be undertaken. The work in brucellosis eradication is an accurate illustration of just how difficult it is to cate a disease once it becomes endemic in livestock or plant life. I am very pleased that this Bill is before the House. It highlights the importance of quarantine and the importarice of legislation to streamline quarantine procedures. Without effective quarantine we will have further brucellosistype endemic infections that we will then be needing to eradicate.",34
33,Mr MILDREN,PAIRS,"1 should like to support the comment made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) that this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. I think that the whole House recognises how significant it is to make this shift of plant and animal quarantine to the Department of Primary Industry; It has been pleasing to note the spirit in which this legislation has been dealt with. The split in responsibility should ensure a greater likelihood of a concerted attack upon those areas of quarantine that relate to primary industry in particular. One matter on which I would like to comment, because it is of major significance to the people in my electorate and in the adjoining electorate of Burke, is the ongoing fear that potato growers have regarding the possible importation of two very serious plant diseases from New Zealandgolden cyst nematode and black wart. I know that  has a similar fear in his electorate. If the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) were present, I am sure that he would feel the same way. This is a matter of concern. We recognise, of course, that restrictions' are imposed upon us because of the conditions: of the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand; but it will be an ongoing fear, :and obviously there will be great necessity to maintain the mOst rigid quarantine surveillance, becau,se' these diseases would be disastrous in areas such as mine. , To the area which I represent, the potato growing industry has a significance to the economy which I cannot over emphasise. At this stage, at least$15m is goingirtto Ballarat as a result of the work on potato farms. It is not just that. The inc dustry also maintains a very large number of families, because the farms are not large. They are fairly small farms, and it is extremely intensive farming. Many of these people have been on the land from the last century. The families have held thos- farms for, many decades. These people are greatly concerned that if there were to be a breakout at the point of importation for the processing of potatoes, this would have a disastrous effect upon their livelihood. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to see that we are now bringing plant and animal quarantine into the Departeradiment of Primary Industry. I am sure that there will be a continuing and co-operative relationship between the Department of Health and the Department of Primary Industry to ensure that quarantine is kept at the highest possible level. We also recognise that it is not only the importation of potatoes, even if just for processing in the major cit.. ies, which could possibly bring in the golden cyst nematode and black wart. If people are careless about travelling in these infected areas of New Zealand, they could unwittingly be the carriers of those diseases into Australia: That will be a continuing responsibility of the Department of Health. I do not wish to go over the ground covered by prev.ious speakers. However, with regard to honey, I emphasise that the importation of pollen involves a considerable risk, and the honey farmers, not only in my area but throughout New South Wales and South Australia, have the same fear. They are conscious of the need to maintain the most rigorous quarantine survdlance. I only hope that as a result of the shift we shall find ourselves not in a diminished position but in a strengthened position concerning quarantine. For a long time. I have felt that the Department of Primary Industry should have the responsibility for quarantine, and I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the HOl!se feel the same. I am pleased to add my support to the Bill.",34
34,Dr BLEWETT,PAIRS,"in reply-I should like to take this opportunity to thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate for their bipartisan support for the Quarantine Amendment Bill. I should like to echo the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) in noting the enOrmous success this country has had with quarantine over this century. As the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr.Ian Cameron) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Everingham) pointed out, we have very difficult surveillance problems in the northern part of this country. Nevertheless, as the honourable member for MCMillan said, we are one of the few countries in the world which are free from a whol- range of plant and animal diseases. It is worth acknowledging at this point the very great achievements of quarantine in' Australia through this century, and that the changes now being made are not as a result of any failures in quarantine but are a recognition of the new sorts of quarantine problems we are facing; The honourable  tural knowledge, gave us various examples,. such as the problems of bean thrip, potato cyst nemotodes and citrus canker. I think that he would recognise the very effective actions that have been taken by quarantine to deal with these problems. We might say that eternal vigilance is the price of keeping this country free from foot and mouth disease. I think that this has been achieved by quarantine. As honourable members on botb .sides of the House have pointed out, this move i.s long overdue because of the great changes in emphasis in quarantine today compared with earlier decades. Luckily, human quarantine is no longer the great problem it was in the past, but animal and plant quarantine have become much more significant elements. The change the Government is making r-cognises that. Speakers on both sides of the House have said that the change is long overdue. I agre- with that. I point out that the Hawke Labor Government, in its first three years, has honoured its promise to the rural community that it would make those changes in quarantine. In relation to the point raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory about the problems of surveillance of that northern area, echoed by the honourable member for Maranoa, I think the honourable member for the Northern Territory accepts the point we all accept, which is that there is no way the Government 'cancarry out complete surveillance across that whole northern area. The Government has to organise. the most cost-effective surveillance it can produce and make use of all the latest. technology in providing the most effective barriers across that whole northern area. I think both sides of the H0use realise· this is a very difficult task. This Government has riot only the surveillance under constant· review but also the interception once illegal1crllft are sighted. To encourage the honourable member for the Northern Territory that the Government is constantly vigilant about this, I would like to inform him that this morning a vessel was sighted 46 miles north-west of Bathurst Island. It is suspected to be fishing illegally, and the interception response is already under way. So the GO'1'ernmentis doing its best in what is, admittedly,avery difficult situation. , Wi-h reference to a query raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the final structure of plant and animal quarantine withi- primary industry is still under consideration, but there is a strong expectation that his desire that these plant and animal quarantines be amalgamated with the Bureau of Animal Health will be satisfied. Finally, let me echo strongly the points made by the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). While the Government wants the most effective animal and plant quarantine it can have in this country, the Government also has to make sure it does not use those health and quarantine provisions as trade barriers. Those two things have been kept distinct. I welcome very much the bipartisan support. We want effective health and quarantine for animals and plants but we do not want to use those regulations, and will not use those regulations, simply as economic or trade barriers. I thank all honourable members for their part in this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill'read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

35,Mr GRIFFIT,PAIRS,"S '(MiifibY*-9ng) (l2.3-)';-r; preface my relparks by, referring to an articl«in today's edition of the Australian headed :ICo"" alition out-spends ALP on as'. The articleilrtdi-' cates, from figures compiled by the Australian' Broadcasting Tribunal, that: The Liberal and National parties have spent more than $14m on political advertising on television and radio during the past to years-almost double the amount spent the Labor Party in the same period. The reason I make reference to that report is my strongly held view that what is happening in terms of the insurance companies' campaign in Victoria against the Victorian Labor Government'S portant proposed, reforms' to the workers compensation torian system is germane to that sort of article. The Insurance Council of Australia is alleged to have spent in the vicinity of $2m on a quite disgraceful and misleading campaign to bring attention to alleged deficiencies in the proposed reforms advocated by the Cain Labor Government. It is not only my partisan view that the campaign has been somewhat extreme. I refer to a report on page 39 of the 22 February edition of the National Times. Karen Kissane opens the article by saying: The insurance industry is pulling no punches in its frantic attempts to dellect the Cain government from its plan to take over Victoria's workers' compensation. Primetime television advertisements designed to tug at the public's heartstrings lack only the violins. I have some concern about the campaign conducted by the Insurance Council of Australia, but I have also a concern about the campaign conducted by the Law Institute of Victoria. I will address my preliminary remarks to the campaign conducted by the insurance companies. Honourable members ought to be made aware that in Victoria 60 per cent of the 50 or so insurance companies working in the workers compensation system are overseas-owned. Also, in terms of individual companies, they have been significant contributors to Margaret Thatcher's British Conservative Party. For example, the Eagle Star Insurance Co. contributed in 1983 the sum of $24,000 to the Margaret Thatcher campaign; Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance contributed the sum of $50,000; C. E. Heath-I will return to this company a little later- contributed in the vicinity of $10,000; Phoenix Assurance Co.! $19,500; Royal Insurance, $35,000; and, Sun Alliance Insurance, $35,000. This makes a total of $174,000.  Mr GRIFFITHS'-'-The honourable member -"";, I -: iii _,Ii shows by his ignorant interjection that he knows' nothing about the insurance industry. The insurance companies have long argued that workers compensation is a particularly unrewarding area of involvement in insurance generally. In terms of the alleged unprofitability of that area of business activity by these insurance companies, I quote from a report from Reinsurance Magazine, dated 3 December 1984, a United Kingdom pUblication, by headed 'Lights out at Heath'. I make the point "" that this is a trade journal. The writer is address.: ing the future of the C. E. Heath Insurance Co. I' quote from that report: Then there is the worrying matter of the broke(s imworkers compensation business in Australia. If the Labor Party wins control of both Houses in the VicElections expected next May, a single fund for workers compensation will almost certainly be set up in that State. Western Australia and South Australia, also important to Heath, could well fellow. According to estimates, workers compensation in Australia will contribute around £ 10m (33 per cent) of Heath's profits this year. That report brings to light two fundamental issues. Firstly, workers compensation insurance is not the difficult task often presented by insurance companies. If C.E. Heath is receiving 33 per cent of its world-wide operation's profit from workers compensation insurance in Australia, and if that amounts to £ 10m, it would be somewhat difficult successfully to put the argument that workers compensation does not, at least for some companies, provide a very high rate of return on investment. My concern with C. E. Heath's is particularly strong in that it contributed a very large amount to the Thatcher campaign and obviously that money has been taken out of the system in Australia. The reality is that ordinary business people and ordinary employees in Australia have been involved, however indirectly, in the funding of Margaret Thatcher's campaign. That is something about which to date the insurance companies have been silent. I note this report of comments made by Mr Trigg, the Insurance Council's spokesperson, on page 19 of today's Age: Mr Trigg denied the ICA had given money to any political party, although individual insurance companies could, and did make donations. 'That is their individual corporate choice,' he said. When Mr Trigg was asked about this a week or so ago he implicitly indicated that the individual insurance companies were not making donations to the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party. From' my sources I am confident that each and every one of the insurance companies I have adverted to ' today has made significant donations. In fact, my sources within the insurance industry-quite senior sources I might add;:.t:-descrioed itin the following terms: - They are - taking;it do:ovn in. wheel·., barrows'. That obviously ..indicates that a lot 'of mon!!y is going to the Liberal.Party,in Victoria, and I believe it is incumbent upon the managers'of the various insurance. companies to indicate to· their policy holders the ,leyel·of donations that. they are making to the Liberal Party campaign in Victoria. In terms of the Insurance Council of; Australia alone the campaign has been estimated to cost towards $2m, .which is a significant amount. The Labor Party's ability to compete is. Pl,lt into some sort of context when one takes into account the fact that the expenditure of the coalition parties on election. campaign advertising over the last 10 years has been almost double that of the Labor Party; In my submission, the activities of the Law Institute of Victoria and the Insurance Council of Australia indicate a conspiracy to defraud the business people and employees of the State of Victoria. Both campaigns have been predicated on the self-interest of the insurance companies, as indicated by the sort of information I have already provided. In my view the Law Institute of Victoria would be unable to keep a straight face if it had to argue that it had the best interests' of the Victorian business and Victorian employees at heart. I hasten to add that, in terms of the proposed reforms, there is an agreement between the business people of Victoria and the trade union movement that the proposals are the best' option for the future. The Law Institute and In-. surance Council of Australia campaigns are reactionary and they are based on the narrowest self interest of the participants. I should add a degree of bipartisanship to my comments on the Law Institute campaign. I do so by extracting a letter to the editor of the Agelast week, headed 'Glib Information about Compensation'. It is from a Mr -. Mulvany, whom I know to be a seni6; partner In one. of - he largest workers compensation practices in Victoria. This letter, from a member of the Law Institute of Australia and practising lawyer in the relevant area, states: The calTIpaign being conducted by the Law Institute of Victoria concerning the. Victorian Government's intentions to reform the worker's compensation sys.t-m is capable of two constructions. It is either a genuine attempt to inform the cotnmunitY'about issues which it considers important or a cynical campaign to support the Libend Party platform and its implicit preservation of the financial interest of lawyers and private insurance companies. As the official representative of lawye-s one would assume the Law Institute is committed to the principal that all available evidence should be presented for those asked to make determinations. It is therefore surprising that in its 'election like' material, the Law Institute fails to fully. inform the electorate of the facts about the Government's proposals. Of major concern is the glib information preselJWI t.o the communit- about hJ!llp. sums in workers' compensatIOn and common law claims. Nowhere in its material' does the Law Institute refer to the' considerable body-'cif reputablditerature that criticises lump surns as a mt;thqliof compensating personal injuries. The institute has failed to inform the community of tile following: 1. That the average lump sum received by an injured worker is fractionally more than one year's average wec;klyearnings. , - .. That there are currently considerable social, financial and judicial pressures that deprive workers of a free choice between a lump sum or weekly pay'. meilts of compensation. 3:' That to obtain a lump sum it is necessary to endure a process that involves medical mercenaries; preju-ices as to ethnici-y and gender and harrassment by msurance compames. It is unlikely that any of this material has been made available to the 62 per cent of respondents to the Law Institute survey who indicated they would prefer a lump sum rather than continuing income maintenance. If the material circulated by the Law Institute is an attempt to inform the community, then as a member and a personal injuries lawyer, I resent its ineptness. If indeed, it IS an atte!llpt to become involved in an election campaign then I resent both its involvement and its direction. That let-er was signed by Paul Mulvany, a senior partner m the Melbourne legal firm of Maurice Blackburn and Co., a firm widely known in Victoria to specialise in the area of personal injuries and industrial law generally. In terms of the responses of the Law Institute and the Insurance Council of Australia it is worth pointing out that 15 per cent of the $800m that is involved in :-"",orkers compensation in Victoria finds its way mto the coffers of the legal fraternity. Fifteen per cent of $800m is quite a significant amount of money by any measure but, to put it into context the Victorian workers compensation system is thsingle most expensive system in Australia. To the extent that it is the single most expensive system it is apparent that lawyers are taking a disproportionate share of moneys that ought to be more directed towards theinterests of injured workers. .. Another factor that has arisen in the debate in Victoria is that the insurance companies have, I am reliably informed, intimidated their staff in an effort to ensure their attendance at political rallies designed to oppose the Cain Government's legislation. Mr MCGauran-Where is, your evidence? . Mr GRIFFITHS-I shall be happy, upon clearing it, to quote the individual's name in this House, but I shall not do it, of course, without that individual's okay. I can see by the response that honourable members opposite are very excited about these comments. Mr ,MCGauriln-It is all hearsay. Mr 'GlfIFFI'rHS-The hohourable --Illbefo-Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) may be vbrY-4r. p-lsed to know that most business peop1e'in""ihe VIctorian Parliament support the proposa:-;So I do not know to whom he is directing his remarks. Is he saying in this House that he will--""",36
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Keogb)Order! The honourable member for Gippsland has been in this House long enough to know 'that all interjections are out of order and I remind him that he is not in his seat. Mr GRIFFlTHS-I would be happy to bring to the attention of th- constituents of the honourable member for Gippsland the fact that he would put before their interests the interests of the Law Institute of Victoria. No doubt the honourable member for Gippsland might like to indicate whether he is a member of that august body. Mr MCGauran-Yes.,38
37,Mr GRIFFITHS,PAIRS,"He is. Well, there we are. Before the member for Gippsland interjects in the future. one would hope that he would bring to the attentIon of this House where he has a pecuniary interest in the subject before the House. The Insurance Council of Australia has taken a very hard line and, in my view, a quite intimidatory approach to its employees. It has, by way of intimidatory circulars, put pressure on employees to attend political rallies, something that we all ought to find abhortent. Mr MCGauran-Table them.",38
38,Mr GRIFFITHS,PAIRS,"The' honourable member interjects and says that they ought to be tabled. As soon as they come into my possession that will certainly happen. I have been reliably informed by telephone conversations this morning that they are available and I give the undertaking to this House that they will be provided immediately they come into my possession. The Insurance Council campaign is not only directed towards maintaining, its own position in the market but also it is a grossly misleading campaign and it relies on the basest sort of advertising that I have seen for a very long time. That is all part of politics; that is something that I will not necessarily !ose any sleep over. But what I find objectionable IS th: fact that the campaign is grossly misleading. The Insurance companies and the Law Institute of Victoria simply have not put the argument accurately and the letter that I read from a practising solicitor in that area is but 'one indication of the widespread concern about the tactics embraced by the Insurance Council and the Law Institute of Victoria. ' .,1'1t(. I put the fundanierilalissues as follows: The C. E. l:Ieath jnsurance company, which is one example, gets 33 per cent or 10 million pounds of its world profit from Australia's workers compensation insurance. That money is substantially derived from its operations in Victoria. There is nothing said about thatwben the Insurance Council articulates the supposed concerns of its industry. The insurance companies that are mainly involved in this area in Victoria have used profits made from their Victorian and Australian operations to fund lheMargaret Thatcher Conservative campaign in England. I am not sure how many business people in Australia would be upset ab?ut their money going to that end,but, I am qUite sure that at least a significant minority would object and certainly many employees in Victoria would object to money going that way. The Opposition once again tries to interject. It is always ready to support foreign monopolies against Australian interests. We are not cutting them out of the market. They will be invited to tender, as honourable members would know if they had read the literature, for part of the administration of the Victorian scheme. !t is important to advert, arid I will do so very bnefiy, to some aspects of the scheme in Victoria. As I have indicated, some $800rri is involved in Victorian workers compensation insurance. It is the most expensive system in Australia. When the changeover takes place on 1 July the number of insurance companies acting in the field will drop from 51 to five. Therein lies the concern of the insurance companies. Some of the very large legal firms will be significantly affected. I believe that it is incumbent upon the spokespeople for the Law Institute of Victoria to indicate to Victorians what their pecuniary interest is in these areas. If one looks at the membership of the Council of the Law Institute of Victoria, it is my reasonably informed gliess that a very large number of those individuals would have a direct pecuniary interest in matters that they have brought before the Victorilin 'public, allegedly under the cloak of the interests of Victorian employees and businesses. It is incumbent upon them, in their public comments to indicate their own self-interest. It is anticipated that the Victorian proposals will create 25,000 new jobs. It is anticipated that they will save business in Victoria some $600m. I would like to see honourable members opposite argue against that as a reasonable objective.",38

42,Mr BEALE,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, wo.uld yo.u please co.nvey to. the Speaker my co.ngratulatio.ns o.n his re-electio.n to. the Chair. While o.n aperso.nal no.te may I say that my father served in this Ho.use from 1946 to. 1958. On 18 Octo.ber 1983, during the co.ndo.lence mo.tio.n fo.llo.wing his death, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader o.f the Oppo.sitio.n (Mr Peaco.ck), the then Leader o.f the Natio.nal Party o.f Australia, Mr Antho.ny, the hono.urable member fo.r Parramatta (Mr Jo.hn Bro.wn) and the honourable member fo.r Dundas (Mr Ruddo.ck) had so.me kind words to. say abo.ut him. To.day I am able, o.n behalf o.f my family, to. reco.rd o.ur appreciatio.n fo.r the.se remarks. The electo.rs o.f Deakin have paid me a great tribute by electing me as their representative. Two. fo.rmer members have also. served the.se co.nstituents-Alan Jarman, the member from 1966, to. 1983, had a distinguished parliamentary career and was deputy chairman o.f committees fo.r seven years. On behalf o.f the residents o.f Deakin, I pay' co.mpliment to. his lo.ng and outstanding perio.d o.f service. Jo.hn Saunderso.n, who. no.w sits o.pposite as the member fo.r Asto.n, was the member fo.r Deakin between 1983 and 1984 and also. made a co.ntributio.n to. the Deakin community. It is an ho.no.ur to. serve in the Parliament o.f Australia because, despite o.ur imperfectio.ns and o.ur critics, this natio.n has a pro.ud traditio.n. Few co.untries in the wo.rld can match o.ur achievements in the gro.wth o.f individual liberties and rights and the develo.pment o.f a bro.adly based prosperity fo.r mo.st o.f o.ur people. Few co.untries, at least o.n a per capita basis, can boast o.f having produced such o.utstanding invento.rs, scientists, artists, writers, sportsmen and spo.rtswo.men. The growth o.f the market eco.no.my in the nineteenth century made possible o.ur prosperity and o.ur achievements. Indeed, at the turn o.f the century and into. the 1920s we were o.ne o.f the two. o.r thh!e wealthiest nations in the' world. In mot- tecent times, 'however,our m'arket ecbnbniY:has been subjeCt to some threat and So have 6i.it'.libetties and relative prosperity. The developrnentof markets led to the rise of democratic capitalism, broadenl<d private property rights and theeJ!:pansion of individual freedoms. This historicsu<;:qess of democratic capitalism as an economic system has brought an unprecedented standard of living to those who live under it. Private property rights protect the freedom of the individual to ,co,ntract his property and his labour. Property right-!lre part of civil rights that are essential to indiyidual freedom and, in the form of freedom to contract; constitute the overriding principle of a free market economy. The widening of civil rights also brought with the right to participate in the exercise of political power and the development of representative government. The sustained economic growth also brought with it in our just and compassionate society the emergence of so-called social rights, represented by, in financial terms, redistribution of portions of the wealth of the society to those in genuine need. The phrase 'social rights' is, however, a misnomer; 'social claims' being more appropriate. A government may recognise a social claim in legislation but repeal can take place at any time. Although social claims involve an inevitable curtailment of civil rights afi(- individual freedom it was and is a price that is paid so that those truly in need in our community may be sustained. Mr Deputy Speaker, the ever increasing advancement of social claims has, however, weakened the vitality of our nation. reduced initiative, imperilled our international competitiveness, curtailed our free market economy and created pockets of privilege for certain articulate and politically powerful groups in our community. The rising tide of taxes, deficits and foreign debt has debased our currency and lowered our relative standard of living. In plain terms, we are allowing governments to conduct our affairs so that we live beyond our means. Furthermore, we are permitting governments to implement policies that ,undermine the family, which is the basis of any civilised society. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my found conviction that if we are to maintain our free, humane and prosperous society the spread of social claims must be curtailed. We must start by putting our national finances in order. For years now the public has been delivering a clear message to us that taxes are too high and tax reform is necessary. Budget deficits and overseas gover-­ ment borrowings must be brought under control If we atet6keep'realint-,h!st flltesdownandrrieet the'Costofouiforeigridebt.' """" , "" ',',01 , i (, ) ..

We Canit not blame our Public Service for this situation because it is trying to give effectto our promises. We can only accept our responsibilities to trim spending growth by eliminating those pockets of privilege in our society while maintaining services to those in our community truly in need. Furthermore, the family unit, then subject toless tax than previously, would assume responsibilities, now being carried by governments. One of the major pockets of privilege in our society is the job protection cartel. The trade union movement, operating within the law, has a valid and vital role to play in our society. But in the last: 20 years the collective power of the trade unions has far surpassed that needed to perform its role and that power has been given to it by governments and industrial tribunals of which the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission'is the largest. It is one of the great ironies of our time that the Commission, which was established to protect the weak, the poor and the helpless, is now positively discriminating against them. Its deliberations, far, far from the relevant information generated in labour markets, have imposed on our society rigidity in our wage structure that is creating two classes-haves and have-notsdestroying our international competi-iveness, allowing strikes to become tpo easy and too rewarding, permitting productivity gain,S to be allocated to the workers rather, than spread through the community by, lower prices, encourpro- aging demarcation disputes and allowing ,the promulgation of awards that are unenforceable if broken by the unions and enforceable if broken by employers. Freedom for the working man began when he became able to contract for his labour with his employer.

"" Sensible tax and appropriate family and welfare policies should ensure that the decent working people of Australia will respond to a free labour market and those, of us who have worked on the shop floor with those people have a real admiration for their qualities and their ability to innovate and get a good job, done. If we are to redress the social claims imbalance, not only is a freer labour market needed, but we must move towards freer commercial markets. Collusion between major economic groups in our community, such as government, business and unions, is not necessarily in the national interest. In our educated community there are bound to be genuine differences of opinion on how to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. Corporate state arrangements mean in practice that the least controversial and the least effective course of action is taken. SoCial claims are also made by business groups taking the form of demands for protection, grants, bounties and subsidies. These create further pockets of privilege and deny consumers the benefits of forcing these groups to be more competitive'.Furthermore, as our, current account deficit difficulty presently indicates, we can only preserve our relative living standards, regrettably significantly reduced in recent weeks, by being competitive in world markets. We must not allow oUr resource industries to bear a disproportionate burden in our international trade. There is a further need to free our commercial markets by deregulation. As the private sector can t-tify, the continued weight of government regulations is taking more and more time, costing more and ,more money and, sapping more and more incentive.

' "" Sbcial claims in the community area, where dynari1icforces squeeze more and more concessions from compliant and weak governments, are undermining the basis of our democracy and our position as a free people. It is distressing to cite the recent disruption in the ANZUS alliance as an e)(arIiple. It is, however, inescapable that, by bowing to it minority pressure group, we have jeopardised our national security. We are intricately involved in the United States defense system, mainly through our mainland bases, and the ramifications of further disturbances in the alliance would be widespread. It should be noted that the present mutual reliance gives us the right to contribute to the nuclear disarmament debate in a constructive way. In education, Mr Deputy Speaker, social claims from vocal minority groups are leading to a deterioration in education standards and a growing discrepancy in those standards between public and private schools. Although we have new words to identify objectives in education, there is no fundamental need for those standards set in the past to be altered. We may have new words, like communications and computers, but those two Cs are no different from the old three Rs-reading and writing are the basis for communications and arithmetic is counting or computing. Academic excellence should be,the major goal of education, yet the lack of literacy and numeracy in teenagers, no ,doubt contributing to their inability to find jobs, is alarming. Pressures to avoid accountability to permit further delegation of the education process to schools and teachers at a local level, to eliminate external examinations, to adjust downwards the marks of those students who attend what are regarded as good schools and to adjust upwards the marks of those students who attend what are regarded as bad schools, all of which have been tried and rejected in the United States over the last two decades as creating a tide of mediocrity must be resisted if we are to preserve and enhance our education standards, leading to greater workforce opportunities for our children. The family is the basic unit of our civilised society and most Australians see their current life/ityles as being built around the family, the household and the work that provides the necessary support. ,Over the last decade we have allowed soCial claims to persuade governments to introduce policies that are weakening the fabric of the . family structure and eroding Its st-ndards i of ;-e­ haviotir.-hoseistan-ards were built on fre-d?m and security. Yet ll1creased government 1I).t-r­ ference is threatening freedom and govermnent social programs, subjecfto change either b{tegulation or at the whim of the bureaucracy, pr'qyide only a most uneasy security. We'need to protect and promote the stability of the family; leaving it free to take advantage of opportunities and to resolve its own problems. We need to provide p,olicies that enable the family to prosper.togetheF!l.nd not give benefits that encourage it to split apart. One of our prime objectives must be to f-shion financial policies that reduce taxation for the, - a.m­ ily, adjust real wages to be competitive, and give maximum incentives for the family to provide for its own welfare. Mr Deputy Speaker, we, in politics,' h-ve promised too much and delivered too little. We have taxed too much, spent too much and interfered too much in social problems that can be better resolved outside government by improved education, economic development, technological progress and allowing entrepreneurs to conduct their own affairs. It is now time to curtail the social claims that are reducing our relative standard of living and eroding our community structures. We need to allow the free market economy which has created substantial prosperity for our society to work effectively and without-interference, as it is now doing in some other western democracies. We must get our financial house in order, stop using taxpayers' money to buy votes for us, eliminate the pockets of privilege in our ciety, redress the balance between the trade union movement and those who employ its members, eliminate inefficient enterprises, become more competitive internationally, and protect only those in genuine need. We must stand fast against social claims in the community area and resist policies that weaken education standards and family values. These, then, are my signposts, my directions. Whether in opposition, by influencing government to follow them or by changing public perceptions to reflect them, or in government, in making policies to embrace them, if I can do that for as long as the electors of Deakin ask me to represent them, I will feel that my contribution to national affairs has been worthwhile.",39
43,Mr SAUNDERSON,PAIRS,"1 congratulate the previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), on his maiden speech, although I noticed that members of the National Party of Australia were a bit quiet with some of their 'hear, hears' when he was talking about doing away with bounties and other such thirigs'.Ne\\erthe1e-S;r-Mstirethathe will b'e\;onttibuting further to thisPar}jament: In: titlking to the Address-in-ReplY'iriOtioH., one has to'. consider that' the GoverilIrient''is moving into its second term. We can look babk'-twhat'it achieved 1n the 20-odd months of its fitst term but' We should not thlnk'tlia.t We are the b\i.lyoneS'whohavesomething to offer. We should, in fact, look at the performance of other governments to see what they have done and what we can learn from them. ,I "" i ' I ; ' ,,'. One of the governments ,whose perfofll).al)ce we need t9 look at verycar-fully is the Cain Lapor Government in Vict.oria.lt. js just compl-ting its first term of office and I·think that we can learn a lot from the way that it ,hils operated within Victoria. When it came to povernment in 1982 it replaced a government which had, been in office since 1956. That Government had. allowed the State to run down totally. It had .been corrupt; it had involved itself in land deals, about which most of us will recall the enormous publicity at that time; it had sold off most of the public housing stock and depleted facilities which the general community required. Public transport and public utilities were in a total mess. Government administration had become lax and inefficient. The Cain Governmerit, like our Government, faced enormous problems, and not just with getting the system working again. When it came to office, unemployment was extremely high,particularly amongst the young. It set out on a twopronged attack. Firstly, it looked at a way of reinvigorating the public enterprises that existed in so- Victoria. It bas had some enormous successes in the terms of improving those facilities. Probaply the most successful has been in the public transport area. It has reinvigorated the whole public transport system, modernised its management and, more importantly,. achieved the things it promised it would. There had been promises from the previous Government for some 15 years to build a transport centre in the area where I live, Box Hill, but in fact it never got around to it. Yet the Cain Labor Government has been able not only to promise to do it but also to do it. It has completed and opened a modern transport system which has improved the services in the eastern suburbs. The Government has not just concentrated on the public enterprise side of transport; it has increased significantly the number bf bus routes, both in public and private bus services. The community can take advantage of the improved train services and bus services and' the requirement for people to use their motor vehicles to travel everywhere within the eastern suburbsto a great degree has been lessened by the performanCe of the Cain Government. '. T-e Government .ills91 .1qoked .at inefflcil<!1cies wlthm the Governmp'}t system itself ll\1d s-t ab9ut reorganising the,qy,-si7g9yernme'1to-ganis­ ati<;>ns. that had sprU!1g ,up under tpe previous administration, which had no idea of· how to govern. Those qang(l-were eliminated by the Cain Government ands/;'!;h, things as water and sewerage have been co-ordinated and put into the one administration-another fine example of the Cain Government's efficiency in administration. It has improved the services of the Government Insurance Office and is now moving towards improving workers compensation. for Victorians. That will have a two-fold benefit; it will not just improve services for the workers but, in fact, it will improve the competitiveness of private enterprise, particularly small business people. Workers compensation is a very expensive part of the cost of employment. The proposition from the Cain Government will bring about very great reductions in the cost of workers compensation and will lift the competitiveness of private enterprise. The Cain Government did not just look at its administration, although it knew it was extremely important. Under the guidance of its Treasurer, Rob Jolly, it has lifted the economic position of Victoria tremendously. But when it came into office, as I said earlier, it was also faced with the problem of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. It introduced the employment initiative program, a program which is extremely successful and which has now been taken over by our community employment program, which is also proving successful. That employment initiative program laid the framework so that Victoria now has the lowest unemployment of any State. That program showed us what could be done. It provided the Federal Government with the knowledge that, when applied nationally, it would work very effectively, and our CEP program has in fact worked well. Because the employment initiative program was in train the administration of the CEP program has been easier in Victoria because the Government knew what was required. But the Cain Government is still not satisfiedneither are we-that enough has been done in the area of employment. Currently it is looking at the . introduction of a youth guarantee scheme. That will promise every youth that he or she can have either school work or a training program. That is a problem that the Federal Liberal Opposition.and the Victorian Liberal Opposition have failed to tackle. It is okay for people to come ill to the House with platitudes and slogans ab9ut free market trade not only in the market-place but also in employment, and all those sorts of things, but it does not address the problem of how to provide job-.The - iberals in Victoria have ,come - p with a ,Sqh,emef they cilJl tqe youth employment sch¥me, :E-. It is. supposed to mean 'Yes, Y0ll: can' get a J9- ,'.. - ut It really means 'Ye-, we can cut your w-ge-jn half', because that is really what it does. It'me'answe can all have a, job but we cannot reany-fford to live on it. .",42
44,Mr SHIPTON,PAIRS,Do you want jobs or don't you want jobs?,43
45,Mr SAUNDERSON,PAIRS,"Of course we want jobs but we ·want the sorts of jobs that we are offering and that the Cain Government is offering-real jobs with real wages. Evidence clearly shows that when· a government introduces programs which simply reduce the cost of employment by cutting wages all that happens is that people who are currently in permanent employment in fact lose jobs and employers employ people on cheaper wages. It does nothing to satisfy the need for new jobs. In looking three years ahead we have to look at what things need to be done. We know that im. provements can be made in our Government's administration. We have taken steps in our first term of office and we know that we have to take more. But we also know that it is important to look at the basic infrastructure of society, and put our effort into ensuring that that is improved. In order to do that, we need the co-operation of all areas of the community. As everyone in this House would know, the Hawke Government has been extremely successful in getting the cooperation of the community in. a consensus approach. The situation in Victoria has been exactly the same. The Cain Government has shown that it is able to work with all areas of the community and it listens to all the things that people have to say and takes them into account when it implements its programs. It has a real concern for the community at large, and it has shown that by the effort it has put not only into trying to resolve the unemployment problem but also into the provision of community services. Just down the road from my house is a vacant block of land which has been there for 15 years. Another of the promises that the Liberals trotted out every three years was: 'Yes, we are going to build a geriatric assessment centre out your way. Yes, there is the block of land', Every three years they would put up a little sign indicating where it would be.",43
46,Mr SHIPTON,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I ask you whether on this Addressin-Reply debate it is in order for the honourable member to make a cheap political speech on the Victorian election campaign. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! There is no poillt of order. I suggest to the - bnourable'in-m-er for Hi-i-s th-i' MrSp'-,fk6r IS very firm on frIvolous - omts of order. I----the does not try it a-ain. '",43
47,Mr SAUNDERSON,PAIRS,"Thank you,,:Madam times and called people crooks. Deputy Speaker. I congratulate you on your electionto your office. Opposition members ,do) not I , 'M-daui like to listen to comparisons of good and bad government because they know that the Government and the Cain Government have shown themselves to be very good governments compared to the former Federal Liberal-National Party Government and the former Victorian liberal Government. The vacant block of land in my area, at the end of my road, was the site for a geriatric centre which the former Victorian Government of promised to build so that the aged people, in parVictoria, ticular, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, would have the facilities that they required. Fifas teen years they have been waiting. The Cain Government, almost as soon as it came into office, began the work. The building, on that block of land, is just nearing completion and will soon be operation. As I said, the people in the eastern urbs of Melbourne, particularly the will gain a tremendous benefit from that service being provided. The Cain Government has put enormous into trying to build up again the stocks of public housing, stocks that had been criminaHy sold off by the previous Administration so that thousands of peopl- in Victoria - ould not get decent housing at decent rates. The Cain Government has started the reversal of that process and the increased funding under the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement wiil ensure that the Cain Government will be able to continue its program of improving the public housing stock., Child care is another area in which the Cain Government has moved effectively. We have assisted by providing capital to allow new child care, centres to be opened but the Cain Government has ensured that additional funding for the, staffing of those centres is being made available. In all those areas we have something to from the way that the Cain Government has operated. We can see all the things it has we take notice of those things, it will only enhance our chances of having a good record at the end this term of office. I, reiterate that some of the problems the Opposition has are caused, perhaps, because it lacks the planned policy approach that the Labor Party adopts. Its leaders tend to their concentration and make mistakes in their speeches. We had Malcolm Fraser in 1983 telling everyone to put money under' their beds lind that ihtr(:6rhfutinists *er-leil-iYwhere. Of course, that 'co-{hiili:dea:rlyi'n'tp'e bl-ction ih1983 when the "".,,"" < pullHc rejected his 'a:-ptoach. Before we went to the pblls recently Aildtew lost his cool a couple of \ r i I: - '-f-' .

48,Mr SAUNDERSON,PAIRS,"The Leader of the Opposition lost his cool a few times and called people crooks and other' such things, The community made its judgment and; of course, the Opposition lost at the polls in December. We won the last election and we are in government for three years. That is why we are making speeches from this side the chamber. The Leader of the Opposition in Mr Kennett, is having difficulty too. He knows his policies are not winning any votes and, one of my colleagues said earlier today, he has a problem with foot in mouth disease. He has not only virtually accused the Victorian Premier of being a child molester but also accused the Vicin torian caucus of being a death squad. It will go out suband shoot all those people in Victoria who do not aged people, vote for the Government!",44
49,Mr SHIPTON,PAIRS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I ask the honourable member to effort withdraw the words 'child molester'.",44
50,Mr SAUNDERSON,PAIRS,"I withdraw those words. People voted for the Australian, Labor Party in 1983 because they saW that it had clearly laid out policies and responsible leadlfrswho do not make verbal assaults on their opposition. I think the result in Victoria will be pretty much the same. People will support a government which has shown itself to be sound and efficient and which clearly ha!1a concern for the community rather than an opposition with policies which are obviously not sound and a leader who cannot be sure of providing a strong performance. We won in December and the John Cain Government will win this Saturday. That will ensure that the living standard of the people in Victoria will continue over the next four years to improve. The Cain learn Government's co-operation with 'the Federal Government has been an' enormous success and done. If 'has enabled mimy of our programs to be implemented without the sort of confrontation we of get from some of the Premiers who are in opposition to our political party. We have made a commitment to implement the program that we have started. We have also given a commitment in the lose area of peace and' disarmament. The Cain Government has shown a fine example of this : with its declaration of a nuclear-free State. That Government has a clear conscience in the way it approaches peace and - i-armament. Then-t,i0!1al Government has given· a strong commitmeJ?t, to pursue that approach. P-ople can look at the approach of the State Government on this matter with pride. In summary, Madam Deputy Speaker, I.refer to the reduction in Australia's inflation rate from double digits .under the previous Government to single digits. The inflation rate is less than half the previ,ous rate, interest rates have stabilised and the housing industry has been boosted by our initiatives and programs. Victoria has had just as much of a success story. Unemployment, as I said earlier, is now the. lowest in the country. Inflation is at the same level. We can only congratulate the Cain Government on its fine performance over the three years. We are sure that it will be in government for four years and the Victorian people will do well. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Before I call the next speaker, the honourable member for Braddon, I remind the House that this is a maiden speech, and I ask the House to extend the usual courtesies.",44
51,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. May I at this stage congratulate you on your election. As well, I ask you to pass on my congratulations to Mr Speaker. I quote: We have mineral wealth; the capacity to feed ourselves twenty times over; a small population; a healthy climate; and plenty of space, but in the past decade Australia has shown every inclination to self-destruct. That is a quotation from last Saturday's Weekend Australian Focus article 'What's Gone Wrong with Australia?' I think if we read carefully the signs in Australia at this present time in history we could almost say that we are facing the dieback social problems of Australia. As previous speakers have alluded to, Australia was once number one in the world per capita income table. We have dropped down to twelfth and now to sixteenth position, and it is estimated that, unless we do something about our society, we will drop further down as we approach the year 2000. The series of articles which followed described Australian society in a very factual manner. was in contrast to the broad generalisations in Governor General's Speech that were used to describe the progress made by the Thirty-third Parliament which lasted for only 21 months. further convinces me that the perspectives so freleaders quently given by this present Government gross distortion of the Australia being experienced by families and individuals in our cities, leafy streets of suburbia and in the rural regions far .bori:zons where the. m,iners, fanners, timber ft;)Je,-- - nd labourers swe-t an-toiltoprodJlce approjumatdy 80 per cent. of Australia's export income-the products that are vital if we are to maintain our present living standards. As one receiving input from various forms of media, and in talking to fellow Australians, I cannot but become acutely aware that a strong, largely unconscious search is being undertaken to identify those values and principles that will take us to our bicentennial and'into the twenty-first century with a sense of hope'and dignity. I refer honourable members to the' editorial of today's Australian which is headed: 'Defending the basic values of our society' I would like to read a small section of that editorial: It goes without saying that economic questions, unemploylnent and inflation, remain at the forefront of our political debate. But it is equally true that once the voters come to believe their government has lost its zeal for defending the values on which society depends they will look elsewhere for leadership. The regaining of that trust which it is now losing must be the Federal Government's most urgent priority. Australians are looking for those values and principles that make strong yet humble individuals, independently-minded yet community-conscious people, fulfilled yet ever-developing individuals who will make this an even gre'ater nation. People are tired of a smorgasbord approach to life whereby their leaders appear to be as lost and unpredictable as the next person in society, where education systems prefer to leave children to pick the fruit from the trees of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values as they best see fit and where governments prefer to govern by popularity ratings rather than by conviction. As a nation we would do well to focus our minds on those values that are embodied in the concepts of God, Queen, country and flag and on the principles of justice, integrity, humility and mutual respect-God because he is the source of all things in this universe; the Queen because the monarchy represents the system which has governed this country very well for 197 years and because there resides within the monarchy an amount of wisdom which is passed on from one genera,tion t.o another and which canThis not be passed on in any other form; our country the because it is. our lifeblood and we ought to be totally committed to it; and our flag because it represents so many of the things which we in It Australia stand for. When nations and their do not give priority to these values, there is are a no consistency of behaviour and they become tossed like a pork on the oceans. I believe the rein the cent ANZUS and MX missile crisis illustrates of well the lack of commitment by this Government to the defence of this country and a hlck dnnte-­ rity in iueetingour oblig-tions.The Libefat-ahY and thecoalitiQnparties kriow 'where the.Vsi,-iiaThey fully support! the ANZUS 'Treaty and'they are unequivocal ,on m-eting Honourable members would no doubt be aWare of the strong team of five Liberals who represent Tasmania in this House. This situation began in 1975 when all seats were won by the Liberals and, if this Parliament runs its full term, the record of 12 years of unbroken Liberal representatidrt ofall seats in a State will be an enviable one. Although the members of the team have changed, I assure the House that the same team spirit generated in the past nine years is as strong as ever. I thank in particular Ray Groom and his wife Jill f()r the help and the work done in the seat of Braddon and wish them all happiness in the future. My electorate of Braddon contains some of the most beautiful scenery and some of the richest agricultural land in Australia. It comprises eight main towns, namely, the city of Devonport, which I am pleased to say is now entirely in Braddon following the recent redistribution; my home town of Ulverstone; the beautiful town of Penguin; the geographical centre of the electorate, Burnie; Somerset; Wynyard, the town that needs its airport upgraded so that the region and the west coast of Tasmania can be adequately serviced for the next decade; Stanley, the picturesque town nestled at the foot of an old volcanic plug known as the Nut; and Smithton, which services one of the best dairying areas in Australia, if not the best. Each of these centres has rich grazing and cropping hinterland that produces a wide range of vegetables, fat lambs and cattle which are processed for the Australian market, exported or marketed locally. Lying midway between Victoria and Tasmania is King Island which has a unique life style. If one wants a quiet, relaxing holiday away from smog, telephones and crowds of people, I can thoroughly recommend it. The hard working people of Btaddon are selfmotivated, resourceful and enterprising and are linked by strong family bonds. They cherish the freedom that comes from having work and having been in families and are deeply concerned about those unemployed and others who cannot experience the security of happiness and acceptance of being part of the family. At this point I would like to thank the people of Braddon. for the honour and privilege of being their representative in Canberra. They can be assured that I will champion their collective interests and promote a future for Australia that giveS Tasmania, amj. any other State for that matter, a fair go. Loyalty to representing the needs' arid' aspirations of north-west cd-sters, Tasmani-ilsand Austr-lianswill be my goal. ; i, .' '. "" Ii. "" , At the moment some very deep concerns and ,. its obligations: , ,I' ,',' ,;"" even crises are being experienced by people within my. electorate. I mention the plight of the young and the middle aged people who are without work; the frustrations of young families involved in the dairying industry who, through no fault of their own, are at this moment facing severe financial hardship; and the employees of contracting industries who do not have the necessary skills or personal attributes to make the change. But at present the assets test is causing widespread anxiety. Family after family in my electorate believes this is a travesty of justice. Where is the justice? This Government talks a lot about equity but it does not talk a lot about justice. Where is the justice when a person can have a piece of real estate worth $200,000, $300,000 or $lm in any of the larger cities or popular tourist resorts of Australia and receive the pension, but a small business person or a farmer with a property worth $150,000 cannot? Where is the justicl(? If people believe that only those of Liberal persuasion are being affected, they - re quite wrong. I met two people in my electorate during the' campaign, both of them waterside workers, who said: 'I have never voted Liberal before in my life but because of the assets test I am going to change'. It is affecting many people throughout our community. The Government prides itself on striving for equality but in so doing· it ignores a far higher value; that is, justice. I think its concept of equality is the sharing of miseries. The ideology of this Government is simply based on a misguided assumption that people are equal. Quite frankly, people are not equal, not because of the family they are born into as such .but due to their make-up at birth. No amount of government interference will ever change that diversity. It is from that fundamental diversity of people. that the richness of individuality develops and provides a nation with a heart and a soul. The assets test, while being sold ori the basis of achieving equality, is designed mainly to reduce gradually the capacity of families and individuals to live independently of governments. Other evidence of this Government's uncaring socialist policies is seen in its determination to rriake government all powerful and families pawns to be manipulated on the chess board of history. I mention the following that this Government pursues with this aim: Creating a large bureaucracy that has to. be sustained by taxpayers; increasing taxes by over 22 per cent in' 1983-84, the largest increase by an Australian government in 40 years; incurring large deficits to fund the e--anslOn of programs aliC?n to the long term well. ' , ., - , ' I . , . being of the overwhelming majority of Au-­ tralians. The debt this country is building is mortgaging the future of young Australians who not only will have the normal commitments of buying a car or a house but also will have the national debt to pay. Ordinary Australians have come to realise that big government does not mean better government and bigger bureaucracies do not mean better services. The Government is acutely aware of the need to raise more revenue. It is for this purpose, and this purpose only, I believe, that the tax summit has been called for July after the suggestion was proposed to our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by a journalist in the heat of the campaign. This illustrates the vulnerability of leaders to being tossed about by the latest idea unless they act according to principle. Recently considerable exposure has been given to the problem of drug addiction. This problem is a natural consequence of a philosophy that there is no right or wrong-or, if it feels good, do. it. That philosophy has been rampant for many years in a large proportion of the population and is based only on a principle of self-interest and self-indulgence. The prime educators, the parents of this great nation of the last 25 years or so, have been bombarded by such conflicting evidence and advice from so-called experts on how to bring up their children that they have opted for a position which can be summed up in comments like these: 'Well, you are old enough to know what is right; go and have a good time' or 'You go and find your own way in life'. This has been done under the guise of allowing our young people to develop independently and with freedom. In the schools many topics once discussed within a framework of knowing right and wrong are now debated and discussed as if there are no ground rules, indicating that our long cultural heritage has been devoid of any long lasting guiding principles, which is simply not the case. The student has to work it out for himself or herself without any guidance, and so often the unsaid thought is: 'Be it on your own head.' It is not my prerogative to tell you what is right or wrong. After all, who amI, or anyone else for that matter, to tell somebody what to do?' That is the stance the teachers have been taking. In general they are just reflecting the attitudes presented by our leaders in our society. In trying to help our young people stand on their own feet we have created a situation of the blind leading the blind and the uneducated leading the inexperienced as youngsters talk amongst themselves in an endeavour to find out those constants that will help them make their way in life. 111. a, - t;neral way man- adults in ,our, c?mmllni-y haveabdic::ated their responsibilities ,or at least -, 'I ' .. - h,Maway from the tough decisions r-uired to make this nation strong from within the he.arts and 'minds of its people. When young people, and other people' for that matter, choose what' they like with no regard for mutual respect or accountability to others, we are shocked at the huge social cost. That is the reaction we have. L,et me just remind honourable members of some of the things in our society which we are deeply disturbed about: Heroin addition, vandalism, breaking and entering, burglary, the so-called poor attitudes of some school leavers, single parent families, and unemployment. No amount of education of the type that we have had and no amount of money allocated by this Parliament or any government will solve many of these problems. One has only to look at the newspaper comments last week about the social situation here in the Australian Capital Territory. It is the best educated community in Australia with the highest incomes in Australia; yet it has the biggest drug problem. That illustrates the problem. We have to get at something in the heart and soul of the people. It will not matter how much money we put into education; that will not solve the problem. I quote afamous former member for my electorate, Dame Enid Lyons: The problems of government are not of blue books, not problems of statistics, but problems of human hearts and human feelings. Yet it is not the role of government to force people to change attitudes by legislation. If the leaders of this great nation desire to change attitudes and values they should do so ,by convincing a majority of people before legislating and not after. Let me illustrate by using two examples of recent times how this present Government ignored this fundamental principle of a free democracy, legislated first and then tried to convince the people second. First, in an area of Tasmania which was formerly part of my electorate it used all the force of the law to override the express wishes of Tasmanians by preventing a hydro-dam being built. This was seen to be all the more unprincipled when, during the last election, it was not prepared to act in the same manner over Daintree Rainforest. Where is such a government's integrity? Secondly, there has been the opening of the floodgates to pornography and violent videos. I have listened to some of the new Opposition members talking about family matters, and I just trust that members on the Government side will do everything they can to look after families and not do what this Government did in its last term. The subsequent outcry clearly illustrates the people were not convinced by, are not convinced by, and indeed are strongly opposed to, such a change in permitted standards. It was left to the States, not the Government, to express the wishes of the people. That is a tragedy. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, h;t us remember that the only authority governments have is dependent on the mutual co-operation of the people, that the only power that governments have is given by the consent of the people, that only money governments have is provided by the people, and that each time this House passes new legislation it affects the lives of men, women and children.",45
52,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. JUSTICES (LONG LEAVE PAYMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1985 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed.,48
53,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, I congratulate the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) on his maiden speech. cussions This is my first speech as the member for Calwell, a newly-created seat in Victoria. Before I goon to the main theme of my speech I want to say somelations thing about tl1.e great Arthur Calwell, after the seat has been named. Arthur Calwell was, course, the leader of the Australian Labor Party for many years. He was in fact a man of enormous principle and dedication. He was a man who put up the' philosophy of the Labor Party and supman ported that philosophy even when that philoshandling ophy was electorally unpopular, as it was in the early days of opposition to the Vietnam war. Arthur Calwell was a man of deep compassion the poor and the underprivileged in our: commay occur. munity. He was a person who believed that the democratic socialist philosophy of the. Labor Party could be brought into play in such a way that it could bring about a fairer and more just - ociety. Arthur Calwell was also the acknowledged chitect during the. Chifley Government of Australia's post-war. immigration program. That Australian' Labor ,Party immigration program, which was continued by successive conservative governments, was based, on courage and vision. The consequence was the .buildingof Australia into a multicultural society through the impact the successive waves of migration. This is the most enduring testament of the work of the great Arthur Calwell. I believe that it is particularly appropriate that the first member for Calwell is himself a migrant and a person who came to Australia as a child under the program initiated by Arthur Calwell. '",48
54,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! It being.2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order lOlA. The honourable member for Calwell the will have leave.to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA NA  an immediate meeting of the ANZUS Councilthat is,at the Foreign and Defence Minister level-so that all three alliance partners can work together to prevent the utter destruction, of the ANZUS alliance, which is, as We have said, fundamental to our nation's security interests? I remind the Prime Minister that Article VII of the ANZUS Treaty provides that 'the Council should be so organised as to be able to meet at any time'.",48
55,Mr HAWKE,ANZUS TREATY,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I assure him that distook place with our friends in the Unitt(d States of America when I was there about What are the best sorts of things t() do to ensure that rebetween Australia and the United States whom can be maintained. We are concerned also with of trying to maintain relations between Australia and New Zealand at· the operative l-vels. The question of the calling of a. meeting of the AN-US Council, to which the honourable gentlereferred, is also under consideration. ,We are this aspect of the matter, as indeed all others, in a way which"" by our· calculatiOl).sand thqse of our friends, is bestcalcuJated to minimise for the damage to the trilateral relationship which I assure the Leader of the Opposition that; as a government, we will be doing nothing which Will exacerbate the real difficulties which exist In that respect we are at one with the Administration of the United States. I am quite prepared to keep the arLeader of the Opposition informed of developments in this regard. I hope and indeed believe from his reaction that he would' not want to see anything done which uildulydamaged the relationship. We all want to' get back to the most effective operation between the three of us. I am more than· pleased to give him an .undertaking of that I will keep him informed of what develops. VICTORIAN ELECTION: FINANCING OF NA",48
56,Mr OKEEFE,PROMISES,My question is directed to the Treasurer. The Victorian Leader of the Opposition has claimed that he would finance nearly a billion dollars worth of election promises by cutting general administration expenses. These include some very substantial items of funding provided by the Commonwealth Government for specific purposes. Will the Treasurer comment on the propriety of this approach?,49
57,Mr KEATING,PROMISES,"I have had the opportunity of examining reports on the Victorian Liberal Party's document on the cost of its election promises. It is a most extraordinary document indeed. Mr Kennett has made over-Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. It was quietly drawn to your attention that this is a matter not pertaining to the responsibilities of the Treasurer of Australia. Why are you allowing it at the moment ifit concerns Victoria?",49
58,Mr SPEAKER,PROMISES,"Order! If the honourable member for Moreton had been listening he would have heard that the question contained a referenc,e to ComlIlonwealth special purpose grants.",49
59,Mr KEATING,PROMISES,"Mr Kennett has made over 400 promises to the Victorian electors, costing around one billion dollars. When asked the obvious question 'Where is the money coming from?', he said that he would save $IOOm or $200m each year by cutting back on general administration expenses. He instanced the rise of general administration expenses under the current Victorian Government. He has made a quite fundamental accounting error in seeking to imply, having seen general administration expenses rise in the Budget accounts and - aid that they should rise by only a certain proportion or by a certain percentage rate, that the gap, could be offset against savings to cover his promises. Part and parcel of those administration expenses are major items which are not primarily administrative and which a State government cQuld notlegally appropriate to any other use, a conspicuous example being the Commonwealth employment funds of around $120m which are allocated to the States for employment projects. These sums are not primarily administrative and it would be illegal for any State to misappropriate them for any other purpose. Another example is the superannuation of State, employees, which adds up to $80m. Again these funds belong to the contributors. What we have in Victori!l is the prospect of the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, were he to become Premier, contemplating breaking the law by misappropriating Commonwealth funds from general expenditure so that he may cover a plethora of irresponsible election promises which he has no hope of covering. In conclusion, I quote from an article on this very point in the Age newspaper. Tim Colebatch of that newspaper said: The fact remains that the Liberals' policies do not add up. I concur fully and, completely with that conclusion. DEFENCE CO-OPERATION AND NA",49
60,Mr SINCLAIR,EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE,"I ask the Prime Minister: In the light of the New Zealand Government's position that nuclear ships are not welcome in New Zealand ports and the British Prime Minister's position that no British naval ships would visit New Zealand while this policy prevailed, could he advise the House what steps he and his Government are taking to ensure that defence cooperation and the exchange of intelligence under the five-power arrangements between Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore and Britain do not terminate in the same way as they have under ANZUS and in the defence relationship between New Zealand and the United States of America?",49
61,Mr HAWKE,EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE,"I shall make just two points in regard to the question' asked by the Leader of the National Party of Australia. Firstly, I remind him that I said yesterday that we will take every step, as far as possible within the province of this Government, to ensure that, as a result of the decision that has been made by the United States, the position of Australia is not prejudiced in any way whatsoever. The Minister for Defence's answer to a question asked by the right honourable gentleman yesterday also made it clear that we would be more than prepared to brief hirn and the Leader of the Opposition as to what was being done to ensure that the proprieties and Australia's interests were protected. I assure the right honourable gentleman that, in this other area to which he referred, the Minister for Defence will be holding the appropriate discussions. If any action has to be taken which is necessary in the circumstances it will be taken according to the same principles. In other words, our principles, are the same in that area; that is, Australia's interests and the contributions that it can make in the region will be protected. If there is any consequential flow-over into that region from the action that has been taken by the United States in regard to New Zealand, that will be taken into account in precisely the same way. NA Mr BRUMBYWill the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations inform the House whether Victoria has shared in a national improvement under the Australian Labor Party? Can he indicate what are the future prospects for the Victorian labour market?",49
62,Mr WILLIS,VICTORIAN LABOUR MARKET,"All honourable m-mbers would be aware that, since the Hawke Government has been in office, this country has experienced a very strong economic recovery and great improvement in the labour market. I am very pleased to say that Victoria has shared more than proportionately in that improvement. Over the past year Victoria has experienced the fastest rate of employment growth of any mainland State. A total of 67,000 new jobs have been generated over the year to January 1985, representing a 4.1 per cent increase compared with an increase nationally of just under 3 per cent. With only 26 per cent of the Australian labour force; Victoria has accounted for 38 percent of employment growth in Australia over the past year. That, obviously, is a very good record on the employment side. On the other side of that coin, unemployment in Victoria has also improved very substantially-;-it has fallen by more than 21 per cent or'about 13 per cent over the past year. The unemployment rate in Victoria has fallen by almost one and a half percentage points in the past year and currently stands at 7.8 per cent, which is the lowest of all Australian States and the only State below the national unemployment rate. In regard to young people, the number of young unemployed teenagers looking for full time work has fallen by 20 per cent over the year to January 1985. The unemployment rate amongst these young job seekers is the lowest rate for all Australian States and represents a fall of almost 7 per centage points in that unemployment rate. With regard to employment and unemployment there is no doubt that the State of Victoria has performed very well. Indeed, even with regard. to industrial disputation, there has been a dramatic improvement in that' State. In 1981 it had the second highest level of industrial disputation. In the year to November 1984 it was the second lowest in the country and over the last two years the number of days lost due to industrial disputes in Victoria has virtually been halved. So on both the employment and industrial relations side there has been a tremendously good performance by the Victorian Government. . I would like to say that on the basis of the cies which have \:>een put forward by the Cain Government for its next period of office, and thost: that have been put forward by the Opposition, there can be no doubt that a re-election of the Cain Governmt:nt is essential for. the continuance of this Very good performance in Victoria. In particular, let me say that the policy of the youth guarantee, which has been announced by the Cain Govenlment, will be a very considerable improvement for young people, providing a guarantee to all 15 and 18-year-olds tl;1at there will be ajob, education or training for them. That, indeed, is a very dramatic policy and one which offers infinitely more for young people than the idiotic youth employment scheme put forward by the Kennett Opposition, a policy which is totally ill-conceived, which would cover only one-third of the work force, which would probably result in higher rates of wages for some juniors because it has been so ill-conceived and would, almost certainly, result in· the displacement of many adults by juniors. The YES is definitely a no no. I am sure the people of Victoria will see that and vote accordingly on Saturday. NA  the Prime Minister. Will' the ,Prime Minister advise the House whether the Foreign Minister or any other Minister wrote to him expressing concern about the MX decision before the meeting between himself,the Foreign Minister and the Minister for Defence on 16 November 1983, which I remind him was the meeting which the Prime Minister has consistehtly represented as being the occasion from which his first undertaking to the Americans to assist in the MX missile tests flowed?",50
63,Mr HAWKE,MX MISSILE TESTS,"As I have made clear on a number of occasions in this place, I am not .prepared to go to the contents of correspondence between Ministers and myself. It ,is a practice that I have consistently followed and I am sure that my predecessors in office did the same thing. DEPORTATION: GONASEELAN FAMILY",50
64,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MX MISSILE TESTS,Has the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic; Affairs seen reports in the media regarding the deportation of the Gonaseelan family? Could the Minister advise the House whether these reports are accu.rate?,50
65,Mr HURFORD,MX MISSILE TESTS,"I can tell the honourable member for Grayndler that I have seen these.reports. They are accurate as far as they go, but I do not think by any stretch of the imagination one can say that the. reports, whether they are from poli- the ethnic affairs writer of the Sydney Morning Herald today or in the electronic media on other occasions, have been balanced. J think it is of value to the House if I give the facts about this case because I hope that there is applicability to lot of other cases in which members have a great ancelS. interest. Mr Ray Gonaseelan is a South African of here, Indian origin. He arrived in this country over two years ago with his wife and two children. He travwithdraw elled on a visa which gave him temporary resiseen dence in this country for three months. Before he left South Africa, as with all the others who travel on this sort of visa, he, signed an undertaking he would not look for and would not request a change of status. Thim, like so many others, sought to queue jump-that is what change of status is, it is queue jumping over those who legitimately applying to come to this country. jority There are over a million inquiries each year for which 70,000 places are available. First of all, he too. tried family reunion. He was visiting members of his wife's family, but he did not come within our necessarily strict guidelines if. we are going to manage to keep our intake into this country at manageable levels with the million inquiries that we are receiving. He then sought to come into country under the status of a refugee. Former Ministers for immigration and many others in this House will know that we have an visory committee called the DORS CommitteeMX missile? the Determination of Refugee Status Committee-to help the Minister in determining whether a person is a legitimate refugee. I can honourable members that I have faith in this Committee. I have seen the results of its work. I am glad to see that one of the former Ministers, the honourable member for Warrihgah, Is nodAffairs ding to say that he, too, has faith in that Comsonally mittee. The Committee thoroughly investigated. It diq not use just those who were friends South African Government in determining whether or not this person was a refugee; it sources such as our own mission sources in South Africa. The Committee rejected his claim in the advice that it gave me. Then Mr Gonaseelan tried on compassionate grounds. He used the fact that medical treatment was required for one of his children. That was thoroughly inve-tigatlid and one of the medical advisers in theDepartm.ent of Heal.thadvisedme that the sort of treatment necessary for the plaint was readily available in South Affica. when the ethnic affairs writer of the Sydney Morning Herald and the television reporters mainly list the claims made by people such as without giving any: idea of whether those claims are substantiated, and then merely list that Department and the Minister have rejected claims, I do not believe they are giving a balanced report. I make an appeal to them in this sensitive a area to make some effort to find out what the balI would also say to the House that everyone I believe, has sympathy for the victims of the regime in South Africa and its apartheid policies. I in f-vour of no one. I have been there, what is going on, been to treason trials and so on, but there is no way in the world that we can be a haven for everybody who comes here. We need that to go through the necessary processes to see whether people are genuine or noL I am sure that he I will have the support, if not of the mediocre members of the Opposition front bench who are are making these noises at present, of the vast maof this House if I say that the guidelines will be administered with firmness, but with sensitivity NA",50

I am looking forward to officially visiting Sri Lanka during that visit. Of course, I will take the opportunity of informing 'myself as well as I can on the most unfortunate communal dis'turbances which are taking place there. I have received many direct approaches from representatives of the Tamil population of Sri Lanka, less comso from the Sri Lankan community. The DepartSo ment of Foreign Affairs maintains a monitoring watch on what is developing in Sri Lanka from both our national representation there and conthis tacts which we have.

70,Mr NA BROWN,AGE TAPES,"The Attorney-General inay be aware that in answer to a question this morning the New South Wales Attorney-General said that he had had discussions with the Commonwealth Attorney-General concerning the authentication of the Age tapes and the granting of immunities for police officers involved in making the tapes-that is clearly a Federal matter as the New South Wales Attorney said-and that, I use his words, 'until the Commonwealth Attorney-General makes up his mind there is nothing further that I can say about it'. I ask the Attorney-General: When will he make up his mind about the granting of immunities? In the course of making up his mind, will he include a consideration of those tapes relating to the Cessna-Milner drug case and the events surrounding it?",52
71,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AGE TAPES,"It is true that there have been discussions between the Attorney General of New South Wales and me on what is regarded as the authenticity of the Age tapes. The honourable gentleman would know that the matter arose last year and was investigated by Mr Temby, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who furnished a report to this Parliament. That report indicated that the Australian Federal Police were aware of some interceptions by the New South Wales police in the period, surprisingly, when the honourable gentleman was Attorney-General, in 1981-82. . Mr NA BROWN - Acting.",52
72,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AGE TAPES,"Apparently nothing was done when he was Acting Attorney-General. It is obvious that if there were interceptions by the New South Wales police they were illegal. That is the position. The Director of Public Prosecutions has suggested that the matter be referred to Mr 1ustice Stewart to investigate further the question of authenticity. As I understand the position, Mr Justice Stewart has sought to interview 31 New South Wales police officers. Of course, they are under the control of the New South Wales Government. The New South Wales Police officers have indicated, through their solicitors, that they are not prepared to assisUn the inquiry or to give, any evidence unless they are granted indemnity in respect of their illegal intercep'tions.",52
73,Mr HOWARD,AGE TAPES,I don't blame them.,52
74,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AGE TAPES,"Although the honourable gentleman is saying that he does not blame them, the question is: Can one make one law for one person and another law for another? Mr MACKellar-The New South Wales Government is",52
75,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AGE TAPES,"It is not a matter for the New South Wales Government; it is a matter for me. That is the question I am considering at present on the basis that the people involved are police officers who a.re bound to give their utmost service to the lawful enforcement of justice in Australia. They have information which they feel would be of benefit but they 'were not prepared to give it earlier. They are now prepared to give it on the basis that they - o not Iluffer any penalty. There is no guarantee that they 'would suffer any penalty from the poiIit of view of strict evidence that may be admitted against them. That is my dilemma at present. The average citizen in Australia may ask: If police officers are granted indemnity, because they can intercept anybody's conversation, why should the law be enforced against other people and not the police officers?",52
76,Mr HOWARD,AGE TAPES,So you still think the tapes are fakes? ',52
77,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AGE TAPES,"What the Government has to look at is what is being put to me at present both by Mr Justice Stewart and Mr Temby. Irrespective of what further evidence is given, it is not likely to lead to the prosecution of any person. I make that point in answer to the honourable member's interjection. The other point I make is this: Mr Temby is of one view and Mr Justice Stewart is of another view, which certainly does not help me. I think there are further avenues that might be explored and it is convenient now, as the honourable member has asked the question today, to say that I had a discussion with Mr Justice Stewart this morning and he is prepared to explore further the other avenues on the basis that all the evidence available can be given to him. NA",52
78,Mr MILTON,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,Will the Attorney-General inform-the House of the total cost of providing information under the Freedom ofInformation Act for all departments for the last financial year? Will he also indicate what proportion of this figure is a result of parliamentarians seeking information under the Act?,52
79,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,"I cannot answer that question to the extent that the honourable gentleman may want me to; I will try to get further information for him. However, I can say that requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act are, escalating each month. At present they are running at a rate of 3,000 a month. This year the number of requests will perhaps total some 36,000. Last year they totalled 19,000. Last year the cost of answering the requests was $17m, so it is working out at an average of about $900 per request. It surprised meto find out that the amount we have collected from charges is $13,000. So there is a fair gap between what it is costing us to provide the information and what we are collecting. Let me make it very clear that a number of requests are made to enable people to correct thdr records. The bodies most involved in the provision of information under the Act are the Australian Taxation Office, and the departments of Veterans' Affairs, Social Security, Defence and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Those five account for about 50 per cent of all requests. I think· it is a matter that the Government may have to look at, not so much from the point of view of denying any information but from the point of how much it is costing. Perhaps the information sought can be given in a much easier fashion than by the present method. I understand that some parliamentarians make use of the provisions of the Act. About 100 requests have been made. One significant request made recently was by a former parliamentarian, Mr Newman, the former member for Bass. '",52
80,Mr GOODLUCK,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,A good member too.,53
81,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,"Yes, that is why he is no longer here! The Government may have to pursue the matter a bit further because Mr Newman has asked for all documents relating to all the travel expenses of Ministers over two years. I understand that the information sought involves 10,000 pages and it relates to every particular. I understand the cost-",53
82,Mr GOODLUCK,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,There is still no aspersion.,53
83,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,I am not making any aspersions. It is well known that any honourable member can have information on the cost that is incurred during ministerial trips but the gentleman asked for all documents-every single document.,53
84,Mr GOODLUCK,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,Somebody said something against him.,53
85,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,"Mr Newman is no longer a member of parliament. I make the point that the cost of providing that information will run into many thousands of dollars. The question arises: Would Mr Newman be prepared to pay for the cost of providing the information? Mr N.A. Brown-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you make a ruling as to whether it is proper' for a Minister, either the Attorney General or anyone else, to reveal publicly in this manner details of requests under the Freedom of Information Act made by· ordinary private citizens?",53
86,Mr SPEAKER,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,I accept that the honourable member for Menzies has asked a serious question. I think he will realise that. there are a number of facets to his query. I ask him to allow me to consider the matter and advise the House accordingly when I have done so. I think he will appreciate that to answer that sort of question off the top of my head may lead me into error. PRIVATE COMPANIES: DISCLOSURE NA,53
87,Mr TUCKEY,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,Is the Attorney-General aware of an article headline on page 1 of the Australian Financial Review of 22 February which refers to the intention of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities to introduce legislation 'in the current sitting of Federal Parliament' which will require extensive disclosure of finanoial information by private companies irrespective of their appointment of an auditor? I ask him whether he is further aware that the newspaper states: Public company competitors of private concerns would relish the access to this . . . financial data. I ask the Attorney-General: When will the Government introduce this legislation? Is it to be included in the legislation referred to by the Special Minister of State as legislation 'to reduce accounting and annual reporting obligations for most companies'? What benefit is expected for the general public from this gross invasion of business privacy? Why was this proposal deleted from the Ministerial Council Press release relating to these matters?,53
88,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"I am not aware of the details to the' extent that the honourable gentleman mentions them. He will appreciate that the Ministerial Council virtually puts us, as the national Parliament, in a position of legislating in accordance with its wishes. I attended the last meeting of the Council. It had made a number of earlier decisions which. I thought were made on the basis of giving business much more freedom and not imposing obligations to furnish as many documents' as were required by the respective State corporate affairs commissions. I am surprised that the honourable member has some report of which I am not aware and which, from the thrust of the question, indicates that private companies will be required to furnish details which could help their competitors. My information is that, particularly as about 80 per cent of the companies concerned are proprietary companies, the intention is to improve: the capacity of those companies or corporations to comply with requirements by making it easier for them to furnish their annual returns et cetera. I will take on board what the honourable gentleman has said. I have no intention of doing anything contrary to the wishes of the Ministerial Council, but I am not aware of that position. I have attended only one meeting, as the Council meets only every three months. I am not aware of that position. It seems to run counter to the whole thrust of what the Council is about, if the honourable gentleman's information is correct. ",53
89,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"That is not the point. The difficulty that we find with this what is called uniform companies legislation is that we have to have uniformity and consensus, and when it is there we are expected to draft the legislation. ",54
90,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"No, I do not have to agree. I have never participated in such a discussion. I make the point that, whilst this is a newspaper report, the Australian Financial Review usually has good access to leaks.",54
91,Mr TUCKEY,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,Are you against it?,54
92,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,I want to have a good look at it from the point of view that we are not in the business of trying to impede corporate affairs being conducted in a very efficient way. There is criticism of too much red tape and too much regulation. I am anxious to try to remove that. ,54
93,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"I know. But perhaps we should look at introducing some nationallegislation, with the Council's consent, particularly in the securities area. That would certainly help the business community more than having the nonsense that has been thrust on us, in that we have sit back and wait for six State Attorneys-I am not criticising them-to come to some agreement, with all the delay, the excess administration and the burden that imposes, because the previous Government would not accept uniform legislation. CANBERRA: PUBLIC BROADCASTING",54
94,Mrs KELLY,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Territories. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has recently granted a public broadcasting licence, in Canberra to a racing and sporting organisation spons()red by the Australian Capital Territory Gaming and Liquor Authority. Can the Minister inform the House whether the Tribunal ignored licensing ,criteria guidelines in this case?",54
95,Mr DUFFY,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"I am aware that, as the honourable member has indicated, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has offered a category S public broadcasting licence to Canberra ar,td District Racing and Sporting Broadcasters.' There were three other applicants, as the honourable member is aware. The ABT report noted that all applicants, with one exception, had presented a good case for the granting of a licence. The licence was awarded to the Canberra and District Racing and Sporting Broadcasters primarily because of the fact that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal: . . . found that there is a lower level of unmet need within the overall community'and leSs demonstrated support for CSPR's-which was one of the applicants""':"" proposed service than that of CDRSB. I indicate to the honourable member and to all honourable members that the granting of a licence in this case, and in all other cases, is a matter for the Tribunal and not for the Minister. The Government accepts that this is essential if the Tribunal is to be perceived as an independent body, and I have no further comment to make on the matter. AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR: DEVALUA,TION",54
96,Mr IAN CAMERON,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"I ask a question of the Minister for Primary Industry. Win the devaluation of the Australian dollar ,and the resulting pressure on borrowings tp meet advance wheat payments result in any change to the guaranteed minimum price for wheat prior to October 1985?",54
97,Mr KERIN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"I am not quite sure whether this is a question for the Treasurer or for ine. The Australian Wheat Board has issued a statement on this matter and I draw the honourable member's to attention to that. It states that the devaluation of the Australian dollar causes the Australian Wheat Board no' concern. The Board is' engaged in sophisticated actions with respect to futures trading and foreign exchange cover. If the honourable member wants some detailed response to his question, I will certainly provide it to him. MELBOURNE: URBAN ENVIRONMENT LICENCES Mr GRIFFITHS-Can the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services indicate what initiatives the Government has taken to enhance the urban environment and residential amenity of Melbourne-s western and north-western suburbs?",54
98,Mr UREN,OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"My Department-has been particularly involved in two major programs. The first program, which we commenced in the first year of our Government; was the regional community development program. In that program we work in co-operation; with the State Government and local government to carry out schemes and projects to examine the social and physical infrastructure of regions. I am pleased to say that, arising out of those, studies, ,yesterday I announced; jointly with my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and the Victorian Ministers for Planning and Environment and Water Supply and nine projects under the natural areas enhancement scheme that will help to develop the surrounds and foreshores of the Maribyrnong River, Korbroit Creek and also Merri Creek in Melbourne's western and' north-western region. Honourable members opposite appear not to be interested in areas that are bein'g enhanced. The Maribyrnong River has been exploited over the years by past governments and government departments, as well as the private sector. I am pleased and proud to say that this Government has made a contribution of $2.14m and that' the State Government and local councils have contributed $350,000. This will create employment for another 179 workers. The Commonwealth Government is working with State and local governments to overcome many of the social problems of' the western region of Melbourne. People have been deprive,d of areas such as the foreshores of the Maribyrnong River in the past. Our Government is involved with people and is concerned to alleviate social problems and provide rec.r:eational oppo-tunities. The. western region of Melbourne has been exploited by all governments and by private enterprise in the past. Commonwealth departments, in 'particular, have alienated .large areas of the river foreshores. The Government, working with the' Victorian Government and local government authorities, intends to ensure that those foreshores are. used in the interests of the people. Regrettably, in the past, particularly when conservative governments which had very little concern for the social and recreational problems of people have been involved, there was very little recognition of the .need for recreation areas for people in the western region of Melbourne. Such areas should be set aside for the' people. This Government is concerned with people, their living environment and the improved recreational environment for the people of western Melbourne. NA",55
99,Mr BURR,WAGES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the difference of opinion between· the Treasurer and the Prime Minister over the discounting of wage adjustments for inflation caused by exchange rates, can the Prime Minister clarify exactly what views the Government will put. to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on this matter?",55
100,Mr HAWKE,WAGES,"Any lack of clarity is not as between the Treasurer and myself, but in the mind of the honourable member. The issue involved in the honourable member's question is an important one and I want to deal with it with the seriousness that it deserves. We need to understand' that the inflationary impact of what is happening to our currency is not just a question of its relationship with the United States dollar, but also one of its relationship with the currencies in the rest of the world. The honourable member will appreciate that the movement of the dollar against the rest of the world's currencies has not been as great as it has been against the United States dollar. It is the case that if the trade weighted index to which I refer remained permanently at its present level-':no one at this stage can say whether it will-lhere could be a significant increase in the price of some internationally traded goods. I also remind the honourable gentleman of the fact that only about 15 per cent of our demand is imported, so we have to put that perspective against it. While lhedirect price effects of the' devaluation cannot be avoided, we will be concerned to ensure that they do not contribute to a renewal of an inflationary cycle which, as a result of the very successful economic policy of this Government, has been arrested. The people of Australia are enjoying the fact that the level of inflation in this country now as a result of our efforts is less than half that which we inherited from the, previous Government. It has to be understood that discounting of wage indexation, which is the subject of the honourable member's question, is only one of a number of means of avoiding a second round of inflation which can flow from the cause to which the honourable member referred. This Government will take these matters seriously into account. It is not only the question of discounting which has to be considered. A number of other methods are available to government to meet this problem. As I am sure the honourable member will appreciate, inrespect of the current case, it is not relevant because the prices that are reflected in the two quarters indexes that are before the Commission are not affected by devaluation. The issue will not arise until September of this year. 1 say, as ·did the Treasurer, that anything the Government does in formulating its' position in regard to not only the wage case, but also any other decisions we take, will at all times be consistent with two criteria: The general objectives of economic policy of trying to have an environment in which there is growth with low levels of inflation; and, consistent with that, the objective of ensuring the total maintenance of the prices and incomes accord. RURAL RESEARCH: FUNDING",55
101,Mr MILDREN,WAGES,I remind the Minister for Primary Industry of the commitment given by the Prime Minister in his recent rural policy speech during the election campaign to raise the level of funding for rural i:esearch. When does the Government intend to implement this commitment?,56
102,Mr KERIN,WAGES,"First, I remind honourable confirm members that the Government has already of increased government rural research funding my portfolio by $5m in each of our past two Budgets. Those decisions have raised our research funding from $23m to $33m a year. Also today repo-t was tabled in the Senate as a response to a Senate committee's inquiry into research and extension services. This was also recently agreed to by Cabinet. We have also established the national soil conservation funded to the extent of $4m this year. We have also deci<ied to establish a bureau ofrucal resources under my Department. We have with vigorously pursued the need to establish manageme ment regimes for our, fishe,ries to protect source and to bring some stability dustry. Each of these three propo-as also involves research funding and co-ordination. . To' answer the honourable gentleman's quesnational tion more specifically, I am pleased to announce that the Government has adopted the objective raising, within five years, the level of industry Commonwealth contributions to research to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production of industries included'in rural industries research funds. decision establishes an objective to be ,met by government in partnership with industry. Most research under, the rural research trust funds ,now at a level of about 0.25 per cent of gross , of production, about half of the 0.5 per envisaged. So it follows that in the,next five the Government's contribution to rural .research funding will be able to increase so long as the evant industries are prepared to match, dollar for dollar, the Government's new funding, objective and policy. We are also taking step's to ensure that the funds are spent effectively. To this end, I ihtend to introduce in this session of Parliament the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Research and Development Bill and the Rural Industries Research Bill. NA NA  the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General will recall that he answered a question on Tuesday about the proposed move to Canberra of the Australian Security Intelligerice Organisation headquarters and ASIO staff. In the course of the answer, he said: They had a meeting and decided by a majority, we were told, that they would not transfer to Canberra. Has the Attorney-General had an opportunity to refresh his memory on this matter? Can he now that he was advised that, at the meeting ASIO staff, the staff resolved by an overwhelmin ing majority that .the move to Canberra' should . proceed? Will the Attorney""General also confirm that he has received advice from the Directora General of ASIO that the ,need to proceed with the transfer is urgent and that any delay would prejudice the operational efficiency of ASIO and na,tional security itself and throw into chaos both ASIO staff and the transfer of personnel and program. It has, been equipment?",56
103,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,I did have a meeting two representatives of ASIO staff who told that on a national basis;-I emphasise that it the rewas felt that the move to Canberra should to the fishing inproceed: ,56
104,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"Yes. It was felt on a basis that the move ,to Canberra should proceed. I am delighted to. know that they of recorded that conversation ,with me and gave a and copy to the Leader. of the Opposition. When the Leader of the Opposition asked a question of me earlier this week he had the decided advantage of This me. I must say that the miriutes they gave him probably did not encompass a,11 those matters. ' I Let me come to the most interesting point. In is this day and age of freedom of information, why value should I not tell the Leader of the Opposition cent what happened when the Director-General of yea,rs ASIO saw me yesterday. I said: ' Mr Director General, I understand that: the staff of ASIO feel relthat, on a national basis, they should.come to Canberra'. He said: 'Yes, that is right'. I said: 'What about on a Melbourne basis?""Well', he said, '98 per cent favour the move to Canberra'. I asked: 'Does that mean that 98 per cent of them are going to come? 'Oh, no', he s-id, .'less than 50 per cent want to come'. I said: 'That would appe-r to make a rather severe' indentation into the staff we have at headquarters': 'Y-s', he said, 'It would, but, in the interests of ASIO, we think we should come to Canberra'. I said: 'The Government is trying to look at the interests of the natiQn from the point of view of security. If we lose more than half the staff that are in Melbourne, do you think we could overcoml} the problem?' He said something like this: 'A number of them have made arrangements to buy milkbars and other businesses. They desperately· wal).t"" ,as apparently happens----;c'",56
105,Mr HOWARD,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,You are making a joke of this.,57
106,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"I am not. The honourable member knows more about this than we will ever know. I will plead innocence, but the' honourable member knows a fair bit. What I am frying to say is this: The Government set out to say that it is important that we talk about the security services being in Canberra.' The staff of ASIO in Melbourne, as I told the House earlier this week, decided that they did not want to move, They decided further-this is the problem the Government faced-that they would want what are called termination payments, which would run into millions. of dollars. The Government has to look,at the national interest from the point of view of security. Jf secur,ity is the param\mnt consideration,why cannot the whole staff come to Canberra? That is the issue about which the Leader of the Opposition was fair enough to ask. It is very clear that because the staff have been in Melbourne so long-there is nothing wrong with this-and because they have family and domestic considerations, they do not feel that they are able to meet the Government's wishes to come to Canberra. That is the position. I am presently in the position, for the first time, of asking the Cabinet how it looks at the situation. Quite frankly, while it is very fair of ASIO to say that 98 per cent of its staff are in favour of'the move, less than 50 pet cent are in favour of moving. NA",57

127,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member may proceed. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-Myatterition has been drawn to remarks that were made yesterday in ENERGY this House, recorded on page 309 of Hansard, by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The honourable member was speaking about a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure that WaS brought down in this ,House. I have not been misrepresented in the fi-st Part of those, remarks, but I need to put the matter into, context. The honourable member for O'Cqnnor said: I am deeply concerned that although the then Chairman, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr L«o MCLeay), was an excellent chairman, whim the Parliament rose an interim report was submitted to the Parliament relating to the affairs' of the Aboriginal Development Commission. It was stated in that, report that a confidential report would be made to the Minister for A--, original Affairs (Mr Holding) regarding - atters arising that inquiry. My continual requests for information throughout the recess indicated to me-- ' that is, to the honourable member for O'Connorthat this had not been done-that is, the report had not been transmitted to the Minister. He then said: I put it on record that this",58
128,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The honourable member must proceed to where he was personally misrepresented. I appreciate that he is making his point, but it is a bit detailed. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-lam pointing out where I have been misrepresented. Further on in the honourable member's remarks he misrepresents me again. I will deal with the first misrepresentation. In the report that the Standing Committee on Expenditure brought down and in the tabling statement that I made, I said: It is expected that this report will be followed by two further reports-- . one of which 'would be a confidential report to the Minister. That report - as tabled on 5 October. On 11 October, as honourable members will recall, the House was dissolved. The House did not go into recess, as the honourable member for O'Connor thought it did. As most honourable members would be aware, when the House is dissolved all the committee- of the House disappear.

130,Mr LEO MCU,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"AY- Mr Speaker, for the honourable member for O'Connor to suggest that I should have forwarded this confidential report to the Minister is to suggest that the Minister and I would have indulged in a conspiracy to pervert the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives and, indeed, if one takes account of Pettifer's citation on page 581 of the-",59

Mr LEO MCLEA Y,- The second point is that the honourable member for O'Connor goes on to say: ' On the other ,-and, the Chairman of the Committee-- . that is, myselfis a Government member and, of course, the Minister-that is, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairsis naturally closely associated with him. I do not think that the Minister needed to wait to see that report. Quite clearly he should have got the information and taken some action on it-is a matter of great urgency.",59

143,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been mispresented?,60
144,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, Mr Speaker, by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay).",60
145,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I will allow the honourable member that indulgence but he must realise that this is to deal with misrepresentation.,60
146,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Certainly, Mr Speaker. The point I wish to make is that time and again in that speech I was at great pains not to criticise the Chairman or suggest that he had been at fault in any way, as he has claimed. My whole attack was on the total inadequacy of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) to look after taxpayers'money-",60
147,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor has exceeded his indulgence.,60
148,Mr HOLDING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. I claim to have been misrepresented.",60
149,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Minister may proceed. Mr - OLDING-I refer to. the statement of the .honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) where, having referred to allegations in respect of the acts of the Standing Committee on Expenditure, to which your attention has been drawn, he went on to sayan the other hand, the Chairman of the Committee is a Government member and, of course, the Minister is naturally closely associated with Minister needed to wait to see the report. Quite clearly he should have gotten that information and taken some action. on it. The implication in that is that there was some sort of complicity between the Chairman and myself.",60
150,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, there is not.",60
151,Mr HOLDING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Well, that was clearly the implication; but if the honourable member says it is 110t, I will accept that. But also I will say this: When the report was published I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee asking him to forward me a copy of the report. He subsequently called upon me to point out the constitutional difficulties in which he found himself in that as the House had been prorogued he was not able to present the report. The statements made by the honourable member for' O'Connor are without foundation and are typical of the contemptible smears that he continually makes of members of this place.",60
152,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The Minister should not have made that last remark. NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE-UPDATED NA Ministerial Statement,60
153,Mr DUFFY,COST,"Holt-Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Territories)-by leave-Following the practice established by my predecessors, I wish to inform honourable members of the updated estimated cost of the new Parliament House. The updated building budget is $513m and the updated non-building items budget is $131m-both figures being in August 1984 dollars. Both updated budgets include the earlier approved estimated cost of the extensions to the building required to accommodate the additional senators and members. The additional accommo"" dation is being provided within the construction program by means of extensions to the eastern and western wings of the building which had been provisionally planned for in the original design competition submission. The project is now entering its most intensive phase with employment on the site in excess of 800 and expected to peak at over 1,200. As more of the structure of the building is completed the emphasis is moving to the finishes and interior fitting-out of the building. This stage of the work and the build up in the provision of non-building items, which cover furniture, communications, sound and vision equipment and a range of other facilities, mean that the economic benefits of the project are extending well beyond Canberra. him: I do not think that the Honourable members will· also be. pleased to know that the target opening date for the building of early 1988 is still considered achievable, despite the industrial dispute which closed the site for 14 weeks during 1984 and the significant additional scope of work involved in the building extensions. The finalisation of an industrial agreement covering the period through to the completion of the project should provide the basis. for industrial harmony on the site. It is essential, however; that all parties involved in the project co-operate during the remaining years if the project is to achieve the scheduled completion date.",60

Petition received. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The damage to Australia's national intetests by the Government's failure to act as it responsiblepai'tiier in the Western Alliance. ' I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the Standing Orders having risen, in their places- ' .",61
155,Mr MACPHEE,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Wemust remember that the ANZUS situation, which is now in a state of grave disrepair, is of consequence to the entire Western alliance. There is no doubt that ANZUS is an integral part of the Western alliance, and it is seen to be such by other countries, whether they are formally in the alliance or nonaligned in the Third World. The damage which has been done essentially represents a taihire on the part of the Australian Governm.ent to understand the nature of its relationship with our ANZUS partners. It represents a failure to urtderstand the need for public harm.ony and for private honesty. The first manifestation of this was when the Minister for Foreign Affairs { Mr Hayden) began to be critical of the United States as though it was United States intransigence which had kept the super-powers from arms cont-ol talks. The facts are that the Americans proposed the strategic arms reduction program, suggesting that the number of arms be cut by half, or even more. The Soviet Union refused. to negotiate on that basis. But which country did our Foreign Minister rebuke? It was ·not· the Soviet Union but the United States. It was our ally which was publicly criticised, not once but on several occasions, in Australia, in Geneva and at the United Nations. In the Foreign Minister's Geneva speech, he laid down conditions for the continuation of United States baseson AQstraiian soil. He did this without regard to the facts, and 'Yithout regard to the delicacy of the Vnlted States position in trying to get the Soviet Union to the arms control table. The Foreign Minister'jeopardised the United States chances .of not.o-lygetting the Soviet Union to the negotiating table, but making progress when they finally gotthere.· We all know how angry the Americans were. . Australian journalists, politicians, officials and business people were told privately, and it has been reported very widely in American newspapers as well as iii' Australia. The Prime Minister (MrHawke) knew how angry the Americans were because his friend tht; Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, rang and told him. The Prime Minister spoke :to the Foreign Minister, and .he induced the Foreign Minist¥r to r¥lease a Press statement saying that he was talking about .ahypothetical situatiqn. But the Foreign Minister, as a result of that and other public criticisms of the United States, is no longer trusted by the United States. He said publicly what h y should have said privately., With the. ANZUS Council and other avenues open to him, he had many opportunities to express .hisdisq-iet. Had he done so, the Americans would .then have explained to him what the facts were, and he would have understOOd that the Americans did not deserve his castigation; rather; they deserved his support. The Foreign Minister personally appointed as Ambassador for Disarmament Mr Butler, who was formerly his principal private secretary. Mr Hayd-n-,,-;- No. Mr MACPHEE'-I apolpgise. He, was with Mr Whitlam. But it was .an appointment of a, person welLknow.n to .the Foreign Minister an<;l an appointment of a person who has immersed himself. for mapyyears in questions of arms contiol. Mr.Bl,ltlerhas been quoted favourably by the Opposition inpre\!ious debates, on this matter or on the matter of i\1X missil-s, I shall quote him again. On AM on 5 February, he said: A good part of United St-tes current policies; both in the areas of space and in the area ofMX development, has . been brought about because. of what the Soviet Union has done. The Soviet Union has got massive capacity .in long range intercontinen-al missiles of the kind that MX represents and they've already involved themselves in considerabl9 '.Star Wars' research. . Our position is that deterrence is necessary so that there is no nuclear war. Bill Hayden has said repeat,edly t\1at we regrllt that a}1d I think we a,ll regret that .. But what wedo within that framework 'of deterrence---':and it's the only framework we can operate in at the moment-what we do is seek, with an activity that I believe is second to none, to try to get both super powers to drastically reduce the amount of nuclear weapons that they have. We believe that. many utterances of the Foreign Minister and his Ambassador reflect a sensible position in terms of the role of deterrence in bringing about arms reduction consultations. We believe that the Ambassador was correct in principle and in his approach. But what we find has happened is that despite the Foreign Minister's personal conviction of the need to proceed via the deterrence path, he and the Prime Minister have deserted that position. In fact,. one of the. consequences will be to leave the Ambassador for Disarmament in a less effective position in disarmament talks in which he is currently engaged in Geneva. I have said that the Americans doubt the reliability. of the Foreign Minister because of his public utterances. Hegave them a public warning at the United Nations in October last year that Australia was demanding from the United States more progress on arms control in return for the continuation of United States bases on Australian soil. The effect of that foolish statement was that the Foreign Minister was trying to bargain with our ally to force the United States to make concessions to the Soviet Union. I contrast that with what Mr Whitlam did when he was Prime Minister. I remember his saying very firmly that he was elected on a promise to remove the United States bases, but on finding out what the basis. did he said: 'That is one promise that .J am proud to break'. There are several reports of a meeting of the Victorian Branch of the Aust.ralian Labor Party 011 25 March 1973 which Mr Whitlam addressed. Mr Whitlam made a powerful speech and, as a resl,flt, the meeting defeated a resolution calling for all United States bases in Australia to be abolished. Mr Wl,1itlam is quoted' as saying about the bases: They help to see that the great Powers do not have the ignorance and suspicion of each other that leads to war. Mr Whitlam said: These bases allay suspicion and remove ignorance. That is .an extremely important thing for a Labor Prime Minister to have done; to have set out to confront his own Party with the facts and to get it to change its policy. Contrast that with the approach of the present Government.The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made remarks with distinct tones of anti-Americanism-certainly no criticism of the Soviets, but an apparent castigation of the Americans. Again, let us contrast thiit with the approach of Mr Whitlam at that time. Mr Whitlam said, at the same meeting, and again this was widely quoted: Don't blame the Yanks for everything we don't like in this country. With regard to the Federal Labor platform, he said it was essential that the Party back the Government. The present Minister for Foreign Affairs fought very hard against the left wing of his Party in respect of uranium exports. He then, however, apparently felt that he had to mouth some of the left wing's concern about the American bases. He ought to have taken on his left wing in the way Mr Whitlam did on that issue. He ought not to have spoken out against the United States in the way in which he did, saying that unless they speeded up their endeavours to get arms control talks under way there might be some question about the futl,lre of the American bases. He lacked finesse and a sense of history, arid he humiliated and weakened our most impoitant ally. The situation got worse. All they/hile the Americans were saying: 'We are not happy about Mr Scholes as Minister for Defence; we are riot happy about Mr Hayden as Minister for Foreign Affairs; but we do have a relationship with the Prime Minister'. What was the second glaring example of the Government's misunderstanding of its responsibilities? Along it came, in the form of the MX controversy. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the new Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) upheld publicly a sensible decision of the Government, which in fact was the same decision made by the previous Government, to facilitate the monitoring of the MX missile tests. Editorial, political, military and public opinion urged the Government not to renege on its commitment to the United States. The media cuttings are several metres thick, but I use one example from the Melbourne Herald, which enthusiastically endorsed the Government at the last election. lam bound to say that it must be rapidly changing its mind. On 4 February, before the Prime Minister unilaterally reversed the commitment which he and his Government had made to the United States, under the heading 'MX:,the Left lifts off', it says: Mr Hawke, jointly with Foreign Minister Bill Hayden and the then Defence Minister, Gordon Scholes, agreed in November, 1983, to honour a promise of the previous Fraser Government to support test flights by two unarmed American missiles. The missiles will be launched in California and will be programmed to touch down in international waters off Tasmania. Australia will provide staging facilities in Sydney for aircraft monitoring the flights. That, ih our view, was not an unreasonable decision. The US is our major defence partner, and while that does not mean Australia should follow blindly wherever the Pentagon may choose to lead, co-operation i in military programs that do not cOmpromise our national interests are a necessary contribution to the alliance .. Mr Hawke .' was right to offer our support. For precisely those reasons, he w,as wrong to withdraw his Government's support. He should have . done what Mr Whitlam did in respect of the American bases. The effect of the decision to reverse the commitment which his Government had made, and the Fraser Government before that had made, is to rebuff the Americans just as strongly as did New Zealand in denying port facilities to United States vessels. In many ways. it was worse, because it came on top of the New Zealand decision. I was in the Sinai, talking to the Australian, New Zealand and American troops, when news came through of the Prime Minister's unilateral reversal of his commitment on the MX missiles. That very morning American officers were saying to me 'What is an ally in the light of what New Zealand has done?'. Having come back from a trip to see Australian and other troops in operation I arrived back in a helicopter, and' an American officer met me with a cable which he had just been given from Washington, annoimcii1g the Prime Minister's decision. He did not have to say anything to me; his face revealed what he thought, and the 'cable spoke for itself-what indeed is an ally? We know that that is what the Americans privately think. We know that publicly Mr Shultz again got the Prime Minister and the Australian Government off the hook. There was even an argument about the passing of a joint communique between the two. It is very much a public friendship. It is now being widely said in the United States as well that Australia is being let off the hook because of the importance which the Americans place on friendship with us, but everyone knows that they do not now have confidence in this·Government. When. we. look at the Los Angeles Times of 7 February we see. that that is exactly what is said there: . The move by Shultz avoided embarrassing Hawke as he prepares to meet today with .President Reagan at the White House. Let no one be fooled: the Prime Minister comes in and quotes statements by the President and the Secretary of State as though everything is normal. The Prime Minister's predecessor as the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Albert Monk, once said, to me: 'A person lets me down only once'. I am afraid it is true of nations as well, and the Americans must feel and do feel that they have been let down by Australia. The third manifestation of the Government's lack of understanding of its obligations under ANZUS is in respect of New Zealand itself, and  some very powerful points about. that yesterday. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, when he was elected, made statements which this Labor Government-which might have-' had some affinity with the New Zealand Governmentmight have privately said to him were going to jeopardise trilateral arrangements, a trilateral treaty. It cannot be said that what happens be-' tween Wellington and Washington is only for them. We do not have to run errands for the United States; we have to run errands for ourselves. We have to privately and forcefully tell the New Zealanders what the consequences are for them, for us and for the United States of the action they have taken. The Government failed in its obligations there, as it failed in its obligations to Australia and ANZUS, and to all those other nations in our part of the world and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation powers who rest on the stability of this alliance. The Government stands condemned and ANZUS is, in tatters,' as much because of the neglect of this Government as because of the actions of the New Zealand Government.",64
156,Mr HAYDEN,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"The proposal before the House is 'a very serious one. It hils obviously been carefully considered and soberly constructed by the Opposition in its presentation. It makes a very grave charge against the Government; it accuses it of failure to act as a responsiqle partner in the Western alliance. By any measure, that is an extraordinarily grave charge to level against a government. It is not far short of the charge of recklessness, almost of treasonable conduct. So, one would reasonably anticipate that there would have been outlined a substantial body of evidence to support that allegation. What did we get? Some comment I made in respect of the comprehensive test bim treaty, and our initiatives on that matter in Geneva, was alleged to have upset the United States. Yet our initiatives on that matter resulted in the United States positively moving from a negative vote to an abstention. In international terms, at multilateral forums on such matters, that is significant. There was some sort of moan about the change in the MX tests, but the United States made the change to the arrangements for the tests, so the arrangements were quite satisfactory to it. Then the Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs cast doubt on my reliability in the view of the United States. The United States itself has released a statement which has made it clear that it repudiates any such suggestion, and it did that before Christmas. There we have it: A limping, haggard, unconvincing litany of manufactured whinges. Whoever Opposition members claim to speak for, they cannot claim to speak for the United States. Their whining' has been refuted as flimsy and as pathetic. By whom? By the declarations from the United States by the Chief Executive of the United States Administration, President Reagan. Let me remind the House of what President Reagan had to say at - the White House on 7 February this year, at the time of the departure of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke): Australia is a reliable ally, an important trading partner, a trusted friend and a fellow democracy. He said of Australia and the United States: We've stood together through trials and tribulations. We've rejoiced together in triumph . . . As a key ally and a vital voice in world affairs, Australia makes a significant contribution to the way we approach international challenges I repeat the words 'as a key ally'. What does this mishmash, this contrived posturing of the Opposition, declare? It declares that we have failed to act as a responsible partner in the Western alliance. The President of the United States has declared that we are a faithful ally and a vital voice in world affairs and that we make a significant contribution to the way the United States approaches international affairs. This concocted nonsense has been cobbled together in desperation by this very desperate Opposition. On ANZUS we are told, en passant, that it is in tatters; it no longer stands. This is what the American Secretary of State for East Asia, Mr Wolfowitz, had to say at a Press conference in Washington on 7 February: I think ANZUS is a treaty we view as intact. We would like to keep it intact. It's certainly very strong and solid with the Australians. I have no more to say of a very lengthy series of declarations of firm commitment by the United States to its relationship with Australia-a commitment declared positively and unambiguously by the United States Administration. In the light of all of that and in the light of this repudiation of the Opposition's cheap; contrived misrepresentation, one must ask oneself some questions about the motivation of the Opposition. Is the Opposition trying to undermine the confidence of this community or undermine the ,conviction ,of the United 'States about Australia at a very delicate time,at a very difficult tiine?'We knowledge that it is a time of difficulty and we have conveyed our concerns to the United States and New Zealand about the present situation in respect of ANZUS. Just because we are not shouting abuse from the rooftops and hurling invective across the aisle at one or other party to the Treaty, a member of the alliance, the Opposition feels that insufficient is being done. The proper and effective way to approach this sort of problem is to have continuous exchange between all three parties. There is no doubt about our concern in respect of ANZUS and the present situation; there is no doubt about our commitment and the undilutable quality of that commitment. Both on public record and in private discourse we have made that clear. We would hope that somewhere along the line, somehow, we will be successful in persuading the Government of New Zealand to change its, tack, to adopt the sorts of courses we have adopted and persist with or, as the United States says, to rejoin active participation in the Treaty and its obligations. Members of the Opposition simply believe that if they hee and haw long enough their jackass antics will be taken seriously. It will not be long before we get blamed for the turmoil in Burkinosaso or the breakdown in Chad, or perhaps soon we will get retrospectively the blame for the football war in Central America. This is a futile and pathetic effort by the sition to try to poison the mind of the Australian public, to try to sow seeds of doubt that the Labor Government is anti-alliance, anti-Western and anti-American. The Americans have made it clear that the Labor Government is none of those things-'-that it is trusted, it is supported, it is endorsed and, more than that, it is influential within the associations it has with the United States and other countries. There has been, understandably, a great deal of focus on ANZUS. We have said on many occasions that it is a keystone to our defence and international political arrangements. But, by definition, using the English language' parsed properly, 'keystone' means that it is one and that there are other keystones. Why is not some attention being given to those other keystones of our 'relationships? The world is much bigger than just the immediate area in question. It is extremely important but it is not the beginning and end or the totality of all of our concerns. For instance, we have key interests with the Association of South East Asian Nations. That is not covered by ANZUS. Is it suggested that that is a matter of indifference, of inconsequence? Nor is Papua New Guinea covered by ANZUS, but it is extremely ac- important, as is the five power agreement. So too are commerce and diplomacy critical on the wider canvas for a country such as Australia. Then, of course, there is Australia's engagement under the defence co-operation program. That has been sustained by a succession of governments in this country. Political colour, conservative or Labor, is a matter of indifference; it, has been supported. It was supported by the Whitlam Labor Government and by the Fraser Government, and it is being supported by the Hawke Government. this year we will be spending nearly $50m on defence co-operation in our region. About $18m of that will go to Papua New Gljinea. The ASEAN countries will receive nearly $24m. Most of the remainder is to be distributed in the south west Pacific. As I say, it is focussed on our neighbouring South East Asian and South Pacific regions. ,The broad objective of the, defence cooperation program is to promote the national independence of the participating countries. We participate on a regular basis in a large number of combined military exercises on either a bilateral basis or a multilateral basis. We carry out those exercises with other allies. We conduct with the United States land, air and maritime exercises which aim at improving inter-operability with our ally-air defences, air-submarine warfare, control of shipping, general training, etcetera. Under the five-power defence arrangements we exercise Oppowith the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand. We exercise also with regional countries, such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Singapore"" Malaysia and Thailand, and with old Commonwealth countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. From that outline we can see that the relationship within the alliance is not only as the Americans describe in respect of ANZUS-a very strong, enduring and viable thing insofar as the association between Australia and the United States is concerned. It is much mOre comprehensive than that. We do make a substantial and enduring contribution to what might be more generally described as the Western alliance. On critical tests this Government has stood up and been successful on the issues that really count. Let me take the issue of United States facilities in Australia, a subject of considerable disputation in this community. The Prime Minister and I stood up publicly, in the democratic forum-something foreign to members of the conservative parties-at the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party, and >in any other forum available to us in this country for months on end, as we still do, to argue the justification for those facilities. We proposed and promoted them and we declared their essential linkage in policies such as those concerning deterrence and verification. I have said before that we .wish it was a happier world to live in with no nuclear weapons or the threat of them and with arms control effectively in place. We aim at that very praiseworthy objective. We do not pretend to have a monopoly on this sort of thing buLwe would like a little credit for work we have done. In the meantime, living in an imperfect world, we have responsibilities in respect of those facilities. That is why We have defended them-we have done so with considerable .success-and why we will continue to do'so. But it has not been easy. It has not been easy because this issue suddenly exploded oil an unsuspecting and totally uninformed Australianpublic. That is remarkable because one of those facilities had been in this country for two decades and the other one for a decade and a half-Pine Gap and Nurrungar. Why was the public unsuspecting and ill informed? Whenever the LiberaIs'in government Were challenged on this issue and asked to explain what these facilities were about, instead of arguing the moral justification of them-the moral justification which I find unchallengeable; that is why I argue it-they scuttled into some cowardly funk hole stamped 'secrecy'. That is why we had an unprepared public. For the Liberals it was too hard to explain and too difficult to defend, so they retreated to the cowards' defence of secrecy. That is where the genesis of this mindless muddling through, which has epitomised Liberal-National Party administration in foreign affairs, came into being and continues today. We got out there and argued this case. Until Hawke and Bayden and their colleagues got out there and talked about deterrence and about verification and took on by the sharp tusks the opponents they were confronted with, no one had heard that debate in this country and it will continue. But it will continue sensibly because, at the same time, we will pursue that ultimate objective of effective nuclear arms control at mutually stable levels. We support a freeze. We support reductions. We will do all we can to try to work towards that end. It is hard work. It requires great diligence. It requires competent people such as those in the arms control and disarmament branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which scarcely existed before I became Minister iforForeign Affairs. Two officers were working part time on it and now there is the best part of a dozen. Our ambassador for Disarmament in Geneva is working at this. Having said all of those things, I come to the relative measures. Who is the keeper of all this virtue, this patriotic fervour that we have heard so much about in the last few days? We have been hearing about the inviolability of the ANZUS alliance. Only the conservatives know how to behave with the Americans! Let me tell honourable members what Mr Renquf had to say in his book of anecdotal experience, about the visit of the former Prime Minister to the United States of America. He said: The sourness of the relationship between the two governments carried over into 1979 when Prime Minister Fraser accused the US of not adequately protecting Australia's interests in the MTN, a weird charge coming from a man whose professed policy vis-a-vis the US was independence, and hinted that if Australia did not receive treatment in the MTN which she regarded as adequate, the future of the US defence facilities in Australia could be jeopardised. So here we have honourable members opposite applying their form of leverage. ,It is all right when they engage in a non-virtuous form of conduct, using the description that they have used. That is a principle in itself. It is humbug. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The Minister's time has expired. The discussion is concluded. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed.",67
157,Dr THEOPHANOUS,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Calwell). (3.43)Before the interruption of the debate, I was talking about what a great honour it is for me to represent the electorate of Calwell, which has been named after the great Arthur Calwell. I was talking about the contribution that Arthur Calwell made to the Labor movement and to the Australian nation. But I also want to thank the people in my electorate who worked hard in assisting me in the recent election arid also those who have worked to bring together the forces of the Australian Labor Party in Calwell. As honourable members know, it is one of the most depressed areas in Australia in terms of poverty and unemployment. I can assure Labor Party supporters and the people of my electorate'that I will be working hard to get rid of the stigma of the deprived west of Melbourne by trying to bring as many services as possible to that area. We must banish from our society the monstrous injustice whereby people have unequal opportunities and achievements in life as a consequence of living in cultural circumstances. That basically has been the thrust of the Governor General's message in, relation to the Labor Government-our commitment to continuing the process of achieving greater fairness and greater equality in this country. In this regard one cannot achieve the task simply through the Federal Government; one needs the assistance of State governments. I want to say something about the importance of the tremendous work of the Cain Labor Government in achieving this goal, in seeking to establish a more just and prosperous community in that State. I have been amazed at the base and outrageous attacks which have been made on' the Cain Labor Government in the last three weeks, especially by certain vested interests who s«ek to exploit and undermine the people of Victoria. Those interests who are spending all this money in this outrageous campaign are, in my view, beyond contempt because of their attitudes. I shall demonstrate by the facts that I shall put before this House that the Cain Labor Government has an outstanding record of achievement and that the John Cain leadership has brought to Victoria a compassion and sensitivity to the wishes of the people which is unparalleled. This humanitarian approach is encapsulated in all the economic and social programs of the Cain Government. Let me illustrate this with one example. The Cain Government has just announced a $10m anti-poverty program. It is the first government in Australia to announce a specific anti-poverty campaign of this kind. Given that aspects of the recession remain with us, can there be any more important goal for a government to pursue than to protect the neediest and poorest section of the community? Part of this program is a new housing plan announced by the excellent Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Cathie. Under this scheme, low income families are to be given the chance to own their own homes: In his statement Mr Cathie said that the scheme would be run in co-operation with private banks and building societies and would provide at least $100m in loans to households earning up to 120 per cent of average weeklY earnings. Under this proposal, 2,000 families will be assisted each year. Mr Cathie said that the scheme was based on a successful $20m pilot program run by the Ministry of Housing last. year. The scheme attracted, 12,000 applicants for 450 loans. Mr Cathie is quoted in the Age as saying: We see it as a scheme for getting a lot of people fully into home ownership, virtually without government subsidy. This scheme illustrates the gener!!.l philosophy of the Cain Labor Government Satisfying the needs of the people with the maximum economic responsibility. This is clearly seen when we examine the record of economic achievement by the Cain Government. Iremind the House that the Cain Government was elected at the height of the recession which had been brought on this country and that State by the outrageous policies of the previous State Liberal Government, led by Mr Thompson, and of course in the midst of the extraordinary, tough, monetarist policies of the FraserGovernment at the Federal level. Faced with this virtually insurmountable problem",69
158,Mr GOODLUCK,WESTERN ALLIANCE,Ah!,70
159,Dr THEOPHANOUS,WESTERN ALLIANCE,I suppose you are proud of the quarter of a million unemployed you created in your last year. Is that what you are saying? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! The honourable member will address the Chair.,70
160,Dr THEOPHANOUS,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Faced with this virtually insurmountable problem, of mass unemployment and a negative growth situation, the Cain Labor Government proceeded to put down policies based on a philosophy of expansion, a counter-cyclic economic policy to try to drag the State of Victoria out of recession, and it was successful. Indeed it could be said that the Victorian example set the pattern for the Federal Labor Government; that is, expansion during a time of recession based on a responsible approach to economic management- This has been an outstanding success in the creation of jobs, in the reduction of inflation and interest rates and in making inroads into the elimination of poverty. The record of the Cain Government on these , matters is the best in Australia. For example, unemployment is now at the lowest level of any State of Australia. The level of youth unemployment is also at the lowest level in Australi!!.. A greater degree of industrial peace, stimulation of the housing industry and encouragement of new industries, especially those utilising new and advanced technology, have allied to a massive economic recovery in Victoria. Unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, have been successfully reduced by the Cain Government through capital works and targeted employment programs. Both the 1982 and success1983 State Budgets provided a substantial boost to employment through increased spending on capital works, especially housing. It has been estimated that the 1982 Budget alone led to the creation of over 200,000 jobs. The 1983 Budget provided a 43 percent increase in capital spending. In 1982, $30m was directed towards jobcreation in the public sector and the non-profit private sector through the employment initiative program. An estimated 3,450 jobs were created, 92. per cent of which went to long term unemployed people. This employment initiative program is well known and provided the model for the Federal Government's community employment program which has been a spectacularsuccess in dealing with the problem of unemployment. Overall, then, since the Cain Government came to power in Victoria, a quarter of a million new jobs have been created. Over 25,000 have gone to people aged between 15 and 24 years. The Cain Labor Government also has an excellent record in relation to programs to assist manufacturing industry. These programs were developed against the background of an enormous rundown in manufacturing, with the impact of the recession. It should be remembered that during this period, employment in manufacturing severely contracted-that is,· the period merely before the Cain Government-with the loss of thousands of jobs in Melbourne and Victoria generally. The State G\lvernment acted immediately to try to redress the situation, by providing incentives for manufacturing investment and support for those industries facing immediate danger. Last year the Government outlined an economic strategy for Victoria based on a 10-year program, the first such long term program that has ever been developed for Victoria. In that economic strategy, the most important aspects related to industry policy, ,The new policy was described in these terms:. Consequently thete are four major thrusts in the new state and regional industry policies. The first of these is to assist smaller firms in the State's manufacturing and tertiary industries to upgrade their entrepreneurial skills and improve the level of: innovation, design, technology and marketing. The second is to assist those.small to medium sized firms which do have a competitive advantage to fully realise the growth potential those firms in slow-growing or declining industfies to develop and implement strategies to re-orient their activities into those areas in which they can achieve a competitive advantage as a basis for long term growth. The fourth is to asSist i-gions to develop and talise on the regio-'s .competitive strengths so as to increase· their rates of growth and to lessen their dependence on firms supplying slow-growing or declining markets. In addition, the· Government issued· new guidelines for lending by the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. The result is that a greater proportion of financial assistance for Victorian industry is targeted towards industries using new and advanced technology, export industries and tourism. Also, by cutting the red tape of approving major private sector investrrient projects, the Victorian Government has facilitated more than 50 projects in Victoria's manufacturing and commercial sectors, with a value of over$150m. Madam Deputy Speaker, in addition to the matters mentioned here, the Victorian Government has adopted an expansion of the apprenticeship system for young people. This has been done, firstly, by encouraging employers through exemptions from payroll tax for the first year of apprenticeships; secondly, by increasing travel and accommodation subsidies to apprentices; and thirdly and most importantly, by producing a scheme whereby more apprentices are taken up in State Government agencies year after year, and so directly training more people. Consistent with this highly responsible expansionary approach to economic management, the Victorian Government has established the best system of accountability that has ever existed in the State. We have had not only a complete overhaul of the budgeting procedures for the State of Victoria through the establishment of the Department of Management and Budget, but also the establishment of bodies which have played a big role in ensuring that the public money is used in the most responsible fashion. The Government has been able, through the establishment of the State development program, to fund projects involving large scale capital works-projects which have had a very significant impact on the provision of infrastructure in Victoria. The Cain Government committed itself to supplying $400m over the.e years for development projects. It has met that target. Let me mention some of the excellent projects which have been funded under this program: The Holmsglen College of Technical and Further Education, the Broadmeadows Court House, the Glen Waverley Police A<;:ademy, the Forensic Science Laboraof this. The third is to assist tory, the Box Hill Transport Centre, the Webb Dock rail link and the western trunk sewer. I use these examples because they present part of the· spectrum of projects which the Victorian Government has adopted in this very positive strategy. implement strategies to capi7 Mr MCVeigh-What has it done for the dairy farmers?",70
161,Dr THEOPHANOUS,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"A lot more than the honourable member ever did when he Was in power. When the Cain Labor Government came into power in 1982, the situation of housing in Victoria was absolutely disastrous. Housing commencements were at the lowest for many years. The public housing lists had grown over the years without any sympathy or concern on the part of the previous Liberal Government, which had become complacent, and insensitive to the voice of the people, and especially to the poorer section of the community. From the spending of $127m in the last year of the Liberal Government-that is, 1981-82-housing spending was boosted in 1982-83 to $227m and in 1983-84 to $270m. As mentioned earlier, the Cain Government proposes to boost housing even further in the current Budget and to introduce schemes which will assist those people who relied on public housing, and also low income families seeking to purchase private housing. The housing proposals of the torian Government are based on the recognition that. there is a needy section of the community which is reliant on public housing and public accommodation at low rentals. The argument that this public housing stock be sold off, which has been put forward by the, infamous Mr Kennett and his team, would be absolutely disastrous to people in poverty, who would not be in a position to purchase these homes and flats. It is just another example of the anti-people pollcies which have been proposed by the extreme right wing which has now seized control of what was once the great Liberal Party in Victoria. ' The many Australians of migrant background who live in Melbourne and the whole of Victoria have received an enormous boost from the work of the Cain Labor Government, and especially the Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Peter Spyker. All ethpeople nic groups in Victoria know of his untiring efforts to promote a genuinely multicultural Australia, The Victorian Ethnic Affairs Commission was established under his guidance and has been a major force in involving. ethnic communities in the decision-making processes-,-so that it may have an active and effective voice on the issues that concern them. In the last two years, $500,000 per annum has been made available to ethnic community groups through grants from the Commission. In addition, there has been a substantial increase in ethnic teacher aids and in community language and bilingual teachers in Victorian schools. These teachers and teacher' aids cover a wide range of ethnic group languages, including Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Greek, Turkish and Arabic. There have been big changes in the curriculums in schools, to promote the idea of multiculturalism and knowledge of different cultures. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Cain Government's approach contrasts with that the Opposition Leader, MrKennett, who does not have any understanding of the needs of the people. In particular, he has no sympathy for the plight of the disadvantaged, the poor, the homell';ss and the unemployed. His proposals for massive reductions in the public sector will have only one result: Tha-,is a dramatic reduction in the quality and quantity of the services available to the people, especially in education, health, welfare and,transport. Mr Duncan-The standard ofIiving will ,crash.",71
162,Dr THEOPHANOUS,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"As the honourable member says, the standard of living will crash. But it is not just a recipe for massive ,reductions of the services available to the bulk of the people. What will it do to employment? It is also a recipe for Vic- massive increases in unemployment. The massive reductions in public sector spending proposed by Mr Kennett will result in these big increases in unemployment. If the people of Victoria want to see thousands of people thrown out of work, as occurred during the Fraser and Thompson period, they will elect Mr Kennett, whose economics ate even more mad, more irrational, than those of Malcolm Fraser. It is the economics of confrontation based on conflict between the private and public' sectors of the economy; If Mr Kennett were, God forbid, to be placed in charge of the Victorian economy, both sectors would suffer, with hefty unemployment. The solution to' the current unemployment situation, particularly youth unemployment, is not the regressive scheme proposed by Mr Kennett of cutting wages in half for young people. The Cain Labor Government's plan to more positively assist young unemployed is the only realistic approa'ch. By creating more apprenticeships, by increasing places at TAFE colleges arid by making available the option of participating in work-study schemes the Cain Government aims to create real job opportunities and the chance to gain usef)ll skills and education, whiC;h it has guaranteed for all young people. This is the way to assist 'thosl'; young people tragically hit by the p-oblerri or long term unemployment, without exploiting them in the manner that Mr Kennett proposes an without endangering the job security of those workers currentlyemployed. .' "" Contrast the humane, rational approach of the Cain Government with the iricoherent and inhumane program promoted' by .the Kennett Liberal Party, the aggressively insensitive approach of the Opposition Leader, who does not seem torecognise that there are poor and unemployed people in the community. Surely any rational person, any swinging voter who is considering the situation, will vote Labor on Saturday. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honoura\?le member's time has expired.  position) (4-02)- The Gove.rnor-General's Speech is traditionally - me wh-ch se\s out the vision of Australia towards which the Government of the day is working. It also give- t-e OPl?osit ion the opportunity to set out what It IS seekmg to do. What marks the speech that this Government provided for the Governor General is that it has no vision, no perspective, no sense of planning for the future. It is the speech of a government that is already aging after less than two years in office disheartened by its election failure, stale, expedient, lacking leadership and lacking direction. The Government promises to create an Australia which is stronger, fairer and more equitable. These are the Government's words. But what the Australian people see and suffer day after day are the consequences of broken pledges, the consc::quences oflackofleadership, the consequences of policies which alrea-y hav- cr-ated and will continue to create a natIOn which IS becoming increasingly weak, unfair and more inc::quitable. Where is there any strength in a falte-­ ing economy and a crippled currency? Wh-re IS there any strength in a. once p.owerf-l allIa-ce now in disarray? Where IS the fairness m a natI-n which cannot provide work for so many despairing young people? Where is the-quity in a nati-n .whose government seeks to pumsh the enterprIsing and the thrifty wit- assets tes-s - nd superannuation taxes? Where IS leadership m a government riven by faction and a Prime Minister without authority'?· At the· beginning of this Thir.tY-fourth Parli-­ ment allow me to reaffirm our prmclples, the philosophy . of government for which. the people of Australia gave us amanda.te. for all but five years of the last three decades. These are the principles and philosophy we will continue to pursue in this Parliament. In those many years of government the coalition has always' stood for, and will.continue to stand for ·the right to individual freedom and endeavour' theencourageirient of enterprise, effort andexceiIence, and the recognition of every Australian's inalienable right to be rewarded for these qualities; and, so as a consequence, a total commitmerit to· a nation in which private enterprise is the keystone of .progress, free .of intnlsiveahd unnecessary government regulation. . We.stand.f-r, and will.-ontinue to stand for, a just and fair society which. encourages the ad-en­ turous. and protects the disadvantaged; as?clety which demands that the government acts m the interests of all Australians, without surrendering to pressure groups or factions; - nd- finally- the creation of a nation aware of ItS mternatlOnal responsibilities, and responding po-itively to them in the pursuit of national securIty and world peace. In. this context I want to - on-entrate on what we believe to be the major Issues now . confronting us, and to which we seek to - pply long standing and traditional values. Those Issues include industrial relations, the plight of the rural community, the state of the economy, the burden of taxation and national security. The Government boasts of having achieved 'national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction' in its first term of office, and yet in the past three months Australia has seen the most bitter industrial turmoil since the Government took office in March 1983. There have been strikes by train drivers, waterside and meat workers and food preservers and violence in the building industry. Millions of dollars have been lost by the Government, importers, retailers and industry b-­ cause of Public Service bans. If all this turmOil and bitterness reflects a spirit of national reconciliation the word has lost its meaning. What it now means is that the Government has lost any influence it might have had on the union movement. What will follow in the coming year is increasing turbulence, increasing losses in. domestic productivity and exports, accompamed· at the same time by increasingly strident demands for higher wages. What we are seeing is the beginning of terminal fragility in the much vaunted accord of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In employment and industrial relations matters the results of the Government's philosophical inconsistencies are clear. On the one hand the Government has pursued deregulation of the financial system, and the coalition. applauds the steps taken so far. In particular, we support - he floating of the Australian dollar, a measure whICh has the potential to enhance Australia'- international competitiveness and therefore stIm-l-te employment growth. But whatever posItIve potential the floating dollar possessed has been negated by the Government's ign?rant and irr.esponsible adherence to the centralised wage-fixmg system and the Government's support - o- full consumer price index linked wage nses. ThiS IS not the act of a government concerned with sound economic management or the maximisation of employment growth. It is the act of a government concerned first and· above all, to please and appease its - ower base-the trade union movement. To put it mildly,it is most unfortunate for Australia that the Government has no wages policy to replace the prices and incomes accord. The. coalition's policy, on the other hand, is clear and positive. The nation's wage fixing and dispute settlement procedures need fundamental reform. We believe that the way ahead, the best course for Australia, is to decentralise these procedures. To this end our policy is directed to promoting a greater measure of collective bargaining between employers and employees, and to enhancing the accountability of all parties to agreements reached in this way within a decentralised system. As a first step we plan to change the present Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission into a. new industrial tribunal with powers to fix minimum wages only, foster the resolution of disputes, enforce decisions contractually - nd promote a positive restructuring of the trade union movement. It is patently absurd for the Government to free the financial system on the one hand but shackle the industrial relations system on the other. The . consequences of this inconsistency will become harmfully evident this year. The dole queues will fail to shorten, those already employed will clamour, with the Government's encouragement, for higher wages with little reference to productivity or industry's capacity to pay, and Australia's international competitiveness will be dealt a further blow. It is employment growth-the creation of more jobs for the hundreds of thousands of Australians seeking work-that will suffer at the hands of this Government's inadequate employment and industrial relations policies. The Governor General's Speech makes scant reference to that part of the Australian community which has always been a major contributor to the nation's prosperity and progress. The farmers, wool growers, rice growers and cattlemen and the producers of' cotton, fruit, grapes and oil seeds are virtually overlooked in this Government's speech as put to the House and to the people by the Governor General. Those primary producers are dedicated and purposeful men and women and they and their families create a significant proportion of Australia's export income. They are dismissed in the Governor General's Speech in only four meaningless paragraphs. The Government, speaking through His Excellency, said: A major report on primary industry to the year 2000 will be developed this year. Measures will be taken revitalization of industries such as fishing, sugar ing which are facing long term, market related, structural difficulties. There is no need to wait for yet another report on primary industry to know what is happening to it. Any member of the National Party of Australia or the Liberal Party of Australia can tell honourable members opposite that now ..The man on the land will find little comfort in an acknowledgment of market related structural difficulties w}:len, for example,.. he learns next week that the predicted average annual farm income this year will be $6,598, which is a sum equal to less than one-third of the average weekly wage. The average farmer will find this out from a paper prepared by the Livestock and Grain Producers Association of New South Wales, which has prepared a 94-page document for yet another summit in Canberra next Tuesday. What is happening to Australia's rural industry is catastrophic. The LGPA paper states that unless the Government acts immediately more than 30.0.,0.0.0. jobs' could be lost on Australia's farms and rural properties in the next three years. This is at a time when the proportion of farmers already living below the poverty line-I stress below the poverty line-is between 15 and 20. per cent, according to a recent survey by the University of New South Wales School of Geography. In the city of Sydney and its suburbs the average is between 7 and IOper cent. All of this is largely due to rising costs which are largely State and .Federal government charges and taxes, transport imposts, grain handling and inspection fee- and electricity and irrigation charges. These are only some of the dimensions of a rural decline which ,the Prime Minister seeks to arrest by yet another summit. On the other hand, our policies are already firmly in place. Among them are these initiatives: An expansion of the role of the Primary Industry Bank of Australia; an underwriting scheme for the sugar industry; export inspection charges to be borne by the Commonwealth; and income equalisation deposits to be restored as an effective means of equalising variable incomes, with tax being paid only in the year of withdrawal. We spelt them out in greater detail in the last election campaign but they are some of them. .. . . ' To turn to the nation's broader .economic prospects, there is equally no comfort. While we welcome the increased business and manufacturing activity of the past 18 months, we do not acc-pt that, as the Governor General's Speech claims, it is the strongest economic performance for decades. Despite the euphoric attitude of the Prime Minister and the so-called world's greatest to assist the restructuring and Treasurer, there are others in'the Government---;-I and dairy- stress in the Government-who take a far more realistic view. I will quote them: The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has described as patchy what is perceived as some kind of miraculous economic recovery brought about by the Labor Government. Less than two weeks ago the former Minister for Finance and present Minister for Trade (Mr Dawkins) was even more frank. Speaking on 19 February to the Australian Insurance Association, the Minister said that these problems remain: Firstly, major debt and balance of payment problems; secondly, unemployment at far too high a level; thirdly, a poor trade performance; and, fourthly, stagnation of manufacturing industry. Yet nowhere in the Governor General's Speech is there any strategy, any plan, any blueprint for solving the serious far-reaching structural problems which are embedded in the Government's economic performance. Taxation is one of these problems. At least the Government has recognised this. As suggested to the Prime Minister by a Perth radio announcer, he is calling yet another summit. Sometimes I wonder whether Australia will eventually have even more summits than the Himalayas. But will the summit address one of the basic causes of high taxation, that is, increasing government expenditure? Of course not. The Government's philosophy is for more expenditure, not less, and more bureaucratic intervention, not less. We have said time and again that if expenditure cannot be brought down, taxation cannot be brought down. Government members know as well as I do that there will be no preparedness to wind back expenditure and get a real reduction in taxation. The summit is being called as just another means of raising more revenue from the Australian people and trying to go through a staged performance of what is already planned. Apart from broadening the tax base, which we favour, it appears that the Treasurer has now discovered that he can add 10 per cent to everything except the Australian dollar. Apart from broadening the tax base, capital gains taxes, death duties and gift duties are all to be considered. The summit will be a talkfest for the Government tp find more revenue. There will be no cuts in government expenditl,lre because the Government's philosophy is for more expenditure, not less, and more bureacratic intervention, not less. Our position on the achievement of economic growth is clear and unequivocal. It depends on the productivity of the private sector. That is the engine ofreal prosperity and more jobs. A strong private sector creates productivity and profits. It stimulates investment and generates not only more jobs but also permanent jobs, in contrast to . the cosmetic concepts such as the Government's proposed new enterprise initiatives scheme. The prosperity of Australia has always been founded on a strong private sector-in the factories, in business and commerce and on the landunshackled by government regulation and not discouraged by government charges and taxes. That is what we stand for and it is markedly in contrast with what the Government proffers. We also stand for a nation recognised internationally, at least until recently, as a good friend to its allies, reliable in a crisis and dedicated to the pursuit of peace and disarmament. We have demonstrated this again over the past week or so. We have demonstrated to the people of Australia that the present Government, and in particular the Prime Minister, in a futile attempt to paper over the deep factional and ideological divisions in the Labor Party, has placed party and personal survival beyond fundamental responsibility-the fundamental responsibility for the. security and survival of Australia as a nation. ThaUs a charge on which this coalition will never be found guilty, as this Government has been. We also stand for a caring and compassionate society which takes into account, as we approach 200 years of white settlement, the special needs of the people who were here before we came; a society which takes into account the special needs of the people who have come here, many of them fleeing tyranny and oppression, to enrich Australian life with the diversity of their skills and cultures; a society which believes that the benefits of education should be equally shared; a society in which the creativity of our painters, writers, actors and musicians can be stimulated to the pursuit of even greater excellence. Our political philosophy totally embraces a sense of vision, a deep concern to create a better, more equitable society with benefits and obligations equally shared and differences resolved by negotiation, not by confrontation. Our vision is to ensure that no single powerful group, be it big unions, big business or big government, so dominates society that it is harmful to those Australians who cannot muster such strength. We are not the tools of the trade union movement; nor do we, in denying that the Government speakS on behalf of the Australian people when it is manipulated by the trade union movement, go on a trade union bash. We stand to identify those elements within the trade union movement that would walk the Government towards programs that are not in the best interests of all Australians. As I have indicated, in standing for a fairer, more just and more equitable society, we are looking after those who do not have access, through powerful organs such as the ACTU, straight to the Cabinet room at Budget time to do special deals for themselves. Our vision is to create a nation in which all Australians can share a sense of national pride, in which we can playa part in its achievements and they can play it equally. In seeking those achievements, all Australians can prosper in the nation's growing strength and fulfil their aspirations for a richer life. That is our vision, and our task is to make that vision a reality. In contrast to what is transpiring today, we will not fail that vision.",72

167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will return to his seat if he wishes to be heard.,76
168,Mr DUNCAN,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was saying that it may well be about time we thought about getting television in the chamber so that the people of Australian would be able to see the acting we have seen in the House in the past few minutes. I noticed also that the Leader of the Opposition has some new speech writers who are refugees from the Fraser years. They are former Fraser staffers. I am surprised that they did not know that farm costs doubled under the Liberals between 1977 and 1982. I am surprised that, in writing the speech that was just delivered, they did not mention that the wages explosion of 1981-82 occurred under the Liberal Party Administration of Prime Minister Fraser. I am surprised that they did not mention that farm costs this year are only 4.6 percent, compared with 11 per cent under the Liberals in 1982-83. I am very surprised also that they did not record some of the other aspects of the disasters that occurred during the years of Fraserism. That is the fact of the matter, and next time the Leader of the Opposition speaks in the Parliament he would do well to mention a few more of the facts instead of going on with the sort of hypocrisy that we heard in the last 20 minutes or so: . I have the great privilege to represent in this Parliament the electorate of Makin. I am its first member. I take this opportunity to thank the electors of Makin for the confidence they have shown in me and the Labor Government. I can assure them that I will do my very best to see that they receive vigorous representation in this place. Makin is named after the Hon. Norman Makin, a man who was a truly distinguished Australian. He represented the people of South Australia, first as the Labor member for Hindmarsh and later as the Labor member for Sturt anQ the Labor member for Bonython, for a total of 36 years. I understand that he was the third longest serving member of this House. He was· the member for Hindmarsh from 1.919 to 1946. During that period he was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1923 to 1929, again in 1936, and from 1956 to 1961.He was the Speaker under the Scullin Government from 1929 to 1931. Norman Makin also was a Minister in both the Curtin and Chifley governments. He was Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions from 1941 to 1946. He was Acting Minister for External Affairs in 1<}45. He was a member of the Production Executive of the War Cabinet from 1941 to 1946 and was a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from 1940 to 1945. In 1946, Makin resigned from· this Parliament to become the first Australian Ambassador to the United Nations and to the United States, a post he held until the appointment was terminated by the Menzies Government in 1951. During that time he .served as the first President of the United Nations Security Council in 1946 and 1947. He was awarded the United Nations peace medal in recognition of his leadership. . ; In 1954 Norman Makin returned to this Parliament as the member for Sturt. In 1956 he was re-elected as the member for Bonython, a seat which he held for the Australian Labor Party until 1963. During that time he wasonce again a Temporary Chairman of Committees. In 1980 Norman Makin was awarded the Order of Australia and he died in 1982. He was a lifelong member of the Australian Labor Party. I met him on many occasions, especially during my time as Attorney General in the Dunstan Government. I found from my discussions with him that we had many shared beliefs. His lifelong fight against poverty and inequality and his interest in achieving peace were common aims for us both and we each shared great faith in an:d admiration for Don Dunstan, the then Premier of South Australia. Although Norman Makin was a very old man when I knew him, it was my privilege to do so. It is my particular honour to represent the electorate that now bears his name. The Makin electorate is typical of average Australia. It has a high proportion of young families. It has a high proportion of home owners and home purchasers. It has a high proportion of medium wage and salary earners. It is a high growth area. But the electorate of Makin is not without its problems. First, there is the problem of housing interest rates which most people in my electorate, to a greater or lesser extent, bear.. A particular problem in relation to that is the attempt by some of the major trading banks in recent times to talk up housing interest rates. We have already seen attempts to do this in the last couple of months. The issue affects many of my constituents and I will return to it in a few moments. Secondly, in some parts of the electorate there are still high levels of unemployment, especially amongst young people. Fortunately for these people, the Labor Party has been returned to government and they will be able to look forward with more certainty to some improvement in the situation in which they find themselves through no fault of their own. The achievements of the Hawke Labor Goventment in reducing the levels of unemployment have been very considerable. I will do all I can to' ensure that unemployment is reduced further and that full employment in this country· is again achiev«d. , As I mentioned, many of my constjtuents are young home buyers. They have benefited greatly from the economic recovery and have been assisted directly. by the Government's first home owners scheme. Others have been assisted by the substantial allocation of Federal money to public housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The electors of Makin have also been assisted in the area of public housing by the sighted housing policies of the Bannon Labor ceive Government which for the past two years has allocated 100 per cent of its loan funds to public housing. In this way, it has played a major role promoting recovery in the building industry which, in turn, has had flow-on effects throughout the South Australian economy has increased the stock of public housing in the State by over 7,000. When this and the low interest housing loans provided by the South Australian Government for low income earners are taken into account, it is easy to see the advantages ,that Labor governments bring to ordinary Australians. Home owners and purchasers have also benefitedfrom the economic policies of the Hawke Labor Government. The reduction in inflation and home loan interest rates have been significant aspects of the economic recovery. As I have said, however, some of the major trading banks ,have not been acting as responsibly as they might in relation to interest rates on home loans. It is clear that some of them are more interested in maintaining high profits than in providing adequate funds to enable home buyers to have acCess to loans at reasonable rates of interest. There are a number of reasons why increases in home loan interest rates should be resisted. First, the banks are experiencing high profit levels and near record liquidity. In fact, the net operating profits of the four major trading banks alone was almost $750m in 1983-83. Preliminary figures for 1983-84 suggest that profits will be in the area of $1,OOOm. Second, real interest rates are at an historically high level. Third, the recent establishment of the national secondary mortgage market will give a substantial boost to available home loan funds. This in turn should exert strong downward pressures on home loan interest rates. It appears that the banks have realised this and have purposely remained silent on the advantages which will accrue from the secondary mortgage market. Instead, they are trying to make it appear inevitable that interest rates will rise. It appears that they are promoting a strategy to make sure that any subsequent falls in home loan interest rates will be compensated by earlier rises"" thus overcoming any potential losses to bank income. Honourable members might like to reflect on the outcry we would hear from the benches opposite if the trade unions tried this sort of ramp. An interest rate rise of one per cent. would increase monthly repayments for home buyers with a $50,000 loan at 11.5 per cent by about $10 a farweek. Wage and salary earners would need to reincreases in their pay packets of at least $12 before tax to compensate for such a rise. There is no doubt that any hike in housing interest rates in .would lead to inflationary pressures and demands . for wage increases to compensate and would put the survival of the prices and income accord in and, importantly, real jeopardy. It is disappointing that sOIile banks have taken the attitude they have during a period when economic stability is required to ensure that the benefits of recovery are not dissipated. The attitude and approach of the building societies and other non-bank financial institutions, such as the credit unions, have been far more responsible. Some banks seem to want the privileges of both deregulation and the old, regulated financial system without taking the responsibility offered to them by deregulation. The Australian people would be much better off if these banks accepted the responsibility they have as leaders in the finanminally cial system and, from the process of deregulation, used their influence to ensure the stability and orderly development of the Australian economy. It was the sorts of problems! have been talking about that led me to make a move from State to Federal politics. It had become apparent to me, especially during the years of the recession, is simply not possible to effect any real change at the State level, other than at th- margins, in the standard of living of ordinary Australians. Jobs, unemployment and the economy at large are affected most at the national level. As a State member of parliament who represented a strong working class electorate, I have been increasingly angry at some of the injustices that I saw on an almost daily basis. I can see no reason why, in a country which is as well endowed and rich as Australia, there are people who are homeless, people who are living in the streets or in caravans, in sheds or in the backyards of friends and neighbours and in cars, or who are crowded three or four families to a house in some cases and who, in some instances, live without hot water and heating because electricity costs are too high. I can see no reason why elderly people must spend two weeks at home and go out only once per pension cheque because they cannot catch buses-the steps are too high-'---and because they can afford only one taxi fare per pension cheque. The shops are a $6 ride there and back. They have fresh food for Orily a few days after each trip, which can hardly have a good effect on their health. I can see no reason why people must go without teeth because their teeth were extracted four years ago and they did not have access to the information, or because some so-called professional did not give them the information, that they could get free dentures from the pensioner dental service, or why those who do know must wait for three months and longer before they can get dentures. I can see no reaSon why education is still better for the rich than the poor, why some people can buy clothes off a clean hook from a new warehouse and from new fabric, while others must buy their clothes from a box full of old clothes that someone else does not want. I can see no reason why old people in need of care cannot find adequate, nursing home or rest home accommodation. In view of the rapid ageing of the population, which we all know is happening, these problems inevitably are going to increase. I can see no reason why we have not reoriented our hyalth care services to provide such facilities as hospices for the terminally ill or why, because of the inflexibility of politicians, health administrators and medical practitIoners, terill people in pain cannot get access to heroin, which is recognised as the best pain relief for people in those circumstances. I can see no reason why conservatives are seen by some as' nice people, fighting for a free, society when, in fact, they are the ones responsible for maintaining the sort of economic structure which has created and that it continued the problems I have referred to. One advantage I had as a politician in a safe Labor seat in a lower socio-economic area was this: If I ever felt like taking things a little easy, like enjoying life in the Parliament, that mentality could not survive longer than the next day in the electorate office when again I would be faced with the line-up of the problems and discomforts faced by my constituents. These' problems obviously had a very different face to those brought to the conservative members of Parliament in their lush, green, spacious suburban electorates. I am angry that this is not the just society that the conservatives insist it is. It is a society of haves and havenots. There are those who h!lve the power and those who have 'no access to it, and no chance to gain that access. There are those who are rich and have the information and the means so vital to enable them to enjoy the benefits of society and there are those who are not and who do not. I am angry because many of the problems which I describe could be resolved with the application of a little imagination, some lateral thinking and redistribution and reallocation, rather than the expenditure of massive amounts of money. In 1980 the new member for Wills, the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), pointed out in his maiden speech to this Parliament that the expenditure of$600m would eliminate poverty in this country. He said that, if the Fraser Government had been prepared to amend tax laws: to ensure that the laws in respect of taxation applied equally to the rich and to the hiss rich alive, then the revenue would have'been available to effect this great purpose without any increase in the rate of tax. He went on to point out: If in 1979-80 taxes paid by the non-Wage and salary earner category of personal income recipients had kept up the same proportion to taxes paid by wage and salary . earners as they did in 1975-76, the public revenue would have been higher by $715m. Aswe are aware, the burden of,taxation continues to be unfairly placed on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, especially the lower and middle income .earners. I have been quite vocal in my support for taxation reform in Australia. The debate on taxation reform is one of the most important facing us. If we fail to provide Australians with a just, equitable and progressive tax system we will be entrenching further the problems to which I have .already referred. I do not believe that we should meekly accept the pronouncements about taxation that are fed to us by the so-called economic experts. Australia is the only member of th- Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development without death and gift duties. It is, with the Nethetlands, one of two member countries without a capital gains tax. It is not a highly taxed country, although the tax burden in this country is unfairly borne by the middle class and the poor. We must ensure that the taxation burden is reallocated so that it falls more equitably. As the Prime Minister illustrated in his maiden speecl-, even a slight reallocation could eliminate poverty. Of course, since he made his estimates we have suffered another full term of the inequities of the Fraser Government, but his point remains valid. If we extend this point, so that we undertake more substantial reforms rather than act merely within the parameters of the existing system, however inadequate or otherwise they may be, not only will we be able to eliminate poverty in this country but also we will be well on the way to raising the living standards of the great majority of Australians in the lower and middle income range. It is of no credit to all the parliaments of this nation that a million Australians live in proverty. We should make a much greater effort to eradicate the grind of poverty from our nation. Following the Henderson poverty inquiry it is my view that with the database that that provided this House should have established a committee on disadvantage, inequality and poverty to spearhead the fight. The problem still exists; we should delay no longer. A parliamentary poverty committee could be a great educative medium, particularly for Liberal and National Party members who show no understanding of the magnitude of human suffering caused by our community. It would also be a focus for exposing the problem to the community at large. It would be a bold step and a sign from this Parliament that we have hope for the future and a belief that all Australians can be helped to share in a better life. I wish to raise one or two further issues very briefly. The first is that of Aboriginal land rights. I am proud to have been a member of the Dunstan Government which negotiated the land rights agreement with the Pitjantjatjara people in South Australia-an agreement which received bipartisan support and was enacted finally by the Tonkin Liberal Government after we had left office in 1979. We have an obligation to Aboriginal people which has been too long unrecognised. We must ensure that we achieve a just settlement which takes into account the interests and wishes of Aboriginal people. Recognising that I and all other tjtembers Qfthis Parliament have enormous obligations in this place, I believe that one of the most fundamental is that we, more than any others, are the trustees of the Australian nation-at least for the duration of our time here. We are under a tremendous obligation to future generations of Australians not to leave this country in any worse condition than it was when we came here. Hopefully we will be able to pass it on in a better condition. I have come here as a representative of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement upon which it is based. I would like to thank all my supporters and campaign workers for their tireless efforts on my behalf. My. campaign committee was composed of people who believe in the things that I believe in and who are concerned with the sorts of issues that I have raised today. It is my hope that I will not let them down.",76
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Mr Mildren)Order! The honourable member.'s time has expired. Before I call the next speaker there are two points I wish to make. The first is that this is the next speaker's maiden speech and I request that all members of the House extend the. courtesies to that ll1ember to which he is traditionally entitled. I also remind the House that that is a courtesy, not a rule. There is an obligation on all members of the House, including the speaker, to recognise that.",79
170,Mr SLIPPER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was happy to defer to the  and I very much appreciated his contribution to this debate. I rise to speak in this chamber very conscious of the honour bestowed upon me by the electors of Fisher. The electorate is situated in the south-east corner of Queensland, the great State of the north. I am aware that I represerit all people in my electorate, regardlessorwhether to date they have favoured me with their support. I feel a sense of humility and am conscious of the great traditions of this place and of the Westminster system of government. I am proud to see our Australian national flag so prominent this chamber and the Royal Arms above Speaker's chair. Our flag is symbolic of Australia-its Christianity, its origins, its form government and its position in the world in southern hemisphere. Our flag must be preserved at all cost's for future generations. It is indeed sincerely regretted that some honourable members opposite do not value our I am pleased to support the motion so ably moved and seconded by the honourable members for Cowan (Ms Jakobsen) and St George (Mr Dubois). I wholeheartedly congratulate them on their efforts and I wish them a fulfilling, although not necessarily lengthy, stay in this phlce. It is interesting to note that we who are newly arrived in this chamber are berating our peers with what are officially termed 'maiden speeches'. I am pleased, but surprised, .that the term 'maiden' has not been outlawed as sexist by those who worry about such trivialities. I hope that I will resist the temptation to be unduly provocative and I must say that I appreciate the traditional courtesy extended to me. I am informed that in the mother of parliaments in London courtesy and reasonable co-operation are regular occurrences whereas by comparison, this House has always engaged in constant guerrilla warfare. Perhaps this is the Australian way, but I would be sad if it were. Unfortunately, these situations have a habit of enduring. I would \llso like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to pass on my best wishes to Mr Speaker and also to Madam Deputy Speaker on their respective elections. The non-partisan welcome and help given to me by both of them were truly appreciated. I might add that the very attractive garment in a becoming shade of National Party green worn the other day by Madam Deputy Speaker is no doubt· tangible evidence of this very warm welcome. I have long held an interest in. politics governmentand- like the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), have been a member of a party . for many years.

If it were not for drugs. the misguided decision of a relatively· small number o(voters, who knows. what shape our . foreign policy would now take?

Th- major centres and districts comprise Strathpine, Lawnton, Petrie, Kallangur in and Dayboro in the Pine Rivers Shire, CaboolMr ture, Bribie Island, the Beerwah-Glasshouse Mountains area, and parts of the Sunshine Coast of hinterland including Maleny, Montville, Maplethe . ton and Kenilworth. From there we head inland to Woodford, Kilcoy, Toogoolawah, Blackbutt, to be Yarraman, Cooyar and Crow's Nest. His a truly wonderful division, lam sure .honourable great heritage. members will agree. I am fortunate to .have as. my parliamentary neighbours the honourable members for Fairfax (Mr Adermann) in the east,· Wide· Bay .(Mr Millar) in the north, Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) in the west and Groom (Mr MCVeigh); Oxley (Mr Hayden), Petrie (Mr Hodges) and Ryan (Mr Moore) in the south. Together, we are members of all parties represented in this place \lnd our cooperation on matters of common interest should ensure succ-s. Within Fisher are some of the fastest growing residential areas in our country and I refer, of course, to the Pine Rivers and Caboolture shires. The. Queensland National Party· Government has done much to assist this development and I would like to congratulate the State Minister for Transport, Mr Don Lane, on the anticipated completion. next year of the suburbanelectric railway as fiu as Caboolture., Many of my constituents work in the city and it is important to have a fast, efficient and reasonably priced urban transport system. . , , . , . ,. . I also make a plea to. the Commonwealth to recognise the special problems that growth areas and their local authorities .face. Continuing financial assistance must be given and I will be doing everything in my power to achieve this.: The relevant Minister should certainly take note that I will be regularly beating a path to his door.

Iris wprse than useless for this Government to fiddle thejobless figures by adding people to the public payroll. Under this Government, public sector employment is one of the few growth industries. SmaIl business throughout Fisher is big business and a major employer. It is utterly wrong for any government to consider business to be an enemy to be crushed at all costs. A healthy private sector means a healthy economy. I turn now to the country areas. One of my concerns is that our nation's greatest hopes for the future earning of export income are not receiving attention and support. Mr Katter-Not by the Labor Government.",80
172,Mr SLIPPER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Certainly not by the Labor Government. I refer, of course, to the perpetually renewable resources of rural industries, many of which are situated in Fisher. The Government must consider the adverse effect that recent policy changes have had on these industries, for they have been, are now, and always will be the foundation of our country. I am pleased that. the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) mentioned that many members on this side of the House have the good fortune to represent very beautiful divisions, and Fisher is no exception. It is blessed with an excellent climate, rich soil and an ability to produce a vast number of rural products of excellent quality. We grow almost everything which goes into a fruit salad-from pineapples, bananas, pawpaws, citrus fruits and strawberries, through to more exotic varieties such as kiwi fruit and passion fruit. I am sure that my constituency would welcome your patronage, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the patronage of honourable members. Other major industries include dairying, poultry and egg farming, beef cattle, grain and lucerne, as well as tobacco, ginger and vegetable growing. All these industries have their unique problems and display great initiative. For example, the Caboolture Butter Factory in my electorate is meeting the chailenge or over-production by marketing a large number of new and original products in an aggressive free enterprise manner. Tourism is also a major industry, on Bribie as well as in nearby coastal towns and the Sunshine Coast hinterland. There are a vast number and variety of original attractions and beaches. Large numbers of refugees from southern States and left-wing governments are, to quote our excellent Premier Joh, 'voting with their feet' by selecting my electorate as a place to holiday or settle. As you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome them all. I am indeed fortunate to sit with this fine body of people comprising the National Party of Australia. I am particularly honoured that so many of them have seen fit to be present in this chamber to hear my maiden speech. I am pleased and honoured to serve with the Leader of the Op National Party (Mr Sinclair), for as surely as night follows day-or should I say 'Hawke follows Whitlam'-in less than three years they will hold the nation's two highest elective offices. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will join me in congratulating them in anticipation. I am also pleased to see Senator Boswell and Senator Sheil present in the senators' gaIlery for my maiden speech. I wish to record publicly my thanks to Senator Lady Bjelke-Petersen, known as Senator Flo throughout the length and breadth of Queensland and Australia, for her extensive assistance in the election campaign. I am certain that this lady does not have an enemy in the world and I know that she is highly regarded by everyone who meets her. I would be remiss if I did not record appreciation to my parents and family, to my campaign director, Bruce Page, from Peachester, and his wife, Helen, and my entire campaign committee for their obviously fruitful efforts on my behalf. I am also indebted to Mrs Yvonne Chapman and Mr Bill Newton, the very effective and hard working National Party State members for Pine Rivers and Caboolture who also played key roles. In addition, my thanks go to other State members whose electorates are partly included in FisherDeputy Premier BiII Gunn, Minister for Industry, Small Business and Technology, Mike Ahern, Gordon Simpson, Tony EIliott and Tony Fitzgerald. I also see Miss Cathie Gregor, State Secretary of the Queensland Young Nationals, in the Speaker's GaIlery. The Young Nationals are, of course, a very fine organisation which I have served as State President. As a former State President of the Young Nationals, I. know that it is a very fine organisation. The Federal· division of Fisher was created by the redistribution prior to the 1949 election, which saw Sir Robert Menzies returned as Prime Minister. Undoubtedly, with the obvious exceptions of Prime Ministers MCEwen, Fadden and Page-I hope that my Leader has noticed what I said-Menzies - as our greatest Prime Minister ever, and he remained firmly at the helm of Australia for a record term. Fisher has seen its size,shape and composition altered from time to time at the whim of various redistribution committees. Since its creation, it has been represented by only three members. A great Queenslander and Australian, the Rt. Hon. Sir Charles Frederick Adermann, father of my predecessor, served in this House, initially as the member for Maranoa and then as, th- inaugural representative of my present seat. He was elected to this Parliament on no fewer than 11 occasions and in 1955 his constituents thought him so worthy of continued support that he was unopposed. It may be too much to hope that my constituents may be similarly impressed in the future. Sir Charles's contribution to the nation has been immense and equalled by few others.

He was an excellent Minister for Primary Industry, for understood his subject fully. Many honourable government. members, particularly those opposite, would be aware of the tremendous debt which Tasmania, Queensland and Australia owe to Sir Charles Adermann. He fanned the political aspirations Queensland's long-serving Premier, encouraging him to seek Party endorsement for, the former State electorate of Nanango. If it wen- not for efforts of Sir Charles Adermann, Queensland today would not be privileged to ,have Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen as its leader. Indeed, the whole of Australia is no doubt grateful that Sir',Joh is there to keep any socialist government iIi line. The second member for Fisher, Mr Evan Adermann, is still serving in this tively I might add, as the honourable member for Fairfax. Evan is a modest, sincere and dediCated person of excellent character and he possesses Christian principles. He has served the nation as Minister of the Crown for almost five years and a reservoir of common sense, decency and parliao(mentary knowledge. I could continue extolling the honourable member's virtues; however, I will desist lest it should sound like an obituary. pleased to be on his left in this chamber-in a geosociety. graphic sense, I hasten to add-and thank him for his help and guidance. I would also like to thank my good friend the honourable member for Maranoa for his excellent representation of those areas I inherited from him in a political sense the last redistribution. , I am told that a maiden speech gives one portunity-and I understand that such me,nt opportunities are very rare-to expound one's personal philosophy a little. Being a member of the National Party, I believe in the maximum possible freedom of the individual from qureauunthought cratic and governmental interference. There must be, of course, respect for the Crown of law, as well as our judicial system and parliamentarY institutions. Accordingly, I am somew-at saddened by ,the standard of dress now permitted in this chamber. Mr Katter-Shocking.",81
173,Mr SLIPPER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"It is indeed shocking. I support less taxes and less government, along with the principle that there should be reward for initiative, enterprise and hard work. In common with many others in this place, I am a supporter of the principle of States rights, and as a lawyer I have been concerned at their steady erosion since serFederation. An immediate worry is the complete misuse, or should I say abuse, by this Government of the Federal external affairs power. Decentralisation of political power and the reversal of curhe rent trends must be a top priority for the next It is, indeed, a sad state of affairs that not more and more decisions affecting Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia are being made centrally by this Parliament, in of which those States have little more than numerically nominal representation, albeit of excellent quality. I agree with the honourable member for the Denison (Mr Hodgman), who said in his maiden speech a number of years ago: We believe that Tasmanian decisions should be made by Tasmanians. We believe that West Australian decisions should be made by West Australians. ' I am sure he would not mind, if I added that Queensland decisions ,should be made by House, very effecQueenslanders. Since the election my electorate office has been inundated with queries from constituents rightly a fearful of Labor's savage assets test on pensic)[ls. is For this reason, I have given notice to this House an intended motion condemning this brutal impositiQn on our senior citizens. I am, also concerned, at the erosion of fllmily values and at the I am - ttack on the family as the basic unit in our Alas, time waits for no man, so I must move on. Other matters that must be addressed are the question of constant industrial anarchy arid outin rageous Aboriginal land claims, as well as the need to follow Mrs Thatcher's sterling example by moving in the direction of privatising nationalised an opcompanie,s and government enterprises. Governis necessary, but we must always rememl;ler that it is II necessary evil. Under successive administra-ions in this country the public sector has spread its unwelcome tentacles in hitherto of directions. Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, it is now time to take a stand and to be and the rule honest to our philosophy. It is fitting that my electorate should be named in honour of the Rt Hon. Andrew Fisher, one of Her Majesty's Privy Councillors and Prime Minister of this nation on three occasions. He was a man of great principle and a person who exercised his many abilities in advancing the Labor cause. He was a great supporter of the idea that the Labor Party should be the political voice of the working man, and in his day it certainly was. Andrew Fisher was loyal to his sovereign, to institution of monarchy and to his Party. He gave an outstanding example to everyone into contact with him. As Prime Minister, Fisher made an unqualified promise of support to Britain. Honourable members on both sides House would know of Fisher's famous declaration that 'Australia would assist the Empire to her man and shilling'. He decided to resign in 1915 a result of friction in the Labor Cabinet. Nothing much changes. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) said so eloquently in this chamber couple of days ago, 'so We are where we were we were where we are'. I intend to serve my electorate, my State this Parliament to the best of my ability in the dition of my predecessors, so that I may be conestablished. sidered and counted worthy to be their successor. Time is short and mine has almost expired. Like the right honourable member for New England more than 20 years ago; I would like to adopt words of Sir Winston Churchill, who said: This is not the end, it is not even the beginning end, but it is perhaps the end of the beginning. I thank the House for its kind indulgence to a member. """,82
174,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Order! The honourable versity. member's time has expired. Before calling the honourable member for Burke, - would ,remind challenges. the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech, and I trust he will be extended usual courtesies.",83
175,Mr OKEEFE,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"1 come to this House as a consequence of the recent Federal distribution. Whilst the seat of Burke has retained the same name, it is effectively a new electorate central Victoria. I must acknowledge the work my predecessors, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), the honourable for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), the previous honourable member for Burke and present honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), and you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as the honourable member for Scullin. The efforts of my colleagues as members of this place have paved the way for me so adequately. The seat of Burke represents a wide cross section of social and economic conditions and life styles. In fact, I believe it to be representative of the wide challenge which faces our Government as a whole. This seat includes outer metropolitan areas, such as West Meadows, Bethal and Coolaroo-disadvantaged areas which require close attention and support from our Government. There are satellite centres, such as Craigieburn, Sunbury and Gisborne, which are the experiencing growth and the strains upon comrriunity support services, such as housing, child who came care and health. ,Elsewhere in the electorate are major rural of the centres and provincial towns, such as Castlemaine, Bacchus Marsh, Kyneton and last Daylesford, and the fringes of Bendigo and as Ballarat. They need our encouragement and assistance in the decentralisation of industry to provide them with stability and growth. I have In my a electorate smaller country towns which have their and own unique characteristics, such as my home town of Heathcote and the town of Woodend, which is now a blending of commuters who travel and to Melbourne for their work and the traditional trafarming and rural base on which the area has been Also there is Maldon, which is an historic centre which is building upon the mining and pioneering heritage of the district and which is recognised by the National Trust and is being the preserved under the direction of this Government. In this seat there is a unique blend of life of the styles and objectives. It comprises people who, despite major changes in their rural, industrial and working circumstances, or tragedies, such as the new recent bushfire disasters, have shown remarkable determination and resilie,nce in the face of adMy conviction arid that of this Government is to embrace their needs and meet these The Government program announced by the the Governor General follows upon the first term of the Hawke Labor Government. In March 1983 this Government was elected to bring Australians reback together on a course of national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction. In that first in period of office the Government established conof fidence in itself and turned round the economy. Three key components of the economic strategy member have achieved the turnaround. ' Firstly, there is the prices and incomes accord, which is the foundation stone of this Government's economic policy; The prices and incomes accord has been principally responsible for the current inflation rate of 5.1 per cent-the lowest rate in Australia for 12 years. We have given a stimulus to the housing industry, for which we make no apology. The injection of funds into public housing and the first home buyer's scheme has contributed to getting this industry on the move again. Most significantly, again through this Government's economic management, there has been a fall in interest rates which has directly stimulated home buying. The Government has turned to the use of the public sector for job creation schemes, such as the community employment· program, the jobs on local roads program and the bicentennial road development program. The effect of these programs can be seen all through my electorate. They 'are excellent programs and they are achieving the Government's objective of providing job opportunities for the long term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups in the labour market. I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) .of a further $8.7m worth of CEP work in Victoria-providing 622 new jobs. I draw particular attention to a project to be conducted by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, which will employ 10 people for 26 weeks on preparing regional reports on bushfire prevention activities and undertaking fire prevention work, including the clearing of roads and fire breaks-a worthwhile project funded under the community employment program. While speaking on fire prevention, I welcome the announceinent by the Minister tor· Science (Mr Barry Jones) of the Government's intention to set up a new bushfire research unit at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, to establish a National Centre for Rural Fire Research at the Chisholm Institute of Technology and, through the Industrial Research and DeveIopment Grants Act, to provide a feasibility study into a computer assisted disaster agement system. In talking about disaster management, I congratulate the Victorian Governm'ent for managing to tackle the task of emergency services coordination. Through its work in Victoria there has been a major advance in the organisation of emergency services to combat bushfire disasters. The lessons learned from the Ash Wednesday fires were significant, and they enabled Victoria to cope with the recent bushfire outbreaks there. While speaking on the Victorian Government, I also want to comment on the significant developments in education. After a decade of industrial disputation and government inaction, in one term the State Labor Government has turned a polarised and inflammatory environment into one of close working relationships and substantial industrial harmony. I give credit also to the teacher unions that have responded with the formation of their teachers federation and that now play their part in a consensus of parents, teachers and government in Victorian education. The· Victorian Government has also conducted a major overhaul of administration,with significant devolution of power and influence to local school councils. Most importantly, because .to me unemployment is a major priority, I commend the V-ctorian Government for the way in which it has embraced job creation schemes to get people back to work. Through its own employment initiative program and.the flow-ons of our Government's community employment program, the results have been put on the board in Victoria. That State now has the lowest unemployment rate in Australia. ' Given the scope of the Burke electorate, I have also announced my intention to work closely with the 21 local government bodies in the electorate, for I believe that that is the best medium through which I can most effectively represent my constituents. This Government is committed to local government as the third tier of administration and our strong links with local government will result in the successful implementation of our programs. I cite the City of Broadmeadows as an indication of what can now be achieved by Labor governments co-operating at the Federal, State and local levels. I can give personal testimony of this because I grew up in the City of Broadmeadows and I am aware of the results of years of neglect and disadvantage during successive Liberal governments at the Federal and State levels. Now in Broadmeadows, after one term of Cain government and one term of Hawke government, we have a new technical and further education colman- lege, a community health centre, a basketball stadium, a new courthouse and police station to assist in the administration of justice, a new town park and an ethnic community council and migrant resource centre have been established. Today the Cain Government has announced another $lOm project to reconstruct the Broadmeadows station. Around $25m has been allocated in.one term of government. Mr Speaker, during this term of office, as outlined in the Governor General's address, the major objective of this Government will be to reform the taxation.system and the approach that we are adopting is to have a tax summit to allow the various components of Australian society to come together and make an input. It worked at the National, Economic Summit Conference and it will work at the tax summit. I see the reform of the taxation system as our most important objective because we are determined to achieve a fair and equitable system. We want to eradicate the opportunities for tax rip-offs and rorts which characterise the current system. We want to and will achieve these aims. Not long ago I attended a management development conference stressing improved worker participation and industrial democracy. The keynote speaker, a person of international renown, indicated to the seminar that Australian workers, when given the scope to demonstrate their initiative and capabilities, are among the most inventive and ingenious in the world-particularly on weekends. On weekends we manage to organise community groups and sporting teams; we demonstrate administrative, economic and budgetary skills; we can build extensions and renovate houses, build holiday homes and overhaul and maintain motor vehicles; and can even become barbecue gourmet chefs. But the speaker at this seminar stressed that the problem lies not just with increasing the skills of the work force in Australia but with improving management and the effective use of our labour force. We have the capabilities within this country; management' must learn to use them. That is the thrust of the Government's initiatives to improve worker participation and industrial democracy. I believe it is appropriate also to indicate something. about my personal approach to being a member of this Parliament. I say that in reference to the shameful events of November 1975. The sacking of the Whitlam Government brought into question the Whole Westminster system. At that time Gough Whitlam urged us to maintain our faith in the process of parliament. He urged us to maintain our rage, but to maintain our faith well. I have done so and I turn to those on the other side of the House and point to their deplortralised able behaviour at that time which brought great discredit on this Parliament. In fact, very little changed. Prior to the recent Federal election Opposition stooped to personal attacks on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and again reduced the public perception of this place to an all time low. One asks why members of the Opposition befight have in this manner. The basic problem is that they are bereft-they are bereft of philosophy, they are bereft of expertise and they are bereft the ability to govern. Take their philosophy, once again exposed in this House just a few moments ago by the Leader of the .Opposition (Mr cock). For years they have gone on about free enterprise, always coupled with cries for cutbacks in public expenditure and deregulation of busiwords. ness. During their period of office; from 1975 1982, they presided over an expansion of public sector debt to a projected $9 billion. That was the deficit to be left behind for our Treasurer (Mr Keating). They presided over massive expansion in regulation and control and a massive increase in small business bankruptcies. Their Country Party-or National Party, as they prefer to be called-colleagues continually bleat for one subsidy or protection scheme or another, but that is not what the rural sector needs. It does not need subsidies or handouts-it needs orderly and creative marketing and managelllent and co-ordination of its productive capacities. The rural economy was once the backbone of this nation; now we on this side are being asked to rebuild in a term what it took them twenty years to run down. We will rise to the challenge and we will win the full respect of the rural sector in so doing. I take pride in drawing attention to the announcement of the Minister for Primary Industry (MrKerin) of the formation of the Government's primary industry, rural and provincial affairs committee. The new committee will increase the status of primary industry and rural affairs within the Hawke Government and it reflects the importance of the Government's commitment to Australia's rural communities. It will ensure that members and senators who have day to day contact with constituents in rural areas will have input to the process. It is the first step in fulfilling this Government's pre-election promise to better integrate government activities as they affect rural Australia. Economic management is more than just rhetoric and slogans. There can be no better example than the approach of those on the other side of the as House to wages policy when they were in government. In 1975 there was total support for a cenwage fixation system. They urged plateau indexation, which was a total disaster leading to has confrontation with wage earners bea.ring the the' brunt. By 1982 they had totally abandoned that position, opting fqr free market direct bargaining. Why such a turnaround? It was because their whole policy was based on the economic slogan of inflfltion first, without any real understanding of the causes and interactions involved. It was just a discredited philosophy· .which produced of nothing but unemployment and misery for cquntless Australian families. Who coined phrases such as 'dole bludgers' and 'life wasn't meant to be Peaeasy'-no pun intended? Nothing has changed. There are still no policies and no philosophy; just outdated rhetoric. Actions speak louder than Our Government has produced the goods to and our Government will continue to do so. In conclusion, I thank you, Mr Speaker, the Clerk and his staff for the assistance in my induction into this place. I take this opportunity to gratulate you, Mr Speaker and Madam Deputy Speaker, on your election to your positions in this Parliament. I thank the people of the electorate of Burke for their confidence and support. I assure them of my commitment to represent them in this Government to the best of my ability. I give a special indication of my appreciation and support to those members of my campaign committee and other members of the Australian Labor Party, in and out of the Burke electorate, who supported me. They know that I see mys'elf as their representative and I have a commitment to working closely with them. Of course, I thank my family and, in particular my wife Rhonda and my boys Michael and Andrew because they must continue to support me in my parliamentary career. I take this opportunity to thank those honourable members present for the courtesy they have shown me during my maiden speech.",83
176,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Before I call the honourable member for Casey, I remind honourable members that' this is his maiden speech. I trust that the House will allow him the usual courtesies.",86
177,Mr HALVERSON,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I bffer my warm congratulations on your recent appointment. It is my honour 'and privilege to serve the people of Casey as their representative in this Parliament. I thank the electors who placed their trust and c!lnfidence in me and the many people who supported, encouraged and assisted the campaign of the Liberal 'Party of Australia in the Casey electorate. This is an office which encompasses duties, responsibilities and obligations awesome in their magnitude and diversity. I stand ready and willing to accept the challenges and I am prepared to pursue with dedication and commitment the best interests of my constituents. I am very grateful and unashamedly proud to have this opportunity to be of service to my electorate and my country. Casey is situated to the north-east of Melbourne. To the south its boundaries are outer metropolitan SUburbs; to the north the Great Dividing Range. The electorate covers approximately 750 square kilometres and includes suburban, semi-rural and rural areas, with industries ranging from heavy secondary to pastoral. The concerns, needs and interests of the people of Casey are complex, distinct and varied, reflecting the contrasting demographic and geographic features which combine' to give the electorate its microcosmic character. This electorate bears the name of one of Australia's most distinguished sons, Richard Garcondiner Casey, whose outstanding career of public, political and parliamentary service spanned six decades. As a soldier with the first Australian Imperial Force he served at Gallipoli and on the Western Front and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross for his personal bravery. As a Cabinet Minister in times of both peace and war his responsibilities included the portfolios of Treasurer, Supply and Development, External Territories, Works and Housing, National Development and External Affairs. As a wartime diplomat and troubleshooter, a member of Britain's war Cabinet and in the difficult and dangerous role of Governor of Bengal during the critical period leading up to India's independence, he became friend, confidant and trusted adviser to world leaders, including Churchill and Gandhi. He developed and maintained lifelong interest in and influence on Aus' tralian scientific and technological progress, particularly through his close assQciatio l1 and involvement with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. In the early 1950s, Casey recognised that Australia's position would alter 'from being a British-European outpost to being an independent, stable and significant leader in an Asian environment. He realised also the importance of strengthening and safeguarding the AustralianAmerican alliance. He implemented a post-war foreign policy designed to be relevant and beneficial to what he perceived correctly as Australia's future role. He was created a life peer in 1960 in recognition of his outstanding and loyal service to Australia and the British Commonwealth. In 1965 Lord Casey became the third native-born Australian to be appointed Governor General. He served this office with distinction and dedication until his retirement in 1969. He died in June 1976 aged 85, having devoted nearly three-quarters of his lifetime to serving Australia. His wife, Maie, contributed a wide range of talents in her own right to the Casey career which, in many ways, was a partnership. From my experience I know how important it is to have the help, support and encouragement of a loved and loving wife. Lord Casey sincerely believed in, and rigorously and without hesitation applied to his own life, the concept of service to country above self. Soldier, diplomat, statesman, talented and gifted, a gentleman in the true sense of the word-he was all these things. But more importantly, from first to last, he was a patriot. It is to the continuing detriment and disadvantage of Australia that we do not have more men and women of the calibre of Richard and Maie Casey. It may be argued that such people are born and not made but without an environment that nurtures and encourages the ideals that make 'a country great-patriotism, nationalism, optimism, endeavour, the spirit of adventure, identifying and responding to challenge-it is unlikely, if not impossible, that greatness will emerge, develop or even survive. It is a sad reflection on the current state of our nation that patriotism and nationalism are becoming tainted and unacceptable words and that sacrifice, courage, discipline, loyalty, devotion to duty and love of country are, to many, un fashion:. able concepts or embarrassing cliches. Some may briefly rally to the cause during the cricket season or the Olympic Gaines. Certainly we break out the green and gold, balloons and streamers, perhaps even our coats of many colours, to celebrate a magnificent national sporting victory such as winning the America's Cup. But such universal displays of national fervour are rather short lived. If honourable members stopped 10 people in the street and asked them to repeat the words of our national song they would find that nine of them do not even know the fitst line. This may be symptomatic of the fact that there is now only limited room, if any at all, in the busy school curriculum for exercises such as the singing of our national song or saluting our country's flag. It may indicate also the first successes of' a small' but vocal minority who are committed to 'reeducating' the rest of us in regard to out British traditions. These same people are happy foi: Us to spend millions of dollars restoring examples of early Australian architecture. They will even arrange demonstrations and organise strikes to ensure that we do. The vast majority' of these buildings originated in the early days of British settlement and display the unmistakable influence, if not the actual handwork and craftsmanship, of British settlers from both sides of the bars who pioneered this country. Yet, to a large extent, these people are the sponsors and supporters of current efforts to replace our flag because it reflects our early ties with Britain; something about which they consider we should not be reminded in the context of the intangibles of pride in our traditions but to which they have no objectiof,l in the realities.of bricks and mortar. Altering the design of our flag will not and cannot alter facts that are now history. Australia was a British colony, a part of the British Empire. Fortunately it remains-at least for the moment-a member of the Commonwealth, the most successful and stable international political alliance ever established. Our parliamentary system, our legal system and the protections and safeguards of our system of government which are reinforced by a constitutional monarchy; are all traditions we have inherited from Britain and they are inextricably woven into the fabric of our Australian heritage and our Australian society. To claim that a new flag would be an appropriate gesture for our two-hundredth birthday to signify our independence, our rebirth as a nation in our own right and our long awaited-by some-severance of our ties with Britain, is to replace reality with absurdity. Rather than proving we have come of age, it will be a startling example of our immaturity and an unnecessary. exercise in divisiveness. We. are already an independent nation. If we have not yet come to grips with this fact, a green and gold flag-even one with shooting stars or a kangaroo rampant-will do little to alter our internal attitudes. It wiiI have even less effect on our international standing. . . Australia is not faced with any current threat and is unlikely to be faced by any future threat which could be directly attributed to her historical links with Britain. We are, however, certainly a nation at risk and the immediate danger comes not from without but from within. We are in the midst of a self-generated identity crisis, uncertain about who we are, why we are and where we are going. Our smouldering bewilderment is being fanned and fuelled by those committed to promoting ideologies and a new social order foreign to Australia and totally unacceptable to the vast majority of Australians. If we allow it to flare unchecked it will rapidly engulf and destroy those values, standards and traditions which are the keystones of our democracy and our Australian way of life. The immediacy and reality of this threat manifests itself in readily identifiable ways. Our education system is being increasingly used as. a means whereby political propaganda is. disseminated and instilled in .the impressionable minds of our student population. What better de'Vonstration of this alarming trend than the recent announcement by Premier Cain of his intention to distribute 'education kits' to Victorian schools to explain and justify his nuclear-free State and peace policies. That such a blatant abuse of our educational resources and facilities should even be contemplated, much less' publicly promoted, is indicative of the present crisis in many of our schools. Institutions which oncproudly encouraged the pursuit of excellence, of striving to do one's best, are now reduced to accepting second rate as near enough, and near enough as good enough. ' We already have a generation of young Australians who have been deprived of their faith in themselves and their hope for the future. It is a depressing fact that, in this International Year of Youth, many thousands of them will turn to drugs, alcohol, crime-or even, as a last resort, suicide-as they struggle to find a solution to their despair, distress and disillusionment. No doubt they will be encouraged-quite wrongly, but nonetheless very convincingly-to regard our free enterprise system as being the cause of their troubles and lack of opportunities. They will respond accordingly. Unemployment continues at frightening levels. The tragedy of wanting to work but being unable to find a job is just as devastating and demoralising, if not more so, for those over 40 years of age as it is for those under 20. Most people who are in receipt of the unemployment benefit would prefer the satisfaction and dignity of working for their pay to receiving what they and the rest of the community perceive as a no strings attached handout from the Government. One possible solution to their dilemma would be to reintroduce a system of national service. National· service should mean just that-to be of service to one's nation. It is the small pric.e one should be prepared to pay to live in the finest country on earth. It does not necessarily mean military service, conscription or enlistment. It should not be interpreted as encouragement of, or preparation for war. It would simply be an additional means of creating a range of useful and practical employment opportunities to provide options for those who prefer working for their pay to being paid for not working. There should be no embarrassment, fear or hesitation. in being prepared and able to contribute to one's country and community through a proper national service program. Another obvious and permanent solution lies in stimulating the private sector, particularly the small business sector, which has the potential'capacity and capability to provide self-funding employment on a large-scale, permanent basis. Instead, the Government persists in adopting short term 'band-aid' measures, funded from the public purse. The non-productive nature of most of these projects ensures that the long suffering taxpayer will have little relief from that most depressing of occupations-public purse refilling. Penalties are now being imposed on what once was,regarded as responsible citizenship. One example is the iniquitous, socialist inspired assets test. People who have worked hard, scrimped and saved to achieve security and peace of mind in their twilight years are now threatened because of their diligence, initiative and thrift. Honest, decent people are being turned into liars and cheats as they attempt to protect what is rightfully theirs. Our senior citizens are not only stripped of their hard earned, so-called assets, but also of their dignity and pride as they are subjected to the probing of big brother bureaucracy, determined to deprive them of any suspected over-abundance of wealth. No other section of our community is forced to suffer such a distressing and disgraceful invasion of privacy as having to reveal, perhaps even justify, their lists of personal possessions to an imper"" sonal inspector who may knock at their door on behalf of the state. Another grave concern is the undermining of the role and responsibilities of the traditional family unit. We must act now to preserve the stability, sanctity and strength of normal family relationships and bonds currently threatened' by unacceptable and trendy alternatives, some of which have already been condoned by government legislation. Moral values and standards-such as respect, self-control and self-esteem, regard for rights, welfare and well-being of others-are not unnecessary or old-fashioned concepts; they are gijidelines which ensure the growth and development of a decent, disciplined and civilised community. Families need special support, consideration and protection. They must be provided with the environment and encouragement which enables them to cater for their own needs and manage their own affairs. They do not benefit from attitudes which belittle or diminish their status or influence. To sanction any further decrease in the already rapidly declining position of the tnldition!jl family structures, standards and values is to guarantee the collapse of a fundamental and most important unit in our society. In direct contrast to this background of our current actual experience of socialist policies based on unnecessary government interference and· increasing government intervention and regulation, we have been promised a Bill of Rights to ensure the freedom of our society and guarantee our privileges as individuals. In reality, this Bill of Rights is a Bill of constraints and .caveats. - f it is ever implemented, it will effectively deny us our traditional freedom of choice and will offer in its place a whole new concept-freedom to do as we are told. In concert with the current attack on our links with Britain is a more sinister, more far reaching and more potentially disastrous campaign against our American allies in the ANZUS alliance on which the security and prosperity of this country depend. Our relationship with the United States of America is vital-it must be based on mutual trust and co-operation. It is tinged with suspicion and apprehension. We are being mislead and manipulated by those who claim to be motivated by concern fOf the futur- security and stability of the world in general and this country in particular. Australians, particularly young Australians; are being frightened by continual talk of the possibility of a nuclear war instead of being encouraged to appreciate and ;tccept th<,: reality of a nuclear peace, a peace which is secured by the nuclear capability and strength of Ameri-a, the only cOl.llltry in the free world able.to ma.tch the battle power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Whilst that power remains balanced, we have our best chance of a lasting peace and of retaining the freedoms and liberties we now so often take for granted. Until they are actually fired in anger, the. weapons of war. retain a proven potential and positive roIeas instruments of peace. Our security has now· been jeopardised by the actions of State socialist governments in denying our allies access· to our ports iiI1d the Hawke Government in denying the United States of America the facilities required to assist in the testing of MX missiles. Once and for all, the true allegiancesof some members of the powerful socialist Left. faction of. the Australian L.abor Party have been revealed. Let no-one be deceived by this shameful exercise in trading the future security of Australia for personal ambition in the short term and the furtherance of the socialist ideology in the longer term. ' In this Parliament we debate policies and issue's which affect the lives of all Australians. The cisions made here must be based on what is right and fair for Australia and Australians, and the correct decisions may not always be the popular ones. This powerful and privileged institution the embodiment and guardian oCthe democratic rights and freedoms of this nation and her people.

I also pay tribute and express my most deeply felt gratitude to my wife, Anne, and my two sons and two daughters for their love, loyalty and commitment, which went far beyond what any husband or father could reasonably ask or expect. I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of those people who have in the past given conscientious representation to the electorate I now represent. The seat of Hunter is one of the original Federal seats and its first member was our nation's first Prime Minister-Edmund Barton, later Sir deEdmund. Matt Charlton served the electorate well for 18 years lmd the Jameses, father Rowley arid son Bert, served the electorate for a remarkable span of 50 years broken only by a three-year is period served by the great Dr Herbert Vere Evatt. The new electorate of Hunter is an amalgam, a bit ' like a four-piece jigsaw puzzle. The new seat of Hunter has been given 18,000 voters from the seat of Paterson. I feel sure that many. honourable and members would have noticed that Mr and Mrs Frank O'Keefe were in attendance when this Thirty-fourth Parliament was opened. Frank gavelS years of distinguished service to I this House and I know that honourable members are unanimous in their respect for Frank and of Nance O'Keefe; I am sure honourable members wish that lovely .couple the long and happy retirement they so richly deserve. The honourable member for Lyne, Mr Bruce you Cowan, in a rare moment of mental a,berration, slip through his fingers 18,000 of his finest constituentswho.are \low happily enrolled in Hunter. I thank the hQnounible member for being a good shepherd to these voters, but. I assure him that I am they have come to a better pasture. ' I congratulate the honourable member for abortion, Newcastle, Mr Allan Morris, on his matchless play of generosity for permitting some 6,000 ble voters-I need not explain why they are sensiThey ble; they happen to vote for the Australian Labor Party-to be enrolled in the new Hunter electorate. I now mention a man to whom lowe a great deal, more than I can ever repay-Robert James recovery. Brown, the honourable member for Charlton. The honourable member for Charlton has served in the New South Wales Parliament and this Par"" liament with great distinction. I thank him and wife, Joy, for their friendship. When the honourfirst able member switched to his present electorate left 14,000 of his former voters in the electorate Hunter. I speak for the overwhelming majority that number in saying thank you to Bob Brown for a representation which was the epitome of personal and political commitment. I feel very proud and honoured that my name now stands among those I have mentioned. They are men who have made-some of them are continuing to make-a magnificent contribution to our nation's political system. Hunter is like many other Federal country elecof torates. It has 13,000 square kilometres of mixed agricultural and industrial pursuits. The main centres of population are Maitland, Cessnock, Beresfield-I will get them all on recordSingleton, Denman and Merriwa, which are joined by smaller but no l-s vibrant townships such as Woodberry, Tarro, Thornton, Lochinvar, true. Branxton, Greta, Neath, Wollombi, Bellbird, Pokolbin, Paterson, Gresford, Jerry's Plains and Sandy Hollow. Every honourable member would be aware of the extent to which the Hunter electorate is one of this nation's main engine rooms. I assure my honourable colleagues that every dollar spent in my electorate will advance Australia far further than the same dollar invested elsewhere. It is no exaggeration to state that when the Hunter Valley is going well the of this nation is going well. At the moment the nation is not exactly aglow with good health. However, it is certainly doing far better now than it was doing before Labor gained control of treasury bench. I wonder what transfer fee scheme, honourable members opposite would be prepared to pay for the Labor Party's Treasurer, Keating. Before the advent of the Hawke Government this nation was afflicted with an apparently minal illness brought about by policies which had a pretty rough gestation. These policies were ceived by divisiveness, nurtured in the womb deceit and incompetence, and, if they escaped saw the light of day as uncaring degenerdisates devoid of social conscience. There was not sensitoo much wrong with the coalition's policies. had only one fault-they did not work. It was a lucky day for this country when the Hawke Government was elected and able to put into practice a coherent set of economic and social policies which have put us on the path to No apology is necessary for reminding honourable members on the other side of his House of the his miracle achieved by the Hawke Government in its two years in office. At a time when members he. of the Fraser Government had thrown their arms of into the air in despair, the Labor Government set of about producing the strongest and most sustained economic performance for decades. What agony the conservative members opposite must have suffered when opinion poles showed that their supporters considered the present Treasurer and his team to be superior managers of the economy. How galling it must have been for them to see Labor's successes in halving the infiationrate and slicing the rate of unemployment. How they must be kicking themselves as they observe the success Labor's pursuit of national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction, which won the support and admiration of all sectors of the com"" munity, including the business and rural sectors. Opposition members may well chorus that Australia still has its problems and, indeed that is But in the honest recesses of their hearts they know what history has proved-that when the going is tough the best bet is a Labor government. The going does remain tough in the Hunter Valley. Because of its industrial and manufacturing base, the Hunter has been ravaged by unemployment problems. Some townll in the Hunter Valley have unemployment figures double that of the national average. The people of the Hunter electorate, however, welcome the concern that our rest Government has shown towards the unemployed and they applaud the initiatives that are being taken to generate' employment opportunities. I refer to the broadening of the community employ the ment program, the new enterprise initiatives the increased support for apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship training, work experience Mr opportunities, the community youth support scheme programs and the reforming of labour market programs to give greater emphasis to terimproved training and works skills development. All these are evidence of the Government's genuconine concern for the unemployed and evidence of by this Government's determination to act rather than to mouth ineffectually words of sympathy. The House is aware of the recent crippling train strike in the Hunter Valley and its effect on the nation's credibility at a time when coal and wheat producers are fighting desperately to retain and gain markets and thus ensure employment. As I moved in the House last week, which motion was greeted wi-h a chorus of derision by the Opposition, congratulations are due to those in the Hunter Valley who have come together in a spirit of consensus to create a consultative committee which wiIIwork for an early settlement of disPlltes which are likely to interrupt the passage of coal between mines and ships. The people of the Hunter Valley are deeply appreciative of the Government's commitment to revitalise and restructure our manufacturing industries so as to increase our competitive strength. The buoyancy imd viability of our manufacturing and fabricating industries ar- central to the prose perity of the Hunter electorate. The steel industries assistance plan is crucial to our welfare. Voters in the Hunter Valley well know that, were it not for the Hawke government, there would not be a steel works in Newcastle .. The Government has formulated positive policies designed to promote small business opportunities ana to stimulate industrial development. In this House I will pursue the development of policy initiatives in that vi-al area. The electors in the Hunter Valley will endorse this Gov.ernment's commitment to assist the restructuring and revitalisatioh of industries in the rural section. Of particular concern to me is the plight of our dairy industry. We have many fine dairy farmers in the Hunter Valley. From meetings I have held with dairymen, I find them to be responsible and sensible. But they are deeply and justifiably worried about the problems confronting them. They and I appreciate the efforts. being made by my good friend the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin), who is striving mightily to find solutions to the problems of the dairy industry. Dairymen in the Hunter electorate are aware that the powers of the Federal Minister are restricted by State Government considerations. However, they are delighted that the Minister is prepared to visit Singleton to witness the problems of the industry at first hand and to establish a meaningful dialogue with them. We all know the 'problems confronting the man on the land because of the agricultural policies of the European Economic Community; and for other reasons. But it is not to the Opposition's credit that it has deliberately falsified the facts about many rural problems. Opposition members claim that farm incomes are at their nadir when in actual fact farm incomes were at their lowest in 1982-83 when the rural community was being strangled by conse'rvative hands. From 1977 to 1982, under the coalition, farm costs rose by 200 per cent whereas this Government has kept farm costs increases below that of the consumer price index. Also of great importance to the Hunter electorate are the wine and tourist industries. Members of this House, due to the generosity of Wyndham Estate wines, will have ample knowledge that the Hunter wines-there may be some disagreement-are the best in the world. Vignerons have survived the 10 per cent wine tax but it is important that the industry not be made a milking cow. I urge the Government to take action to protect the Australian wine industry from the. dumping of imported wines. However, I will have the opportunity at some future date to speak further on Australian wine protection. I emphasise that the Hunter electorate, because of its wines, its history and its proximity to Sydney, to mention only three factors, hll.s the greatest tourist potential of any area in Australia. We have the visitation figures to back that claim, despite oversights such as that by the Minister for Sport, Recreation.and Tourism (Mr John Brown) in failing to allow Paul Hogan to publicise our valley. I point out that these visitation' figures have been achieved despite the fact that our roads offer small inducement t.o tourists to visit our area. In fact, if anything, our roads are a deterrent to visitors. But, after years of neglect by successive Fed eral coalition governments, the roads in the Hunter electorate lay claim to being among· the worse in the nation. It is only now, due to the energetic efforts of the present Minister for Transport  a fair proportion of road grants is being allocated to overcome the backlog in road construction which exists in the Hunter Valley. Good roads are necessary for many reasons. Towns such as Merriwa and Denman need good roads to counter isolation. The Hunter needs good roads for the heavy vehicles engaged in industrial and mining works. Good roads would triple the tourist dollar spent in the Hunter and we know the employment value of the tourist dollar. Because the Hunter electorate has virtually no public transport, good roads are even more essential. I turn now to a problem of such proportions that it constitutes nothing less than a national scandal. Because of constraints of time. I will refer to this matter but fleetingly as I intend to pursue it at length in a future debate. I refer to a problem which is a major contributor to health and pollution problems in cities and towns in every State of the Commonwealth. Of course, I refer to the tragic backlog of unsewered premises. In this field, as in many others, conservative governments have a disgraceful record.' The Whitlam Labor Government's initiatives were the first responsible efforts to eradicate the sewerage problems which exist. In successive Budgets, the Whitlam Government provided nearly $300m to assist the States to eliminate sewerage problems. I congratulate the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) , who was the Minister responsible for that magnifiqent national sewerage program. But, of course, the program was ruthlessly dismantled by the Fraser Government. Not only did the Fraser Government fail to keep its promise to turn on the lights but also it denied hundreds of thousands of Australians the opportunity to pull the chain. I will return to discussion of sewerage problems at an early opportunity to seek assistance for those people in my electorate who are denied an essen.tial health facility. Since my time has almost expired, I can do no more than to say that this Hawke Government is a caring government, a government concerned equally for this nation's youth, its adults and its senior citizens. It will provide a simpier, fairer more efficient tax scheme. It will give increased assistance to local government authbrities. It will provide better opportunities in education, health and transport. Honourable members would not think so to hear some of the debate in this House in recent times, but the Government' will also work for international peace. It will eradicate poverty and create a better lifestyle for every Australian. This Government in the Thirty-fourth Parliament will bring to this nation and its people a new hope, a new confidence and a renewed sense of pride and achievement. Madam DEPUTY' SPEAKER-Order! I will delay calling the honourable member for Parkes for a few seconds, because at the beginning of the last maiden speech there was a lot of noise that was disruptive. Before calling the honourable member for Parkes, I point out that this is a maiden speech. I ask the House to observe the usual courtesies.",89
179,Mr COBB,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"1t is with a mixture of excitement and humility that I rise to speak for the first time in this place. When I was a small boy my father eked out a living from the soil by ploughing it and harvesting its produce with draughthorses. I guess in those days neither he nor my hard working mother ever dreamt that one day their son would have the honour of sitting in this esteemed chamber representing others who also struggle to make a living from the land. I am proud also to be the first member for the newlycreated seat of Parkes, which is named after Sir Henry Parkes, the father of Federation. The Parkes electorate takes in the main towns of Forbes, Parkes, Canowindra, Molong, Wellington, Gilgandra, Coonamble, Narromine, Trangie, Warren, Nyngan, Bourke, Brewarrina and Wanaaring. It is centred around the city of Dubbo,. one' of the most rapidly growing, free enterprIse centres in Australia. I thank the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) who, before the redistribution, serviced most of what is now the Parkes electorate, for he left it in very good shape. The size of the electorate is 125,000 square' kilometres. I invite honourable members to compare this with the size of the 28 Sydney electoratc:s which altogether total ,leSs than 3,500 square kilometres. We could almost throw a blanket over some Sydney electorates. Indeed, we could fit all 28 of them within the Parkes electorate 36 times over. That exampie serves to highlight the fact that, although we may have the principleof one man, one vote in this country, we certainly do not have one vote, one value. My electorate is made up mainly of rural indusand try and small business. One of the main rural industries is' wool. Some of the best and most famous merino studs in the world lie within the Parkes electorate. We also have some of the best wheat growing areas in Australia. Other primary industries include beef cattle, fat lambs, much of Australia's c<,>tton and many irrigation products. The risks of rural industry are high and the hours long. Though export earnings are substantial for Australia, the net profits to producers are either low or non existent. The many farmers who have money borrowed to carryon often cannot meet their interest payments. The position small business finds itself in is often no better. It is an education to doorknock nearly every small business in my electorate from Forbes and Parkes in the south to Coonamble and Bourke in the north to Ilear the tale each relates. Though each may use'different words, they all tell the same story. The average small business in the Parkes electorate is built on the family unit and employs as little outside labour as possible because of the high costs of that labour. The average owner of these small businesses works 60 to 70 hours a week,has a relatively high capital outlay of hundreds of thousands of dollars, yet earns only $100 to $200 a week, much less than any staff he or she may employ. It is not as if these people are providing something which is not wanted. Their very existence is the reason many country towns continue to survive, but they are being strangled in a Gordian knot of red tape and crippled by rate of taxes, licence fees, council.and union lations and every other device thought of by deskunder bound bureaucrats to suck dry the life blood these people's existence. These examples are not invented stories. I only wish that I cQuld take a delegation of any ing members and GovernmentMinisters around enterprise, some of these businesses in my electorate to and to see the situation for themselves first Even to call into refuel one's car at an isolated service st-tion in a town with only 10 people to find that that petrol station has to have cences before being allowed to operate makes wonder at the madness which pervades this country at present. The message one gets from this is clear: If we work, if we invest, if we risk and have a go in Australia today, the GovernEven ment and the burea,ucrats will punish us,grind . down and tax us to the status of peasants. On other hand, if we choose not to work, not only the Government leave us alone, it will also us and send us a cheqlle in the mail every other week. The system we have in this country today completely upside down and· I, for one, make. no apology for the fact that much of my time spent as the member for Parkes will be devoted to restoring the position to what it should be. There are many issues that I will pursue as member in this Parliament. Basically these issues stem from my belief in free enterprise as not only the best system but also the only system that will maximise the well being of the people on this planet. If we take the 171 nati.ons of this world and scale them from one to 171 according to how well off is the average man, an interesting corretem lation falls into place. By 'well off', I use two teria: The degree of freedom and the purchasing power of the average citizen. Those countries the top of the scale are ones such as the United States of America, whose system most closely proximate free enterprise. Below the United States of America are countries like Japan, Canada, West Germany, Australia and, still, New Zealand. As we move away from the ftee one enterprise system through the mixed economies and socialist systems, not only does the standard of living of the average worker decrease but gap between the rich and the poor within the:;e countries widens. At the bottom of the list are the communist, totalitarian and dictatorship regimes, many of which are located on the African continent Asia. However much the left wing may hate the capitalist system and however much it may cheating espouse the theory that ownership is better in public rather than private hands, the fact cannot the be denied that in practice the average worker is regubetter off under a free enterprise system than a socialist one such as exists in the Union of of Soviet Socialist-I stress the word 'Socialist'Republics, the USSR. Wherever in the world the two systems exist side by side the average worker doubtvotes with his feet every time for the free capitalist system. It is a fact that more hear people want to defect from East Germany to hand. West Germany than from West Germany to East Germany. More people want to flee from mainand land China to Hong Kong or Taiwan than the resix liverse. More want to go from North Korea to one South Korea than the other way round, and we all know which way the migration patterns take beall tween Cuba and the United States of America take a and Mexico and the United States of America. on the African continent, with the repugus nant apartheid system of South Africa, more t):le blacks are wanting to migrate from Moz-mbique will to South Africa than from South Africa to reward Mozambique. Even in Australia we see more people shifting homes from New South Wales and is Victoria to Queensland than the other way round. The reason why the free enterprise system always works better than the socialist alternative is that it better suits human nature. If we own something privately we will look after it more a carefully and always have an incentive to add to it. However, if we share something with everyone else we are more inclined to neglect it, even abuse it, and have less incentive to work harder to add to it. Before the revolution, Russia was the biggest exporter of grain in the world; now it is the biggest importer. For all its faults, the free enterprise syshas proved to be the best for most people all criof the time or, to paraphrase Winston Chl'rchill, the free enterprise system is the worse one in the at world, except for all the others. Crucial to any free enterprise system is the apmaintenance of incentive: The greatest incentive of all is that if one earns something one is allowed to keep it. Unfortunately, if one is an average worker in Australia today, for every extra dollar earns, one is forced by law to give almost half ofit away in tax, most of which is spent on others. The temptation to cheat on this law is therefore the high and the incentive to work more for this country is therefore low. Consequently, we see that fewer and fewer people exert themselves above a certain level. In fact, the highest marginal tax rate of 60 per cent collects very little tax at and in all-about $700m-contrary to what was originally intended. The simplest way to overcome the and the incentive problems is to have just one single or flat rate of tax which need be set only at about the 23 per cent level to gather the same amount of tax as we collect now. With the incentive to work fully restored, more tax would eventually be. collected and the 23 per cent rate could actually be lowered later. This system is also very fair. If one earns five times as much as the next person, one pays five times as much tax. If one earns 10 times as much, one pays 10 times as much tax. What could be fairer than that? I have found an amazing acceptance of the cOhcept of the flat tax rafe by people of all political persuasions within my electorate. Provided steps are taken to maintain pensioners' real incomes, the party that has the foresight and the intelligence to introduce this system will win an enormous section of the Australian electorate. I move now to the faIling value of the Australian dollar. I must say that I am sorry that no reference was made to it in the Governor General's Speech when Parliament opened. The dollar has fallen because people are waking up to the fact that the economy is in worse shape than the Government has led us to believe. However, I congratulate the Government for having floated the dolIar during the term of the last Parliament. As the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. The floating of the dolIar was the one good thing the Government did during the term of the last Parliament. Clearly, it was something the previous coalition Government should have done years before, but never quite had the fortitude to do. Although the dollar's fall is a reflection poorly mal1aged economy, it is nevertheless good news for exporters, at least in the short term. Unfortunately, the increased prices we must now pay for our imports will force up the consumer price index and eventualIy flow on to increase wages, so locking us into another inflationary spiral. Neither side of the House wants that. To overcome the inflationary problems resulting from the falling dollar and at the same time to retain the benefits the faIling dollar gives our export industries, I advocate to the Government that now is the time to lower tariff protection. Tariff reductions now would lower many import prices to their levels of only a short few weeks ago and so would not harm the import competing manufacturers at all, such as the car makers and textile producers. Here is the chance to make these industries more co-petitive in the long term without harming them in the short term. It is one of those magical moments in Australia's economic history which I hope this present Government has the common sense to recognise and the courage to grasp. It is a no lose situation. I repeat: Carefully managed tariff reductions now will retain the benefit of the falling dollar for exporters which would be of enormous benefit to them. As import prices will come down to their previous levels, all the importers in Australia will also be delighted, instead of wearing the long faces they wear now. Even the import competing industries will see it as the best thing to do as it will make them more competitive on world markets, which is essential if they are to have a long term future. If the Government cut tariffs now it would be hailed in the media and across the country as an economic miracle worker. If politics can be likened to a game of chess, perhaps I am teIling the Government of the one move that could checkmate the coalition at the next election, when most observers sense we will be in a winning position. Nevertheless, it is such a beautiful move that I must point it out, for if the Government is bold enough to play it the whole of Australia will be the beneficiary. I turn now to possibly the saddest problem in the whole of the Parkes electorate-the plight of the Aboriginal people. I have recently returned from Bourke, that town so indelibly etched into Australia's outback history. Even the term 'back 0' Bourke' has become part of our folklore language. I am sad to report that Bourke today isa virtual siege town. Bricklayers have bricked' in many shop-front windows iri the main street because they have been broken so many times no insurance company will insure them any more. People cannot go window-shopping in these areas of our because there are no windows. Those who still have windows have' them meshed and barred. Ceilings are meshed too, and some of the most sophisticated computer burglar alarm systems this country has seen are in operation there. I have seen one room protected by no less then ten locks. If photographs were permitted in Hansard I would ask permission to have included in it some of the shots I took of all this. One cannot make a public telephone call out of Bourke. None of the telephones work. There are stories that when people go out at night they take their videos with them to a video baby-sitting service so that they'are not stolen. Bourke has 27 police. Apparently! that is more police per head of populatiori than iri any other town in Australia. Unfortunately- the new laws do not allow the police to do much these days. They are not allowed to kick backsides any more and tell children roaming the streets at 3 a.m. to go home. The police themselves could be charged if they did so. The few cases that do get to court are treated indifferently. The laws of this country today are designed more to Pl'otect the rights of the criminal than the rights of the victims. Occasionally someone with 40 or 50 offences is convicted and sent away to a rehabilitation home for a few years. However, when he returns in, a few weeks and Parliament. chalks up another five to 10 offences in the first week back it is not hard to see why the locals frustrated and angry. Many locals I talked to on the verge of shutting down their businesses and moving out. They are holding on only a few weeks longer to see whether something can be done to improve the situation. In the meantime, the ists are staying away and the town is getting name. I am not talking about the Iraq-Iran border; I am not talking about El Salvador; I talking about a town in Australia, a town in the Parkes electorate-Bourke, Even though many people are suffering from this problem, it seems to me that the people fering the most are the black people. We are troying them as a race. By patronising them, treating them differently from the whites and lavishing them with money and handouts we are creating a bitter division between the white and black communities. We have stripped away further nearly every shred of dignity that these once proud people had. I say to all honourable members in this chamber: For goodness sake, thinking we can solve the so-called Aboriginal problem by writing more cheques in everbeing increasing amounts. It has not worked overseas, for example with the Red Indians in the United States of America; it will not work here. I know is fashionable to label anyone who even dares question our Aboriginal policy a racist, but that if we are genuinely concerned with what present handout mentality policies are doing these people, if we have a shred of compassion left in us for their well-being, and if we only take time to go out into the field and see what pening, we must surely change our present, easy-way-out cheque book policy in an attempt to save these people before it is too late. I have touched on many topics in my' opening address. I congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker and Mr Speaker, on your election esteemed positions you hold today and I thank you for the courtesies that you have shown me a new member of this Parliament. I thank the House for hearing me as it has done today. I look forward to the future so that I can make a positive contribution to this great country in the many areas that need attention.",92
180,Mr BRUMBY,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"1 begin, nation's Madam Deputy Speaker, by warmly congratulatof ing you on your election and I ask you to convey to Mr Speaker my congratulations also on his , election to that position. I know from my experitrial ence during the Thirty-third Parliament that you will each discharge your responsibilities with great distinction during this Thirty-fourth For government today efficiency, honesty and are competence must be the minimum requirements. are They must go hand in hand with social planning, justice and a clear sense of direction-a vision for the future. While Australians may have their political differences, most of us share a similar vision tOUrfor the future. We look for government which a bad offers a sound combination of good management and good policies and we .want a society that is am both prosperous and fair and in which every person and all families have a chance to grow, to participate and to share in the nation's wealth. As a Victorian, I am proud of the quality and sufthe achievements of both the Federal and State desgovernments and of the very close partnership by and co-operation that exist between the Hawke by and Cain. governments. Victorians want good government and not just cheap gimmicks. In just two days time all Victorians will choose between a term of good government or an alternative of gimmicks and advertising hype. Over the last four ye-rs Victoria has been properly managed. stop The State Ministers have been welded together into a tight and competent team. The State is now run efficiently with long-term plans and coordination between departments. Budgeting and financial management have been modernised. it There are no land deals under the Cain Government. Instead there is a widespread recognition, I say even among non-Labor supporters, that the Cain our Government is a clean and honest government. to The Victorian Government has faced up to difficult and tough decisions. Those decisions have the been made when they have had to be made. Some is hapexamples have been the proposed reforms in lazy, workers' compensation, the Alcoa smelter decision, the issue of casinos and action against the ' Builders Labourers Federation. Under the Liberals those decisions were put off for ever, and . they would be again under a divided Liberalto the National Party coalition. Most importantly for all Victorians is the fact as that in just three short years Victoria has become Australia's'strongest and fastest growing economy. Victoria is, indeed,leading Australia's economic recovery. Almost all of the objective evidence, such as the major economic indicators and statistics, now confirm this. Victoria has the highest job growth rate and its lowest rate unemployment, especially and particularly among young people. Economic and investment growth in Victoria tops that of all States. Indusdisputes have been reduced by some 70 per cent si!lce 1981 and the inflation rate is half what very it was under the Liberals. The Victorian housing industry also leads Australia's housing recovery. The results of that economic recovery are starting to be recognised outside Victoria. New projects, worth literally billions of dollars, are getting under way, like the Chia development in South Yarra and the Esso-BHP oil and gas project. Last month Victoria was awarded a triple A rating-the highest international rating given to a government for the performance and reliability of its economy. Victoria is the only Australian State to achieve that recognition, which has actually been given to very few national governments. Finally, late last year Commonwealth statistics showed that for the first time in more than: 14 years more people were actually coming back to live in Victoria than were leaving it. These are achievements of which all Victorians can be proud. By a combination of positive policies and long term planning and, importantly, by working in partnership with the community and the Hawke Government, Victoria now faces its brightest economic future for many years. There have been claims during the Victorian election campaign that the Cain Government is a hightaxing government. Similar claims were made of the Hawke Government prior to the recent Federal election. What is so ironic about these claims by the Liberal Opposition is that its own policy documents show clearly that taxes increased by 29 per cent under the previous Hamer-Thompson Liberal Government in Victoria and they have increased by a far more moderate 8 per cent under the Cain Government. What is even more remarkable in the context of taxes and charges is the claim by the Liberal Leader, Mr Kennett, that under a Liberal government there would be no increase at all in taxes in the first year of a Kennett government. Mr Kennett's promises, of course, simply do not add up. It is something of a mark of his inexperience and perhaps ineptitude as a political leader that there is now a $1 billion credibility gap between his spending promises and the potential revenue base. Mr Kennett has released a package of promises which is quite intentionally unachievable. In fact, it is totally unachievable. His only objective in that approach can be,to diminish people's faith in the democratic process .. No doubt many Victorians will make their own assessment and judgment of Mr Kennett's ability and experience to lead Victorians. No doubt all Victorians will question whether a man who makes the claim that the Victorian Premier, John Cain, is unfit to leave alone with one's daughter, is himself fit to rep'resent the people of Victoria. Similarly,· the people of Victoria must judge whether Mr Kennett's claim thaf the Hawke Government's national economic summit was akin to a meeting of the Grand Council of Fascists is really an accurate description of the many distinguished business and community leaders, unionists, and politicians who made up that summit. Finally, the 20 per cent of Victorians employed in manufacturing iridustry must wonder whether Mr Kennett's economic development policy, which makes not one mention of Victoria's vital manufacturing industry, is really a competent document from an aspiring Premier. As Federal member for Bendigo I have been able to witness at first hand the remarkable development of the Bendigo area in the three years of the Cain Government. I have seen the new police station, the new ·fire station, the new White Hills primary school and the new tourist information centre. The North Bendigo railway workshops have been upgraded, more than 40 elderly person's units have been constructed and only last week the Premier officially opened the new$lOm Sandhurst reservoir. Most pleasing of all is the strong economic recovery in Bendigo's private sector,· which has seen unemployment fall by 20 per cent and the strongest ever program of ·support for decentralisedindustry by a State government. In context of Bendigo's development, it is somewhat amusing to hear the Liberal Party of Australia again claim that the Cain Labor· GoVernment discriminates against country people. Apart from the programs I have just mentioned, such as the new police and fire stations, new school buildings and new tourist infrastructure, the Cain Government has embarked on a major program· of bringing new services to country people.",95

182,Mr BRUMBY,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"I was talking earlier of the great partnership and the great co-operation which have developed· between the Hawke Government and the Cain Government in Victoria. One of the areas in which that partnership is very evident is in the fight against inflation, in which nationally and in Victoria we have seen inflation halved during the last two years. It is essential for continued economic recovery and for international competitiveness that the fight against inflation be continued, and both the Hawke Government and the Cain Government are pledged to continue that fight and to support fully the very successful prices and incomes accord. . . It is a matter of great concern, when looking at the policies of the Liberal Kennett Opposition in Victoria, to look particularly at its policies in the so-called areas of deregulation. In the release of its policy on deregulation, it has announced 11 critical policy areas in which it would be deregulating areas of government activity. Deregulation of those areas which the Opposition has suggested would be in no small way a recipe for economic disaster. Indeed, it is estimated, on very conservative measures, that the deregulation in the areas it has suggested would add between 5 and 10 percentage points to the consumer price index. I mentioneQ that II areas are involved. I shall briefly refer to four of those. First, of course, the Kennett Opposition is totally in support of the deregulation of wages. I do not think there is any doubt that in a period of strong economic recovery, as we have at the moment, deregulation of wages would lead to increases above and beyond those of the consumer price index. As evidence of that claim, we need only look back to the years of 1981 or 1982 under the Fraser Government, when it walked away from centralised wage indexation and we saw a very significant increase in wages. Secondly, deregulation of health care would be of great concern. It is noticeable that only some months ago the Victorian Liberal Opposition supported a 17 per cent increase in hospital charges, compared with a 5 per cent increase which was approved by the Cain Government. All Victorians would be asking themselves how people would cope if hospital charges rose by 17 per cent under a Kennett government because, in addition, it is the Opposition's policy to allow catch up in private health insurance, so. we would see significant additions to the cost of family health care. Thirdly, agriculture is an area proposed for deregulation, and there is no question but that the Liberals' policy states that they intend to abolish the orderly marketing boards which have provided such stability to our primary industries. Prices in many areas would rise or fall erratically and our farmers, who are so vital to the economic prosperity of Victoria, would become virtual supermarket employees. Fourthly, petrol pricing concerns me greatly as a country member of Parliament. Here again, the Kennett Opposition is pledged to removing the Cain Government's trigger price maximum on petrol. That would see the price of petrol throughout Victoria leaping overnight by up to 2c per litre. In the other context of petrol prices, the Liberals' transport policy commits them to removing motor registration fees and replacing that money with a levy on petrol equivalent to approximately 5c per litre. In just those four areas there is a recipe to add between five and 10 percentage points to the consumer price index. That would throttle the economic recovery which has been so strong in Victoria. I conclude by reinforcing a point I made earlier. The claim of the Liberal Opposition is that the Cain Labor Government has somehow, in its past three years of government, discriminated against country people. Apart from the programs in Bendigo which I mentioned earlier, such as new fire and police stations, new school buildings and new tourist infrastructure, the Cain Government has also embarked on a major program of bringing new services to country people. More than 5,000 children in country Victoria have been seen by the school dental service, and the elderly citizens have warmly welcomed the new low-cost denture and spectacle scheme for country pensioners. Government departments, such as the Department of Health, have been regionalised, and Bendigo's designation as a Strategic A Growth Centre has brought new assistance to country industries which have never before been assisted by a State Government. The expenditure of more than $40m over the next four year& on upgrading Victoria's grain handling facilities is sound evidence of the Government's commitment to our primary producers and, of course, the $32mprogram for salinity control really puts the Liberal and National parties to shame over their total absence of support for salinity control in Victoria during some 27 years of conservative government. They did nothing for salinity control. A great deal of long and overdue good work by the Cain Government and an excellent and cooperative relationship with the Hawke Government have substantially benefited Victorians. What a State government does affects not merely our lives but those of our children and of all Victorians. Victorians demand and deserve the best possible government. That means government with the best performance, the best leadership, the best team and the best policies for the future. In summary, Victorians deserve good governments and not just cheap gimmicks and advertisinghype.",96
183,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Before calling the honourable member for Mayo, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",97
184,Mr DOWNER,WESTERN ALLIANCE," Mr Speaker, I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating you and Madam Deputy Speaker on your re-election to your high offices. As a new member of this House, I am deeply conscious of the honour the electors of Mayo have shown me in returning me as their representative. I am also deeply conscious of the very great responsibility they have vested in me to represent their iqterests. The new electorate of Mayo covers the Adelaide Hills, thl! Fleurieu Peninsula and c-itrin rhetoric of yesterday. Kangaroo Isl\lnd, as well as the town of Murray Bridge. Mayo is a district which derives its livelihave, hood from farming and from a wide range ofsmall -)Usinesses. The farmers and small business people In my electorate are a typical cross-section of those parts of the community which create such a large proportion of Australia's total prosperity. They are the real, but often forgotten, wealth creators. I shall be a tireless advocate for my electorate and for the interests of its farmers and small business people, but neither my electors nor I shall pleading for special, uneconomic consideration, which will not be in the national interest. All shall be seeking from this place is a fair deal the leadership to allow our industries, our district and Australia to get ahead. That leadership must be based on a clear understanding of the national interest and it must be based on a definable set of valu-, not a craving for popularity or political survival; values which provide the' means to achieve sustained rates of economic growth, values which offer greater stability imd security for. individuals in a rapidly changing social enVironment, and values which provide national security in an unstable and unpredictable world. It is not leadership to base policies on deals with se-ected and privileged interest groups, and it is With some regret that I note that the underlying current of many of the Government's policies ries with it the flotsam and jetsam of those deals. It is always a danger for any government to come the champion of certain sectional interests. Whilst it is clear that the sectional group - ith strongest grip on the present Government Australian Council of Trade Unions, it is by no means the only sectional group to which the Government is beholden. I make no secret of surprise' at the way a minority of carefully selected business people and groups have less than vigilantly fought for the interests of the comthamunity, just so they can dine with Ministers and promote their selfish and sectional interests. . One of the consequences of embracing sectional Interest groups, rather than providing leadership and direction, is that their cries for special consideration are always about wealth redistribution rather than wealth creation. So many of those groups are still singing the tired old rhetoric of the 1950s and '1960s. They are still debating ways of - edistri?uti.ng the nation's wealth, but not ways of IncreaSIng It for the benefit of all Australians. In the 1950s and 1960s growth was almost autocommunity-wide matic"" and it was certainly expected. In that mate the, debate about redistribution of wealth may have had some relevance, .but that is the sac;I ' , Today the challenge is quite different, yet many failed to perceive this change. Today the challenge is to provide a climate for sustained and sustainable wealth creation: It is because that problem has not been addressed in the last two years that the economic recovery is sadly now beginning to falter. To generate greater prosperity requires an understanding of the general structure of the Australian economy. Put necessarily simply, Australia has two be almost separate economies, and one is holding back the other. On the one hand is the slow track we economy, dominated by the heavy manufacturing and sector and labour intensive industries. It is an economy which is uncompetitive and often inefficient, yet it is retained with a safety net of anticompetitive regulations and high levels of protection .. On the other hand is the fast track economy, domInated by efficient export-oriented industries, by the rapidly growing services sector and by the new, fasf-emerging information industries. I note that many of these industries are based around ,small, efficient firms producing what could be termed mid-technology products, such as agricultural and mining machinery, and, of course, a very wide range of services. These small firms have become the big employers. In the United States of 'America, for example, 60 per cent of the thirty carmillion most recent jobs created, are in firms which employ less than 20 people. These are, of course, the firms and industries which thrive on a bemore deregulated market, on hard foughtcompetition, and which depend on a realistic domestic the cost structure which takes account of the interis the national market-place. It is the web of regulations and the network of my government intervention which, while propping up th-slow track industries, are holding back those In the fast track. It is in the national interest the fast track economy be given the opportumty to develop and that a substantial restructuring of the slow track economy takes place. Only then will the dead hand of the slow economy be lifted from the shoulder of the fast economy. It is the role of government to ensure that the appropriate framework exists for this change to take place. Any governf!1ent which is hostage to special Interest groups will be unable to manage this essential revolution, and thereby will discard the national interest. I am confident that there is now a growing recognition that steps towards clisubstantial structural adjustment of the economy, and a process of deregulation and liberation of the market, is necessary. That was certainly borne dut by public support for the conclusions of the repo-t of the Campi)ell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and also for the floating of the dollar. But the process must be comprehensive, not ad hoc. It must recognise the conceptual linkages between policy areas, and nowhere is that more true than with the labour market. While on the one hand the Government has moved to float the dollar, on the other hand it has locked Australia into one of the most rigid labour market regimes in the Western world. As the dollar declines, so Australia multiplie- the inflationary impact of the devaluation and, of course employers are hit with higher import prices. In 'addition, they must pay a further estimated $1 billion so far in wage increases due to the devaluII,tion, because wages are not linked to supply and demand; they are linked to the consumer price index. Consequently, the advantages of devaluation are cancelled - y inconsistent government policies. Honourable members are, of course, very familiar with the debate over the liberation of the labour market. We on this side of the House are not advocating the total dissolution of the present industrial relations system. All we are seeking is a labour market which is more responsive to the supply and demand for labour in individual industries and which enables individual firms to bring a sense of personal involvement into these essentially human issues. The linkages between labour costs, company profitability, employment levels, tax receipts and even welfare programs, deserve to be acknowledged, not just by the Bureau of Labour Market Research or the report of - he Kirby Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs; they must be acknowledged by' the Government. This same lack of consistency applies in both the transport and communications indu-tries. Until the Government has the courage to cast off the incubus of union regulation and consequent government involvement in those industries, our fast track economy will struggle to find its feet. The irrational regulation of those industries is a serious limit to growth and prosperity in this nation. . I turn now to yet another and fundamental , aspect of economic management which, if we are to achieve sustained rates of economic growth, demands the application of those same principles of ensuring that the fast track economy is able to maximise its wealth creating potential. That cannot be done if the overall size of government which is in essence unpr9ductive continues, to grow almdst exponentially. It is in this context that I note, with some degree of interest, the Government's commitment to what has become known as the trilogy. No one in the business or farming communities would deny that these objectives are laudable, but it will require a real growth rate of 4 per cent for each of the next three years for it to be achieved, and that will not be possible if the fast track economy is not liberated. Even if the trilogy is achieved, the starting point is one not only of massive expenditure but also of public debt which has been escalating alarmingly. Over the last two Budgets the average annual growth in government outlays in real terms has been 6.9 per cent, which compares with an average of 2.2 per cent for the seven Budgets of the Fraser Government. The real average annual growth in the Budget deficit over the last two Budgets has been 14.9 per cent, which compares with a 6 per cent decline during the Fraser years. The reality of the rapid growth in public expenditure is three-fold. First, the funds are not being deployed in capital investment projects; they are being spent on current consumption, thereby depleting, not adding to, the nation's prosperity. They are, in fact, redistributing wealth not creating wealth. Secondly, it has ensured that real interest rates in Australia have remained considerably higher than rates in our major competitor countries. While in Australia the commercial prime rate is around 9 per cent in real terms, in the United States it is 6.25 per cent, in West Germany it ,is 5.7 per cent, and in Japan it is, 3.2 per cent. Clearly, this has a major bearing on the capacity of the fast track economy to grow. Equally seriously, expansionary fiscal policies have contributed to a rise in the public debt, from one-third of gross domestic product in 1975-76 to just under one-half in this financial year. Over the . same period interest on this debt has increased from 2.7 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent of GDP, and the devaluation of the dollar has only exacerbated this problem. The growth in the public debt is placing unnecessary burdens on the community and again on the fast track, export-oriented economyand industries. Let me once more remind.the House that a large public debt may be acceptable to the privileged few who participate in consensus, but it is manifestly not in the national interest; nor are the high levels of taxes and charges which result from massive expenditure and a substantial public debt. I welcome the commitment made in the Governor General's Speech to taxation reform, for there is no doubt that our taxation system is too complex, it is unfair and it is insufficiently neutral. I very much hope that once the Government has dispensed with its tax summit publicity it will act with both courage and determination, ignoring the squeaks and squeals of the special interest groups, and will introduce a fairer and more neutral taxation system. While, ipso facto, taxation has a redistributive function, taxation must also be geared in such a way as to maximise our economic growth potential. But in a sense, these issues are secondary to the urgent need for substantial reductions in expenditure. If the Government really wants another summit, I on it first to hold an expenditure summit, to put together a package of proposals which will signifiwaters cantly cut spending, thereby opening the way just for more efficient and fairer taxes, but also amuch smaller overall tax burden. Many other aspects of regulation and taxation need carefully to be examined if the Government is to give the fast track industries a chance to sprint ahead while the slow track industries jog along and in some cases, sadly, finally drop out of the race altogether. Never has there been a more explicit expression, though, of the Government's failure to open the path for the fast track indusand tries than in the latest balance of payments current account figures."" They quantify at a stroke how much work there is left to do to fire up our fast track export oriented industries. Australia is also looking for leadership in field of social and welfare policies. To date have found governments locked welfare state mentality which is economically unproductive and socially disruptive. The only solutions offered to the unemployed, for example, have been publicly financed short term job creterms ation schemes or the dole. Both sap the economic vitality of the community as a whole and the esteem of the unemployed. More thought should be given to how the dole can be paid not as pensation for failure but as an opportunity to achieve. Public funds should be used, as the report of the Kirby Committee to Review Productivity and Innovation Programs suggests, to help train young people for jobs in the rapidly changing economic environment or in return for constructhrough tive and socially beneficial community service. that context there is scope, in my view, for much closer co-operation between Federal and local governments in the area of dole payments and community work. By doing that, we would begin to move away from the disruptive and debilitating welfare mentality towards socially and economicountry cally constructive solutions to our society's ing problems. While such changes in strategy lwt win the approbation of those partners of sensus, they would enhance the national interest. ,. ' As a former member of the Australian diplomatic service I. would feel negligent in this, my maiden speech, if I said nothing about the security of our nation. I do so not because it is currently an issue of public cpntroversy, and of very, serious public controversy, but because it stands as the grandest illustration of what I and my electorate believe to be the national interest. At no time since the inception of the ANZUS Treaty has it . been under greater threat, not just as a result of the recent disastrous decisions taken by both the call Australian and New Zealand governments but also because Australia. has been buffeted by the of pacificism which have flowed across not much of Western Europe and to a lesser extent for the United States. The emergence of the Nuclear Disarmament Party underlines the reality that, particularly amongst the young, the political, moral and intellectual basis of the alliance is being challenged. It is a serious error to treat this phenomenon lightly. That this situation exists in Europe, and is emerging in Australia, is largely due to the failure of Western leaders, including our own Government, to articulate the meaning purpose of the alliance in terms which will impress upon the imagination of ordinary people. In particular, leaders have failed to convince, or even try to convince, those who were brought up between the 1960s and 1980s and who; have been searching for new horizons. Those people have the not found those new horizons amongst. the miliwe tary acronyms and technicalities of the Western into the post-war defence debate. ANZUS and the alliance should be seen in of the preservation of a way of life:----a way of life which is, and always has been, under threat. selfThe Government's failure to address the fundamental political and moral bases of ANZUS has comled to an intellectual vacuum which has been filled by naive cries for unilateral disarmament. The reality is that the security debate is not between those who want war ahd those who do not; obviously no one wants war. The debate is between those who are prepared to guarantee peace strength and deterrence and those who In just hope war and conflict will go away: The generation of the 1930s in Britain and France which demanded peace through unilateral disarmament ended that decade fighting the world's bloodiest and most destructive. war. Determination and resolve by the present Government will in our own ward off the pacifist movement. But such endurdetermination requires so far unseen courage to may place in all fields of government endeavour the congreater inter-t of our nation before the squeals and cries of special interest groups. Before I conclude, 'like many speakers, in this debate, I would like to pay a brief ttibute,in this case to my own father, who sat in this House before me, until 1964. He represented ,the seat of Angas in South Australia and part of that seat is now covered by my own electorate. I would like to sayror the record that he provided a great deal of inspiration and had a great influence on me and it is partly through his influence and encouragement that I stand in this House today. I also thank ·the House for the very warm messages of condolence that it paid to my family, in particular my mother, in 1981 following the death of my father. I thank the House for its' courtesy on this occasion.",97
185,Mr CHARLES,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Firstly, Mr Speaker, I would like to congratulate you. on attaining your high office again, and ask that you pass' on my congratulations to the Deputy Speaker and' Chairman of Committees, Mrs Child, on her election. I am very happy and proud to have been re-elected to this Parliament as the member for Isaacs with what is once again a substantial majority. It is significant to note that I am the first Federal member from either side of the House to have won the seat of Isaacs on three con, secutive occasions since the seat was reconstituted in 1968. Mr Chynoweth--:Great - ember!",101
186,Mr CHARLES,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Some people would agree with the honourable member. I would like basically to concentrate tonight on one subject, that is, arms control and disarmament. I was pleased to see that the Governor General mentioned that in his Speech last Thursday. He said: Australia was elected to membership of the United Nations Security Council and other United Nations bodies, the Government will be active in seeking peaceful, practical solutions to global problems. The Government remains deeply committed to advanc· ing the cause of peace, arms contr-1 and disarmament. Undeniably, no issue is more important to the well-being of current and future' generations of Australians than the objective of peace, disarmament and a future free of the threat of nuclear war. Achievement' of this objective cannot be easy. No one could eXpect that an issue of these dimensions would have easy answers or solutions. The topic of disarmament and arms control, whilst one of the most important issues of our time, is an extremely complex one, covering as it does a wide range of technological developments as well as human emotions and international diplomacy. Everyone here would be aware of the dire consequences of a nuclear exchange between the two super-powers. The outcome defies imagination'or description. There is no such thing as a winnable nuclear war. We should therefore be united in our abhorrencepf the concept and in our determination to prevent s'uch an exchange from ever taking place. There is clear evidence that the arms race between the super-powers is continuing virtually unabated, with both sides progressively upgrading and modernising their military arsenal. Partly as a result of the competition between the superpowers the military arsenals, both nuclear and conventional, of other nations have also reached substantial proportions and are continuing to be increased in some areas. The number of nuclear warheads deployed throughout the world has increased steadily since 1945 and is currently estimated to total between 44,000 and 60,000. In fact, of the 60,000 warheads deployed around the globe; by far the largest numbers of course are held by the two super-powers although significant numbers are also held by Great Britain, France and China. The testing of nuclear warheads has also occurred continually since 1945. The Swedish Institute of Peace, through its' Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Year Book 1984 shows that by December of 1983 the total number of nuclear explosions carried out had reached 1440. Of these 1,256 were conducted by the two super-powers, whilst the remaining 184 were conducted in this way: France, 120; China, 27; the United Kingdom 36 and.India one. I had the pleasure of visiting the Swedish Institute of Peace last July. I had some very interesting and infoqnative discussions with officials from that Infor 1985·86. As a member of this stitute. In addition to the proliferation of nuclear arms .there has been a continued and growing spread of conventional weapons throughout the world. Some 80 per cent of arms expenditure is on conventional weapons. As that is something that is no- talked about very much and as it is not widley known, I repeat: Some 80 per cent of arms expenditure is on conventional weapons. In Europe the nations of the two opposing alliances account for some 40 per cent of the world's men and women in uniform and an even greater share, nearly three-quarters, of the world's military expenditure. Perhaps more disturbing has been the increasing deployment of modern military technology into countries of the Third World; that is, countries that can ill afford to use their scant economic and natural resources on armaments. Weapons systems are becoming more sophisticated and accurate, perhaps encouraging an erroneous belief that limited tactical skirmishes are actually ible. The size ·of the arms race is ·enormous, placing an indefensible·' burden on. global sources. The Swedish Institute of Peace estimated last year that between $750 and $800 billion spent on the arms race in 1983. However, recent figures suggest that that.figure could now be close to $950 billion. The arms race could therefore be said to be costing over $lm every minute hour of every day. In fact, the arms race has come the largest factor so far in the world's tory of waste and the diversion of the world's resources to non-productive anti-social purposes. What can Australia do about this everit. increasing arms race? Firstly, we cannot abdicate from the arena. I repeat: We cannot abdicate from the arena. Disarmament is not a simple issue. It is not just a case of removing ourselves from the issue hoping that our geographical isoouter space for peaceful purposes' only. lation, our comparative unimportance and our classical moral position will somehow create us a world free of nuclear dangers. To suggest Australia can somehow escape the consequences of a nuclear war is rather akin to the perspective of those who still believe in a limited and winnable nuclear war. There can be no such thing. Even we were regarded by both sides as cOlnpletely tral we would still suffer enormously. Extensive scientific assessment over the few years indicates that the world could be jected to a form of nuclear winter after a nuclear exchange between the super-powers. A recent study which has received a great deal of publicity warns that a strike of just one megaton could trigwill ger a global nuclear winter. A massive cloud of smoke and radioactive dust would bring freezing temperatures to the globe. suggests that massive burning Of synthetic . materials would release a deadly mix of toxic fumes, the effects of radioactive fallout would more extreme than those predicted by the :earlier models and the stratospheric ozone layer would be destroyed, exposing the world to prolonged, high level radiation once the skies had cleared. other words, there would be massive environmencantly tal damage. It is doubtful whether we could withinitiatives stand such inhospitable conditions. I must out that riot all scientists agree with that position. However, to talk of withdrawing from the nuclear debate in this context is purely ostrich talk. The Hawke Government has reviewed Australia's role in disarmament matters quitesigAlthough nificantly since taking office. We have been most forceful in pursuing progress on the long path towards a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. This treaty, when proclaimed, would prohibit clear testing. At the Thirty-eighth General possPlssembly of the United Nations last year Australia. and New Zealand persuaded the United reStates of America to abstain from, rather than vote 'against, our joint resolution .calling. for a were comprehensive treaty. This. change in the American position represented a substantial win for those committed to this policy. We have been . able to use our position as a responsible exporter of every of uranium to promote the Nuclear NonbeProliferation Treaty. This Treaty is the single hismost important and effective arms· control .measure in existence. It discourages-the spread of nuclear capability beyond those who already have We are working towards the establishment.of a subsidiary body to the Conference for Disarmament which will.research the implications of using outer space for the nuclear arms race. Needless to say, Australia is wholly committed to tlieuse of . We are working in support of an American for draft convention which is now before the Geneva that conference to prohibit chemical weapons. Australia has alsQ ratified the inhumane weapons convention, which seeks to prohibit and/or restrict the use of conventional weapons which are if considered inhumane. The Government is active neuin the search for.a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and is a member of the United Nations past committee where the proposal is being pursued. subWe have revived the concept of a South Pacific nuclear weapons free zone. This was put to the South Pacific Forum in 1983 and progress was again made last year. We hope that.a final report be brought to this year's South Pacific Forum. I believe that this will. be a substantial step forward and a significant feather in the cap of the The same study Hawke Government. In 1983, the Government appointed Mr Richard Butler as Australia's first ever Ambassabe dor for Disarmament. Since then he has been active at the conference in Geneva and in other international forums in support of our policies for effective prohibition of nuclear testing and chemiIn cal weapons. Mr Butler's appointment has signifiimproved the effectiveness of Australia's in disarmament discussions. To comppoint lement the appointment, the Hawke Government has also upgraded the capacity within the Department of Foreign Affairs to handle disarmament issues through the boosting of the disarmament and arms control and nuclear policy areas. I would like to see more done, including a further lift .in staff in the Department and a further lift in. staffing for Mr Butler, the steps taken by the Hawke Government since taking nuoffice have been a very real move forward in.the cause for arm- control and disarmament. Whilst the tensio.ns in o.ur wo.rld wo.uld have increased in recent years and we have seen nego tiatio.n after nego.tiatio.n co.llapse, it has beco.me crystal clear to. me that the wo.rd that we all need to. take significant no.te o.f is 'trust'. It is a very ,simple wo.rd,but a very impo.rtant wo.rd. We canno.t have' disarmament and arms co.ntro.l nego tiatio.ns witho.ut trust. We canno.t have a technical so.lutio.n if there is no. po.litical go.o.dwill. We are putting. the proverbial cart befo.re the ho.rse; I must admit that it is o.ne o.f the' few things o.n which I wo.uld readily agree with Dr Henry Kissinger, who was quo.ted o.n 30 July o.flast year in the Australian as saying: There is no technological way around a political negotiation. Only a political understanding will enable meaningful instructions to be issued to the technicians of arms control. If such an understanding is not attainable, arms control negotiations will either stalemate or become. a propaganda forum. Ho.w o.ften have we seen that o.ccur in the last few years? Bo.th super-po.wers are to. blame; there is no. questio.n o.f that. Bo.th sides have no.t been serio.us abo.ut the respective nego.tiatio.ns. We have also. seen in the So.uth Pacific area the continued nuclear testing by France. Ho.no.urable members will be aware that Australia has protested very strongly to. the French Government. It is o.ne reaso.n why I believe· that the states o.f the Pacific will jo.in Australia and proclaim a nuclear weapo.ns free zo.ne in the So.uth Pacific in the very near future. Whilst I have been talking abo.ut the build-up o.f bo.th co.nventio.nal and nuclear arsenals around the wo.rld, let there be no. mistake abo.ut the Hawke Government's co.mmitment to. o.ur allies and .to. the o.nly practical co.urse o.f actio.n at this time; that is deterrence. There can be no. general o.r co.mplete disarmament, as so.me people mistakenly. believe when they talk abo.ut disarmament, whilst we have basically two. co.mpeting so.cieties in o.ur wo.dd. The o.bject o.f having a well equipped defence fo.rce has always been part o.f a co.untry's strategy to. defend o.r deter o.thers fro.m invading o.ne's co.untry. Deterrence in the nuclear age wo.rks in exactly the same way, but with higher stakes. There are risks with any strategy, but it is significant to. no.te that the wo.rld has been free o.f glo.bal co.nflict between the majo.r po.wers fo.r nearly fo.ur decades, which is quite an achievement when co.mpared with the previo.us fo.ur decadt:s. War raged fo.r nearly o.ne who.le decade during that time. A strategy o.f deterrence has wo.rked, and I believe will co.ntinue to. wo.rk, even the.ugh the wo.rld has its problems at present. Ho.wevc::r, I must repeat my earlier statement that go.o.dwilland trust are essential if we are to. see a happier, freer and mo.re stable wo.rld o.ver the next fo.ur decades. It will o.nly be through po.litical go.o.dwill that respo.nsible arms co.ntro.l-I repeat, arms co.ntro.l-discussio.ns will o.ccur, be meaningful and bring true peace and stability to. everyo.ne o.n o.ur planet. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Befo.re I call the honourable member fo.r Flinders, I info.rm the Ho.use that this is a maiden speech.

I request o.f yo.u to co.nvey to. the Speaker my co.ngratulatio.ns o.n his re-electio.n o.f the high o.ffice o.f Speaker. I also. co.ngratulate and thank bo.th yo.u and the Speaker fo.r the excellent new members seminar which was held recently. I am sure it will co.ntribute greatly to. the wo.rk o.f all new members and their understanding o.f this great institutio.n. I feel bo.th privileged and proud to. have this o.ppo.rtunity at last to. address this Ho.use as the representative o.f the people o.f Flinders. It is pleasing to. see so.me members in this Ho.use this evening as it makes quite a co.ntrast to. my entry into. this place at the co.mmencement o.f my first term, when I was greeted by the sight o.f the Secretary to. His Excellency the Go.verno.r-General fixing o.n the do.o.rs o.f the Ho.use the Pro.clamatio.n o.f the disso.lutio.n o.f the Thirty-seco.nd Parliament. My first electio.n to. this place o.n 4 December 1982 represented a turning po.int fo.r the then Leader o.f the Oppo.sitio.n and no.w Minister fo.r Fo.reign Affairs (Mr Hayden) and in retro.spect the final high fo.r the then co.alitio.n Government. There can be no. questio.n no.w that my re""electio.n is symbo.lic o.f the fact that the Liberal Party o.f Australia ando.ur co.alitio.n partners have no.w spanned a difficult perio.d and are resurgent again, mo.ving inexo.rably to.wards go.vernment at the next electio.n. Such changes in po.litical fo.rtunes do. no.t co.me by the mere passage o.f time, but rather are a result o.f the endeavo.urs o.f men and wo.men. It is indicative o.f the healthy po.litical system we have in this co.untry that my electio.n to. this place has been bro.ught abo.ut, no.t by the effo.rts o.f a few but by the effo.rts o.f very many people if! Flinders, and with the assistance of my parliamentary co.lleagues o.n this side o.f the Ho.use. I wish to. express thanks publicly to. my electo.rate chairman, Jack MCMenamin; my two. campaign directo.rs, Haro.ld Weber and Don Jewell; Liberal Party branch members and suppo.rters; and especially my family, including my wife, Julie, who have been towera of strength to me over the 1ast.27 m'onths and tijrdee1ection campaigns. I. have been honoured tp receive the support df the people of Flinders and now reaffirm my commitment to represent them to the best of my ability. I also partiCularly thank' the Leader of the Oppo ship that he provided, not just to me but to Liberals throughout the electorate. FinallY, I cannot overlook the contribution of the Prime Minister (MrHawke)' whose brief foray i'nto Flinders probably put the matter beyond doubt. I take the opportunity to invite him into the electorate of Flinders at the next earliest opportunity and, at the, very least, during the next campaign when I am sure;: his presence will be similarly benefiCial. Before turning to some of the issues relevant to my electorate, I wish to pay tribute to the late Rt Hon. Sir Phillip Lynch. The public perception of so many people on the centre stage of our national life is sometimes distorted by the fleeting glimpses, the misquotes and the fabrications of a mass audience. For them recognition awaits the historian's pen. But this is not so in the case of Sir Phillip Lynch. The sheer weight of his achievements rightfully demanded and received recognition in his own lifetime. His loyalty to his principles and to his 'Party and his common sense were the basis of his reputation as a builder of bridges between Australians from aU walks of life. He was a great Australian and a great parliamentarian and is greatly missed. The seat of Flinders, which takes its name from Matthew Flinders, one of Australia's greatest explorers and the first man to circumnavigate Australia, is one of the original seats in the Federation. Following last year's electoral redistribution the seat now takes in the whole of the Mornington Peninsula with the exception of the residential areas north of Mornington and follows Western Port Bay round to Wonthaggi in the east and encloses Phillip Island and French Island. The electorate is today as it has been for many years, a favourite place to retire, an exciting destination for both local and international tourists, an area of rich agricultural resources and, with the fine harbour of Western Port, an area of great potential for development. I encourage honourable members from both sides of this House to come to the' electorate of Flinders and enjoy the marty features that it has to offer. One of the features of great significance on the Peninsula is the area known ,as Point Nepean which guards the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. The area, of 1,477 acres, is owried by the Commonwealth and is .occupied by the Army for the Officer Cadet School of Portsea. The OCS will be vacating the property at the end of this year to re-establish itself in the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. The area is of great historical interest. It poses problems of erosion and fire - ontrol. The OCS has a significantly beneficial im- i pact on the local economy. The area has been well maintained by the Commonwealth over many years but there is now the prospect that upon the departure of the. Army a vacuum will be created. That is the worse thing that could be allowed to happen. The future of the area will require considerable consultation between Federal, State and local governments and local people and it is of vital importance that a management plan be put in place prior to the Army's departUre. This area is a national asset and. the .Government must · establish a framework within which decisions can be made so that the future usage of the area will meet with broad community support. Another issue of great importance t6 the people of Flinders is the cost' of telephone calls, particularly into the Melbourne local call zone. The charging policy of Telecom Australia rests essentially upon zones established in 1960. Many parts of the electorate, both on the Mornington Peninsula and across to Cranbourne South, are now parts of suburban Melbourne, and that fact ought to be recognised. Subscriber trunk dialling charge rates are a very considerable disincentive to the establishment of businesses and I know from personal experience, having worked in the electorate for a number of years, that it places an unfair bur·den on small business people attempting to compete with businesses in adjacent areas of the Melbourne zone.' As the rate of the introduction of high technology increases there will be ever greater demands for the use of the telephone to hook into data banks and the technology of the twentieth and twenty-first century. I was pleased to see a parliamentary report tabledlast year entitled 'Ringing in the Changes', to which I put a submission with local colleagues, Dr Ron Wells arid Robin Cooper, largely supporting the point of view I am now expressing. The report has been with the Government for some time and provision of some real relief for the people of Flinders is now both urgent and overdue. Before turning to some wider issues I wish briefly to mention two industries which are of great significance and potential in the electorate of Flinders. They are the tourist industry and: the · rural industry. The rural industry in Flinders is diverse and includes such activities as dairy farming, about which I hope many members, including members on the other side of the House, are fully aware. High technology has its application in the rural industry. For example, it plays an important part in ensuring that the ex-ellent asparag4s,-f the Kooweerup Swamp is on the shelves and still fresh in, the&hops .of -()ndon and Tokyo wjthin two days .of cutting. Governments have a role - n providing support to, industry and I hope that the present Government. does not forget that ou).' rural industries have and will continue to have a fundamental impact on the economic development of this country. The world tourist industry was reported a few years ago to be now larger than the world's steel industry. Within Flinders we have the famous penguin parade, which is one of the biggest international tourist attractions in Australia, superb bay beaches within both Port Phillip and Western Port and surf beaches to rival any other in Australia. We have some great convention facilities, every form of accommodation and the beautiful hills of Bas, Red Hill and Merricks North on the Peninsula; Subject to the importance of the preservation of all those features which make Flinders one of the great places in Australia to live and enjoy, the potential for the development of the tourist industry knows no bounds. What is needed is for governments to ensure .that the framework of government controls for the maintenance of the area and the provision of basic infrastructure, by being certain and concise, will encourage confidence in the area's potential so that those who are prepared to risk their money to provide jobs and facilities and develop the area will in fact do so. As a local councillor I saw too many applicants with reasonable proposals and. the necessary risk capital and confidence in Australia's future leave their money in the bank rather than try to overcome the hurdles of a multitude of permits. This country was not built with permits; it was built with confidence and initiative and it is time governments stood back and let people with initiative get this country going again. Before concluding, I feel th\lt it is important for me as it neW member to state some of the basic principles by which I hope successfully to represent the interests of the people of Flinders and Australia. A vision of a better Australia of course needs the confidence that one can make a contribution to bring such visions to reality. To that extent I am idealistic. I believe that if Australians work together and pursue common goals we can achieve a better Australia for all Australians. I do not doubt that hon.ourable members on both sides of this House share a vision of Australia without poverty, where all Australians can have shelter, are well fed and clothed, can receive a good education and can. reach their full potential in a country whose sovereignty remains inviolate. Of course, the real difficulties and controv-rsies become apparent when we'look to achieving the&e, basic sorts Of aims. For m- - he starting point must be the aims and aspirations of the individ\lal. Sir Robert Menzies talked about the individual and his encouragement and recognition as being the prime motive force for building a better world. The acceptance of that simple but fundamental point of view leads to the compelling conclusion that governments and their bureaucracies cannot, and should not, assume the responsibilities of individuals. If that 'argument fails at first to be persuasive one needs only to look back at the history of Western civilisation since the Industrial Revolution to see the benefits of economic and political freedom for individuals. The real - ignificance of Milton Friedman has been his emphasis on the inter-relationship between economic and political freedoms. He points out that if over 40 per cent of gross domestic product is being spent by governments it is not being spent, by individuals and individuals are not, having a direct choice in the expenditure of the fruits of their labour. The market-place is distorted by the inefficiencies of the demands of government. That translates itself into the political process quite clearly with the demands for less taxation and the lifting of restrictions on people's freedom of choice. Those demands go hand in hand with the parallel demand that governments should not impose upon the individual's right to have an economic system where effort is rewarded. There is surely nothing wrong with enlightened self-interest. It represents an acknowledgment that the first duty of individuals is to care for themselves and for their families. That is a fundamental part of the human condition which will work to bring about those basic aims which I outlined previously and is in no way inconsistent with a genuine concern for others. Certainly, there is a role for governments to play in the maintenance of minimum standards for those people who, for one reason or another, are unable to care adequately for themselves. That is only compassionate and humane and one of the prime responsibilities of governments in modern society. The free enterprise system does work and it can work very efficiently as long as we maintain a framework which discourages market distortions. In' this country we have the traditions of freedom which could really contribute to the achievement of prosperity for all. Politically, Australian people are looking for a party that will lead the way. It was very clear in the general election, where the message from the electors ofFlinders to the Government was that they did not want an assets test which would impinge upon their rights to accumulate property. They did not want a capital gains tax which would rob them of the fruits of their labour. They did not want superannuation tax which would inhibit their ability to' provide for their personal well-being. They did not want death duties and gift duties which would restrict their right to provide for their children and their grandchildren. Certainly, this Government and this country have seen some .improvements in our economic prosperity over the lasftwo years. But we haveyet to s-e, and we will not see under a Labor government, the preconditions for lasting economic growth. When a government criticises constructive proposals put by Jeff Kennett in Victoria to employ the young unemployed; when the vested interests iii our labour market prevent the adult unemployed from obtaining real jobs; and when government maintains a monopoly on the technological communications systems of the 1980s and 1990s, the preconditions for real growth are not being met. . . The London Economist, in a review of 1984, looked at the American economy and noted that several deep ,changes in American life had prepared the ground for America's ideological shift. This has gone hand in hand with its economic progress over the last two ,or three years. The Economist completed its review with the words: Above all, America's new mood brings it back to one of its main intellectual roots. able rights include life, liberty ness let a Governrnent get in their way? The Americans have realised that the once conventional wisdom that governments can solve problems by spending a lot of money on them has proved to be an illusion. Unfortunately, that cannot be said of Australia. Australia is a lucky country. Let us not allow it to become a fool's paradise. We have the people and resources to build up this nation and I look forward optimistically to the Australia ·of the future and commit myself to working hard for its improvement.",103
188,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, through you, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. Mr Ian Cameron-How come you are making a maiden speech, Gerry?",106
189,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"If the honourable member waits a while, he will hear. I would like also to congratulate those honourable members who tonight have made their maiden speeches. There have been some excellent contributions and I am sure those honourable members will make their mark ,on this; place. . One.of the disappointing featur-- abo--coming, baqk to this chamber, and something which has, struck me, is that some changes have taken place on the other side of the chamber: It is disappointing to see those people,from the Liberal Party of Australia who have stood up for what they believe in being removed from the front bench and replaced by other people; The honourable ' member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) wrote an article in the Bulletin newspaper, slightly' disagreeing with the Leader of the Opposition  he went. The leader of the militant doctors in New South Wales, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), has fallen out of favour and he is on the back bench. The same applies to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). The same also applies to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife); the great crime he co-mitted was to beat Stephen Lusher, the National Party candidate. . That prompts me to read an advertisement that was inserted in the Melbourne Times on 13 February. It is worth noting, It is in amongst the housing advertisements and it is headed 'Renovating the Liberals '. It reads: Would fed-up worried conservatives willing to stack Liberal Party branches in the safe Labor 'Melbourne' eleotorate kindly contact me Will the people whose inalienThere is a telephone number provided. It and the pursuit of happi- continues: By this simple initial device determined conservatism can easily begin snatching many blockI do not quite know what this meansof influence from the unprincipled mediocrities throughout the infrastructure of the currently wretched Liberal Party.' . It is signed by someone whom t should not name because people might - ant to ring him up.",106
190,Mr GOODLUCK,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"You couldn't do it in Tasmania, could you? .",106
191,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"One could not do that in Tasmania but it shows the state of the Liberal Party-the disunity that prevails on the other side of the chamber. The plotting was already taking place in the parliamentary dining room tonight. There they were, the little dissident group, all huddled in a corner plotting the downfall of Andrew. It seems that they have already begun their work. The honourable member forWannon (Mr Hawker) can cry out as much as he likes. It is interesting that last week one of the biggest manufacturers in his electorate did not ring the honourable member. He rang the member for Melbourne because he wanted to get the job done; he wante<:i it fixed 'up. Within 24 hours the problem 'was solved. Letters have been pouring in ever since from manufacturing in9ustry in his electorate. Let us not kid ourselves: The Liberal Party is in' a shambles. . It is interesting to note that the No.2 person getting up behind the Leader of the Opposition is"" the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), It is not the Deputy Leader of the eral Party,the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who is sitting quietly, winking nodding to the honourable member for Mackellar say: every time the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) opens his mouth. What an insult to those people it must be to be replaced on the front bench by the honourable member; for .o'Connor. For God's sake, what a disgraGe! The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), a of respected Queen's Counsel, a person highly regarded in the community who has been asked the Melbourne Age. to write a feature article tomorrow has been replaced by the honourable member for O'Connor; the small businessman's friend who wants to evict everyone from the property he owns. That is the sort of person he is. The honourable member for O'Connor has thumping Aborigines while someone holds them to evicting small shopkeepers. Mr Robert Brown-Is Wilson TJJckey better than Jeff Kennett?",106
192,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"WewiII get t6 Jeff Kennett in a moment. I wish to address my remarks tonight to the election in Victoria because peopleMr Ian Cameron-Oh, come on! .",107
193,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,Surprise! I ask honourable Jeff.Kennett members opposite not to worry. Mr Ian Cameron-What happened' to the paign member for Casey?,107
194,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"The former honourable member for Casey is all right. The people in Victoria Saturday are going to have a .choice between current Labor Government and the Liberal Party, the coalition or the Nat,ional Party. It seems to that there is no doubt that the choice will see the return of the Labor Government in .that State. This will be the.firsttime that a Labor governtake ment in Victoria will be returned back-to-back. After all, this will not, be a particularly difficult choice for peopl- to make. On the one hand, Australian tabor Party over the last three has brought Victoria back from the brink of bankversion ruptcy w-ich was caused by conservative governseriously? ments. The Labor Paity has created an enviro.nin ment of strong economic growth and bunch development .manlOlged \>y. a team of competent f!Jrward,thinking men and women. Against that we have. the motley half-bilked crew of - eceitful incompetents from the Liberal and National parties who are attempting to - eceh:e the Victorian people by pretendillg that they could form a co. alition government. I ask people to think about the threat of a coalition government in Victoria. ' Jeff Kennett, before the last election, is reported Libas saying:. 'A coalition government in Victoria would be a disaster'. He said that when he was not and the Leader of the Liberal Party. He went on to I would never be able to work in a coalition. I ask people to think about those sorts of comments because it seems that they may have had an effect on the National Party. As yet in the course this campaign the two leaders of the coalition parties which pretend that they could form a coby alition government have yet to appear on the same platform. This shows a lot about what they feel for each other. They will not even get in the same room together. Let us talk about the leaders. Mr Ian Cameron-How often does Bob Hawke gone from have you on his platform?",107
195,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"My Leader and I often appear at functions together. We are great friends. My Leader and I represent electorates which adjoin each other and we work closely together. As the honourable member· for Streeton (Mr Lamb)' pointed out in the House last night, the Premier of Victoria, John Cain, is a man of the highest calibre, a man who is beyond reproach both in his personal and political lives. The comments that made publicly in the course of the campaign have been most unfortunate. The camhas shown what John Cain is about. He has refused to be drawn into a personality feud or battle with the likes of Jeff Kennett. We have a credibility ,problem with old Jeff. He is not on thought of very highly, even by his own people. the For the benefit of honourable members. I will quote a few things that have been said about him. me He has been described as 'lacking jUdgment, lacking an understanding of issues and lacking in tact. . As Tim Colebatch of the Age asked: How can you seriously a leader who spent half of his Budget speech complaining about the fact that John Cain did not invite him to a VFL dinner? the How can a man who deScribed the National years Economic Summit Conference as ' Mr Hawke's of the Grand Council of Fascists' be taken What a way for him to treat his friends the business community, to describe them as a of fascists. He has been described by his colleagues-not by us but, by members of the Liberal Party-as a 'blabber boy', 'motor mouth',. 'killer Kennett', 'daffy duck', 'calamity Kennett', and even before he became the Leader, he quickly established himself as God's gift to journalists on a quiet day. There we haveleffKennett. Mr Chynoweth-They are all the complimentary remarks.",107
196,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"They are the good things about him. I now raise one issue concerning the depression in public housing. Some honourable members will recall my maiden speech a couple of years ago. I suggest to new members that they get a copy of my speech and read it, because it talked about a number of issues which some of them touched on tonight. It dealt, in particular, with public housing. The Liberal Party in Victoria has launched a unique planfor public housing. It has simply said that it will, sell off large sections of existing high rise stock to make way for offices. It was going to establish a Victorian sports centre on one estate by kicking out all the people. It would be interesting to know who drafted this policy. The fact is that high rise fiats cannot be turned into office blocks because the ceilings are too low. I would have thought that would have been covered in the building regulations. The building regulations for office blocks are too strict for these high rise buildings to be tl}rned into office blocks. The Liberal Party dreamt up this lunacy, which the Liberals prefer to call a policy. Whoever dreamt it up has not even bothered to acquaint himself or herself with the contents of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement; neither, so it seems, has the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who is in his usual way prepared to indulge in more lies and deceit. In a Press statement yesterday the Hon. Michael Hodgman, QC, MP-the QCs must have been going cheap-stated that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr West) had misled the House in answer to a question put to him by the honourable member for Streeton. The honourable member for Denison said: Mr West wrongly asserted that the Victorian Opposition's housing policy directly contravened the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. He further wrongly claimed that it was not lawful. As a matter of law, on both points, we say that Mr West-intentionally or otherwise-misled the House. The knack the honourable member for Denison has for deliberately misconstruing the truth never fails to amaze me. Honourable members will recall that he did it during the immigration debate in the last Parliament. He was so bad he had to be moved from his shadow portfolio and disciplined by his Leader. He is now having a go with housing. I will' 'read to the House the relevant passages from: :the State Liberal Party's policy on housing and the relevant sections of the Housing A'ssistance Act 1984, which enshrines in law the Commonwealth-State 'Housing Agreement. The Liberal Party policy specifies: As a matter of priority; the incoming Liberal Government will ensure that subject to the ability to re-pay the loan people will have the right to buy their public rental' house or flat. In addition to a right to buy, long term Ministry of Housing tenants will receive a discount bonus of the purchase price of that home. It continues: Purchasers may sell their home subsequently, but if resale occurs within 5 years of purchase there will be repayment of some of the discount. A sliding scale will range from re-paying 100 per cent of the discount in the first year to 20 per cent of the discount in the fifth year. Mr Ian Cameron-Do you understand ail that, Gerry?",108
197,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"If the honourable member listened he might learn something. It is important for members of the National Party to listen. Paragraph 34 (1) of Schedule 1 of the Housing Assistance Act 1984 has two things to say about these propositions. Firstly, the concept of selling rental housing at lower than market ,value or replacement cost can be undertaken ,only, in circumstances in which 'it is agreed between the Minister and State Minister'. Paragraph 34 (1) (a) of Schedule 1 makes that provision. No such agreement has ,been made or even contemplated. In other wQrds, the Liberals have not even bothered to sound it out. Secondly, under section 34 (2) any body or group which acquires rental housing at other than market value or replacement cost and resells the property must repay to the State an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale at market value or replacement cost, of the housing. The State Liberal policy says quite another thing. Mr Ian Cameron-This is riveting stuff.",108
198,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"It is important to the people who live in the high-rise fiats. If the honourable member'listens he will understand. In both respects the'Liberal Party policy contravenes the Act. The law and order brigade over here and the law and order brigade in Victoria 'want to kick people out of their fiats, turn the fiats into offices and break all the regulations. Now they want to contravene a Commonwealth-State agreement. I just cannot understand it. It is clear that the honourable member for Denison had not eVen ' read the State Liberal policy when he made the quite absurd assertion in his news release that the Victorian Opposition housing policy required that all sales of public housing rental stock 'Yould b- at market value., Even if the State Liberal policy could. be legally implemented, it would have to fail on econom,ic and social grounds. Because my time is running .out I will not read this statement but perhaps people would like to obtain a copy. It is the State improvement strategy of February 1985 by the Ministry of Housing in Victoria. It is an excellent document which gives all the details of what the State Labor Government is doing and will do in the next 10 years. The Cain Labor Government has taken a responsible approach to the issue of public housing. In this election campaign it has promised to maintain and build upon the housing program it has established. In the area of public housing, over the next four years the Cain Labor Government will add at least 12,000 public housing units to the existing public housing stock and' will spend a further $120m over this period to improve current stock and bring it up to an acceptable standard. In implementing this commitment, the State Labor Government has developed an improvement strategy which establishes priorities as determined by the tenants. This is the important point, because the tenant groups which have been established on these estates have been doing quite wonderful work in getting the residents together, finding out their needs, and then informing the Government. This has led to a much better understanding between the Department and the people. Unlike the Liberal approach, the Labor Government believes in working together with the tenants, rather than imposing some ill-begotten policy on them which frightens the living daylights out of them. The Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial quoted one tenant as saying: No one on a pension could afford to buy their flat. Another tenant said: I waited so long for this flat and' I don't want to be thrown out of it in a hurry. Another tenant said, and this is probably what most people think: If Mr Kennett does that then he's stupid. I could not agree more. It is one of the most stupid and cruel acts I have ever heard of since I have been involved in politics, and that is a long time. Underprivileged people wake up in the morning and read in the daily newspapers that they are going to be evicted, that emporiums are to be established, that office blocks . will replace their housing. It is quite cruel when the pensioners and single par.ents and their families who live in these estates are subjected to this sort of action by irresponsible politicians. I could not agree more with the person who described Mr Kennett as stupid. In other areas the polioies being proposed are marked with the same stupidity. Mr Kennett, I remind the House, has also said-we all know that he has a fetish for the private sector-during this campaign that every government agency is up for grabs. If elected, he will sell, or attempt to sell, the State Insurance Office, the State Bank, the Government Printer, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria and the prisons. He will flog off the prisons to private enterprise. I am not quite sure how they will be run, but I presume that if somebody does not pay his board he will be evicted and turfed out. The prisons will be run on purely profit lines. How ludicrous can he get? He also talked about flogging off the courts of law. That is the sort of attitude and policy that is being put forward by the State Opposition. I ask the people to dwell on those things-selling banks, insurance companies, prisons, gas and fuel, and the highly profitable SEC. When a similar philosophy was actually put into practice in the Canadian State of British Colombia the net result for that community was a massive increase in unemployment. The credibility of the State Opposition, I think, is absolutely shattered and in' tatters. On 22 February, Tim Colebatch in the Age said: The problem with the Liberal Party's costing of its election promises is not what it reveals about the promises but what it reveals about the Liberals. Essentially it shows that they do not understand the Victorian Budget papers. They have based their promise to provide tax cuts with spending increases on an extraordinary misinterpretation of the budget's national accounts figures. And that is despite the fact that the meaning of the figures is explained in the budget documents. Where would Mr Kennett make his $178 million cuts this year? Or his $312 million cuts next year? The fact remains that the Liberal's policies do not add up. The $57 million cost they give for their new first-year spending proposals, for example, list nothing for edu. cation, despite their commitment to greatly increase funding to non-government schools, nothing for housing, nothing for transport, and only an unexplained round figure of $25 million for health. Yet their policy documents are full of promises in these areas. The choice on Saturday is quite clear. The. people-Mr MCVeigh-What are you going to do about the dairy farmers in Victoria?",108
199,Mr HAND,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"We are up here today fixing that up. We did not cause the dairy farmers' problems. The dairy farmers' problems were caused by Liberal State governments and Liberal Federal governments. Mr MCVeigh-Tell us what you are doing to do for the farmers. MrHAND-The farmers will be taken care of. As I said ' before, it is ashame when the constituents of the honourable member for Wannon have to ring the member for Melbourne, whose electorate is right in the heart of the city, to get their problems fixed. That also goes for farmers trying to' get jobs for their kids. We never stop. Every day there are telephone calls from sons, daughters and mothers of farmers ringing' us in our offices trying to get help because of the neglect by members of the other side of the House of the farmers in years gone by and their neglect of them now as the farmers representatives. The choice on the weekend is quite clear, as I said. It is a choice between stability and growth, a choice between people who cannot add up, people who are determined to smear and put fear into people, people who behave in a very irresponsible manner, and the alternative, which is, of course,the return of a Labor government.",109
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"Mr Keogh)Order! Before calling the honourable member for Gilmore, I remind honourable members that this is the honourable membyrs' maiden speech. I am sure that they will extend the usual courtesies to him.",110
201,Mr SHARP,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"As I rise to address this House for the first occasion, I take the opportunity to thank both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of this House for the hospitality given to both me and other new members on entering Parliament. I also place on record my thanks to all those members and supporters of the National Party of Australia who made a contribution towards my presence in this House today. I also thank the electors of Gilmore, who have placed their confidence in me: My fervent hope is that I shall be able to live up to their expectations over the years. I stand here today as the first member for the new electorate of Gilmore, created by the recent electoral redistribution. The electorate was named in honour of one' of Australia's great citizens, Dame Mary Gilmore. Some would criticise me for calling Dame Mary Gilmore a great Australian. They would point out that the differences in political philosophies between her and me would make my declaration somewhat suspect. However, to evaluate a person's worth to the nation using political beliefs as a main criterion is, I believe, an injustice. Surely the best way to evaluate the worth of an Australian is to view the contribution that he or she has made to his or her country, and Dame Mary Gilmore made a great contribution to Australia. She was one of our most noted authors and poets. Indeed, it is my privilege and honour to represent the electorate which bears her name. The electorate of Gilmore stretches from Young and Cowra in the south-west of New South Wales eastward through the city of Goulburn and over the Great Dividing· Range to Nowra .and the coast. Gilmore includes many small towhs and communities such as Boorowa, Crookwell, Gunning, Taralga, Sutton, Marulan, Kangaroo Valley, Bundanoon, Sussex Inlet and Huskisson. The economy of Gilmore rests in the main on the very broad shoulders of agriculture. The area around Goulburn and the southern tablelands is famous for its ability to produce fine wool. The Picker family from Bigga has established a reputation as one of Australia's best fine wool producers, setting a world record price for their product. The electorate also has the distinction of having the famous Merryville Stud, started by Sir Walter Merriman, which is also noted for its fine wool sheep. Wheat production is a major part of the agricultural economy of the electorate. However, the viability of this industry now appears in doubt. Rising costs of production and increasing government controlled charges, charges that increase at levels tied to the consumer price index but which bear no consideration to the. industry's ability to pay, combined with depressed world prices for wheat, mean that we can expect to find many people dropping out of the wheat industry. I am particularly concerned at the debts many wheat farmers have generated oVer recent years in attempts to survive the downturn in the industry, by purchasing newer, more efficient, machinery in the hope of increasing production but, at the same time, burdening themselves with large interest payments which will be hard to meet due to poor returns in the recent drought. The inevitable result will be that the younger, more enterprising and more modern farmer, coming from a not so well established financial background, will fall from the industry nrst. Beef production plays a vital role in the economy of Gilmore. Expected rises in the beef prices will see the industry consolidate itself after the difficult times it has experienced in recent years. However, these rises in price will pccuronly as long as the European Economic Community does not dump onto the world market its subsidised beef at prices below the present world market price. If it· does, any expected price rises might .soon disappear and we may even witness price falls. The dairy industry is a major component of the economy in the region around Nowra and Goulburn. This industry has suffered the pains of rationalisation over the last 10 or 15 years to the point where in Goulburn there are now only eight dairies when 10 years ago there were 33. Decisions to be m-de by this Government will tilt the scales for the future of all dairymen in Australia, and in particular, the dairymen in my electorate. The wrong decision could see 25 per cent of those rently engaged in the industry fall by the in anyone's terms, a savage loss, particularly when the dairymen in my electorate have followed the course of rationalisation over the years in the belief that by now they would be able to settle down to a stable industry giving them a fair living. The growing of fruit and vegetables is also'imand portant. Young is Australia's cherry capital during the drought the cherry industry suffered tree losses of up to 50 per cent. Producers, howboundaries, ever, have shown the resilience and determination which all country people have and are now rapand idly replanting trees and installing water bores and irrigation systems to try to minimise losses in future droughts. Vegetables are grown in the Lachlan Valley region near Cowra. The Edgell canning factory at Cowra employs some 450 areas. people during the height of the season and proseems vides income of some $5m to the district. It is criminal that this canning factory, and the people who work in it, are competing against savagely little su-sidised competition from other countries. This unfair and uneconomic cost undercutting conroad stantly threatens the future of the industry, but far our producers and canners have withstand the competition by virtue of the efficiency of their methods and the high quality of their products. Whilst both the national' economy and the economy of the Gilmore electorate rest their weight on agriculture, the agricultural industries in general terms face a'very dismal year ahead. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics predicts that the average family farm worker's income 1985will be $6,598, which is approximately third of the average Australian income. No better indication of the plight of farmers can be provided than to use the example given by the National Australia Bank at this year's BAE ference, when it pointed out that in the last two years the farming sector has become a net borrower' of money from the banking system when previously it had been a net lender to the banking system. The industry and government, both Federal and State, must seriously address themselves to the continuing falls in trade for the farmers of Australia. Over the years farmers have done their best to meet the challenges which falling terms of trade have presented, and as a result they have made their industry one of the most efficient producers of agricultural produce in the world. Cerservices-industries tainly, there is no doubt that Australian farmers are this country's most efficient workers. Therefore, it is imperative that farmers be given as fair a go as possible and not be burdened with unnecesscurary imposts which could have the potential to wayside; bring the industry to its knees. Beyond agriculture, there are many other parts to the total strength of Gilmore's economy. Mining is a major employer and money earner in the areas around Goulburn, Marulan and Young. The mining industry employs about 665 people injects many millions of dollars into Giland more's economy. But with such a beautiful portion of Australia lying within the electorate's tourism naturally becomes a major industry. The tourist regions surrounding Nowra the coast are, to mymind, underdeveloped as a tourist resort mainly because of the lack of a suitable road liriking this area with places such as Canberra and areas to its west. One road existstrunk road 92-to connect Nowra with those The road was built in about the 1830s and it that since those days little has been done. Whilst the road takes a much better route to the coast than the road over the Clyde Mountain, it is used because it is at its best a bone-shattering journey along 130, kilometres of dirt road. This would be an ideal project for upgrading and so sealing under the Australian bicentennial road debeen able to velopment program. The improvement of trunk road 92 is one of the many goals I have set myself as the member for Gilmore. Another is the establishment of an air service which would greatly boost the economy of Nowra and the coast and go part way towards alleviating the damage done by this Government when it axed about 1,000 personnel from the Navy base, HMAS Albatross, at Nowra. This has for resulted in unemployment in the area increasing onedramatically by some 333 people in the past 12 months. That trend is likely to continue further as the Government gives service contracts to businesses outside the local area and in favour of Outlook Conmetropolitan-based firms. Cowra hosts another major tourist attractionthe Japanese gardens and war cemetery. Last year some 46,000 people visited this place. The importance of these gardens is underrated as they are used extensively by Australian businessmen as an almost compulsory visiting point when they are carrying out business with Japanese businessmen. Many major deals have been struck between Australia and Japan as a result of these beautiful gardens. Goulburn has a broad range of industries and such as the Supertex factory, employing some 315 people and manufacturing textile products. ,Cooper Laboratory Indilstries Ltd and' Baxter's ShoeS',areaiso major employers. Services to the wool industry with the wool handling centre provide an additional service to""an important ind-st;'y. Go'ulburn also hosts the New South Wales Policy Academy- That is now housed in very modern and spaCious surroundings with planned facilities that will make it one 'of the best police academies in the world. On a visit to Goulburn during the recent election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated that there was a' possibility that the national police academy may also be located on the New South Wales Police Academy site,t1:nis taking full advantage of a nurpber of facilities which could be used jointly, such as the $2.5m driver-training track, new heated training tank, library, pistol range, teaching staff and facilities. This would also enhance closer relations with police of different forces and save the taxpayer millions of dollars. I congratulate the Prime Minister on his wisdom of opening up this sensible option and trust that he will stand by his proposal-to the benefit of the people of Goulburn, and, indeed, Australia. As my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) did in his maiden speech to this House, I support the call, for further consideration of the Sydney toMelbourne high speed rail link as proposed by Dr Paul Wild of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Goulburn has a proud history with the railway. However, it has witnessed over the years the decline of railway business and the increase in large semi-tniilers driving down the main street of the town, travelling the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne. The Department of Main Roads has, I am told, done a count of semi-trailers passing through Goulburn, and it averages out at one every 70 seconds. Each one of those semis has cost well in excess of $100,000. Multiplying that all out, that means that each day $124m is tied up taking freight between Sydney and Melbourne by road. Add to that the damage done to the Hume Highway, the lives lost in the countless accidents involving semi,trailers and the inefficiencies of carrying 20 tonnes on one truck compared with carrying 2,000 tonnes on one train, one can easily see that to build this fast rail service has more merit than'first meets the eye. It 'WOUld be derelict of me not to recognise the importance of small business because small business, collectively, is one of the major employers within my electorate. I firmly believe that the Government should give some incentive to small businesses by allowing them inore flexibility in their wage contracts so that they can employ pedplewho want to hav6(a job'butwho are not' currently employed because the employer cannot afford the penalty rates and high wages, which exist at the moment. This incentive WQ1)ldsoak up J a lot of unemployment, particularlyyou-h,unem"" ployment, and give those people re!!.l jobs with long term futures. One of my major goals as a member of this Federal Parliament will be to ensure that the econdmy of my electorate is given every opportunity to develop to its fullest potential"" thus ensuring' the livelihood, prosperity and social well-being of the people living within my eleCtorate. To do this I believe it is essential that governments place a heavy emphasis on promoting the growth of private enterprise; for it is through private enterprise that efficiencies are IDaximised and competition generates initiative, motivation and a sense of achievement and satisfaction. We, as a parliament, must also work to reduce the level of taxation now restricting personal initiative and the striving for success. Australians now find themselves in the unenviable position of being one of the highest taxed people in the world. The average wage earner today finds himself paying tax at the rate of47c in the dollar. Only a few years ago, to be in the top income tax bracket, one needed to be earning several times the average income. Now one needs to earn only twice the average income to be in the top tax bracket. Every person in this House must realise how necessary it is to give people a reward for using their talent and skills and for working hard. I am sure that every person in this place has worked extremely hard in order to achieve electoral success, Our reward is to be a member of this House and to carry out the high office of government that goes on within. That is oui' reward, but the reward for the average person comes in the form of money in the hand. The more work or effort a person gives is directly reflected by the reward he or .she receives. Yet governments seemingly work overtime to devise new methods of reducing that reward, which must result in less productivity. One of the major reasons why Australia finds itself in this unenviable high taxation position is due, I believe, to the attitude that says we must take from those who have' and give it to those who have not. I remind this House of the words of that wise man, Abraham Lincoln, who said:' You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. His words indicate that if we' strengtheh ' the strong we will strengthen the ;weak. By doing as Abraham'Lincoln said, I believe we' will reverse the current trend of a declining standard 'of living and, hayelj he8Jthie-, ,happier, more pro-pet?\lnation, for all,Al,lstralians toJive in. Asa young Australian I am concerned with this country's ,'future.' I 'expect to bea taxpayer many years ito come. Like many young Aus-' moving tralians, I am rapidly becoming alarmed at the dl,lring level of debt which the Federal Government is cumulating as a result of the deficit budgeting chology. This fiscal year the Federal Governand ment's intere-t bill and our borrowings increased, by some 30 per, cent, t- $5.6 billion. Thai fC?Psition resents about 8.8 per <;:ent of the Federal Govern"" ment's total outlays for the :year and, indeed,it represents about $900 per year per taxpayer. Unsecond less something dram,l,ltic is done soon, today's young Aust,ralians will find that their future been mortgaged and that tomorrow's taxpayers now will be paying for yesterday's services and facilities. ' I look forward to my years of service in this House. I' look forward to my duties and the responsibility of serving the people p(Gilmore and Australia. I thank' honourable members for their attention.",110
202,Mr KEOGH,WESTERN ALLIANCE,"1 should like first to congratula:te the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the members of the Labor Governistry ment on their re-election for a second term. I also take the opportunity to congratulate my Australian tralian Labor Party colleagues, those and those elected for their nrst term, in this enlarged Thirty-fourth Parliament. 1I have already congratulated Mr Speaker and Madam Deputy from Speaker, but I place those congratulations on record. This Government's comfortable majority working clearly shows that the people of Australia are more than satisfied with, the direction and peryear formance of the Hawke Labor Government during ing its first term in office, with its strong leaderfirst ship and sound economic policies. J thank electors of Bowman for my, re-election. They gave mea clear signal, by re-electing me with increased majority; that they. desire me to conconditions tinue to represent them for at least a further term with this Labor Government. I assure them that will continue to represent them and serve their best interests, as I have always tried to do. I shall comment briefly' on the poor performefficient ance of the Opposition during the term of the prelong viousParliament-in stark contrast to that of the Government. Apart from a short-lived sparkle  during the election campaign-his talent as a shpwman or, more col,'rectly, as a show pony,was put to good use-,-:the Opposition's record past two years has been notable only for its dull i,' , , ' arid-nremarkabl¥chara-ie(Of cout-e, political leadership is not simplx ""q-e ability to project a for cosmetically competent image for a few weeks, about Australia, ,on ,the electronic media, an election campaign. 'It is about the ability acto perform in Parliament over a long period; arid psyin the case of the Opposition Leader, to Prepare project some reasonable alternative policies to those of the Government. The present Oppofailed to do this during its two years in the previous Parliament. I ,have no doubt that it will fail again to do it during this Labor Government's term. It is interesting to note that, apart from a brief and somewhat isolated rise in position has in the public opinion polls, the Opposition has relapsed to its consistently low points rating, in the low forties. ' I refer for a few moments to the program of this Government, which was outlined in the Governor General's Speech and which provides a very real comparison with the alternatives that the Leader of the Opposition and his Shadow Ministry have been able to present. That shadow Ministry comprising principally recycled, failed' and rejected Fraser Government Ministers compared with the vastly superior talent of the Hawke Minwill, I am sure, in the months to come proshall vide further convincing evidence to the Auspublic of its eminently responsible choice re-elected on polling day, 1 December 1984. ,Clearly the achievements of this Governme,nt over the last two years have helped this nation the dismal state in which it was left after the seven disastrous years of the Fraser Government. This Government during its term in office will be continuously to create a stronger, fairer and more equitable society in Australia. This next will be one of consolidating and reconstructto confirm the recovery achieved during the term of the Labor Government. The program the of the Government is for further economic growth and stimulation, a reduction in unemployan ment and inflation and an improvement in the of those less well off in the community. Of cOl,lrse, one of the major tasks this year will I be the examination of the whole system of taxation in this country. The aim of this review will be to achieve a fairer, more equitable and more system of tax for all Australians. For too the tax burden has been carried by too few. I applaud the Government for making this move. I sincerely trust that the Australian Democrats in anot-er place will at long last show some political honesty and support the legislative program to introduce a fair and equitable system of taxation over the when it is put before the Parliament. A complete overhaul, of our taxation system , will be one of the fundamentally important tasks' carried out during this year. It is interesting to note that on many' occasions when honourable members from both, si-es of the House have spoken to the Address-in-Reply they have spoken in terms of supporting the need for restructuring the taxation system. They have spoken of the burdens of the present taxation system. It is interesting to remind honourable members that really nothing was done during the seven years of the Fraser Government but that the positive moves were made very shortly after the elections of the Hawke Labor Government, first elected to office in March 1983. The tax reform summit as proposed for July will be preceded by widespread community consultations. It will be based on these consultations with individuals and groups throughout the community because the Government is determined in its efforts to produce an equitable and fair system of taxation. It is determined to continue to pursue the tax avoiders and the tax evaders, as it has consistently done in its two years in office. Once again I say that I hOpe that the Demo-rat- in the Senate shed their previous hypocrisy and back the necessary legislatio-. I turn' for a few moments to the problem of unemployment-a problem inherited from the last Government and tackled with significant success by the Hawke Government. Unemployment, a problem accumulated over past years because of poor economic management cannot be quickly and easily eliminated. However, this Government has now established a reputation for sound economicmanagement and has consistently improved the employment opportunities for Australian men and women, young and old alike. That established trend of. .lower unemployment levels will continue, aided by the introduction of several new policy initiatives. for example,the Oovernment proposes shortly tointroduce the new enterprise incentive scheme which was mentioned by the Prime Minister last year in his election policy speech. I have already found a great deal of interest in 'and enthusiasm for this proposal among people in my electorate. This scheme will provide people who have a viable business proposition with continued income support from the Federal Government for up to one year while they establish their own 'small enterprises. An allowance broadly related to the unemployment benefit will be paid to eligible participants. This year the scheme will be run on a pilot ,scheme basis, with approximately 600 people participating. The NElS is a good example of this, Government's effort to pursue every avail""' able avenue to secure long term employment for those people who are, unfortunately, still out of work. Not only will small business receive, a boost, from this scheme, but also the Government will certainly be ,making savings in unemployment benefit payments. The Government iS,also looking at the expansion of the community employment program; moving it into the private sector. This program, whiCh ha& been outstandingly successful in my electorate, has been used to advantage by many community organisations and the, local government in the electorate of Bowman. The Kirby report of the committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs, released last month, has provided much valuable information on labour market programs. The Government has already accepted several recommendations in principle and will use these as the basis for further consultation with other groups and organisations in the' community. The Government is looking at setting up traineeships which will combine work, formal education and training, initially for' youni people. This Government is very much aware of the problems of youth unemployment and recognises that the way to overcome these and associated problems is to provide appropriate education and training for young people. This year, International Youth Year, an Australian youth service is to be developed. It will proVide a focal point for co-ordinating the range of local services for young, people. At present the Government is consulting widely with government bodies and organisations in the community in the non-Government sector to ascertain the most appropriate administrative arrangements for the operation of this service. I understand that one of the most successful decisions of the Government in its first term of office was the introduction of, the extremely popular first home owners assistance scheme, which, was introduced in October 1983. In my electorate of Bowman well over 1,000 applications have been approved under this scheme. The first home owners assistance scheme has helped many young Australians into their first homes. Many of these people would not have been able to afford a home without this type of assistance. It has. been welcomed by all sections of the building industry. Many people I have spoken to who are involved in real estate have clearly shown that they have appreciated it. In fact, over the last 12 months or so it was quite a pleasant experience to move around' the different business centres in the Bowman elector': ate and find that, at last;. real estate agents smiles on their faces. The comment was made cently by a leading project builder who carries a lot of work in the Bowman electorate that first' home owners' assistance scheme was an outstanding success and should continue to rebring ceive support from the building industry and the real estate industry, and there is no doubt that will. ' It has been sai<;l that the scheme was flounderto ing some time ago and that there was a need for the injection of more funds into it. The Govern""' ment moved quickly to bring additional funds into the scheme, and recently allocated a further to the first home owners scheme to meet the crease in approval estimates for this financial year. This will bring the total expenditure this financial year to some $290m. Not only has the next scheme provided many first home owners with the opportunity that had been for so long denied them under the previous Government but also of clude my remarks. course, it has had a spectacular impact on housing and related industries. In less than 18 months this Government has done more directly for the first home buyers than the, previous Government did during its seven years in office. The time in which I can elaborate tonight on the benefits of the first home owners assistance scheme is very limited. I will give just one example of h'bw effective it has been in. regard to the buildingi'ndUstry. The comniunity employwould ment program liKewise has operated'successfully. Again this was introduced by the Government was during its first term to provide relief for the critiMinister cal unemployment situation that· we inherited. The revitalisation of the building industry been so successful that those who previously were able to rely on receiving community employment program funds for worthwhile building projects now find that iUs almost impossible to have a building project approved under the community employment program. The upturn in employment opportunities in the building industry has been successful ,that there is, not unemployed available through the. Commonwealth Employment Service offices-particularly in the various parts of my electorate and generally throughout Australia-Jor the .State committee which apfrom the Senateproved the CEP's even to give serious consideration to applications which are based principally on the. construction of building. I am very pleased to add my support tonight to the remarks of my colleagues who have already spoken in applauding the performance of the Hawke Labor Government during its first term. The clear indications of it continuing down that very effective path towards' producing the conhad; ditions for successful economic recovery in this renation will no doubt proceed under the guidance out of the Prime Minister and other members of the the Hl;lwi<e Labor Government during its second term. The Labor Government has worked hard to about real changes and better conditions for the people of Australia. Its success in the last elecit tion was surely warranted. Despite the hopeful indications by many Opposition speakers in regard the benefi.ts they think are about to accrue to them in the coming months, almost to the point of , thinking that they will automatically win the next election campaign, I am sure that there is a lot of $25m fight and a lot of determination left in this in Government. There is no doubt that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), should he be lucky enough to be returned at the election, will still have the opportunity to sit where he is sitting this evening and to shake his head in various directions, as he is doing as I conDebate (on motion by Dr Watson) adjourned. ·FREEDOM OF INFORMATION",113

FLAGS AMENDMENT' BiLL 1985 Bill received from the Senate,' and read a time.",116
206,Mr NA BROWN,STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC,"I move:' That the Bill be now read a second time. The Flags Act Amendment 'Bill has come from - y the Senate today and it gives honourable members "" , a chance to say that the Australian flag is the sign and sympol of our country and that we want it to remain so. In view of the fact that the Bill has just . ill Membership come to this House, honourable members may ask themselves what precisely does the Bill do. The Mr Bill proposes to do three things: Firstly, it preserves our Australian national flag; secondly, it prevents our flag from being changed except by a referendum; and thirdly, it prevents the Government from advising the Governor General to PRIVILEGES make regulations for a flag other than the AusMembership traliari national flag as the standard for the Commonwealth of Australia. Those are three propMr ositions with which I trustthat this House and every meinber in this House will concur. Above no matter which of those propositions honourable members may look at, it can be said that there is a common theme through each of them, and it is simply that the Australian flag cannot be changed without asking the people whether they want it to be changed. Membership We on this side of the House, and I trust the honourable members on the Government side, bein adlieve that when the people are asked whether they wish to have the Australian national flag changed, Maher be members they will say no. Let me elaborate on this point for a short while, in view of the importance of the matter. The Bill ACCOUNTS will seek to strengthen and reinforce the flag as Membership the symbol and the standard of the Commonwealth of Australia, of the Government and of our nation. The, changes proposed in the' Bill be would not,have been considered except for the manner in which the Government moved last year Mr to replace the national anthem, God Save the Dr Queen, with a new version of Advance Australia Fair. The replacement was effected merely by the gazettal' of the Governor General's Order-in': WORKS Council. This was possible because the anthem is not prescribed by legislation. It is by exercise of 'Membership the prerogative power of the Governor General that the tune to be played at official functions is designated. Of'course; the prerogative is exercised be only upon the advice of the Government. The change generated considerable criticism because of the arbitrary way in which it was effected. I am pleased to see the honourable first member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) here tonight because he was at the forefront of those who condemned the change in our national anthem withSecond Reading' out the people being properly and fully consulted. There was no inkling that a change was imminent, there was no public discussion, and, accordingly, all debate .was precluded. I believe that there is now a growing fear thafihe Government will seek to make a similar ligfl,tning cha-ge. to the Australian flag. Fortunately, the flag is prescribed by the FlagsAct 1953, and the flag designated ali the Australian national flllg can be changed only be legislation. Nevertheless, and this is an importan(point, the Act does allow the Governor General, who, of course, acts. under the advice .of the Government, to appoint such other flags and ensigns of Australia as he thinks fif. The fear is now held by many people that, without consulting the Australian people or the Parliament, the Government will aqvise the Governor General to appoint other flags to replace the Australian national flag for specific national purposes. For instance, a different flag may be appointed as the. flag to be flown at the Olympic Games, at the United Nations, or above government institutions. If sufficient other flags or ensigns are appointed, the Australian national flag might be replaced or undermined as the symbol of our nation. Our flag has a very distinguished history. It has flown over this nation and its people in peacetime and in wartime. It has been displayed when we have had triumphs at the Olympic Games. It has been flown when we have had triumphs on other sporting occasions. It has flown over people's work places, over farms and houses throughout this land, over government offices, and it is freely, readily' and courageously displayed on all occasions when the symbol of our r.ation has to be indicated and demonstrated. We believe that it must be demonstrated. We 'believe that when the people look for a symbol they look to our flag. They do not look to the hammer and sickle, they look to the Australian national flag. We are. proud of that flag and we believe that members of .this House should be given an early opportunity, by passing this Bill, to demonstrate· that they support the flag and do not want it changed. Above all, they want to say, as representatives of the Australian people, with one voice: . 'Do not change our flag without fully consulting the people'. In view of the lateness of the hour, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard,. as I have indicated to the Leader of the House (Mr Young), a statement made by Senator Durack on the history of our flag.

212,Mr SPEAKER,STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC,"Before I call the honourable member for Forde, I remind honourable members that this is his maiden speech and I trust that the House will offer him the usual courtesies. 'DrWATSON (Forde) (1O.08)- MrSpeaker,.1 congratulate you on your election to high office. You can be assured that the authority of the Chair will alwilYs command my utmost respect. His indeed a'great honour for me to stand in what has become known as 'this place' and represent the people of Forde as their first member for the new Federal division of Forde. As honourable members are aware, the electorate of Forde is named in honour of the Right Honourable Francis Michaj:l Forde, who served this place with distinction as the honourable member for Capricornia from 1922 to 1946. When' the Right Honourable John Curtin died in 1945, Frank Forde, as Deputy Prime Minister, was automatically sworn in as Prime Minister. A week later, when the leadership was put to the vote in the Labor Caucus, he was narrowly defeated by the Right Honourable Ben Chifley and thus entered the history books as the shortest serving Prime Minister in Australian history; Frank Forde accepted defeat graciously, a quality which it seems is shared by other Australian Labor Party leaders of Queensland. It is a quality which some of their younger comrades have yet to acquire, but then again it has always been difficult for socialists to accept democracy. My electorat""e of Forde contains a wide crossabout section of constituents from different backbeing grounds. The established parts have a high portion of' older people either nearing their retirement or struggling to come to grips with economic realities of leaving the work force. are concerned at the Government's heavy tax on lump sum superannuation payments, the ever clining buying power of their pensions and the blatant attack on their savings by the assets test. My newer areas are characterised by families children, including many who are first home buyers. They are struggling to repay their home loans and concerned by the likelihood of higher interest rates. They are worried that capital taxes, and wealth taxes will destroy their ability provide for their children. However, far and away the biggest problem in my newer residential is that of unemployment. Since the election I have been approached by numerous people of all ages who simply cannot find jobs. I cio not need to mind the House that this situation is a catalyst social problems such as drug and alcohol abuse, the breakdown of marriages and a general intuition crease in the crime rate. These people are waiting for the Government to honour its commitment of creating jobs for everyone. Of course, jobs cannot be created if there is a lack of 'incentive. This brings me to the third section of my electorate which is concerned with light industry. Many factories and shops have clo&ed, or at least wound down, in recent years. T1;1ey are looking for incentives for investment and for relief from the heavy taxation burden. It is becoming a little passe to note Australia's economic decline, a decline which has been steady for the past 80 years. It has already been noted by numerous economic commentators that Australia has fallen from being a country which before the First World War had the highest per capita income; now it is one of the poorer countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Unfortunately, that slide seems to be accelerating. One could attempt to examine the causes of this decline in a broad analysis, but I believe in the limited time available it is more instructive to examine one sector of the economy in detail. In doing this, I refer to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech and, in particular, to his comments on education and industrial relations. I have chosen to comment on education not only because of my interest and background in that field but also because educational opportunities are a major concern to many of our children and their parents. As the popular Press has noted over the last few weeks, Australian parents are deeply concerned the quality and relevance of the education received by our children. In Queensland prothey are concerned about the reduced opportunity for education beyond the secondary level. the However, an equally important reason for They examining education, particularly tertiaryeducation, in Australia is that one can clearly see the deperverse effects of this Government's interventionist policies and the fallacies underlying that intervention. This topic is also receiving with attention in the media. The malaise which has settled on Australian education, and higher education in particular, has, as' one of its root causes, the abolition of university fees by the Whitlam gains Labor Government. The socialist penchant for to using the education system to redistribute wealth and to change our society in deceptive ways is also areas destroying our education system. Four basic arguments are advanced for total government funding of education. First, it is reargued that education is s,omething special to for which, prima facie, all members of the human race have a moral claim. The second is that free provides educational opportunities to low income groups. The third is that cultural education, although not profitable in market terms, is, nevertheless, somehow desirable. Fourthly, perhaps a rather technical argument is that students will under-invest in education since they ignore the external gains indirectly conferred on other members of society. Given the recent statements by the Minister for Education (Senator Ryan) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) it seems an opportune time to examine the issues involved in the funding of education. In examining these previously mentioned arguments, I intend to draw liberally from excellent papers from my former colleagues, particularly Professors Bob Officer and Michael Porter at Monash University, George Fane and Frank Milne at the Australian National University al1d Armen A1chian of the University of California. Firstly, even if the desirability, of providing everyone with the opportunity of obtaining some minimum level of education is accepted, the case for government rather than market provision of any particular commodity does not follow merely from the fact that everyone has a basic need for that commodity. For example, Government policies currently allow private markets to supply the demand for food, even though the need for minimum subsistence levels for food is more basic than the need for primary education, let alone tertiary education.

213,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.15 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",120
214,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,I require th-t the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. GOVERNOR-GENERAVS SPEECH Address-in-Reply . Debate resumed.,120
215,Dr WATSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the House. Secondiy, the argument that low income groups-that is, poor people-cannot contribute towards a profitable university or college education is deceptive. What is meant by a poor person? All university and college calibre studerits are rich in both monetary and a non-monetary sense. their inherited mental talent, their human capital, is great wealth. The failure of socialists to perceive this inherent wealth reflects ignorance of two economic facts. The first is that inanimate capital goods are not the only forms of wealth. The - ec­ ond fact they ignore is the difference between current earnings and wealth. For exa,mple, a person with untapped oil is wealthy even though he is not marketing his oil. So it is with university students. Even though their current earnings are small, their wealth-the present value of their future earnings-is larger than for the average person. It is this wealth, not the current earnings of the student or his parents' wealth, that is a measure of a student's richness. , There remains one even more s--iously deceptive ambiguity-that between the subsidisation of college education and the provision of educational. opportunity. This is the crux of the question. Educational opportunity i,s provided if any person who can benefit from attending college is en,abled to do so despite the smallness of ,current earnings. An appropriately designed loans and scholarship scheme would ensure equal opportunity for education no matter what the current earnings of the student or of the student's parents. Nothing in the provision of full educational opportunity implies that students who are financed during university should not later repay out of their enhanced earnings those who financed their education-the ordinary taxpayers of Australia. Not to ask for repayment is to grant students a gift of wealth at the expense of those who do not attend college. It is exactly the same as using public moneys for the building of a dam or a road for use primarily by a few individuals. The third argument relates to the proposition that a cultural education will enhance a student's general welfare even though it will not add to his future earnings. A person's welfare is increased if he gets more food, more housing, more recreation or perhaps even more beer. An efficient form of aid, as judged by the recipient, would be a grant of money to be spent as the recipient deems appropriate. It would indeed be interesting to see whether students ""(ould devote such a lump sum grant to education or to other investments if they were given a free choice. Subsidised cultural education, instead' of money gifts, could be justified only if the giver knows better than the recipient what is good for the recipient. This is, of course, the typical position adopted by socialists not merely with respect to educational choices but for most welfare choices. While the socialists of the Australian Labor Party - eadily accept this form of intellectual snobbery, it is a leap of faith I am una willing to make as orie who values and reSpects the sovereignty of the individual. The final argument advanced for free tuition is that there are social gains-in economic jargon, positive external effects-from' education. However, before external effects can serve as a valid basis for more education two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, there must be some net social gain unheeded by the student. For example, the ability to read reduces danger and inconvenience to other people. That is an example of a positive external effect. Perhaps economic education would prevent the passage of socially detrimental legislation, although with the present Government this possibility seems remote. While this argument ,is probably valid at the primary school level of education, it is doubtful that this justification continues at higher levels. Secondly, at the university level' there must be available' further incremental net social gains from further education. Simply because there may be net external gains from education, because of the large social gains from elemerttary education, it is not !\ufficient to conclude that total government funding of university or college education is warranted. However, - he, issue of free tuition is not limited to the qllestion of access to university edu.cation. The movement from fee paying recipients oJ - du­ cation to oneof government funding has a critical impact on the incentives faced by the un'iversities and the colleges. This, combined with the system of tenure operating in universities and the bureaucratic and centraliseo wage fixation system and resource allocation system, explains many of the inefficiencies and rigidities in Australian universities. Importantly, it has had a distorting effect on the provision of or, in an economic sense, the production of university courses. The distortion which the Whitlam socialist Government began can clearly be seen in an analysis of enrolments in tertiary institutions in various countries. For example, in engineering and related scientific courses, Australia has a much lower percentage of students than any of our major competitors. However, in courses concerned with humanities, religion and theology, we have a much higher. percentage of students than our major competitors. This distortion in our allocation of educational resources exacerbates the problems arising from relatively low participation rates in Australia for education past Year 10. The fault clearly lies in the mechanism for distributing education resources in Australia. If Australia is to be technologically. competitive in the future, our current resource allocation process must be eliminated and replaced by a mechanism which is responsive to the education demands of potential students. Given the total level of government spending on universities and colleges, there are serious problems in deciding how the money should be divided between and within such institutions. Taken as a whole, the process is complex and unwieldy. The market demand coming from the consumer, both current and, very importantly, potential students, by its very nature, is muted. The demand from various pressure groups within academia and the Government is greatly exaggerated. In the 1970s, for exampl-, the opening or expansion of universities and colleges replaced dam building as enticements to marginal electorates. The consequences flowing from unnecessary dams or colleges were equally disastrous in wasting taxpayers' money. Certain of these institutions should never have been opened because, even with our heavily subsidised educational system, they attract relatively small numbers of students, and then invariably in the wrong areas. We are presently seeing these mistakes repeated in the Northern Territory and, I am sure, they will be repeated in other parts of Australia in the future. If we are to provide tertiary education to more Australians in an efficient way, further rationalisation of Australia's education system needs to take place. Australian tertiary institutions are too small to take advantage of economies of scale in some disciplines. In Queensland it is obvious that the Queensland Institute of Technology and the University of Queensland should be encouraged to expand significantly if tertiary education is. to be provided in disciplines where it is needed and yet still provide it at a reasonable cost. The final point I wish to address is the incentive for individual academics. In a government funded institution, the relationship between lecturing performance and reward is tenuous. Consequently, the incentive to teach well is greatly reduced. It is hardly surprising that students complain of poor teaching in these institutions. While this is important for individual universities, the centralised wage fixation process has an even more detrimental effect on the production of education. Because salaries are set by the Academic Salaries Tribunal and do not reflect market demand,we see a distortion in the demand for academics and Australia's ability to supply certain educational courses. For example, in areas such as accounting and finance, where good staff can earn significantly greater salaries in outside practice or in United States and European universities, we face a significant shortage Australia-wide. The permanent loss overseas of Australians qualified to teach and to do research in these areas means a reduction in the education opportunity available to all Australians. However, in other disciplines the reverse is true. Consequently, we see postgraduate students undertake socially wasteful further studies as the academic requirements are raised to ration the few subsidised positions available. Mr Speaker, it would be improper to leave this subject without referring to the gains to all Australians of returning to a more efficient tertiary education system. There are two distinct advantages. The first would accrue to those young Australians who are presently being denied the opportunity to pursue their preferred career because of the arbitrary nature or, quotas based upon some mythical high school entrance score. Many parents in my electorate have dreams for their children's future. They are conGerned that those dreams will not be realised, not through the absence of ability or desire to succeed on the part of their children, but rather because of arbitrary quotas forced on tertiary institutions by a socialist government. For them a return to a more rational system of educational funding will be applauded. A second advantage will accrue to all Australian taxpayers. A market based system will increase the productivity of educational resources, thereby increasing the availability of education. It will free up education funds and further reduce the taxation burden. There will be a further reduction in taxation through the elimination of bureaucratic mechanisms presently used for the distribution of funds. We should also encourage Australians to invest in their own education by providing them with appropriate taxation incentives. They will find this to be the best investment in life. Australia can no longer afford the .educational system of this country to· be held hostag- to a warped socialist ideology. Australia's fiJture lies with the generation presently at school. They deserve an effective educational system which truly promotes equal opportunity for all. This issue is vital to all Australians, whether they live in my electqrate of Forde or in any other electorate. I hope that all honourable members in the future will give due consideration to my comments. Finally, I thank those honourable members in the House for their attentiveness during my address and particularly for granting me the time to complete it.

216,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I would be failing in my duty as a loyal Australian and a member of this Parliament who is not ashamed to call himself a patriot if tonight I did not draw to the attention of this honourable House the enormous damage which has been done to, Australia's international reputation by the Hawke socialist Government; Since the Thirty-fourth Parliament commenced last week we have had all sorts (If explanations and excuses proferred by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Government of fourth graders and fifth columnists over the ANZUS Treaty tragedy. The headlines of the. United States of America Press are eloquent testimony as to what our major ally now thinks about us. I quote them verbatim. The first is 'Australia balks on accord to aid in US. test of MX'. That appeared on the front page of the New York Times· of 7 February this yeat and was read by millions of our allies as the story was syndicated nationwide. What does 'balk' mean? According to the Oxford Dictionary it means 'to avoid a duty', 'to disappoint', 'to frustrate'. Is that the action of a faithful and loyal ally? Then there is this headline: 'Premier cites split in party', under which appeared these lines: Australia's Prime Minister said today that he had told the United States that because of a revolt in his own Party he would probably hlive to renege on a pledge. In those words this discredited Prime Minister admitted to the people of the United States that he was the shackled prisoner of .the procommunist Left, the most dangerous and sinister element in Australian politics today. I, as an Australian, felt ashamed when I read that report and that shame which I felt was shared by millions of my fellow Australians. The rest of the headlines spdl out in graphic terms the disgraceful and shameless backdown of a Prime Minister who put party factional interests ahead of the national interest. . To get a world perspective of how, others see Australia's actions I turn to the Soviet Union.

False credit is being taken and money on the signs is ' being wasted. I believe it could have better been used on safety signs or some sort of supportive road safety projed. There seems to be no end to lengths to which the Bjelke-Petersen Governwill go in advancing'its own political ends., It I has now produced thousands oJ brochures prothe development of this road, again a road that it is not even paying for. It is not the first time that the National Party Government in Queensland has 'done it. Some time ago a special of the grant of$20m was given for roads in north I Queensland. It was never used in the north. There no record of the money being used on roads at to all. I suspect that the money was used on the in metropolitan electrification scheme in Brisbane. That 'claim has n'ever been denied and there has never been any detail as to how the money was I believe that the time has come for this Government 'to think very carefully about the funding and particularly the allocations to reQueensland for roads. Every time local author-­ ties go to the State Government the, excuse IS that the ,Commonwealth is not giving any money to the State. It says all the time that it cannot build the,roads because there is no money forthcoming froin this national Parliament. I need to restate the comments made by the Minister yesterday when he pointed out that for I 1984-85 $270m has been given to Queensland by .of the the Hawke Labor Government. In fact the that Hawke Labor Government is paying 62 per cent road expenditure in the State. Yet we see the ItS inadeqtiacyof the roads around Queensland. In my electorate there is a desperate need for money of to be spent on what we call the grain roads. The I am Mt Morgan range is dangerous. The Yeppoon fact, in tourist road is a disgrace. The Dingoa Middlemount road ishazardous to life. I believe it of is totally wrong and immoral for a State government to take moneys from a road like that and spend them on.a road servicing Bjelke-Petersen's son. There is a need to rethink road funding allocations for Queensland and I suggest that thought be given to making the money directly available to authorities, to give the local authorities a ,say in where the priorities ought to be. Councillor Jim Turner of the Belyando Shire Council, and of other grain road councils, have prepared an excelinexlent 'submission. They know where the money ought to be spent. But the State is spending it where it wants to. It spends the money in National electorates.:There is clearly a need to give the local authorities a say, to allow them to determine where the local roads allocation ought to be spent and to allow them to have some say as to '!hospita:l , where money for arterial roads ought t6 be spent. '/ 'me'as it worries those cdmmunities. I suggest to honourable members that there is some value in .this. It would give new status to , local authorities. It would decentralise decision making. It would guarantee that the country and provincial roads of Queensland would be catered for. It would be more in keeping with what we s,ee as a partnership role ,between the three levels government. It certainly would end the abuse. by , the Queensland State Government. There are 134 shire councils and councils funds-funds that are being withheld by the State Government regardless of the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars are being, given by this national Parliament. There is a desperate and urgent need for the Government to review its present approach to the Queensland lump Government-and I urge it to do so-and give treatment. funding for roads directly to the local authorities.",123
222,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr MCGAURAN ,(Gippsland) (10.37)-lt is now some 12 months since the introduction Medicare and I believe it is, appropriate once again in .this Parliament to review its operations. In summary, the effect of Medicare has been squeeze out the, private enterprise dollar from medical services in this country, which has meant that the total amount of funding available for health services has decreased substantially. That means that services have to be curtailed and people will be squeezed,oui of the provision health services. Who then has the Government chosen as the sacrificiiil lamb? CO,llectively, country people. ' I will put before the House three examples of how Medicare severely disadvantages my constituents in Gippsland and all country people, especially in Victoria. Firstly, with regard to bush nursing hospitals, already the Toora private bush nursing hospital within my electorate has closed. Two others at Mirboo North and Heyfield are encountering severe budgetary difficulties and are in danger of closing down. These are not private hospitals as such; they are community-owned hospitals which service relatively isolated communities. Consequently, those people are being deprived of a hospital service close to their community. For the purpose of this argument, leaving aside the employment opportunities, it means those people in those communities in South Gippsland, Mirboo North and across the Strzlecki Ranges and Heyfield in East Gippsland must . travel relatively.long distances to visit relatives as well as to be hqspitalised. That worries ',' ,Secondly, we have a shortage of Medicare ,officers throughout country areas. Again, this deprives country people of their entitlement, given that thllY pay a one per cent levy on their income by way of taxation,as does every other taxpayer in Australia. Again, this Government has failed to of take into account the distances that must be travelled in the, country. It.has also. failed to take into account the disparity in and shortage of public desperately in need of t-ansport. The third example I wish to' put before the House is one that the Minister for Health (Dr aIewett) failed to correct despite representations that wllre made to him. I refer to cases in which a visiting specialist toa country hospital is given a sum payment which includes' after-care But, of course, the specialist returns to the city leaving the after-care the responsibility of the local general practitioner. Under the Medicare arrangements the general practitioner is not allowed to share in the fee given to the specialist. The Australian Medical Association has of advised me that at present fee splitting is unethical although, admittedly, it is looking at the situation. Why must the patient pay again for to after-care when Medicare is supposed to have taken care of that aspect of his treatment already? In conclusion, Medicare has r-suliec\ in trem-n­ do us suffering and has accentuated the difficulties of medical services in country areas. Those diffi'cui ties already existed and were unacceptable. of Public hospitals in country areas have the Same problems as do public hospitals in metropolitan it is areas. Country hospitals are overcrowded because people will not pay extra insurance on top of the one per cent levy to attend private hospitals. This problem is further accentuated by the closing of private bush nursing hospitals, which has resulted from the callous exercise of governmental power and, in some cases, ministerial discretion.

225,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"1I have been that asked to comment on a matter that was raised in the House today by my colleague the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). The honourable member drew 'attention to. the Cain in Government's 10 year development plan. 1 would like to say something about that plan becijijse lieve it to be a bold initiative which, has shqwn that the Government of Victoria is prepared to lay itself open, to be accountable in terms of development of that State. It is a move which think has been both positive and very ,well responded to. Under the Cain Government, for the first time the business sector, the trade union sector and the community at large have a plan a blueprint upon which they can base their ness decisions, lifestyles and projections for development of Victoria. I want to compare the Cain Government being record in this respect with that of its predecessor, the Liberal-National Party coalition in Victoria. Under it there was a period of stagnation. There were no plans and no future projections-just maps on tables and walls of projects that did not come to fruition. I also want to draw attention to the announcefrom mentyesterday' by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) the admission of new banks into Australia. The Victorian development plan has ,also played role in attracting these banks to Australia and the components of them that will be making their way to Victoria. It is evident from commitments given to the Treasurer as a result of the entry of banks that new jobs will be created in Victoria. Large scale building works will be undertaken these banks open substantial offices in prime in the central business district and there will competition. In the area from which I come-the area of non-bank financial intermediaries-I less know that the opening up of competition will be welcomel;! because prqvisions have been made in the conditions laid down by the Government ensure that those non-bank financial interpast mediaries have available to them the benefits true competition within the banking sector. I return to the initiative of the' Victorian Government in establishing a 10 year development plan which has provided the business sector and those in the community who are looking to planning their future with a blueprint from which they can make their projections and on which they can positively come to Victoria. I am sure , that that development plan and the initiative it represents is Ii. move that will be followed by other States as they see the advantages arid the results that will flow to Victoria from that.",124
226,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight in response to the address by the honourable member, for Capricornia (Mr have Wright), who seems to be treating this House coward's castle from which, from as far south Canberra, he cap make allegations that he is Ibeprepared to make in Queensland. He comes to us ,as a, rather discredited .f,ormer Leader of.the Opposition in Qlleensland' to continue his attack on the the Queensland Premier from this point further I south. He has' not fooled anyone with the complaints he has raised. In fact,,1 understand the same principle applies; in the other States as applies in Queensland. With respect to the bicenand tennial road development program, and the busiupgrading of Queensland roads, he did not say the that an equally expensive sign to that of the Queensland Government indiCates that work is carried out as part of the bicentennial road development program. Over nine years I, have found that State governments every"",here try to claim credit for themselves. However, they do not fool anyone. In the nine years I have represented the seat of Dawson I have found that the person in the street and the person travelling on the roads is very well aware of where the money comes and who is to be blamed for a lack of it. In of my period of representation I have had no great-r difficu1ty then that of trying to gain support for its the allocation of additional funds. I explain 'to any honourable member who is not familiar with the Queensland road situation that foreign Queensland, ,with the exception of Western Australia, has the longest roads to service and the as greatest climatic variations qf any State. I wish sites that the honourable member for Capricornia be would join me, when the new road Act comes into operation at the end of June, in arguing not for funds, as he treasonably did in his speech, but also for more funds for Queensland in recognition of the fact that we have such long stretches of roads to and varying climatic conditions, because in the we have not received a fair proportion of the of funds, for roads. The - onourable member for Capricornia might also \lsk his Government why if the bicentennial road development program has been so successful, the indexed value of the 2c a litre levy fuel has, been placed in Consolidated Revenue and not used for roads. The need for additional funds for roads exists not only in Qileensiand but all over Australia. The honourable member might find on calculation that $500,000 will be taken from motorists all over Australia through the indexed levy but will not be used for roads, which the honourable member and I agree are' desperately in need of that extra fund. ' ing. Instead, it will go to Consolidated Revenue. The honourable member for Capricornia mig4t found it of more interest to his constituents as a had he, asked what the Minister for Health (Dr as Blewett) was doing about the categorisation of not private hospitals. ,I understand that the Mater 'Misericordiae Hospitals in his city will suffer duction in funding from the categorisation, just , the Mater Misericordiae Hospitals in Mackay suffer a loss' of $lm. These hospitals will funds merely because they will be reclassified from group 1 to group 3. Why is the honourable member fot Capricornia not making a point this House about that matter, which vitally his constituents? ' Mr Wright-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. It ought to be made known to the House that such meetings have been held with the, vate hospitals in Brisbane and the honoura-le member for Dawson has not even bothered come to them.",125
227,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Capricornia should have observed my previous warning to members.,126
228,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I do not as have to lell you the reputation of the' speaks from his own mouth-as' far as his ignorover ance is concerned. Of the private hospitals in Queensland, 14 will suffer a reduction in funding. The private hospitals system feels that this the first step down the road towards nationalising the hospital system in Queensland. I say that , cause the one hospital for which I can speak authority will lose $lm, which means that natal care, post-natal care, intensive care nurses' training will be wiped out. This tal that has recently undertaken a $6m expansion in order to give the people of Mackay and the gion the type of hospital service they want choice so far as the publie system is concerned.",126
229,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,",--,Order! The honourable, member's time has expired.",126
230,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier this evening we heard in this place a speech that I can ! describe only as disgtace(ul. During the time. I have been a member of the Parliament a trend has developed whereby' on occasions some honourThat able members have had scant regard for the facts, 'and sometimes the whole truth, in parts of speeches. The speech to which I refer was earlier this evening by the honourable member Denison (Mr Hodgman); It was interesting'to "" note that the honourable member came into this ',House with a lot of 'gusto, looking rather ruddy-faced. Mr Hand-Perhaps he was having a party.",126
231,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"He was probably having party downstairs. One wonders why he was such an up-tempo mood. I wish to bring to the notice of the Parliament the so-called facts that were not facts which the honourable member a reDrought before the House. He talked about the as t1nited States alliance and'how it was in disarray will aI1d'falling apart, about how the Prime Minister lose (Mr Hawke}'had'riot done this and that and was a disgrace to the country in Australia's eyes. According to him, the whole w-rld was going down. in We were all heading downhill so fast that it was affects not funny. According to the honourable member , all of this was out of communist magazine, a Moscow magazine. I must admit that I wonder how he reads it. He is supposedly the most reactionary primember of the Parliament, yet he is the' only member of the Parliament who can quote all the to material that comes out of Moscow. I wonder, if we, waited outside the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Soci,alistRepllblics, how many times we would actually see him going in and out. Be that as it,may, the facts are that the United States alliance, the ANZUS alliance, is as strong ever. In fact, it is stronger than ever because of man-he commitments the Hawke Government has made a whole 'range of issue-, including the porting situation, the joint facilities, and the independent opillions that, h-vebeen put forward by this is just Government in discl1ssions with our American friends from time to time. I say that the allianc,e is bestronger because at least row the United States of with America respects Australia and this country is preputting forward an independent viewpoint, and whether we agree or disagree. There are times isa hospiwhen we disagree '!Vith the Americans. The Americans now realise that we are not a country rethat is totally sycophantic tp the Americans, as and a was the case during the last three decades when '_ we had almost conseclltive conservative governments such as the 'All the way with L.B.J.' corps we saw in the 19,60s, when we all marched off to Vietnam.' ' Mr Hand-They sent everybody else off to do their rotten fighting.",126
232,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"That is absolutely correct. situation has continued for many years. I am a strong supporter, of the ANZUS alliance, as is their the Hawke Government. ,There are plenty of made , examples tq prove thatpoint. We may from time for 'to time disagree with the United States of America; I am. S1.!re that will occur in the future. If there is, to be a respectable and strong relation&hip, whether between countries or between individuals, each should have respect for the other's opinion. I believe that that is occurring within the ANZUS alliance at present. I disagree with New a 'Zealand's position. So does the Government. in that has been, made plain. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said that. The situation is really that diplomacy, I think, should be explored a little 'more by the Americans and the New'Zealanders, at least in the short term. 1I have raised those ¥Olllments to put the position of this Government very firmly as against the absolute lunacy that was put to the House by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) earlier this evening in an outrageous speech that did not do this Parliament any good or any honour.",126
233,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to defend some of the most vulnerable members of my electorate, the senior citizens of my electorate, who not only are under attack from the point of view of the assets test but also currently-believe it or not in Australia-are quite literally under attack because the very homes in which they live are in danger of being blown out of the beachside area in which they are located. The senior citizens to whom 1 refer live at two little hamlets called Port Parham and Webb Beach. Honourable members may well be forgiven if they know not where Port Parham and Webb Beach are. 1 hope that they will forgive me if 1 spend just 30 seconds in a brief geography lesson. Honourable members will be familiar with South Australia and with St Vincents Gulf on which the city of Adelaide is located. At the top of St Vincents Gulf is Port Wakefield, which, of course, is at the heart of the electorate of Wakefield. Just south of Port Wakefield there is an Army proof and experimental range which has been located there since 1920. As a result of that proof and experimental range having been used wisely to test rounds of ammunition and shells for the Army during the Second World War, all the beaches from Port Wakefield for 30 kilometres south are now polluted with Army shells. Those beaches are not accessible. They cannot be used by South Australians as recreation beaches. South Australians accept this as part of the price they pay for defending the nation. The proposal currently before the residents of Port Wakefield and the residents of these two hamlets, Port Parham and Webb Beach, just beyond the proof range, is to extend the proof range so that Port Parham and Webb Beach also will be shelled by the testing from Port Wakefield. The patriotic citizens of South Australia accept this reluctantly in the interests of the nation's defence. However, the reality is that for three years the people of Port Parham and Webb Beach have not known whether they will be bought out or blown out of the water. Mr Hand--That is a bit rough.",127
234,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"Precisely. 1 thank the honourable member for Melbournefor his sympathy. In spite of the fact that on becoming a member of this House I not only inherited this problem but also alerted the then Minister for Defence to it, 1I have had no reaction from him. Let me be fair. Mr Hand-What did the previous Governmentdo?",127
235,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,Members of the previous Government were in the process of making a decision when I inherited this problem two years ago. Mr Hand-And they are still trying to make up their minds.,127
236,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"Precisely. It is perfectly fair to interject that it took the Fraser Government one year to make a decision. I accept that delay. However, it has taken this Government two years to announce nothing at all. In those 2 years the very senior citizens whom the Government claims to be most sensitive towards have been left not knowing whether there is a future in the communities in which they live. In April 1984, almost twelve months ago, under pressure from the South Australian Government and, may I modestly say, the member for Wakefield, the former Minister for Defence said: 'Oh, dear me. Tut, tut. I do not know what we will do so we will have an environmental impact statement.'",127
237,Mr HOWE,ADJOURNMENT,A very wise decision.,127
238,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"A wise decision, to be sure. But in fact we are still waiting on the outcome of that EIS. That is why I am speaking tonight. We were promised that in November 1984 that announcement would be made. Come November the answer was: 'We are caught up in an election. This is no time for making announcemel1ts. Wait until January'. Patiently my constituents and I waited until January. The answer then was: 'No, there is a change of Minister now. We will have to brief the new Minister. Wait until March'. March is tomorrow. How much longer will I and the residents of Port Parham and Webb Beach be waiting for that decision? These are senior citizens who have retired there and invested their life savings in these two hamlets. They know not whether to paint their houses or to sell them. They do not know whether they have any future at all. It is the indolence of this Government that is causing them their present suffering.",127
239,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 March. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m. until Tuesday, 19 March at 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.",127
