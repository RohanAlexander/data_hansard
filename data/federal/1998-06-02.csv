3,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen the comment by the chair of his nonrecommending backbench tax committee, Senator Gibson, that there would be 'a lot of problems' with a switch to a GST? Is this the kind of advice",13

7,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If they were not heckling me,13
8,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ignore them. The Leader of the Opposition has been in this place long enough to know that there is no need to respond to interjections from the other side in that way. Members of the opposition will remain silent, as will the members of the government.",13
9,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is Senator Gibson's comment that there would be 'a lot of problems' with a switch to a GST the kind of advice that the government does not want to hear and the reason why your Treasurer gagged the committee? Will the Prime Minister release the Gibson report so that the public can learn what the many problems with the GST are, or will the Prime Minister allow this report to become like Peter Reith's 1992 Cole committee report, which the coalition has never ever released because it highlighted a lot of problems with the GST?",13
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the entirety of what Senator Gibson has said, so I will not make a comment on what the Leader of the Opposition selects from what he said. However, I had a lengthy discussion last night with Senator GibsonMr Martin-I bet you did.",13
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, and it was a very illuminating. I am very happy to say that, unlike those who sit opposite, my backbench is full of men and women who are interested in tax reform. I think the Gibson committeeI am very pleased to call this task force the Gibson committee-went around Australia and listened and consulted, and the Gibson committee had quite a lot of advice that they wanted to pass on to the Treasurer and me last night. All I can say is that the process of tax reform has been greatly aided by the deliberations of the Gibson committee. There was one piece of advice that I can assure you we did not receive from the Gibson committee last night, and that is that we were not told that it would be madness to implement the promises you make to the Australian people. I would not be surprised if this got a run later in question time, but I was very interested in what I heard when I turned on my radio, like, might I disclose, a dutiful ABC Radio National listener. After a long walk in the crisp Canberra mornings I go back and I turn on ABC Radio National. I heard Fran Kelly interviewing the Leader of the Opposition. She was taking him through his paces and saying, 'What about 1993, Mr Beazley? What about l-a-w, law? What about those promises that you dishonoured when you went to the Australian people?' Do you know what he said? He said, 'Well, actually, we did not dishonour them. You know, it would have been madness to do what we promised. It would have been absolute madness to do what we promised.' One piece of advice that I did not get from the Gibson committee is that it would be madness to implement your election undertakings. The truth is that ours will be implemented, as you will find out in the days and the weeks and the months ahead. Taxation",13
12,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, has the government established a track record of delivering on its tax commitments?",14
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lilley for a magnificently astute and perspicacious question, if I may say so myself. I remind the House that the public response to the budget brought down by the Treasurer three weeks ago has been in recent times exceeded in its positive effect only by the public response to the first budget the Treasurer brought down in 1996. One of the reasons why the public has responded in such an enthusiastic and endorsing fashion to the Treasurer's budget is that for the third time a row he was not announcing any increases in personal tax, sales tax, excise duty or company tax. In other words, it was three in a row with no tax increases. That honours the commitment that I made to the Australian public before the last election. I said we were not going to increase taxes and we have not increased taxes. Mr Crean-You said never ever to a GST.",14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham will remain silent.,14
15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We said we were not going to increase the income tax, the sales tax or the company tax and we have kept the promise. It goes further than that. Before the last election, as all my colleagues behind me will remember, we made a number of quite explicit tax commitments. The first one was that we would deliver a $1 billion family tax initiative, and I am very happy to say that that initiative was delivered in full, on time and without any deduction. The families of Australia, particularly those on modest incomes, are grateful for the $1 billion of extra spending power they now have. When you add to that extra spending power the extra spending power they get through the lowest interest rates in 30 years, it means that Australian families with mortgages are better off than they have been for 30 or 40 years. Not only has their interest rate come down and not only are prices stable, but they have also had the benefit of the $1 billion family tax initiative. They well know that the biggest risk posed by a change of government is that their interest rate falls would be taken away and that, under a Labor government, interest rates would start going up again. Labor's biggest risk is to the present low level of interest rates. The second commitment we made was that we would cut the provisional tax uplift factor. We have in fact gone further in that area than what we promised. We promised to reduce it only to the tune of about $160 million. We have, as a result of the Treasurer's last budget, given provisional tax relief in relation to the uplift factor of $250 million. That feeds straight into the pockets of small business people and provisional taxpayers, including in many self-funded retirees, all around Australia. We also promised that we would introduce a tax rebate for private health insurance. This is the tax rebate that the member for Dobell would like to get rid of. This is the tax rebate that he says is no good. If he thinks it is no good, presumably he wants to get rid of it. The undeniable fact is that, without that tax rebate, private health insurance premiums in Australia would be much higher and more costly than they otherwise are. Whatever the opposition may say, their plan to get rid of that tax rebate will push up private health insurance premiums even higher. We also promised to reduce the tax burden on self-funded retirees. We promised to give them the same income tax threshold as pensioners at equivalent levels of income. We have delivered that commitment in full. I am happy to say to the people of Australia that we have honoured the general commitment we made to keep tax down. We have honoured the specific commitments we made to cut tax and, in one or two areas, we have gone much further than we originally promised. That is a record of which my government can be immensely proud. That is a record that is in stark contrast to what happened when the Labor party was last elected. They went to the election campaigning against a goods and services tax and, as Neil Warren has pointed out, when they sneaked back into office they introduced their own version of a goods and services tax and, to add insult to injury, they did not include any compensation for low income earners. Their record stands in a very pale and poor light against the record of our tax commitments which have been fully implemented and honoured in full. Current Account Deficit",14
16,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Do you recall, when you launched the coalition debt truck before the last election, saying that first priority was the current account deficit and that you had a plan to tackle it? What is the state of that plan in the light of today' s balance of payments figures showing a massive blow-out in the current account deficit to $7.5 billion-the worse ever quarterly deterioration in the current account on record-and our foreign debt blown out by over $30 billion since you have been in office, to an all-time record high of $224 billion? And all of this before the full effect of Asia has hit us. Don't today's figures make a total writeoff of your debt truck and isn't your deficit reduction plan just another one that you have never ever had?",15
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question is no, it does not. Could I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the circumstances of our current account at the present time and the responses to that situation are very different from what obtained in the middle 1980s when the highest levels, so far as our current account deficit is concerned, were recorded. I am very interested that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has changed his language since his press conference. At his press conference, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying that this was the worse quarter on record. When he discovered that that was wrong and that in fact it was in 1995-when his leader was the Minister for Finance-he politically adjusted it to be the worse deterioration. One of the reasons we took the action we did to repair the budget deficit, one of the reasons we have a mediumand long-term strategy to reduce debt in this country-which the Labor party does not have-and one of the reasons why the Labor Party was utterly irresponsible in trying to stop our attempts to repair the Australian budget deficit is that a stable budget position is one of the best responses to any weakening of the current account deficit. The weakening of the current account deficit has been dealt with quite comprehensively in the budget papers, and any examination of the budget papers will demonstrate that the strength of the government monetary policy and fiscal policy and our commitment to taxation reform demonstrate that we have the policy responses for a your deterioration which is overwhelmingly due, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows, to the circumstances that are occurring in our part of the world. I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that if a current account deficit of the amount that you have referred to were responded to with the sort of policies that you have advocated over the last 2% years, it would indeed 100m as a very serious threat to the stability and security of the Australian economy. Election Promises",15
18,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports suggesting that it is acceptable for a political party to break tax promises on the basis that to implement them would be 'an act of pure madness'? Have there been any Australian governments that have followed this practice? Does this government follow this practice?,15
19,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question because this morning, as I was listening to ABC radio",16
20,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,16
21,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not something that I do all that often. We heard one of those moments that lightens the heart of every politician. We heard the Leader of the Opposition expounding a new doctrine in relation to tax credibility. He was asked whether he had a credibility problem by Fran Kelly. She asked: Do you have a credibility problem though, I mean, given the actions of Labor in 1993, when you jacked up a whole raft of wholesale sales taxes? Beazley: Well, we'll find out and I would dispute your analysis. 1 mean, that's Liberal propaganda that says that. Apparently we made up the fact that the wholesale sales tax went from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. We made it up. We made up the fact that the 20 per cent rate went to 22 per cent. We apparently made it up that the 30 per cent went to 32 per cent. All of those businesses have been out there paying wholesale sales tax when they never needed to, I suppose, when the law never said they had to-and I suppose the Australian Labor Party is now going to give them all refunds. They have been paying under Liberal propaganda. He went on and he said: Keating went into the 1993 election and said he would not increase the total tax take. Well, he did.",16
22,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He did not.,16
23,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He did: What I am promising is not to put up tax.,16
24,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I did not.",16
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.,16
26,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We remember so well that Keating went into the 1993 election campaign with income tax cuts. They were not a promise, he said, they were l-a-w. Government members-Law!",16
27,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They were l-a-w. What happened? Let us just recall.,16
28,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,16
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham! The member for Corio! The member for Hotham will remain silent. The member for Prospect! Mrs Crosio interjecting,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Prospect!,16
31,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, they always shout loudest when they like the message least. Let's remember what happened: So the second point I'd sayan that is, yes, we delivered half the income tax cuts we said we were, and then we were faced with the consequenceslisten to thisthat to deliver the second half would have been an act of pure madness. So, in other words, if you make a mad promise, you are entitled to break it. So I say this to the gallery: when the Labor Party makes a tax promise in the next election, your question to Mr Beazley must be: Is this a mad promise or not? If it is a mad promise, he does not have to deliver. The interesting thing is: do you test the promise for madness or the maker of the promise for madness? If you test the maker of the promise for madness, he has got the whole game covered! He does not have to keep to any of his promises! Then he went on and said this: So we didn't deliver because it would have been an act of pure madness. So the way in which delivered the second halflisten to thisand we did deliver it, was to say, 'Okay, instead of getting it as a tax cut, you'll get it as a savings break.",16
32,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, it is a savings break.",16
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is the bit that you want me to read. Just explain this to me: what year did you get that savings break again? What year did you get that? Was it in 1992?,16
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer will address his questions through the chair, if he must ask them.",16
35,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Was it in 1993? Was it in 1994? Was it in 1995? Was it in 1996? Was it in 1997? They had a policy to deliver that in the year 2000-a three per cent delivelY in the year 2000, which was convenient. You could not trust them on their income tax promise from before the election until after the election. So what he said is, 'Even we didn't deliver that one, just you wait another six years. You can believe us in another six years. ' You could not believe these people for six days, let alone six years! This is an opposition which has form on tax. dumping? When it says, 'We intend to cut income tax rates without a GST,' people of Australia remember this: you have heard heard it before the 1993 election",16

37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills tinuing will remain silent. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting,17
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for as Wills!,17
39,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,After the 1993 election it meant that $3V2 billion worth of income taxes were taken away. Three billion dollars of new indirect taxes were imposed. Do worry about saying the Labor Party did have credibility. It was not suffering from lack of credibility; it was suffering from act of pure madness. Burnie Pulp Mill,17
40,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Indushave try, Science and Tourism. Has the minister seen reports of the imminent closure of the Burnie pulp mill, with the loss of 150 local jobs? Does the minister recall a report in the Burnie Advocate on 30 January describing his visit to the Burnie pulp mill in relation anti-dumping? I quote the report: Mr Truss said he did not believe the mills were near closing. If and when they were, his only commitment was that the government would look places. at the situation 'in the light of events at that time' . Minister, when did you learn of the closure the mill? How much comfort will the 150 workers and their families take from knowing that you now plan to look into the situation, having done nothing in four months? Isn't this the same as Black Jack's response to Newcastle closure: do nothing?",17
41,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Naturally, all members in the House will be disappointed to hear reports that there is a possibility that the pulp mill at Burnie could close. I am particularly disapthough pointed and amazed that the member for for Hotham could stand in this House and point an accusing finger at this side of the House, at the government, for this particular response.",17
42,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What have you done about,17
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison it before. You will remain silent!,17
44,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The situation clearly is that this government has acted regarding matters of concern to Amcor in relation to the conoperation of the paper industry. We have introduced into the House of Representatives-and it has passed through the House, you know-a massive reform of Australia's a-ti-dumping and countervailing duty mechamsms. Mr Crean-Too late!",17
45,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Too late,' he says. Who put not the measures in place? The member for not Hotham has been vocal in criticising a Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing an duty mechanisms-and rightly so-but he and his government put them in place. For eight years Amcor and, indeed, other Australian industries suffered under the incompetent measures that Labor had put in place. We moved to reform those measures and the company has welcomed that response. As regards the situation at the paper mill at Burnie, the member for Braddon has been very active in putting forward the concerns of the local industry and addressing the issues of to concern. Everyone is aware of the fact that the mill is old and that the company was anxious, having spent some considerable money on investments there and in other But let us look at the core of the problem. of Many of the problems of that plant and indeed other manufacturing industries in Australia can fairly go back to the industrial relations practices of the Labor governmcnttheir failure to provide the kind of environthe ment in which business could invest and expand with confidence.",17
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are the most cooperative work force we have ever had.,17
47,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, but only after you left government. It has to be said that over the last couple of years the union has worked with management to try to improve work practices and to get some of the rorts that were put in place and remained in place under a Labor government out of the system. Mr Crean-Oh, rubbish!",18
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham will remain silent.,18
49,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Indeed some of the things that were going on in that plant made the MUA look like a work gang. Mr Crean interjecting,18
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham.,18
51,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And the President of the ACTU during that period was none other than the member for Hotham, who stood by while those practices occurred. Over recent times, with the assistance of this government and the member for Braddon, there have been substantial advances. I believe that the company should respond to that improvement in the work force and look at ways in which the workers in this plant can be put to productive employment. The government is considering the proposals that are being put to it by the member for Braddon and the way in which it should respond to this issue. We have delivered effective anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms. We delivered the sort of investment environment that business wants in this country and we have created the sort of circumstances to make profitable investment in Australia a reality for many Australian companies including, I believe, in the paper industry. Taxation",18
52,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, can you advise the House how, within the current taxation system, rates of tax can rise without the knowledge of the public through the hidden indirect tax system, both through increased rates and through reclassification? How would proposed taxation reforms rectify these problems? How would they make the system more transparent, fairer and simpler?",18
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No-one could have missed the point that the Australian Labor Party opposes tax reform.,18
54,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, they keep saying that they are in favour of tax reformthey are just against every measure that would actually implement it. They keep saying that they are in favour of tax reform-it is just that they never really got around to doing it in their 13 years of government. They keep saying that they are in favour of tax reformbut we are still to know the membership of the Labor Party backbench consultative committee on tax reform. They are very interested in backbench committees on consultative tax reform. Let me ask this question: who is on the Labor Party backbench consultative committee on tax reform? Who is on it? Put your hands up. Dick Adams is on it. Who else? Good heavens, Mr Speaker, Mr Dick Adams is the only one on it. I will not say any more, Dick, but you will have a big presence in relation to tax reform. Could it be that the Labor Party does not have a backbench committee on tax reform? Could that be the explanation?",18

57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Burke! Mr O'Keefe interjecting,18
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Burke.,18
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the party that is so interested in tax reform-the only things it has forgotten to do is to set up a body to look at it and to announce who is on it. Let me tell you what the Labor Party really does want. The Labor Party really loves the wholesale sales tax. It is important that people realise this: the Labor Party is going to fight in the next election for the wholesale sales tax system. That is the Labor Party. They say, 'We are against GSTs or broad based indirect tax regimes because they can go up.'",18
60,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
61,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They always shout the loudest when they are about to get the biggest point. Would we be right in asking the Australian Labor Party this question,18
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will respond to the question through the chair and stop provoking members of the opposition.,19
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is an unfair fight, Mr Speaker. Can a wholesale sales tax rise? It would not be the case that you could increase a wholesale sales tax, would it? You would not get a government taking a 10 per cent rate to a 12 per cent rate, would you? A government could not take a 20 per cent rate to a 22 per cent rate, could it? A government could not increase the wholesale sales tax from 30 per cent to 32 per cent, could it? Let me you about the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax system. In 1985, the wholesale sales tax did not cover biscuits, ice-cream and snack foods. Labor put a wholesale sales tax, without people knowing it, on biscuits, ice-cream and snack foods. In 1985, the wholesale sales tax did not cover domestic stoves and ranges. In 1985 the wholesale sales tax did not cover boats; it did not cover flavoured milk and fruit juice. Right throughout J3 years of government the Australian Labor Party not only increased the rates by stealth but also changed the classifications by stealth. The people of Australia ought to know this: the reason Labor likes the wholesale sales tax system is that they increase the taxes without letting on. That is the real advantage of a wholesale sales tax. You do it in two ways: by changing the classifications and by into creasing the rates. These are very important figures and I hope that the Labor Party's consultative backbench committee on tax reform takes them in. At the beginning of the 1990s, total indirect taxesthat is, the taxes the government collected goods-represented seven per cent of GDP. In 1993, that had fallen to 6.1 per cent. Because the proportion of goods as a proportion to the economy is naturally declining. a consequence, if you want to maintain a declining tax base, Labor in the 1993 budget, in order to preserve that tax base, lifted indirect tax by $3 billion. You do not have to do anything but just let the system run for wholesale sales tax take to decline in proporquestion, tion to GDP. This is very important. The 1998-99 budget papers show that the total indirect tax is forecast to decline further as a share of GDP to 5.9 per cent in 2001-2002. For the Labor Party to maintain the indirect tax to GDP ratio, it means that by 2001-2002 it would have to lift tax on indirect taxes; it would have to lift taxes on goods by one per cent of GDP, or $7 billion, just to maintain the tax to GDP ratio-by $7 billion. On the current declining indirect tax base, if the Labor Party just wants to keep revenues to GDP constant-this is leaving aside how the Labor Party would fund an income tax cut, because that is off in the never-never-in the next tell term of parliament, if the Labor Party is elected and it wants to maintain the current goods based indirect tax system, it will have to lift taxes by one per cent of GDP, or by $6 billion or $7 billion. Mr Speaker, are you starting to get the picture? Are you starting to get the picture of what it actually means when you say that you are against a GST? What it actually means is precisely what it meant in 1993. It means this: higher indirect taxes which would have to rise by $6 billion or $7 billion, and no income tax cuts. That is precisely what Labor policy means. That is precisely the trick it is going to try and get away with again. Taxation",19

99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane!,21
100,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why will the tax to GDP proportion not rise? Because the budget is in surplus.,21

102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,21
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The budget is in surplus. This government does not need more revenue. The budget is in surplus-and the budget is in surplus, Mr Speaker, not because of anything the Labor Party did. Here is the Labor Party. The Labor Party says",21
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of relevance",21
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition knows that the answer is entirely relevant.,21
106,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But the Labor Party says, 'We are against indirect tax reform. We want to cut income taxes and, what is more, we will do it out of coalition surpluses.' is what they are saying. How would we have been if we had tried to fund our income tax cuts, our family tax initiative, out of Mr Beazley's surplus? We would have minus $10,000 million to pay for the family tax initiative. When we release our tax package, not only will we be releasing a broad reform of the Australian taxation system but we will be releasing full castings and we will be doing it much more than the Australian Labor Party. If it had anything to do with you, sport, there would be no surpluses for the Australian economy or for anything else. Current Account Deficit",21
107,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, can you advise whether the rise in the March quarter current account deficit is in line with the budget forecasts and what is the government's approach to tackling this issue?",21
108,Mr COSTELLD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Today's current account deficit was better than expectations. The balance of payments estimates for the March quarter of 1998 indicate a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of $7.5 billion, in line with the budget time expected outcome for 1997-98 of $25 billion. The sharp rise in current account deficit is expected to be temporary and concentrated in 1998, with some narrowing occurring in 1999. The budget papers note that the widening of the current account deficit in 1998-99 is expected to be concentrated in 1998 and that, as a percentage of GDP, the outcome for a particular quarter will be higher than the year average deficit of 51,4 per cent of GDP. This is consistent with comments by the governor of the Reserve Bank that the current account deficit will be 5V2 per cent of GDP in calendar 1998 or even touch six per cent for a time. The reason for the wideningMr Latham-How much? Six per cent?",21
109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, six per cent. Mr Latham-You said you would solve it.",21

112,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The sharp downturn in Asia has come at a time when growth in domestic spending is strong, which is leading to continued strong growth in imports. Mr Latham-National savings-remember that?",21
113,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Further evidence of the health of domestic demand came today with the release of the April housing approvals figures. Mr Latham-You said you were going to raise national savings.,21
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Werriwa.,21
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The April rise of 8.3 per cent in relation to housing approvals was well above market expectations of a two per cent fall. As I said earlier, the balance of payments estimate in nominal dollars was $7.5 billion. This was apparently too much for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who went out to do a doorstop. I call on him to release the transcript of his doorstop today because it began with this statement: Evans: We have just announced Australia's worse ever current account deficit. Mr Gareth Evans-Worst ever deterioration.",21
116,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, this is what you said: Evans: We have just announced Australia's worse ever current account deficit. Journalist: Mr Evans, you said this is the worse on record. Statistics say it is the worse for three years. Can you explain how you are saying it is the worse ever?

We have Mr Amnesia and Mr Insane, the Deputy Leader and the Leader-the Goof Brothers. Burnie Pulp Mill",22
134,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, when did you learn of the Burnie closure? In light of the extensive tax advice that you have already obtained from Stan Wallis as BCA chair and also Amcor's chairman, will you now pick up the phone to discuss with him how the government can safeguard the jobs of the 150 workers at Amcor's Burnie pulp mill? Prime Minister, will you be visiting Burnie to meet the Burnie workers 'soon'? Or will you adopt the Newcastle strategy and do nothing?",22
135,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have heard in the past few days of the possibility of the closure. I will check exactly when, and if there is any relevance in the exact time. I will inform the Bouse. I am glad the honourable member for Hotham has raised this matter, and I say at the outset that, irrespective of any political points that may be made on it, if the closure does go ahead it will be a matter of concern for the several hundred men and women who may lose their jobs. I want to compliment the work of my colleague the member for Braddon, my parliamentary secretary, who spent the large part of this morning, as I understand it, in Melbourne meeting senior executives of the company trying to persuade them to delay the closure. I want to make a couple of relevant points. It passes not only strange but absolutely hypocritical for the Labor Party, which, in a conspiracy with the Greens and others, destroyed in 1989 the largest ever manufacturing investment in Australia's history-namely, the Wesley Vale pulp mill. If the Labor Party had not bowed to the radical environmental view on the Wesley Vale pulp mill, then hundreds of Tasmanian blue-collar workers would now have a brighter employment outlook. The Labor Party's weakness in 1989 on the Wesley Vale pulp mill has done more than anything else to jeopardise the economic and employment future of people working in north-west Tasmania. It is indecent hypocrisy for the Labor to be shedding crocodile tears about the employees in Burnie when they calculatedly destroyed the job prospects of perhaps a thousand people in 1989 when they rejected a manufacturing investment worth $1.2 billion-a manufacturing investment that would have given employment hope for the people of northiwest Tasmania years into the future. Yet you now have the indecency and you have the hypocrisy to come into this parliament and start lecturing my government. Mr Crean-Yes, I do!",23
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, you do have the hypocrisy to do it. Yet your government in 1989 had the opportunity to give a new lease of life to the workers of north-west Tasmania. You had the opportunity in 1989. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question relates to the current mill and whether the Prime Minister is prepared to pick up the phone and make the call to Stan Wallis and ask him to do something about saving the jobs.",23
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Botham will resume his seat. That is a point of order that has already been made. The Prime Minister is entirely within standing orders.,23
138,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You had the opportunity to do something, and what did you do? You threw away an investment of $1.2 billion. That investment would have guaranteed the future of hundreds of jobs in north-west Tasmania, but you threw it away. At that time, it was the biggest manufacturing investment that Australia had seen, and you threw it away. You showed a complete indifference. I have already set in train arrangements for a meeting this afternoon of a number of ministers who have responsibility in this area, and I can assure you that whatever action that can be taken by my government will be taken. We do not draw any pleasure at all from this closure, but we draw equal displeasure from the humbug and the hypocrisy of a Labor government that destroyed hundreds of workers' jobs. You destroyed them deliberately and cold-bloodedly. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker. I raise a point of order. The point of order goes to relevance. Party Is the Prime Minister going to make the phone call to Stan Wallis-yes or no?",23
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham knows full well that that is not a point of order, and I would suggest he does not raise them unless they are justified within the standing orders.",23
140,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party thought there were more votes in placating the Greens than there were in preserving the jobs of bluecollar workers. That was the political judgment you made in 1989. You said Green votes in Tasmania were more important than the votes of battlers, and that is why you destroyed the Wesley Vale pulp mill. That is why you threw away a manufacturing investment of $1.2 billion. That is why you defied a lot of the advice you got from the trade union movement at that time.

157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Braddon.,24
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, 'Here's the biggest manufacturing investment in Australia's history.' And what did the Labor government of 1989 do? Remember the year? That year1989-was the beginning of Graham Richardson's 'get re-elected on Green preferences' strategy for the 1990 election. In 1989 the only thing that mattered was the affection of the Green movement, and if it meant sacrificing a few hundred blue-collar workers, if it meant throwing a few trade unionists on the scrap heap, if it m.eant destroying the biggest manufacturing investment in Australia's history-what the matter? They were interested only in the votes of environmentalists. The last people who have any credibility to come into this parliament and tell us what to do in relation to protecting the jobs of bluecollar workers are the members of that government stretching back to 1989. They had a choice in 1989. It was either you placate the Greens or you generate jobs for blue-collar battlers. What they decided to do was to dump the blue-collar battlers and placate the Greens, and it will ever be to their discredit that, when faced with that choice, they turned their back on the blue-collar workers of north-west Tasmania. Unfair Dismissal Claims",24
159,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, are you aware of further research that highlights the impact that unfair dismissal claims are having on businesses? Could you inform the House, Minister, of the costs associated with fighting an unfair dismissal claim, and whether the research confirms that companies are less likely to hire people because of the threat of an unfair dismissal claim?",25
160,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for her question. The question of the unfair dismissal law has been on ongoing issue. Mr Beazley interjecting,25
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.,25
162,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is interesting that we have that interjection from the Leader of the Opposition because the Labor Party is continuing, and has, a policy to oppose a further exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. In fact, we have been advocating a change to provide a benefit for the small business community and you have been doing as you usually do: under direction from the trade union movement, you have twice rejected a measure which would provide real benefit to the small business community and would create jobs. That is the reality of it. You have stood in the way of a sensible reform that would provide a lot of jobs in the small business community. So whether it is Wesley Vale or whether it is small business today, what is your interest? You are dictated to by the trade union movement. You have got frontbenches more interested in fashion than they are in jobs in their own electorates. This latest survey just reinforces the point that we do need further reform in the area of unfair dismissal. If you look at this particular survey, it has come out at a time when we also have a survey from the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. That is an interesting fact as well because not only do we have a federal unfair dismissal law, but there is also a state unfair dismissal law, in particular in New South Wales. In New South Wales, with the only Labor government in the country in place, in the period between January and April this year we have seen 1,850 unfair dismissal claims at the state level, which is more than four times the number of federal claims lodged in that state. We have certainly seen a reduction in the total level of unfair dismissal claims in the federal system as a result of our reforms. They have reduced by about 50 per cent, which is a significant reduction, particularly when you take into account that during that period, at the Commonwealth level, we have taken over responsibility for the Victorian jurisdiction. So we have seen a significant reduction in the total level federally. In the state of New South Wales, though, within the state system, we have se,en an increase in the number of unfair dismissal claims. That reflects the fact that, at both the state level as well as the federal level, the state administration is doing as the unions dictate, that is, have a very free and easy unfair dismissal scheme that has encouraged claims in New South Wales. Who are the people to suffer? They are those who are unemployed and those in small business who would otherwise give those people a job. The last point I make comes from Recruitment Solutions. What they say is-and I am quoting from the Daily Telegraph today: . . . around the country between 5 and 10 per cent of all businesses report cutting their work forces because they fear being caught in legal action. Between five and 10 per cent! There are 900,000 small businesses in Australia. If the number is between five and 10 per cent, then obviously the estimate from the small business association is that you would have 50,000 new jobs if we could have the exemption which we have proposed to the Senate carried. That is, I think, therefore, further evidence why it is very important that that measure finally achieves passage so that we get a benefit for small business. You could not put it better than the Daily Telegraph puts it in its editorial today. It says: Labour market reform was a critical issue in the last federal election, and it will be so in the nextwhich senators hoping to return to office should remember. It makes this simple point: that the unfair dismissal laws are a 'brake on the wheels of production.' Who is applying that brake? None other than the Labor Party. Government Task Forces: Child Support",25
163,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that your task force on tax reform has obeyed the Treasurer and made no recommendations, how will this influence your imminent taxation policy? Isn't this a similar exercise in futility as when the backbench child support committee, which actually made recommendations, was also ignored and in fact misrepresented in the party room by the Minister for Social Security? What is the point of inviting backbench input into policy when it is routinely ignored by you and your inner circle? Can you allay, Prime Minister, the concerns of my constituents about the creation of government policy?",26
164,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the Prime Minister, the member for Dickson is asking a question of the Prime Minister in an area that is not within his ministerial responsibility. However, if the Prime Minister wishes to respond, I ask him to do so.",26
165,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take the opportunity of affirming to the member for Dickson that my government is committed to fair and effective and comprehensive tax reforms. I also take the opportunity of affirming to the member for Dickson that my government seeks a balanced and fair approach in the more difficult social areas related to child support. I think all of us, whatever our politics, will know that, of the many issues that come across our desks as local members, nothing quite excites the unrelieved passion and feeling of people-on either side of the argument-as feeling that they have not been fairly treated by child support processes. As a local member I have spoken to aggrieved custodial parents and aggrieved non-custodial parents and they have each spoken with the same degree of passion and feeling about how unfair the system is. It is just a timely and regular commentary on the human fact that, when a marriage or a relationship breaks down, sadly enough there is a great deal of human emotion unleashed.",26
166,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,26
167,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can tell by the responses of the member for Cunningham and the member for Brisbane, at least, that they have probably had the same experiences, unless they have constituencies that are atypical of the rest of Australia. But while I am on my feet, and mindful of the person who asked me the question, I am delighted to announce that the endorsed Liberal candidate against Mrs Cheryl Kernot for the next federal election is the former ABC talkback host Mr Rod Henshaw. He will be an outstanding candidate, and he will carry the standard in a very articulate way. I believe that Mr Henshaw, of all the candidates that will be on offer, will offer a better understanding. I understand, for example, he has been an resident of the electorate of Dickson for 20 years. That makes him a little different from that blow-in from the Gold Coast who in fact has now become the ALP candidate. I say to the person who asked me the question that I know from my discussions with him and I know from the interviews that I have had with him that Mr Henshaw is committed to a better taxation system for the future of Australia. I know that Mr Henshaw has a very balanced view towards the many social challenges that facc people within the electorate of Dickson. I think he will bring an understanding of the young person's view. I think he will also have a sympathyMr Tony Smith- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order on relevancy.",26
168,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, Tony! I am trying to disadvantage Cheryl.",26
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Mr Tony Smith-My question in relation to this matter was very specific, in particular in relation to child support.",26
170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, but it was also out of order, and I said the Prime Minister could answer it if he wished. Mr Tony Smith-I do ask him to direct his mind to the question if he chooses to answer it, Mr Speaker.",26
171,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not finished. I think Mr Henshaw will bring an understanding of tax issues. He will bring an understanding of the family relationship issues that are involved in child support. I think he will have a very good understanding of the concerns, the hopes and the aspirations of that often referred to group in the Australian community called the 'baby boomers'. But, consonant with the approach of my party, he will not be taking the view that the baby boomers are the only people on the planet; he will be taking the view that, as a Liberal member of parliament, he is elected to represent the entire constituency. I believe that he will do it admirably and with very great distinction in the next parliament. United Kingdom",27
172,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House about the state of relations with the United Kingdom? Does Australia have a close and mature relationship with the United Kingdom? Is the minister aware 'of any alternative approaches to this relationship and to foreign policy in general? Are these approaches original?,27
173,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question. I recognise the enormous amount of work the honourable member does to advance Australia's interests, including in the field of international relations. What an excellent job he has done for Australia in this parliament. The relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom is a very warm, a very close and a very strong relationship. I think it was very much epitomised by the most successful New Images promotion we had last year that brought to the attention of the British people and the Australian people much more modern perspectives of our respective societies. I think both of us believe that the New Images program was very successful. We operate on our relationship now as a relationship based on mutual respect and equality and, as I have said, it is a relationship that has developed very well. That does not mean of course that in the 1990s we, as a government, go to the United Kingdom to find the source of our policies or ideas for the evolution of our foreign policy. We clearly do not. When we put together before the last election our document A Confident Australia, we wrote it ourselves. When we produced the white paper on foreign policy and trade, we wrote that ourselves. That does stand in some contrast to other documents that have been brought to my attention. In January this year at the Labor Party conference-and we all remember that-the Labor Party produced a document called Securing Australia's Place in the World. People may wonder, members may wonder, 'Why is that relevant to Australia's relationship with the United Kingdom?' It is, in a very interesting way. That document has at its outset an explanation of Labor's objectives and challenges. What is interesting about that explanation is the way it contrasts with the British Labour government's 'Mission Statement' of its foreign policy-a very interesting comparison, Mr Speaker. The British government says that its foreign policy is to promote the national interests of the United Kingdom. Labor's is to promote Australia's national interest. That is all right.",27
174,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is wrong with that?,27
175,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are right. That is okay.,27
176,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,27
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The members of the opposition will restrain their enthusiasm.,27
178,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But is this okay? The British government outlined four specific ways in which they are going to do that: security, prosperity-most governments would do that-quality of life, mutual respect. Australian Labor: security, living standards, quality of life, mutual respect. Where did you get that from? They are sitting down there reading Robin Cook's documents, reading the documents of the British government, and then repackaging them and presenting them as something original. The fact is that this act of subservience is the most subservient act in Australian political history since the Scullin government called on the Govemor of the Bank of England to try to fix the Australian economy. That was in the 1930s. You did it then, and you did it again in the 1980s. This is to say nothing of the extensive plagiarism in the Labor Party document. There are 13 policies in the Labor Party document which have either been completely plagiarised or paraphrased from either government policy or the Simons review of foreign aid. Two years in opposition; no work except to look up the British Labour government's policy and to read the government's documents. We have as the opposition spokesman the member for Kingsford-Smith, a man who will go down in history as the laziest opposition spokesman on foreign affairs in history. It is 2 June today. He is about to ask a question. If he asks that question of me, it will the first he has asked in 1998. Visit by Prime Minister of Israel",27
179,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We might have the organ-grinder, not the monkey today. My question is toI the Prime Minister. Government members-Ooh!",28
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of the government front-bench will remain silent. The Prime Minister is quite capable of responding, I am sure.",28
181,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, can you confirm that your Israeli counterpart, Mr Netanyahu, has accepted your invitation for him to visit Australia from 14 August this year? What is your response to Mr Netanyahu's recent assertion that the Oslo peace process collapsed two years ago? Prime Minister, can you assure the House that in the lead-up to the Israeli Prime Minister's visit, your government will vigorously press Mr Netanyahu for acceptance of the United States' plan for a further Israeli withdrawal from 13 per cent of the West Bank as the next step in the Oslo peace process?",28
182,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingsford-Smith for the question. It is true that the Israeli Prime Minister has been invited. The precise date is still to be finally settled but there are dates around the one mentioned by the member for Kingsford Smith that are under consideration. I take the view that the Prime Minister of Israel, whoever he or she may be, is always welcome in Australia. I take the opportunity on behalf of my government to strongly reaffirm our strong commitment to and affection for Israel and our admiration of what has been achieved by the state of Israel since its foundation in such difficult and hosti Ie circumstances in 1948. As it happens, I have had the opportunity on two occasions in recent months---{)ne when speaking at the United Israel Appeal in Sydney in the presence of Mr Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister of Israel and a person for whom I have immense personal regard to not only state what I have just said about my attitude and the attitude of my government to the state and the people of Israel but be also to say that I look forward to the full consummation of the peace process in the Middle East. I said at that dinner, as I have said on other occasions, that Israel has a responsibility as much as the other parties in the Middle East to bring about that peace settlement. I think Israel carries a special responsibility along with the representatives of the Palestinian people. I respect the rights and the aspirations of the Palestinian people and I will use my opportunities and authority to press that view on the Prime Minister of Israel. The close friendship which I have personally with the people of the Jewish community in Australia and the close friendship between Australia and Israel carry with them the right and opportunity to press a point of view that might temporarily be unpopular. I will certainly be pressing very strongly on the Israeli government the need for it to play its part, but I do that against the background of saying yet again to the people of Israel that their right to exist behind secure, defensible and impregnable boundaries is something that successive Australian governments have always held dear, and that will continue to be our policy. I think it is very important that the aspirations of the Palestinian people, which have been recognised in UN resolutions, also be respected. It will be the intention of my government to see that fairness and justice is done to all parties in the Middle East. Higher Education",28
183,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. What impact have the government's policies had on increasing access to higher education by Australian students? Can you inform the House of areas of support for the government's policies in this field?",29
184,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and I acknowledge his great support for young people in his electorate. The government's policies for higher education are aimed at increasing the quality of the university education available to Australians and aimed at access to universities. I am very pleased to inform the House that this year there will be record numbers of domestic students in Australian universities. In 1998 there will be 457,000 domestic students in Australian universities, 18,000 more than in Labor's last year, 1996. It is of interest that when we look at the Labor Party's forward estimates for government funded undergraduate places for this year, 1998, we see the Labor Party undertook to provide 364,000 government funded undergraduate places. This government has delivered 28,000 government funded undergraduate places more than Labor undertook to deliver this year. So this government is widening access dramatically for young Australians to get a university education. We have been able to do this because we have taken a practical, nonideological approach to opening the doors to Australian universities. We have increased the numbers of fully funded government places in Australian universities, which are now running for undergraduates at 10,000 more than in Labor's last year. This is the first year in which the government is providing funding at an average of some $2,500 for overenrolments. The government this year has provided for some 29,000 overenrolments in universities. Perhaps most importantly and significantly, because this goes to the fundamental equity of entry to Australian universities, we have given young Australians the same rights of entry to Australian universities as overseas students, rights ment. they were denied for years by the Labor Party. These policies which are opening the doors to young Australians Mr Fitzgibbon-What are you doing to assist?",29
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hunter.,29
186,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"are under threat from the Labor Party. So far, the only policy the Labor Party has announced for universities is to cut placesMr Fitzgibbon-Abolish, or update fees?",29
187,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hunter.,29
188,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to take away places from the hundreds of young Australians who are showing they are prepared to invest in their first preference university course. This is a purely ideological policy. What they want to do is to restore the discrimination against young Australians of getting a place in Australian universities, as overseas students are permitted to do. Why is this the only policy that the Labor Party has announced? Because it is the only policy that has been strongly advocated to them by the trade union movement; because it is the policy of the National Union of Students; and because it is the policy of the National Tertiary Education Union. Beyond that, thcre is nothing else. There is no other policy. The member for Werriwa has had no interest, as we know, in developing education policies for the Labor Party. Their schools policy is closing schools. Why? Because that is the policy of the Australian Education Union. I am pleased to see that the member for Werriwa is up-front about this. At the ALP National Conference in January this year, he was nothing if not frank. I would like to quote what the member for Werriwa had to say. He said: ... in the months aheadthat is, in the months ahead from JanuaryI look forward to working closely with the leadership of the two unions, the Australian Education Union and the National Tertiary Education Union, to tum the contents of this Chapter into the programs and policies of a Beazley Labor GovernYou cannot get franker than that. That is how the education policies of the Labor Party are formed. That is why their only policies so far are to close schools and to cut places for young Australians to enter universities. They are not interested in educational opportunities for young Australians; they are not interested in expanding educational opportunity. They are interested in who is going to man the polling booths on polling day; they are interested in who is going to give the funds to the Australian Labor Party for their election campaign; they are interested in the people who control the votes at the Labor Party conferences and control the preselections because the Labor Party is a sectional party. It is a party which speaks on behalf of narrow, sectional interests in the community. It is not interested in young Australians, it is not interested in education, it is not interested in expanding access, it is not interested in quality; and it is up to this government to continue to defend the rights of young Australians to gain the education for which they are qualified.

189,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The only kids the minister is looking after are from Scotch College.,30
190,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman will direct his question or he will sit down.,30
191,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, do you stand by your claims in today's Age that Centrelink will refer about 131,000 intensive assistance applications to job agencies, as against a June target of 125,000? If so, how do you account for Centrelink officials this morning telling a Senate estimates committee that the real figure for June is 30,000 all-up? That is right, 30,000 for all forms of assistance.",30
192,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said before, one of the fairly good things about getting a question from the member for Batman is that it always give you a very clear steer to what the facts are: they are the exact opposite to the facts implied in the question. You can never rely on anything the member for Batman says, and the reason for that is that the Labor Party deeply resents the fact that this government has been responsible for one of the greatest social reforms of the last 50 years, one that will be giving unemployed people a real chance to get a job. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is a very specific question, going to statements made by the minister in the media today",30
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order. Mr Martin Ferguson-and Senate estimates hearings. Put up or shut up!,30
194,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order and the member will resume his seat.,30
195,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Batman is totally wrong, as usual. These matters are monitored in close detail day by day by my department, and I can inform the House of the facts. As of 1 June, over 133,000 job seekers have been identified for referral, 89,000 have already been referred to intensive assistance and a further 44,000 job seekers are currently making their choice of provider. The government is already ahead of the target for the end of June of 125,000 referrals. The Job Network has been extraordinarily effective in its first month of operation. The Job Network members, with enormous enthusiasm, are out thereMr Kelvin Thomson-But youth employment has gone up. How can you say that?",30
196,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Wills has been warned. I ask the minister to resume his seat. Under standing order 304A, I ask the member for Wills to leave the House for an hour. The honourable member for Wills thereupon withdrew from the chamber",30
197,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Job Network has been extraordinarily effective in building up the number of vacancies available to unemployed people. It now has well over 1,400 sites open around Australia for unemployed people to go to, and unemployed people have got the real dignity of being able to choose which provider they will go to. They are no longer treated as statistics. They are now able to get the sort of help that they really need. One of the important features of the Job Network is that it is especialJy geared to help those most in need of extra assistance and intensive assistance. I am pleased to be able to say that it appears from early indications that over 40 per cent of",30
198,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister was asked for an explanation of the discrepancy between the 130,000, now 133,000, that he claims in June and his official's testimony to a Senate estimates committee of 30,000. That was it: what was the explanation for the difference? What he is doing, having been embarrassed by it, is giving us an around-the-table discussion on his employment policy.",31
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The minister will direct his response to the question asked of him.,31
200,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, as I have already said, is well ahead of its target for June of 125,000 referrals. We already have another 44,000 job seekers referred to intensive assistance in the process of choosing their agency, and that will happen within the next couple of weeks. It is quite clear that the information that the honourable member for Batman has purported to put before the House is quite wrong. I was in the process of saying that the Job Network is especiaJly effective in helping the most disadvantaged job seekers. It appears that over 40 per cent of the vacancies already filled by Job Network members have been filled by long-term unemployed people. Building Industry",31
201,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Does the government have a policy to reform the building industry? Will this policy assist small business, particularly subcontractors?",31
202,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The qucstion is out of order because it asked for an announcement of policy.",31
203,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not believe it did. Mr Crean-Yes, it did.",31
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Would you please keep quiet. We would all hear then. I will ask the honourable member for La Trobe to repeat his question.,31
205,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I did ask if the government does have a policy to reform the building industry.",31
206,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That means that it is not a new policy; it is an existing one, as I understand the terminology.",31
207,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The member has a lot of experience in the building industry. I know he is very supportive of the policy that we have for this area, which was part of an ongoing program the government has in place to encourage reform in the building industry. Last week on Friday I released guidelines for the building and construction industry that will set in train and will encourage further reform of that industry and will provide further protections for subcontractors in that industry, particularly against the ravages of the CFMEU. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: in relation to the question being in order, you said you thought it was about him announcing existing policy, not new policy. Therefore, you allowed the question to be asked. It is now apparent, 30 seconds into the answer, that what the minister is doing is announcing new policy. He should therefore be sat down because the question is effectively out of order.",31
208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the question were to have required the minister to state a new policy, it would be, but he is explaining existing policy as I understood the response.",31
209,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, Mr Speaker. I am referring to a policy which has already been announced. Opposition members-When? When?",31
210,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,These interjections come from an opposition that cannot even lodge an MPI on time. These are the people who are concerned about the workers in Burnie but could not lodge an MPI. They could not even get it in by 12 o'clock. Mr Cl'ean- Mr SPEAKER ,31
211,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No interjection will save you, Simon.",32
212,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister should be answering the question, not trying to argue a case about MPIs across the House. Mr Crean-Precisely the point of order. I was going to make to you, Mr Speaker.",32
213,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That one I upheld. MI' Crean-You should require him to teB us when this policy was announced, because I think we will find it is new. MI' SPEAKER-The member for Botham will resume his seat. Mr Crean-He is incapable of telling the truth.",32
214,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Botham wi 1\ remain silent. There is no restraint on a minister discussing policy in his answer. The questions require that you do not ask regarding new policy, but the minister is entirely in order in his answer.",32
215,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, your policy for requiring letters on the MPI has been in place for many years. You have to get it in by 12 0' clock. If you think it is really important, it in by 12. MI' SPEAKER-The minister will answer the question.",32
216,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering the question, Mr Speaker. I am answering the question which goes to the incompetence of the Labor Party, whether it is lodging MPIs or whether it is doing what they are told by the trade union movement. I was very pleased that in the Sydney Morning Herald the building industry specialists contractors organisation is reported as welcoming the government's policy announcements and our reform initiatives for the building industry. It was said that the move by the government to introduce a code of practice for the industry was long overdue. It certainly has been well overdue. This is one of a series of steps that we have taken since we have been in government to give a fair go to the building industry and, in particular, to the tens of thousands of small businesses that make up the building industry and that for far too long have been subject to coercion and duress by the CFMEU and others. It was therefore no surprise that in response to the very sensible, moderate and considered proposals that the government has previously announced that Mr Kingham of the CFMEU made some statements. What he said was very revealing. The following was reported in the Sunday Age: Mr Kingham said the CFMEU had secured a commitment from the federal opposition leader Mr Kim Beazley to unravel any changes made by employers if Labor wins the next federal election. What is Labor's secret policy? What is the special deal they have done with the building workers union? Mr Robert Brown- Mr SPEAKER ",32
217,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suppose you are not allowed to work in the building industry unless you are a member of the CFMEU. MI' SPEAKER-The minister will resume his seat. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, my point of order was whether it was in order for the Treasurer to be distracting the attention of get members of the government while the minister was answering a question.",32
218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Charlton is not making a point of order. He will resume his seat. The minister is answering the question.,32
219,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The CFMEU went on, through Mr Kingham, on the weekend to state: Unions wanted a Beazley government to return to the centralised system that preceded the enterprise  as Prime Minister. Isn't it interesting, Mr Speaker, if you go back over the public record, that one of the biggest donors to the Labor Party is none other than the CFMEU. I went back to 199293, $116,000; 1994-95, $251,000; 1995-96",32

227,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He was not asked a question about funding of political parties in this country. He would be too embarrassed to be asked such a question. He was asked one about industrial relations policy, and this has nothing to do with it.",33
228,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has made his point. He will resume his seat.,33
229,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1995-96 they paid $553,000 to tell you what your policy would be. Mr Crean-You should be keeping order, Mr Speaker.",33
230,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is entirely in order.,33
231,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1996-97 the CFMEU paid the Labor Party $277,000 to buy you off. Over a million dollars, with the unions telling you what to do. Mr O'Connor-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. On standing order 145 and relevance, I think it is time you terminated the minister's response to this question.",33
232,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has a point of order, or is it the same one?",33
233,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is exactly the same. It goes to relevance. Coming from a bloke with the relationships with building companies he has got,33
234,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The minister will return to the question which he was asked. He is roaming significantly wider than the question that was asked of him.,33
235,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I intend to conclude, Mr Speaker. I thank you for the invitation to do so. My point is a simple one: We announced a policy for the benefit of the building industry which would provide real protection for small business, and within three days the unions, who fund the Labor Party, are telling the Labor Party to oppose the very benefits for the small business community which we have announced. Whether it is in the building industry, whether it is in unfair dismissal, whether it is with the MUA, when it is a choice between the unions and small business, every time they are for the unions. Taxation",33
236,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Mr Martin Ferguson-What did you do with your discount?,33
237,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman will remain silent.,33
238,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the Treasurer's former senior adviser, Matthew Ryan, who is now No. 2 on his taxation task force, has written in a Treasury research paper: There is essentially no trade effect in switching to a GST. It is an illusion. Will the Prime Minister admit that not only did he mislead the House yesterday on the specific figures about all this but also his economic arguments about the trade benefits of a GST have never ever had any substance?",33
239,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come directly to the question asked about Mr Ryan, but before I do, by way of putting the issue into context, could I say that my attention has been drawn to what can only be described as appallingly destructive comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the Australian economy. Not only did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in giving a doorstop, get his historical facts wrong about the current account deficit but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did something that no responsible shadow Treasurer should do, and that is he deliberately sought to talk down the Australian economy.",33
240,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,34
241,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members of the opposition will remain silent.,34
242,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like Hansard to note, Mr Speaker, that in response to that comment of mine the Deputy Leader of the Opposition received some pats on the back from members of the Labor Party. Apparently it is perfectly acceptable to talk down the Australian economy. This is what he had to say. Bear in mind that these remarks are made against the background that we have established the first budget surplus in eight years, we have established the strongest economic foundations that Australia has had for 25 years, we had the lowest interest rates in 30 years and the lowest inflation rate in the OECD area, and we are seen by the rest of the world as being a stable, secure and safe economy amidst a sea of economic turmoil. This is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say today. He was as ked by a journalist, 'Are we looking at banana republic levels?'",34
243,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Primc Minister will resume his seat. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on a point of order. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, it was the percentage of GDP. Read the full text.",34
244,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The deputy leader will resume his seat.,34
245,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No wonder the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is sensitive, because apparently this is the same transcript from which the Treasurer quoted earlier in question time. Like the Leader of the Opposition, this deputy has a habit that, if he said something embarrassing, he does not distribute his transcript, and we have to go around pointing these things out to the gallery. He was asked the question, 'Are we looking at banana republic levels?' Mr Gareth Evans-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. If he is going to make this point, he has got to be relevant, and therefore he got to repeat the whole question, which was: 'As a percentage of GDP, are we looking at banana republic levels'?' That is what I was answering. You .should read it out; otherwise you are completely misleading",34
246,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader will resume his seat. The Prime Minister should answer the question and is doing so.,34
247,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is what he had to say: Joumalist: GDP. Are we looking at banana republic levels? Well, not quite yet, but clearly banana republic was six per cent plus; we're looking at 5'12 per cent now, with the full effect of Asia still to bite. In other words, you were deliberately trying to fan a sense of insecurity in the Australian economy. You were trying to talk the Australian economy down. You were trying to make it plain that the Australian economy faced the same problems that it had faced in the 1980s. For anybody with any sense of responsibility to compare the state of the Australian economy now with the situation in the 1980s is utterly and completely irresponsible. I do not know the writings of Mr Ryan. I will go and have a look at them. The reality is that the existing indirect tax system does have a very harmful effect on our exporters and a very harmful effect on our manufacturers. Defence Industry",34
248,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, can you inform the House as to the mcasures this government is taking to ensure a closer relationship between defence and industry and to build a truly sustainable Australian-based defence industry?",34
249,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kennedy for his question because I know of his interest in defence matters. I am pleased to say that this morning I announced our strategic defence industry policy at the annual procuremcnt confcrence, attended by some 750 people who are interested in these matters. This is the third policy in a trilogy of has defence policies brought down by this government; the first being the defence efficiency review, the second being Australia's strategic policy and the third being the strategic defence industry policy.",34
250,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, the is the announcement of policy. Isn't she announcing policy?",35
251,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This policy, quite frankly, was required because our strategic policy identified that we needed to do the direct opposite of what the former government had decided was the role of defence, which was to puddle around in its own backyard.",35
252,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is an effective announcement of policy and it ought to be a parliamentary statement if it is being taken seriously by the government. Mr Bevis-Why don't you table it?",35
253,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane will remain silent. Mr Martin Ferguson-It is definitely policy.,35
254,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Batman will remain silent. The minister is allowed to state policy but, if it is new policy, it should have been made by way of a ministerial statement. The honourable minister will proceed with her answcr but she should not use this vehicle to announce new policy.",35
255,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The policy has been announced. Mr Robert Brown-When?",35
256,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you had been listening, I told you a few moments ago that it was announced at the annual procurement conference, which was attended by some 750 people.",35
257,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So it is new policy.,35
258,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.,35
259,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, the strategic industry policy is needed to back up the strategic policy, which puts in place this government's strategic policy for defence. It is the direct opposite of what the former government required of our defence force, which was to puddle around in its own backyard. This government has clearly identified the need of our defence force to be able to deploy off this continent and to deploy in the region. To enable us to do that, we need a strategic defence industry policy to sustain that deployment. The policy itself has 49 initiatives and, unlike defence industry policy that has been brought down by the former governmentwhich never had the endorsement of whole of government and indeed never had an implementation plan-this policy has full endorsement and consultation of industry.",35
260,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is rubbish.,35
261,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is entirely in order; the plicy has been announced.,35
262,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,She should be making a ministerial statement.,35
263,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, you've had a bad day.",35
264,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition knows that, over the years, this practice has been followed. After announcement of a policy a minister explains it in the House. The minister is in order but it is up to her to determine to what degree it is new policy and the degree to which she is explaining existing policy.",35
265,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said, the legacy that we received from the previous government was one that needed tremendous attention from this government, both from Mr MCLachlan and myself. Indeed, it was the commitment of the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, who said that there were to be no further cuts to defence under this government, that has enabled us to put into place policies that will allow the ADF to truly be able to defend this country. The policy that the previous government followed, of fitting platforms for but not with, has left us with a situation where we have built splendid new frigates for but not with, which in fact are floating targets. It is up to this government to give them the wherewithal to be able to truly defend this nation.",35
266,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, she is now straying in relevance terms from the question, which was about defence industry, not about force structure. What she is now arguing about is force structure and, if she knew anything about it at all, for but not with is a common peacetime pattern",35
267,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has made his point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The minister is talking about the construction of ships at the moment, and that is within the answer.",36
268,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said, it is really necessary for our frigates to be able to defend themselves in a high threat environment. If the Leader of the Opposition, the former minister for defence, thinks you can do that with a five-inch gun and a Sea Sparrow missile, he had better think again. What is clearly required is an upgrade of both missiles and radar, which are clearly in the area of defence industry. This is the government which will enable our defence force to adequately defend this country. As I said, there are 49 initiatives in the policy. There is also an implementation plan so that people will be able to see the time line when things will be implemented. It has whole of government support, and I table a copy of this document, Defence and Industry Strategic Policy Statement.",36

288,Mr ANTHONY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"-I would certainly like to finish off my speech on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 in support of the government's backing of the comprehensive test ban treaty. When I last spoke in this chamber yesterday, I expressed concern at the deteriorating situation on the subcontinent of India. It is an alarming situation where you have two medium powers-in particular, Indiawhich has detonated five nuclear devices, and of course subsequent to that was a combination of six tests by Pakistan. This is in grave BILL 1998 danger of going against the spirit and the intent of the comprehensive nuclear test ban trcaty in which Australia has played a vital role. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has said, we are almost getting to the situation on the subcontinent where it is a macabre game of cricket, in the sense that these two particular countries are trying to outdo each other in a very dangerous game where ultimately the vast masses in both these countries will be at their peril. Also, the issues of social diversion, sectarian violence and corruption, particularly in Pakistan, are not being addressed. I would certainly urge-and I know I concur with all members of this House-that the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, SENATE and also the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Vajpayee, bring some sensibility back to the situation of their brinkmanship over the provinces of Kashmir and Jammu where there have been a number of wars. In particular, a major war was fought in 1971 and the province has potentially been at flashpoint during the 1990s. It is also important that there be a return to some sanity because there are a number of neighbouring countries in that areaparticularly Iran and Afghanistan-which, if there is a continuing escalation, could, as more fundamental Islamic states, be forced into a situation where, through their own strategic necessity, they have to also join the nuclear club. I certainly concur with the United Nations Security Council in condemning the tests that have been carried out, which are certainly not in the spirit of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, and urge that the full force of the international community be brought to bear on those particular countries, whether it is through sanctions or the withdrawal of other facilities. I do note that Australia has now suspended our defence cooperation and nonhumanitarian aid to both countries. I gather there have been recalls of appropriate high commissioners. I believe the rest of the world should follow suit. The comprehensive test ban treaty bans all nuclear explosions for all times. Currently, it has been signed by over 149 states. It will be a treaty with teeth and it certainly needs to have those teeth. To comply with that there will be a worldwide network of over 300 monitoring stations and laboratories to ensure compliance. Australia will host 21 of these monitoring stations and laboratories to monitor thermonuclear explosions. I would like to pay tribute to our current foreign minister's determination in leading the cause for the signing of this treaty. Australia has played an important role in getting this treaty off the ground. In contrast to the situation under his predecessor, we actually have a situation now where 149 countries have signed it, with Australia taking a critical role. I would also like to pay tribute to the Ottawa deal, which also has been signed up, aimed at ridding the world of another heinous weapon-antipersonnel mines. This is another shining example of where this government has taken positive steps in disarmament to make this community a safer place-not just with antipersonnel mines but also with nuclear explosions. The people of Richmond, and particularly the people of the Byron Shire, have a very strong view on this, just as I did when France conducted its recent tests. I might add that France has only just signed the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, so I do hope that they provide greater leadership than they showed a few years ago at our back door, particularly at Mururoa. I commend this bill to the House.",39
289,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Barton) (3.56 p.m.)I note that the Comprehensive Nuclear TestBan Treaty Bill 1998 has strong bipartisan support, but I found the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), a little ungracious in that he failed to recognise the tremendous effort put in not only by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) but also by the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), in achieving a comprehensive test ban treaty. Indeed, the negotiations for the treaty went on from 1994 to September 1996 and the current minister only had a relatively brief period at the helm from March 1996. Indeed, it is fair to say that the previous foreign minister was instrumental in bringing together the final drafts which eventually became the text of the treaty. Certainly it has to be said that the current foreign minister played a very significant role in the AugustSeptember period. In particular, when India was preventing the conference on disarmament from presenting the treaty to the General Assembly, Australia took on the role of presenting the treaty. So that was a significant step. The previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, however, played a crucial role-not a very important role but a crucial role-in achieving this treaty and that has been recognised internationally and is to Australia's credit. The debate on this bill is very topical. The recent nuclear explosions conducted by India and Pakistan have brought the condemnation of the entire world. I was not comforted by comments attributed to an Indian official recently who tried to case tensions by saying: What we have here is no worse that the situation that prevailed in Europe during the 1950's and early 1960's. Why does everyone assume that India and Pakistan will behave any more irrationally and irresponsibly than America and the Soviet Union did. Those words will not comfort anyone, I am sure. One has to ask the question: why did India and Pakistan take what common sense would suggest was an outrageous act that was going to draw in the condemnation of the entire world? India alleges that it was a threat by China that caused it to escalate and upgrade its nuclear capacity and undertake these present tests. Other commentators say that the intensely nationalistic government which currently exists in India has been quite obsessed with trying to increase the standing of India in the international community and perceives power and influence in terms of military might and the power of destruction. That is one philosophy. The other philosophy is that it was done for base political motives because of domestic considerations and the nationalism that exists in India. From Pakistan's point of view, Pakistan alleged that they responded to the aggression of India and said they were compelled to have their own tests. They also said that there was an inadequate response by the international community to the Indian tests and, therefore, they felt they had to demonstrate that they also had the capacity to match whatever India could dish out to them. Also, there have been clear suggestions of base political motives at a domestic level. Indeed, if you look at what has occurred in India you find, quite amazingly, that the tests have united a 19-party fragmented coalition government. It is now united as a result of these tests. A polling of some 1,000 people different cities indicated that 91 per cent Indians approved the tests and 82 per cent favoured deployment of nuclear weapons. In Pakistan, it has been reported that Prime Minister Sharif, in several conversations with the President of the United States, indicated his concern for the domestic consequences Pakistan did not conduct their own tests. Indeed, it has been reported that he said to President, 'I don't think I'll last three days unless I conduct the tests.' Certainly, after tests were conducted by Pakistan, it appears that 97 per cent of Pakistanis approve of the tests having been carried out. What we have, clearly, at the end of the day is a situation that appears to be blatant political opportunism by weak and unacceptably emotional leaders pandering to their respective electorates, dominated by fanatics, instead of trying to lead them. I note, with some wry amusement, that a Hindu nationalist in the Indian parliament, Val Thackeray, has been reported as saying, 'We have to prove to the world that we are not eunuchs.' I have always had a philosophy on those people, wherever they are around the world, who want to tote guns, automatic weapons or whatever form of weapon that, rather than demonstrating any prowess in the non-eunuch status, they demonstrate an inadequacy in a particular physical attribute. So, instead of demonstrating power and potency, India has demonstrated to the world its foolishness and inadequacy. The experts can analyse why these actions were undertaken and we can discuss and debate them, but it is of concern that the situation is one that has been brewing. I note, for instance, that in 1993 the former United States CIA Director, James Woolsey, predicted that 'the arms race between India and Pakistan poses perhaps the most probable prospect for future use of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons'. That was some five years ago. Those words, I hope, have been only partially prophetic and will not be carried out to their full. The situation is one of concern. The tension could escalate. Obviously, there has been tension there since the British rule moved out in of the area. There have been three wars in 50 of years between India and Pakistan. The situation is that soldiers on each side are regularly killed around the Kashmir disputed territory. As early as 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test. The Pakistani Prime Minister at the time, Ali Bhutto, vowed that Pakistan, as if a result, also had to go nuclear. He said he vowed to go nuclear 'even if his people had the to eat grass'. Paradoxically, it may well be, because of the reaction of the international the community, that very many people in his country will have to eat grass because of the action that a future generation of leadership has taken. We perhaps do not have a powder keg in terms of the use of nuclear weapons in the Indian-Pakistani situation, but we have a situation of concern, which could escalate to other areas of the world. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Richmond, noted the neighbouring Middle Eastern countries, for instance. There is a significant nuclear capability in the world, even after the end of the Cold War. For instance, Time magazine reported on 25 May that the United States still has an arsenal of over 12,000 warheads; Britain, 380 warheads; France, 500 warheads; Russia, 22,500 warheads; China, 450 warheads; India, an estimated 65 warheads; Israel, somewhere between 60 and 112 warheads; and Pakistan, between 15 and 25 warheads. In addition, it is suspected that Iraq, North Korea and Libya are developing nuclear weapons capabilities. This situation is of great concern. It could undermine the comprehensive test ban treaty process and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Currently, an Middle Eastern nations are parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty but, if they take the example of India and Pakistan, there is a concern that they may withdraw from the processes. We have seen, around the world, boasts that there is now an Islamic bomb-although I have to say, pleasingly, Malaysia, which is an Islamic country, has condemned both India and Pakistan with equal vigour. Nonetheless, this boasting in some quarters of an Islamic bomb could well aggravate the anxiety in Israel, with the consequence that they could now seek to expand their own nuclear capability. The international community has great concern about these events. We have to ask ourselves: has the response of the international community been adequate? Certainly, from the United States point of view, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act 1994 requires the President of the United States to impose sanctions if he is satisfied that a non-nuclear weapons possessing country has conducted a nuclear test. President Clinton acted with appropriate sanctions in the case of India and Pakistan. Japan also acted to freeze grants to both countries and to suspend loans. In Pakistan's case, they look like losing about $] billion because of the sanctions imposed by Japan. However, perhaps most disappointing to date has been the response of Britain, France, Russia and China. None of those countries have suspended aid or trade. Certainly, from Australia's point of view, we have taken action. We have suspended our defence ties and wound back on our diplomatic relations. We have suspended non-humanitarian aid, although at the present stage, as I understand it, we do not provide any non-humanitarian aid to Pakistan and the value of that aid to India is about $31;2 million. So there is not a lot in monetary terms that has been withdrawn as a result of any action by Australia. But the international community really does have to look at whether it has got its act together in terms of immediately responding with unambiguous condemnation and punishment of a country that takes a step which threatens not only the security of our region but also the security of the world and, indeed, the environment of the world. These are very significant things to have regard to. From the point of view of the bill, we note that the bill creates an offence to cause a nuclear test or explosion, that it extends to all citizens inside and outside Australia, that it requires countries to participate in a verification procedure and that it establishes the Australian comprehensive test-ban office. It also fundamentally involves Australia, as previous speakers have noted, in terms of 21 new or upgraded monitoring facilities. So Australia is going to be very much to the fore of this monitoring procedure. But one has to ask whether this is going to be enough. Should we be amending this bill, for instance, to include provisions such as the United States legislation, which requires the immediate imposition of sanctions? These are matters which we all need to consider and, indeed, the international community needs to consider. I notice that there are a number of other speakers who wish to participate in this important debate, but these are important matters for us to consider.",40
290,Mrs GALLUS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I could not help but reflect, as I listened to the speakers in this debate, how different it may have been if it had occurred three weeks ago, before the tests in both India and Pakistan. There is no doubt, that aside, that this is a truly tremendous achievement. Going back to my childhood, one of the terrors as I grew up was the threat of nuclear war as both the West and the East anned themselves. America and Russia gathered these nuclear weapons. In the movies we would see the depiction of what this type of weaponry could do to people and to cities. We saw the results of what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I do not think anybody who ever saw those pictures could grow up with anything other than absolute terror at the thought of nuclear war and the use of nuclear weapons. The comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, the CTBT, is something that we as a world can be proud of and look at with hope for the future. By 7 April, 149 countries had signed. As previous speakers have indicated, it was open for signing in September 1996 and by December we had almost 150 signatories. Unfortunately, since then only 13 have ratified. The country that does stand out as not having ratified the treaty is the United States and there is a fear that it will not ratify because of the hostility in the Senate to the idea. Be that as it may, there is a positive side to this. In actually signing the treaty itself, countries have indicated a willingness to move away from nuclear weapons. They will be held to that signature by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. So, even though they have not ratified, international law would indicate that they should intend to keep their commitment to this particular treaty, and not go ahead with nuclear testing. It is heartening that the five major nuclear powers-Britain, France, Russia, China and the USA-have all signed. Of those, I think the United Kingdom and France have also ratified. Since the good news, which is the signing and the beginning of the ratification, we now have what the speakers in this House have alluded to: what has happened in India and Pakistan. It came as a shock to the whole world that this was happening in the subcontinent. There has been in this House today, and in the press on previous occasions, great condemnation of the two countries. I think the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) referred to them as nuclear pariahs. There is no doubt that we in Australia feel great revulsion at what these two countries have done. But now that it is done, we have to ask if this is as bad as it can get, because the countries have come to a point where they now cannot engage each other in war because to do so would mean the annihilation of the subcontinent. There is a stand-off. I am not saying that this is good news but we should not look at it all as the worse possible scenario. We have a stand-off and the two countries now have to get down to talking to each other. They have achieved what they wanted to achieve, which was alluded to by the last speaker-they are members of the big boys nuclear club. Perhaps having achieved that status they can now pull back, have a look at what they have achieved and move forward towards signing the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. India has already made that suggestion. This has been laughed at in this House as being, 'It is a bit late now that you have exploded the bomb, isn't itT But, if India and Pakistan are willing to move back from the threatening position that they have now taken and sign, something positive may come out of this. I would not want, however, to be thought of as a total optimist. It was rather distressing to read an article by Eric Arnett on the test ban treaty. It was written a long time before the tests by India and Pakistan. He was saying what this treaty meant for the future, and he was very positive about the future following the test ban, but he had a rider at the end of his article, and now in the wake of those tests that rider stands a stark reminder to us all. He said: Although the norm of not testing is now universally accepted, and can only be strengthened by more signatures and ratifications of the CTBT, it is still possible that the regime could be undermined by a state resuming its nuclear test programme. And, of course, that is indeed what has happened. But not to end on that ominous note, I would like to take time to congratulate our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, on the work he did to get the test ban treaty up and going: When negotiations stalled, he moved the treaty process to the United Nations where, at the General Assembly, 150 countries signed. China, Russia, the UK and Pakistan insisted that, for the treaty to go into effect, the 44 countries with nuclear reactors had to sign. Perhaps now that India has carried out its nuclear blasts, it will sign along with Pakistan and, hopefully, Korea to make up the 44 countries so that the test ban treaty can finally come into effect. I commend this bill to the House.",42
291,Mr SERCOMBE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Australia, over recent times, has been able to box well above its weight when it comes to important matters on the international agenda, particularly on matters in relation to arms control. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998, which is enjoying bipartisan support, is an example of a very substantial Australian contribution to that international agenda. The record, particularly of the former government in that respect, is extraordinarily strong and one that continually needs to be underlined not only with respect to the comprehensive test ban treaty and Australia's pivotal role in taking that matter forward but also in a range of other areas. For example, the work of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons was very much an agenda setting example of something that Australia provided great leadership in. The words of former Prime Minister Mr Keating when that report was released remain very pertinent to today's circumstances. Mr Keating said: Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most of the second half of century will very likely return-and probably in a much more unstable and multipolar form. The world must extricate itself from the circular ment that we need nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons. In the context of the discussion about the actions of India and Pakistan, those words sound very prescient indeed. Also I think the role of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in matters such as the testing in the International Court of Justice of the legality of the use of nuclear weapons was a very fine example of taking the agenda on nuclear matters forward in world forums and will in history stand as a most important step. Australians continue to play very important roles internationally with respect to arms control. Richard Butler, in his role with the United Nations Special Commission with responsibilities with Iraq, stands out as a fine example. Dr Gee's appointment as Deputy Director of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is another noteworthy example of the important role that Australia has played and continues to play, and supports the notion of Australia's boxing well above its weight in these matters of world affairs. But we do need to take the opportunity of this debate to stress the need for reinvigoration of Australia's role and the need to build on Australia's strength in these areas. It was pleasing just the other day to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) refer to Australia taking a step in that direction through the conference on disarmament and Australia's initiative in the fissile cut-off treaty as being matters which Australia would now be vigorously pursuing. We wish the government well and offer bipartisan support in that and urge the government to put the resources into it that are required. We undoubtedly live in a very dangerous world, particularly after recent events in India and Pakistan with both countries declaring their hands as nuclear weapon states. It is regrettable that Pakistan has followed India's reprehensible example in the action it has taken. It is also, in a very minor way, unfortunate that the House has not had the opportunity to debate a private member's motion that this I put on the Notice Paper a little while ago which condemns those matters, but this debate arguprovides some opportunity to do that. India, by exploding a number of nuclear devices, very much flouted the international norm which was being built and consolidated in respect of nuclear devices and nuclear proliferation. The configuration of the weapons it used was particularly alarming. It exploded a fission weapon, a thermonuclear weapon and some low yield devices, which were particularly destabilising in the context of their potential tactical use in a battlefield situation. India further foreshadowed-prior to the tests by Pakistan-its intention to proceed to develop its ballistic missile delivery system, which is also very alarming. India, in the past, has claimed, I think with some justification, a certain degree of moral authority in world affairs. The circumstances of its independence struggle with the emphasis in that struggle on non-violence and the leadership that India provided to the nonaligned movement in the context of the Cold War were fine examples of a nation which had established a very clear degree of moral authority. Regrettably, its flouting of international norms with respect to nuclear weapons proliferation has burnt that authority very dramatically. It is regrettable that it did not take an example from South Africa which, to the best of my knowledge, is the only state that has actually unilaterally deprived itself of nuclear weapons having acquired them. I understand that Mr de Klerk, in the process of the winding down of the white minority regime in South Africa, played a leading role in disposing of South Africa's six nuclear weapons. As I mentioned before, Australia has played a very prominent role in nuclear test-ban matters and can claim some responsibility for some of the achievements that have been made. Those things are now very much threatened. Whilst India's and Pakistan's security situation is undoubtedly complex, I do not think anyone would suggest that the position of either of them is desperate One has to question very strongly the correlation that seems to exist in the minds of so many leaders of India, particularly, between the capacity to have a nuclear system and its great power aspirations. Given the immensity of the requirements on the subcontinent for economic progress for its own citizens, and for those of its neighbours, and the capacity to unleash the economic power that is inherent on the subcontinent, one would have thought that an example such as Japan and its major strides in terms of grcat power status would have presented a somewhat more pertinent model for India to pursue. The temptations presented to Pakistan by the Indian tests unfortunately have simply been too strong for Pakistan to resist, and it has regrettably followed down the path that India has taken. It is vital that the world demonstrates through sanctions on both India and Pakistan that there is an intention to reinforce the norm against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in real and effective ways. Regrettably, the strength of international reaction, in my view and that of many others, has scarcely been strong enough in that circumstance. Most members would know that, prior to the Pakistani tests, there was a parliamentary delegation from Pakistan in this place last week. The members of that delegation were led by a very senior senator, the President of the Pakistan senate. He was making it abundantly clear, to those in this place that he was speaking to, that their perception was that a number of countries, particularly Russia, France and the United Kingdom, were simply not acting in a way in which the Pakistanis could take any great confidence, in terms of the seriousness of commitment to real and effective action against India. It is noted that, whilst the World Bank is withholding several loans from India, certainly the Pakistani perception in the period after the Indian tests and before their own was that the international reaction, particularly from a number of states, and I have mentioned three, was simply inadequate. That circumstance really does need to be addressed and real and effective action needs to now be taken with - respect to the two states that have breached the norm-and any others-so that a very clear message is sent to other potential nuclear weapons states of the consequences of them also breaching those norms. One does not have to be a grand geostrategist to understand that, as a consequence of the Pakistani actions, there may well be pressure on countries like Iran to consider their position. There are a number of outstanding security issues between Pakistan and Iran, particularly arising from the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. It is very important that the world community communicates pretty strenuously that the consequences of breaching international norms in these respects are going to be very painful indeed. There needs to be some renewed commitment to the international arms control agenda. As I said, Australia is a country that has the capacity to punch above its weight and in these respects really ought to be very active on the international circuit at present in a range of areas. I referred earlier to the comments yesterday of the Minister for Foreign Affairs with respect to the fissile cut-off-a most important initiative that needs to be taken forward. There is a range of other matters where strengthening of international action is required. The missile technology control regime, particularly given the emphasis both India and Pakistan are giving to the deVelopment of ballistic missile systems, ought to be reviewed and strengthened. There is a very strong and powerful obligation on the major nuclear states-the United States and Russia-to give some real commitment to the strategic arms reduction process, START II and III. To the extent that there is any underpinning logic to the Indian position, the failure of the major nuclear states over recent times to take the giant strides that humanity ought to be demanding of them in terms of furthcr deep cuts to their own arsenals is one that the world ought to be looking to them to rectify. Australia ought to be playing a role doing that. There has been a continuing failure, I believe, to get real teeth into the biological weapons convention. This is an area which I believe this government ought to be pursuing-trading in Australia's reputation and standards in arms control matters. As I understand it, there is still no secretariat comparable to that established under the chemical weapons convention with respect to biological weapons. Biological weapons is another category of weapons of mass destruction that is truly terrifying unless the international community takes real steps to can-y control measures forward. That is particularly underlined by the very rapid advances that continue to be made in the biological sciences. There needs also to be a renewed commitment on the part of Australia and other developed nations in the world to serious economic development of countries in south and central Asia. I think the puniness of Australia's commitment in that respect is illustrated by a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs the other day. He offered, prior to the Pakistani tests, a doubling of Australian aid to Pakistan to $6 million if they did not proceed with tests. Such a miserly gesture on the part of the Australian government underlines, I think, the can-ot aspect of the carrot and stick approach that does need to be taken in these matters. In conclusion, there needs to be a renewed commitment on the part of Australia and others in the international community to address the intractable security issues that continue to divide Pakistan and India, particularly the issue of Kashmir, but also the ongoing and disgraceful tragedy that continues to unfold in Afghanistan. These are matters that need to be addressed as a package. I urge the government not to rest on its laurels with this particular bit of legislation, but to get on with the further work that is required.",43
292,Mrs SULLIVAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Moncrieff-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (4.31 p.m.)-I rise to speak on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 as a long standing member of parliament with a strong commitment to nuclear nonin proliferation and to efforts to rid the world of other weapons of mass destruction. An additional member of the ministry speaking on a bill such as this, which is supported by both sides of the House, is unusual. Nevertheless, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I want to highlight the utmost importance the Howard government gives to the comprehensive test ban treaty, particularly in light of recent events in South Asia. I shall, however, endeavour to keep my comments very brief in view of the pressure presently on the House of Representatives to conclude its consideration of a number of important bills this week in order to meet the Senate's cut-off date. As Australia's Special Representative for Demining, I have just returned from the historic Global Humanitarian Demining Conference in Washington, where again it was brought home to me the highest possible priority the international community places on arms control measures-a fact I wish to convey to the members of this House. The impact of a nuclear arms race on fundamental international security cannot be underestimated and must be emphasized, despite the relatively protected and distant perspective we believe we enjoy in Australia. Other speakers have addressed the longer term implications of the CTBT. As parliamentary secretary with responsibility for overseas development assistance, I should like to deal with a particular aspect of Australia's reaction to the nuclear weapons testing in South Asia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) moved quickly after India's testings, and announced on 14 May the suspension of all non-humanitarian aid to that country. This suspension was part of the Howard government's prompt-but balanced-response. It .stands in contrast, sadly, to the dithering seen from the previous Labor government after the announcement of French nuclear testing in 1995, until pushed by the coalition, especially our shadow minister for foreign affairs, and by the Australian public to express the outrage felt in this country at France's actions.",46
293,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Oh, here we gobipartisan debate.",47
294,Mrs SULLIVAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Bipartisan is not the same as being muzzled about the facts. Reflecting our decision that our quarrel is with the Indian and Pakistani governments and not with the people of those countries, programs and projects which deliver humanitarian benefits to the poor will continue. Nearly half of Australia's projects in India have been affected, resulting in a reduction of approximately $3.5 million this financial year. On 29 May, Mr Downer cancelled a doubling (from $2.4 million to $5 million) of Australian bilateral aid to Pakistan next financial year. This increase had been contingent on Pakistan not conducting nuclear tests and was meant to demonstrate Australia's support for Pakistan at what we accepted was a difficult time for that country. It is extremely disappointing that Pakistan chose not to seek a historic opportunity to exercise restraint and to join the international norm against testing, but instead acted in a way which has increased threats to global security arrangements. A number of speakers on both sides of the House have contrasted the development of expensive weapons of mass destruction and the considerable poverty in South Asia. In the context of the community'S concern for the poor, Australia's decision on aid has been entirely appropriate and measured. In my portfolio responsibilities, I have regular contact with Australians involved in overseas aid delivery. I have heard not one word of concern from them about our action. However, it is worth noting that the Labor Party, whose broad support on this and most other foreign policy issues is welcomed, still found it necessary to try to score minor political points in a non-bipartisan way on an issue as serious as nuclear testing. Mr Martin interjecting",47
295,Mrs SULLIVAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I am responding, aren't I? The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), has suggcsted that Australia should support suspension of funding through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This shows ignorance of these institutions' rules which expressly prohibit the consideration of political issues as a factor in decisions on loans to developing countries. It may be that these institutions will defer immediate consideration of loans, but the opposition should bear in mind that many of these loans are designed to alleviate poverty and therefore are humanitari an in nature. The impact on the aid program of testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is a snapshot of the very real implications of ignoring global standards such as the CTBT, and illustrates the significance of the bill bcfore the House. The bill is an important link in Australia's legislative framework to ensure that this country plays no part, either intentionally or unknowingly, in contributing to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Bill complements legislation to implement the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the biological weapons convention and the chemical weapons convention. On the latter convention, I was pleased recently to he able to introduce and debate legislation further strengthening its provisions. The Howard government also looks forward to the outcome of the current biological weapons convention initiative, announced as part of Australia's comprehensive and forward thinking response to Iraq's flouting of United Nations resolutions. We trust that international negotiations will result in further strengthening of that treaty. I should also note that the Howard government hopes to shortly bring to the parliament legislation to implement the anti-personnel mines convention, also known as the Ottawa Treaty. As Special Representative for Demining, I am particularly pleased this step in the process of promoting arms control is progressing. Events in South Asia have shown that the international community, including its collective parliaments, must do all it can to block these grave threats to international security. For Australia, the CTBT bill is a significant part of these efforts.",47
296,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I am also very pleased to support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998. Many of the speakers in this debate have emphasised the importance of the debate coming at this particular time when we have had the dramatic development of the nuclear explosions in India and Pakistan. While I agree with many of the comments made by honourable members, I think what we are really witnessing here-especially if we look at the responses in India and Pakistan to the explosions-is two cultural traditions coming into conflict with one another and bringing into play the most dangerous weapon known to man. This situation is very serious, not merely because they have developed that weapon but because it is an example of what Professor Samuel Huntington has called the clash of civilisations. I want to discuss for a moment what to the situation where not only can you have the phenomena of these two explosions but you can have, in the streets of the cities of Pakistan and India, people celebrating this terrible deed. Professor Huntington, in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order, in 1996 claimed that in the new period after the Cold War there would be a division of the world and conflict of a very big order between different cultural traditions where the emphasthe is would be on ethnic differences, cultural differences and nationalism. This combinadirection tion, according to Professor Huntington, Professor would lead to severe new conflicts in the world and a situation in which there would exactly the sort of thing we see now in relation to India and Pakistan: the developpolicy ment and the possible implementation of weapons of mass destruction in these kinds conflict. When Professor Huntington's thesis came out in 1996, there were a number of peopleformer Senator Evans, who was then foreign minister, others and I-who took the view that this pessimistic view of what would happen in the new world order was wrong and certainly should not be encouraged. We preferred a model of the world post-Cold War which involved an emphasis on multiculturalism, cultural tolerance and understanding between societies of different cultural and religious traditions. That model has also been promoted in the world and exemplified to a considerable degree in the multicultural policy within Australia. We have tried to export it to the world where there are conflicts, saying to people when they are conflicting on the basis of ethnicity, 'Try to understand the other's point of view. Try to understand the cultural traditions of your so-called opponents. Look for what is common in humanity, not what is separating one group from another.' That multicultural approach to the world order is the one which has been encouraged by the United Nations, of course, and by other international bodies. But there is no doubt that there is part truth in what Professor Huntington was saying, that there are in fact has led two phenomena occurring in the modern world, post-Cold War. One is the tendency towards greater globalisation, greater unification of the human race, greater recognition of those things which we have in common as human beings and, on the other hand, there is this other dreaded tendency to emphasise national and ethnic differences and to try to divide people rather than to unite them. How this issue will be resolved is probably most important challenge facing humanity in the 21st century. Will it be resolved in the which has been prophesied by Huntington, or will it be resolved in the direction of those who believe in multiculbe turalism, multiethnicity and in a united humanity? That is the challenge of foreign in the 21st century-whether foreign policy is going to be guided by the approach of which looks at what people have in common or whether foreign policy is going to be guided by the approach which focuses on the differences, as Professor Huntington has done. You have to say in the light of what has happened in India and Pakistan in the last couple of weeks that those proponents of the Huntington thesis would gain great heart. They would look at what has happened and say, 'There you are, you see.' The fact of the matter is you have a clash of civilisations: a Hindu based civilisation, which Huntington identifies, and an Islamic civilisation-and they will not talk to each other. Not only will they not talk to each other, but they will go to the lengths of actually developing nuclear weapons and testing those weapons to the detriment of their own environment. And in order to do what? In order to emphasise the differences between them and to emphasise the fact that they have this power-and to try to chauvinistically claim that they are a superior culture to the other culture. That of tradition is what we do not want encouraged in the modern world; that kind of tradition is a very dangerous one. It is a tradition that we must oppose. The response of the Australian government and the opposition to this issue has been a good one. All concerncd ought to be congratulated for their efforts in pointing out to India and Pakistan that the world community considers these kinds of actions not only totally unacceptable but also to be based on the wrong premises as to where the world should be going in the future. The premises of cultural superiority or cultural separateness are the wrong premises. Huntington's thesis has to be rejected. What has to be put forward is an alternate thesis: that societies in the future will be multi ethnic, multicultural and tolerant of other cultural traditions. If that going to be the case, then this excessive nationalism, this excessive chauvinism, the idea of being proud that your society-which is a poor society-has an atomic bomb ought to be rejected. In its place there ought to be, as I mentioned, a world which recognises that, notwithstanding the cultural traditions of every country, notwithstanding cultural differences, there are things that bind us together as one human race; and one of those things is that We should get rid of nuclear weapons. We certainly should not continue with the testing of any more nuclear weapons within this planet not only because of the environmental impact but because nuclear weapons themselves do not solve any problems. All they do is make the problems of humanity more serious. As I said earlier, 21st century foreign policy will be dealing with this issue. I am hopeful that the optimists, the people who believe that we can bring people of different cultural traditions together to work together, will come forward and be counted in the world of the 21st century; otherwise, we face a very dire future.",48
297,Mr HARDGRAVE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"It is a unique honour to be able to stand in the Australian federal parliament to support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban kind Treaty Bill 1998, something that is not just morally correct and not just-to borrow the phrase-politically correct but also just darned good sense and downright human. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), at the table, should be congratulated for the role that he played-and, to be fair, his predecessor played-in promoting the need for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty to be a worldwide done deal. It is a matter of fact that 149 countries have signed the document and that 13 have ratified it. Although I do not wish to breach standing orders by pre-empting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, it is pretty obvious there would be a great deal of support for Australia also ratifying this particular treaty. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, like you, I am concerned about my planet, our fragile earth. is I am not pretending to be a seismologist, an earthquake expert, but if you start blowing up nuclear devices into the outer crust of this planet and you start doing it en masse, as we have seen with some 11 tests on the Indian subcontinent, it stands to reason that something is going to give. I apologise to the foreign minister if I cause him any diplomatic difficulty with this next statement, but it seems to me that India and Pakistan have to account for possibly seriously affecting matters in their general region to the point where the blood of 3,000 or 4,000 Afghanistani people is on their hands as a result of the recent earthquake there and where 30,000 people are homeless. I understand that there are some experts who have suggested that the events are not connected. As I said, I am not an expert, but it still strikes me as feasible and conceivable that if you are going to let off these sorts of devices, as the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said, out of some sort of nationalistic oneupmanship, you have to then be accountable for some of the unintended consequences. There have been 11 tests of nuclear devices in the Indian subcontinent-just up the road; down the street from Australia in fact. The Australian plate is connected firmly to the Indian plate, which has a natural tendency to keep driving up the Himalayas as the tectonic plates of the earth's crust continue to move. That we have seen a great earthquake just around the comer worries me greatly, and I think stands, if for no other reason, a willing testament to the futility of the Indian and Pakistani one-upmanship. Now we see that India are considering the concept of another test. Australian Associated Press reported the other day that, while they are reiterating an offer of a 'no first strike pact' with Pakistan aimed at ensuring that the two enemies never launch a nuclear attack on each other, Pakistani officials have rejected the idea out of hand. So now we are looking at the idea of new nuclear tests. According to the Pakistanis, the Indians are planning more tests in the first or second week of July. Who knows if that is right or wrong, but what sort of message does it send to India? It sends them the message that maybe they should be planning because that is what the Pakistanis are planning. What an absolute stupidity to think that grown humans could be conducting themselves in this way, particularly in a nation such as India where its northern province of Uttar Pradesh has sought World Bank aid worth $1.33 billion for new irrigation projects. The irrigation minister of that state in recent days has said that the state's rising population made it essential to make plans for revamping the agriculture and irrigation facilities because they were worried that the state may face 'an acute food grain shortage by the year 2000'. They can find all of this money to blow up nuclear devices but there is a basic need for food. There is a food shortage. What an outrage! What an absolute outrage to the good common sense of the people of India and the absolute desperation that they find themselves in as their government conducts a Marie Antoinette approach to foreign policy. They are basically saying, 'Let them celebrate a nuclear device. Let's not feed the poor.' I think that is an absolute disgrace. I am very pleased to lend strength to the foreign minister in his efforts to promote the need for a declaration of this type to be ratified right around the world. It is extraordinary when you look down the list of 149 signatures that there is no India and there is no Pakistan. Whilst I am sure all in this place defend the sovereign right of any nation to defend itself, whilst I am sure everybody in this chamber and everybody in this nation would defend the sovereign right of people of a nation to be proud of their traditions, their cultures, their beliefs and what made their nation into what it is today, I am also certain people in this chamber universally-as we seem to have bipartisan support on this motion-will condemn a nation which forgets it is part of the global village, that the rights we all enjoy as citizens of this nation, that the rights most human beings enjoy are not being exercised with a due amount of responsibility. We enter into treaties and obligations around the world generally freely, and as a result we receive a great deal of rights, but we have to exercise certain responsibilities. The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is no different to any other agreement that is sensibly and soberly entered into. I would invite-and I am sure there are many people in my electorate of Moreton who would want me to-India and Pakistan to join with the rest of the world to cease their nuclear testing immediately and to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty as a matter of urgency. I am certain from the calls from people within my electorate that, despite the everyday concerns they have about their employment prospects and the futures for their own families, they realise that all of those everyday concerns, those understandable human aspirations of improving themselves, of working hard and striving for some success, could all go down the drain if we continue to have a world that is on the brink of some nuclear catastrophe. I have never been alarmist in my approach. I reject those who are alarmist, but the events of the last couple of weeks have brought home very clearly to me that it behoves the major powers of the world, the nations who wish to exercise responsibility-and there are 149 nations which believe they have a responsibility as far as banning nuclear tests are concerned-to stand their ground and encourage those nations that are not willing to exercise such responsibility to think that all the basic human aspirations of independent citizens in this nation could be put at risk by some nations to our near north. For so many reasons, this bill before us today is a vital one. It is vital to our everyday future as well as the future of our fragile planet. I commend the bill to the House.",49
298,Mr DOWNER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"in reply-I want to begin by thanking the dozen or so members who have spoken in this debate on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998. It has been a very good opportunity for those interested in these issues-and I suspect at this time in our history most Australians are-to gauge the feeling of the Australian parliament on the whole issue of nuclear testing and nuclear non-proliferation. What is striking is that there is a unanimity of view right across the House of Representatives, which I think pretty much reflects the view that you find right around the Australian community: that is, we should take a strong stand in our foreign policy in support of nuclear non-proliferation. We should take a strong stand against proliferation itself where we may see it occurring. We should continue to maintain the very significant reputation Australia has built up over probably 30 or so years since we signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. As a leading country in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, we do this because it is in our national interests. We know it is also in the interests of the international community. We believe it is a humanitarian policy to pursue. It clearly is in our interests as a nonnuclear weapon state for our regional environment, even broadly defined, to be free of nuclear weapons. It is not entirely free of nuclear weapons. We have China as a nuclear weapon state, and we have the nuclear initiatives of India and Pakistan in the last few weeks in May, but otherwise we have a region which is free of nuclear weapons. It is very important to us that we keep it just that way. I would like to refer to some of the points that have been made by members. The opposition spokesman, the member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Brereton), very accurately pointed to the history of Australia's involvement in this issue--in particular, the comprehensive test ban treaty, to which this bill relates. Just about all other speakers referred to Australia's involvement in the evolution of the comprehensive test ban treaty. Under the previous government and my predecessor, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), Australia played a very active role in the conference on disarmament in putting together the text of the comprehensive test ban treaty. I recall during the 1996 election campaign, when I was opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, being contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to a particular text that they wanted put forward. I was asked whether we as the opposition would agree to that text being put forward during the period of the election campaign, which we readily did. The problem in the conference on disarma-ment, though, was that in the end it was not possible to get India and Pakistan to agree to a comprehensive test ban treaty text, and the conference on disannament requires unanimity and consensus for such texts to be agreed. that Australia then took that text as it stood to New York, to the United Nations General Assembly. We succeeded in having the General Assembly pass a resolution bringing to life the text, and the comprehensive test ban treaty was born. So there is no doubt that Australia has a great deal to be proud of and all Australians have a great deal to be proud of in the role we played in putting together the comprehensive test ban treaty. As I said, many members have been gracious enough to refer to that not only in relation to my role but, importantly, also in relation to the role of my predecessor, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). There has been activism on this issue from both sides. The opposition spokesman, and indeed all others, spoke about the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests. I appreciate the fact that the opposition and, to the best of my knowledge, the minor parties, with the possible exception of Senator Bob Brown, have supported the strong stand that the government has taken on Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests. I think Senator Brown may have had an even more elaborate program that he would like implemented, but in any case there has been widespread agreement with and support for what the government has done. There has not been in the media, I notice. I saw an article in I think it was the Weekend Australian suggesting that we should have gone much softer on this issue and I saw an editorial in the Australian Financial Review taking that same position. It is worthwhile saying something about why we do take the stand we take on the Indian and Pakistani tests. First of all, we are obviously very concerned about the contribution those tests have made to an increase in tensions on the Indian subcontinent. It is simply incontestable that those tests have caused a substantial increase in tensions and have created a very unfortunate and very dangerous security environment on the subcontinent, and that the tests have achieved that and nothing else. So it is understandable that, as an Indian Ocean littoral state ourselves, we would wish to express very deep concern about actions taken by countries in our broadly defined region which increase tensions. We do not want to see that. The second thing we want to do is encourage India and Pakistan to do the honourable thing, that is, to join most of the rest of the world in signing up to the comprehensive test ban treaty. The member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) made quite a point of the fact that 149 countries have signed the comprehensive test ban treaty. That means not many have not, and India and Pakistan are notable in that they have not. We cannot, of course, reverse the past. We cannot undo the fact that they have conducted these nuclear tests, so we have to look to the future. We look to a more constructive future, and India and Pakistan can help themselves in terms of their standing in the international community and their contribution to global peace by signing up to the comprehensive test ban treaty. It is fair to say that every country has a responsibility to contribute to global peace. No country should take the view that it is somebody else's role, that somebody else ought to do it. They should not take that view, and that includes India and Pakistan. They do have a contribution to make to global peace, and detonating nuclear devices is the reverse. That is not contributing to global peace. They need to join the mainstream of the international community and they need to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty. It is noteworthy that India and Pakistan are two of, I think, it is only five countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the other three being Israel, Cuba and Brazil, although Brazil has now committed itself to signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and, I believe, will do so before too long. India and Pakistan stand out very prominently as countries that will not go along with that regime, and I think that is deeply regrettable. Again, they need to understand that they must join the mainstream of the international community and themselves contribute to a more peaceful world, and they can do that by signing that treaty. That brings me to the cut-off treaty which the Australian government has been working very hard to get under way in the conference on disarmament in Geneva. Some say that the conference on disarmament has not been successful in recent years ever since the comprehensive test ban treaty was taken out of the conference on disarmament by Australia to the United Nations General Assembly, and that analysis is right. The conference on disarmament in 1997 was a profound disappointment. I went in early 1997, as well as early this year, to Geneva and addressed the conference on disarmament. Its hall was once the home of the League of Nations before the Second World War, and I hope that the fact that a conference on disarmament meets in the same chamber as the League of Nations is not an ill omen. But the fact is that the conference on disarmament has wasted a year, last year, by doing nothing on nuclear disarmament, or on landmines, for that matter. We hoped it would do more. This year we have reaffirmed our commitment to the conference on disarmament and we have encouraged the conference on disarmament to do more on the issue of Iandmines-l will not go into that today-but also to initiate negotiations to achieve a fissile material cut-off treaty. If we can achieve that and if we can get India and Pakistan, as well as the rest of the world, to sign up to a cutoff treaty, in particular the nuclear weapons states and the nuclear threshold states, that will be a very significant contribution to the non-proliferation regime. We are putting an enormous amount of effort into this. We were before the Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and we still are putting a great deal of effort into getting that cut-off treaty up and running. The third reason why we take a strong stand on Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing-I think this is something that those critics in the editorial in the Financial Review and the columnist in the Australian seem to miss-is that countries which conduct nuclear tests which fly in the face of the nuclear non-proliferation regime need to understand that they do so at a price, that you cannot do this sort of thing. You cannot defy the will of just about all of the world and create a more dangerous world without paying a price. That is a warning to others, to the other nuclear threshold states, to other countries that may consider that, if it is all right by India and Pakistan, it is all right by them to take the nuclear option. We must stop countries thinking that is ever going to be worthwhile. That is why it is very important that Australia, the United States and other countries around the world take a strong stand against nuclear testing whenever it occurs. We took a strong stand against French nuclear testing; there was a bit of kerfuffle early on but we ended up taking a strong stand against it. We have pretty much followed the pattern in our response to Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing, and we have taken the same sorts of measures. Our view is as strongly opposed to Indian and Pakistani testing as it was to French testing, and we will continue to take a strong stand because we believe so passionately in the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We believe in it morally, politically and in our own national interest. I think a lot of people were beginning to take its success for granted until recently, but it is clear that you cannot take it for granted. It is clear that countries like Australia have to do everything they can to keep the nuclear non-proliferation regime alive. This reminds me to draw attention to one argument that the Indians and the Pakistanis have been using-particularly the Indians, I might say-which is that in the world as. we have it, with five nuclear weapons states, there was nuclear apartheid and that was not fair. The argument was that there were five nuclear weapons states and the other 190 or so countries in the world were non-nuclear weapons states, and therefore the world was biased in favour of the five. That argument leads one to conclude that every country, or at least every capable country, should be a nuclear weapon state. If that Indian argument was right, then the 44 or so countries which are regarded as nuclear capable, including this one, should become nuclear weapon states so that there is no such thing as nuclear apartheid. I think that argument is absolutely absurd. If nuclear proliferation continues as we have seen it during the month of May 1998, then the dream of a nuclear weapon free world that so many people around the world have will simply be unachievable. It would be unachievable if 44 or so countries around the world were to become nuclear weapon states. We have got to stop it. We have got to stop it for a lot of reasons and it is a very important component of our diplomacy that we do our best to stop it. Other members made very valuable comments. The member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who has been so active on these issues, made the point that it was in Australia's national interest to be activist on these issues. The member for Denison (Mr Kerr), referred to the work of the Canberra Commission as being valuable. The fissile material cut-off treaty, which is being promoted very much by Australia, is one of the initiatives that carne from what I often call the 'road map' produced by the Canberra Commission. The member for Groom ended by making some points about uranium mining. This is the old story: apparently if we mine and export uranium we are contributing to nuclear proliferation. Let me put it to you that I think the contrary argument is true. We mine and export uranium according to a nuclear safeguards policy, so anybody who buys uranium from us is prohibited from using Australian origin material for military purposes of any kind. Therefore, we can guarantee that at least some of the uranium sold in the world can never be used for nuclear weapons or for military purposes. If we dropped out, there would still be a nuclear power industry, there would still he uranium exports and there would still be uranium mining but there would be less of a control on it than there is with Australia being part of the industry. I know that is not an easy argument to sell to everyhodyapparently it is impossible to sell to the member for Denison-but it is a profoundly important argument. It works on the assumption that we are a very responsible country and, as the foreign minister of this country, I am very happy to say that we are. The member for Fadden (Mr Jull) referred to his time at the United Nations and the role he played there. I remember well when we were in opposition and he was one of the parliamentary delegates at the General Assembly. He also referred to our initiative for the conference on disarmament, which is to meet in a special session today. It will meet during the evening, our time, in Geneva, to consider what the Indians and Pakistanis have just done. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) and the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) all had very valuable and constructive remarks to make. The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) talked about the need to reject the Huntington thesis. I will take the opportunity to support what he said. He is absolutely right. We do not want a world dominated by cultural chauvinism or excessive nationalism. We do want a world that toierates, encourages and enjoys cultural diversity. If you do not have a world that can understand that, you will not have a world that works together very well. So 'no' to the Huntington thesis and 'yes' to the member for Caiwell in opposing it. This is a good point to conclude on because he was one of the members who pointed to the irrationality of nuclear weapons, and it is worth thinking about this argument. When I spoke to the Indian and Pakistani high commissioners, I made a point to them which they could not answer. I said to the Indian High Commissioner, 'You have developed, at a cost of billions of dollars, this nuclear capacity. Would you use it on Karachi? Could you envisage a circumstance when you would detonate a nuclear device over Karachi and kill 12 million people? Could you imagine ever doing that?' What could he say to that argument? He can say nothing. I said the same to the Pakistani High Commissioner: 'Can you imagine detonating a nuclear device over Mumbai? Can you imagine doing it over New Delhi and killing millions and millions of people?' Of course, in the end, they cannot. If it is true that they never could do it, then why are theycountries which have per capita GDPs which are a fraction of Australia's-wasting so many billions of dollars? Billions of dollars are being spent on these nuclear programs and yet they cannot say whether they would ever use it. Of course, if they did use the weapons and wipe out millions and millions of people, the world would condemn them for all time. It would be an unforgivable thing to do, and I do not believe that this testing which could lead to weapons-and we hope it will not-is anything more than an obscene status symbol. And it costs so much for countries which need so much. That, I think, is a real tragedy. I thank the House for the strong support it has given to the government's bill and to the efforts by the government in the area of nuclear non-proliferation. Also, let me reiterate that the previous government did a very good job in this area as well, as did its predecessor. It is a great Australian tradition, one that this government has not only lived up to but will continue to live up to. We are very proud of what we have done. I think Australia has taken a very principled stand, consistent with our national interest, on these issues. I am pleased that the House so strongly supports what we have been doing. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in detail Bill-hy leave-taken as a whole.",51

In its current form the bill does not specify to whom the minister's powers under the proposed act may be delegated. The government's amendment prescribes these persons as the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, members of the Senior Executive Service of that department and the Director of the Comprehensive Test Ban Office, which will be the administrative authority established under the proposed act. This amendment is made in accordance with one of the principles of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, namely, that bills should not make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers. The Senate committee has drawn this to our attention and we are happy to move this amendment. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Downer)-by leave-read a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",55
300,Mr OKEEFE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"What we see here in the resumption of the second reading debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998 subsecis a day of reckoning in some ways for the government in relation to something which it described as a 'key measure' of the integrated rural policy package entitled AgricultureAdvancing Australia, which was announced and launched in September last year. I will come back to those words, Mr Deputy Speaker, because you may remember that in September last year with great fanfare the government announced that, after a long and exhaustive overhaul of all of Labor's programs for assistance for farmers in various need of government assistance, they were not going to just simply continue Labor's programs in their first budget; they were going to scrap Labor's programs and come in with this brand new integrated rural package to show they meant business for the farm sector in Australia. This was after many years of them spending their time traipsing around rural Australia, talking about how Labor did not understand farming, did not understand farmers and never provided properly for them in the budget, We had all that build-up-and in fact it became quite drawn out-but then we had the day of the big announcement in September last year. We discovered when it all came down to taws that of a package of $517 million, if I remember correctly, the National Farmers Federation-not me-had worked out within 24 hours that at best there was $30 million of new money-and my figure was $17 million-and that in fact all thcy had come back with was $500 miJIion worth of programs which Labor already had in the budget. Every one of those programs was renamed and hardly any of the conditions changed. If you talk to any farmer in Australia and ask him or her, 'What actually is different in the AAA package?' they will say, 'Hell, I don't know,' and they would be absolutely right to say that. But one thing was marginally different and it is described in the legislation here todayand I am reiterating this for a point which I will come to. In the explanatory memorandum of this bill the words used are: This Bill gives effect to one of the key measureshave and I will repeat those wordsone of the key measuresof the policy package. What does it do? It introduces-listen to the description-a three year 'window of opportunity' which, the government purported, would provide the older generation who were ready to move off their farm the opportunity to hand the farm over to the younger generation and still qualify for the pension. That was basically the aim: to enable them to transfer the farm assets and move out. On the day this was announced I had a quick look at it and described it the following day as a 'sad rural hoax'. I remember my words because I was pilloried by the minister and by most of the hugely enthusiastic farm lobby. I described it as a 'sad rural hoax' because, from my experience and having read through the conditions once, my immediate qucstion was: who could qualify? That is exactly what has transpired. And I find it laughable that the government could be introducing this bill using these terms-'a key measure' to provide a three-year 'window of opportunity' . On the day the package was launched in September last year-nine months ago-the statement in respect of this particular measure said that this initiative was: · .. a comprehensive response by the government to the many challenges facing the farm sector. On the issue of retiring farmers it said: The intergenerational transfer of the family farm from older farmers to younger generations is a major issue in rural Australia. I will use those words again-'a major issue in rural Australia'. One assumes therefore that this must be a major response. In the press release issued on the day, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) described it as: · . . assistance to allow older farmers to transfer ownership ... estimated cost $76.6 million. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) issued a statement on the same day, because this was pretty big stuff; this was going right to the heart of the constituency-'Look what we done for you.' The Prime Minister in the highlights to this press release said the package: · .. brings together a number of reforms to lift t-e viability of farmers into the future and lay the baSIS for greater self reliance. It also provides scope for farmers to exit with dignity if they so desire. Included in there was a gifting moratorium. In other words, this was referred to widely. In the 'Highlights at a glance' attached to the Prime Minister's release, the fifth dot point says: . . . assistance to allow older farmers to transfer ownership of the family farm . . . I know I am labouring the point, but I am doing it for this reason: it was a sad hoax to come out responding to what you perceived to be 'a major issue in rural Australia' and then produce this package. In the Senate estimates hearings today we were told the figure. Nine months later it is not the 10,000 family farms that were quoted on 19 September and not the 2,000 family farms quoted in the Senate a couple of months ago. What is the figure today? The figure quoted to a Senate estimates committee today was 14 successful applications-a major rural initiative! I described it on day one as 'a sad hoax' in that the guidelines rule out anybody who really should be able to apply. Nine months later what do we find? Fourteen successful cases. You are entitled to ask: was I right in describing this as a hoax or was it just a huge case of incompetence from the Prime Minister down? How could members of a government who claim to have been in touch with the rural constituency, who had a massive landslide towards them in rural Australia at the last election, who claimed to know and understand these issues and who bagged Labor mercilessly for not understanding and responding to these issues sit around a cabinet table, go through the provisions of their rural package with a fine tooth comb-because it is a $500 million package, even though it is only Labor's programs re-badged, and even the dollars are the same-have a massive launch by the Prime Minister and get something as basic as this so wrong? Are they incompetent or was it a deliberate hoax perpetrated on what they claim to be their own constituency? My answer to that question is that is was both. It was incompetence at the time. I cannot conceive that the Prime Minister or the minister or any of the department officials giving the advice-wherever it came fromwould have started off on day one, knowing that this day of reckoning would arrive tonight, and proceed. I cannot believe that they would have done that. Maybe they did. If they did it was a hoax and it was incompetent. It was not just my words that afternoon or those of the National Farmers Federation 24 hours later-'Oh, hang on, there's not so much new in this after all.' Certainly by 23 September, a fortnight or so later, we had the first questions raised about this, apart from those which came from me. This figure of 10,000 was not a figure I made up. This was the figure that the government put out in the marketplace as of day one. I quote from the Land of 23 October last year, a rural farm journal widely read on the east coast of Australia. The first paragraph of an article by one of the rural journalists, Ian Paterson, states: The farm handover gifting moratorium-part of the Federal Government's $500 million ""AgricultureAdvancing Australia"" package-wuld allow as many as 10,000 retirement-age farmers to pass on the farm to their offspring and immediately get the Age Pension. It was not myself or journalists making up the figure. This was the figure being put out by the government and its press team. If you know you are going to come to a day of reckoning like today, you do not market a figure like that. You do not market a figure of 10,000 when you know it is going to be 14. I can only assume that, at the time, the government thought that lots of these farm families would qualify. What that tells me is that at the time they were incompetent and all those ministers and backbenchers who had claimed to be in touch with the rural constituency did not understand what a farm is worth, how much income a farm has to generate and that hardly anybody could qualify under the criteria they set. In October last year, the first public utterances-apart from mine-started to come forward. Ian Donges, the then President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, now the President of the NFF, wrote a letter to the editor of the Australian. This is my first public opportunity to congratulate Ian on having been appointed to that position. I have considerable regard for Ian. I think he knows his stuff. He demonstrated that in this letter back in October last year when he said: Farmers will face stringent tests, and it remains to be seen how many can take advantage of this initiative. On 30 October, the New South Wales Farmers Association put out a press release entitled 'Farmers urged to phone on changes to age pension assistance'. The chairman of their rural affairs committee, John Cobb, is quoted as saying that 'overly stringent eligibility criteria are likely to significantly reduce the number of potential beneficiaries of the program'. He went on to say: The expectations of farm families have been raised significantIyOf course they have been raised significantly. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy boasted about it. They put it out in the Land and everywhere else that the figure would be to,OOO. As John Cobb continued to say: . .. expectations have been raised . .. by the announcement of this measure, yet anecdotally, it seems clear that very few families are likely eligible for the measure. So O'Keefe said on 14 September that this was a sad hoax and no-one would qualify. 30 October the government had the New South Wales Farmers Association saying very few families were likely to be eligible. On top of this came the nursing home fiasco. You might remember back then that the government had made its announcements on the new charges for nursing home entry fees and the application of the gifting sions. It soon became clear that here was another part of the incompetence chain behas cause, within 10 seconds flat, when the a minute. minister was asked in here by me, 'Does a farm handed over under the gifting provisions for the AAA package mean that you will have to pay the nursing home entrance fee; in other words, is it exempt from the new measure?' the bumbled answer was, 'God, we haven't thought of that.' Here was a case where the same people sitting around the cabinet table not only made an absolute mess of this program but also did not think of the relationship with another that they were about to drop on the communitold ty, which was probably being discussed on the same day. What on earth is going on around this cabinet table? After a few quesexample tions and heaps of embarrassment, finally there was an announcement: yes, a farm that is handed over under the intergenerational transfer provision will be exempt from the gifting provisions of the assets test for nursing homes. But, of course, what none of us twigged to then was that that was not nearly as generous an announcement as it sounded on the day because none of us knew that, nine months later, there would be only 14 of them. They thought it would be to,OOO. We knew it would not be anything like tO,OOO, but none of us conceived it would be 14. Then the penny started to drop. By 20 January the spokesman for the National Farmers Federation, Mr Douglas, made a statement and described the limits as unreasonable. His words were: It might be a joke but we are still looking for the eligible farmer. They could not find anyone who qualified. to be The headline in this particular country newspaper was, 'Ridiculous conditions placed on farmers'. That is the fact of it. The editor of By that newspaper, the Daily Liberal in New South Wales, had it dead right-ridiculous that conditions had been placed on farmers. There is a point to me going through this chronology because what might have been incompetence became a hoax. By the time this bill was introduced into this parliament for its second reading, the government had provihad nine months to understand what had happened. It had nine months and yet nothing been changed. I will come back to that in On 18 May the New South Wales Farmers news release was headed, perfectly correctly, not 'Farmers Retirement Assistance Scheme unworkable' . Then, in the analysis of this bill by the Senate estimates committee on social security and veteran's affairs, they discovered not only that the conditions were absurd but also that there were taxation and legal implications associated with the intergenerational transfer which the government, again, had not one thought of. The Senate committee has been that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is in discussions with the Taxation Office. Isn't that fabulous? Every we have to date of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy having a discussion with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about issues which affect the farm sector show that the Treasurer comes out on top and the B team lose again. I had not thought of this at the time, but I would not be hanging my hat on the DPIE having successful talks with Treasury about a measure that works for 14 families. What we have is not only massive incompetence but also a sad hoax. I go back to that original statement in the launch, which described this as a major initiative and something that was rcsponding to 'a major issue in rural Australia'. Even after the last nine months of this whole sorry hoax unfolding, they still brought this bill into the House today and used the words that I started off with-this bill gives effect to one of the 'key measures'. How could something that benefits a handful of families be a key measure in anything? What are they trying to say? How can you describe it as a window of opportunity when it works only for a handful of people because you have put absurdly stringent conditions on it? That is why I say it has moved from incompetence to a deliberate attempt to deceive people by saying that it is what they said it was on day one. When the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who is at the table today, sat at the cabinet table discussing this particular issue, I do not know whether they knew that it was the mess that it is. But certainly the Treasurer and the finance minister are laughing now because there are allocations in the budget of several million dollars over four years. I think the figure, if I remember correctly, is something of the order of $60 million; I have the exact figures here but I will not dig them out. Whatever the figures are, we all now know that they are going to be left over. They are going to be part of the surplus for the tax cuts because they are certainly not going to be used in the intergenerational transfer of funds. To sum up, the opposition has, from day one, supported the principle of facilitating the intergenerational transfer of funds and we still do. Therefore, we are giving passage of the bill without any impediment in the parliament. But I take this opportunity to make it very clear that I was absolutely right on day one when I described this as a sad hoax. It demonstrates both incompetence and deception on the part of the government to have done this, to have not understood in the first place what they were doing but to have continued to perpetrate it and to try to describe it in this legislation as a 'key measure'. As I said before, when the negotiations take place between DPIE and Treasury it will be yet another case of the B team-the Nationalsbeing rolled by the A team. In both cases, none of it will be of much benefit to the farm sector.",55
301,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (5.44 p.m.)The Australian farm has traditionally and typically been occupied and operated by successive generations of the same family. Its value is of no consequence to them because there is no intention that it be realised. As a business, its value increases constantly because to remain competitive the occupier must purchase ever larger and more efficient machinery at considerable cost. Wise farmers have learnt that the seasonal and cyclical factors of farming preclude excessive borrowing. So machinery, whilst of a capital nature, represents a continuous drain on gross farm income. It is not unusual in my electorate today for the replacement of a tractor to cost $200,000 and for the replacement of a self-propelled header to cost $300,000, and fanners are now finding it necessary to purchase self-propelled spraying equipment valued at $250,000. We continually hear of increased productivity and all the new farming techniques that exist, but the reality is that this highly expensive capital equipment simply allows grain growers, particularly in the marginal areas-which, by any international comparison, is most of the Australian grain growing areas-to get crops into the ground with the first shower of rain. I was inspecting a work training proposal the other day in a major engineering works in Perth, and we were looking at a piece of seeding equipment which can achieve seeding at the rate of one acre per minute. Crops can be put in quickly and can benefit from following rains, and that is a major contributor to the crops that are being produced in the country today. But that does not alter the fact that the farmer's balance sheet looks brilliant. On face value, they are very wealthy people, but in fact there is a constant demand on their cash flows simply to keep up with the demands of new machinery. In other words, whilst farming is technically asset rich, it is typically net cash flow poor, even in a good season. Consequently, modern-day farming simply lacks the net profit-notwithstanding assets measured in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not in the millions-to support retiring members of a family . Australia's social seeurity laws apply both income and assets tests to the granting of age pensions. The ownership of a family farm obviously resides with the retiring partners or the senior members of the family. So a pension is not available simply on the measure of the assets tied up in a farm that nobody really wishes to realise. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998-with the conditions I will mention-is aimed at changing that situation. As the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has advised the House, it is not generous but it is the first time any government has attempted to address the problems I have just identified. The member for Burke quoted from the media that we claimed that there would be some 10,000 farmers eligible. The media may have said so but, in the documentation provided to me by the Department of Social Security and the minister's office, we said at the time that only 1,800 farms would be eligible with possibly another 300 being eligible for the Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions. So it is not fair to say that 10,000 farmers were told they could be eligible. I am quite happy to accept the fact that at this stage only 14 people have made themselves available in nine months, but that has to be read in the context of the complexities of transferring one's farm. It is not just a case of ringing up Social Security and saying, 'I've made a decision that the kids can have the farm; send the pension,' there are all the complexities that still exist in terms of transferring the family farm. There is also the problem of the conservatism of the older owners and whether they really want to take this step. Notwithstanding the assistance that arises from them no longer being a financial burden on the farm and leaving it to the younger members to support their own families, they worry about what their children might do-whether they will mortgage the farm, whether they will sell it the day after it has been given to them and so on. So there are many reasons why this might not happen. This measure was targeted to those people whose net assets were not in excess of $500,000. I have already acquainted the parliament with the fact that in my electorate that much money could represent two pieces of machinery. It is nothing. But then there is the fact that many of those people who would fit this criteria are those where the pressures of borrowing-due to drought or for whatever other reason-have risen to the point where they might be occupying a property with a marketable value of $1.5 million but they owe $1 million. If that sounds a ridiculous situation, let me say that many farms in my electorate would have to outlay $250,000 just to put a crop in the ground. If it docs not rain, that just disappears in front of your eyes and you are back there next year having to spend another $250,000. So you can see how quickly those sorts of debt levels can arise. There is absolutely no doubt that this measure will help some people-probably not the 1,800 or 2,100 who are eligible. We cannot criticise positive measures, but we can point out to the government in this forum that it probably does need to be revised in certain ways. It should be recognised that, for the measure to have a broader effect, particularly in the farming activities in my electorate, we need to look at capital values that are substantially higher than $500,000-$500,000 of net assets and all the various applications that can be made to that to increase that figure through partnerships, et cetera. We can probably in all cases leave the income measure where it is, which offsets that. If a family farm is able to deliver a comfortable living to the retiring parents and the incumbent children, I do not think too many of them are going to swap that for the pension. If a farm of considerable value generates very low profits to the retiring parents-in the concept that has been put forward in this legislation, we say that the income they have been taking out of the place should not exceed the pension levels-that could be left as a test that better measured the hardship. But it should be recognised that the farm could still be worth $1 million. As I have explained, that is not much in farming. And it is of no value whatsoever unless you intend to sell it. This is an issue that we need to look at-an increase in the actual value or limits put on the asset value, but there is not necessarily a change to the other side of it. I want to make one exception to that, which was drawn to my attention by a constituent, that is, where the retiring member of the family is, for instance, occupying a nursing home. Remember that they are asset tested out of all the support that a typical pensioner would receive in a nursing home. But the payments the incumbent family on the farm have to pay to keep their retired family member or members in a nursing home are vastly more than the pension. As such, it is a rather unfair measure, where people meet that sort of cost and are then told, 'Well, you are well off.' Clearly, they are not. The constituent who contacted me had to take up farm work as a shearer to make up the difference between supporting his mother in a nursing home and supporting his own family on a farm that had an asset value well in excess of the limits that are replaced by this measure. I am also concerned that we did not give people the opportunity-particularly considering that this is a finite measure; I think people have to take this decision within three yearsto place their affairs in this thing called a that everybody wants to blackguard these days. Trusts are ideal for families to manage their property assets and to allow them to transfer from generation to generation without having to go back to the state land authorities and pay very substantial transfer fees and stamp duties in the process. A trust is for that purpose. It is about time people realised that all of the tax advantages of a trust are available to a partnership. All the advantages of a trust or a partnership in terms of income splitting are available to a PAYE family where four or five people have separate incomes. The fact that they earn them separately from different employers gives them the same right to access additional tax free thresholds. The fact that three or four family members might work on a farm but take the income back through a trust is no different. It is really time outside of the big end of town that the use of a trust is not maligned in the way it is in terms of tax results. As a measure, why not say, 'Look, we understand how a family farm works. We understand what it is and that it has no value because you do not want to sell it. Why don't we just let it get into a trust situation and then say that, as such, it is not an asset that affects, in its capital sense, the rights of one-time beneficiaries of the trust to a pension'? It is a simple fact that farming has always been difficult, but with prices today that in real terms are substantially below what they have been in the past it is impossible for successive generations. There could be three generations quite simply trying to get income out of the same property. I think we recognise that these people are in hardship and they should have access to the pension. I would like to think that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), in considering this issue for the future, will take some of my representations into account. But I do reject the views of the member for Burke when he said that it was a cruel hoax. You cannot say that any positive measure is a cruel hoax. The facts are on the table. If some people's expectations were substantially above that, they cannot complain that they were trust hoaxed because the conditions were put out. They can be improved as time goes by. I thank the government for what it has done so far.",59
302,Mr ANDREN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I listened with interest to the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the points he raised. He rightly points out the need to protect the family farm as part of our rural social fabric; it is essential. This move by the government is very welcome, although there are aspects of it which are not, which the member for O'Connor did point out. It is a bit cruel for the opposition to paint it as a hoax because, as the member for O'Connor points out, whatever the weakness and whatever the need for some sort of amendment, it is very much the first time government has initiated such a move. The Labor opposition should be mindful of that fact because it had an opportunity over 13 years to introduce similar measures over a period of extreme hardship on the land when the commodity crash of the middle to late 1980s severely impacted on the viability of the family farm. It is a little cruel of Labor to use words such as hoax. Notwithstanding that, when this AAA package was announced late last year it was warmly embraced by the rural community. It addressed the concerns of the rural community in areas like drought assistance and famHy support. In some key areas-such as rural counselling and drought assistance-it is certainly already playing an important role. A key part of the package was arrangements for the intergenerational transfer of the family farm. A half million dollar ceiling was placed on the net value of the property. While it did seem a fairly low figure, I was prepared to support it and wait for the response from my constituency. I did not have to wait long before it was made clear to me that the levels set under this package were inappropriate and would not do much to aid the transition from the family farm to retirement of those farmers out there caught in the asset rich and income poor bind that affects so much of our rural community. Farmers under this scheme will ostensibly be able to gift their farm to the next generation and access the pension in a window of opportunity of three years. However, the catch is that the property's net value is set at half a million dollars, and the inheriting child must have earnt the majority of their income from the property over the last few years. I understand Centrelink is strictly applying this ruling. It seems a classic catch-22: farmers must have earnt the bulk of their income from the very farm that is unable to support their children, so they go off-farm to earn a living and this initiative disqualifies them from accessing the scheme. That is as I read it. It makes not a lot of sense. A farm with a net value of half a million dollars would be absolutely flat out supporting the ageing farmer and his wife, let alone the children too. Most of the children have been off farm for several years trying to earn a living and working weekends on the farm to help mum and dad. A family farm of this value is just unable to support two generations. This scheme is seen as being completely inadequate by many farmers out there who are finding the net value of their properties beyond the half million dollar net limit, yet by any judgment they should qualify for assistance under this legislation. It is better than nothing, but it is not all right to say it is just better than nothing. If we are serious about meaningful assistance, then we have to have a policy that lifts this threshold to a meaningful level. According to the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, few of the people who actually need to avail themselves of the scheme will be able to do so in practice. While welcoming some aspects of the scheme, such as allowing recently retired farmers to participate, recognition of widowed farmers and the five-year retrospective gifting, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation suspects, as do I, that there is real justification for regarding this scheme as inadequate, good on paper but in reality not extending to those people who by any judgment should qualify. I must say that I am not absolutely critical of all aspects; I am just saying the threshold needs reappraisal. I want to put on the record a few of the complaints that I have had. Pat Manning, a 77-year-old farmer from Vittoria near Bathurst, rightly asserts that no farm of $500,000 net value can support two families. He sees this package as disappointing. Bruce Whalan from Oberon says his son has been forced to get most income off farm in recent years, so does not qualify. As well, the Valuer General says his property is worth more than half a million dollars, although his son has obviously not been able to live off that farm. He says his son has played a significant role in the farm operation over many years, including management, but has, by necessity, made his living by working at other employment. Malcolm Martin from Coonabarabran says the AAA package is no saviour and, according to him, less than two per cent will qualify for a pension under the scheme. Some of the figures that I have seen suggest that he is a little bit harsh in that percentage, but he makes the same sort of point. There are other examples that have come across my desk from farmers who believe this legislation has not got the substance it requires to assist farmers leave the land, leave a viable property with the kids and retire with dignity. The NFF, in their press releases on this, said: The Scheme is targeted at those families whose farms, although capable of supporting one generation, have become marginal as they are being required to provide a living for two or more generations. NFF believes that the Retirement Assistance scheme should be changed so that the limit on assets is increased to $800,000 ... NFF believes that the limit should be increased to the amount that a pensioner can earn under current legislation without affecting their pension entitleeast ment, currently about $20,000. Today, the NFF praised the suggested Democrat moves in the Senate. The NFF said: The National Farmers' Federation has welcomed amendments to the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Bill, foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats. The Democrats' amendments will mean that a home owning farming couple, with no other financial assets, would be able to gift a farm up to $678,500 and receive a full pension, or worth up to $877 ,500 and receive a part pension. NFF also welcomes the Democrats' proposed amendments to increase the income test to $20,000 The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee considered the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998. In his minority report on the bill, Senator John Woodley said: The joint advantages of such a scheme, from the Democrats' point of view, are that it would both raise the assets threshold slightly and at the same time introduce a tapered withdrawal of payments rather than a sudden death withdrawal as the scheme currently proposes. He could have'chosen his words a bit better - han that, but the idea is that, rather than chop 1t off at the pass, it should be a tapered scheme. To me, that makes more sense. Senator Woodley also said: The Democrats believe the legislation should be clarified to ensure that the exceptional circumstances 'mentioned in proposed section 1185B(d) include, but are not limited to, those situations in which a farmer had been issued with an 'exceptional circumstances drought certificate' . This would ensure that descendants forced to work off farm due to the financial impact of drought will not be excluded from the scheme. Talking of drought, it is only a few weeks since we witnessed the ravages of the drought that was at least as bad-particularly in the central parts of the state-as that between 1981 and 1983, and probably as bad in many places as the drought of the mid-forties. That drought still has full grip in several areas including the seat of the Deputy PrimMinister (Mr Tim Fischer), as he mentioned the other day. Anyone driving in the southof this continent in recent months could only be horrified by the stark and barrell landscape. The sale of breeding stock is well documented. The lack of ground water on even so-called safe country on the slopes and tablelands is absolutely alarming, and even recent rains have done little to alleviate this. It is against this backdrop that farmers are trying to work out their options. They want not only to secure their own dignified future worth but to leave the farm in the least unencumbered fashion for their children. To that end, the debate on who is to blame for the lack of drought assistance to farmers is very revealing. The insulting drought package offered by the New South Wales state government underlines how out of touch the Carr government really is and was on that issue. Some $2 million of the $3 million assistance was for water conservation. If it was not such a critical situation that piece of policy would have been a joke. At a time when dams were empty and there had been no sign of rain for months, farmers were not interested in a water conservation scheme; they wanted help to move their stock and get fodder. Stock and transport subsidies should be part of any genuine drought assistance package. The federal government's exceptional circumstance assistance program is welcome, but we really need to get serious in this country about long-term drought proofing. In recent months I have sent a proposal from a local seedling producer to all state ministers, federal ministers and opposition spokespersons for the serious study of old man saltbush as a drought fodder alternative. Trials in Saudi Arabia and near Gulargambone, among other places, have shown the enormous potential of this plant for drought proofing. It is not the downgraded saltbush that has been trialled; this operation has brought back into this country from South Africa the genetic stock that went there at the turn of the century. It includes all of the qualities that you see in the literature from last century when in those days it was an absolutely essential farm management tool. I urge this government, and others around the country, to look seriously at this proposal from this particular operation. This man is not hoping to make a fortune-he is only the seedling importer-and it is up to nurseries and farmers to take it on. The proposal is for low interest loans-very modest government support-to get these trials under way. There are those who say saltbush has been trialled and found suitable only in certain areas; this operation rejects that and urges that it be looked at carefully. Unless we become more proactive in exploring large-scale meaningful drought proofing options, we will continue to be trying to fund emergency schemes for farmers when the next drought arrives. Another issue is the impact of drought on the rural communities, villages and towns, and the need to examine what emergency measures we might introduce to maintain the viability of businesses such as general stores and rural supplies during periods of prolonged downturn. It would seem these people are somewhat asset rich but become impoverished and their survival is every bit as important as the farmers they serve in maintaining that rural infrastructure, the fabric of the rural society, because if they go down the tube so too does that rural community. This would be an investment in the social and basic infrastructure in the bush in the same way that we can find help for the farming community when required. So this bill does cover some of the basic problems it set out to solve, but does not extend to other than the farm community-and even there has the inadequacies I pointed out. There is an argument for a similar concession to the nonfarming small business person or the village and rural business. They too should be aided to transfer their business under the same guidelines to the younger generation. Continuity means everything to rural communities, where the tendency remains for the younger ones to go elsewhere seeking a livelihood. Such an extension of this retirement assistance for the non-farming rural community appears to me to have great merit. I look forward to meaningful amendments to this bill to make its coverage more realistic and more beneficial. I applaud the government on its initiative. It is the first time such a move has been introduced. It is sorely needed. It is welcomed out there in the community. They applaud the concept but urge the government to look more deeply at how meaningful it will be and how many people will actually be assisted. It is a great idea at the moment but, as Australian Pensioners says, the scheme could be criticised as being a Clayton's. I would not go quite so far as that. It also says that, while looking good on paper, few of the people who need to avail themselves of the scheme will be able to do so in practice. I do agree with that. That is the inherent weakness in the bill. I urge the government and the Senate to accept the Democrat amendments.",61
303,Mr ENTSCH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I would first of all like to applaud the comments of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) in that he has looked at a lot of the very positive aspects of this legislation, rather than focusing on a few of the negatives. I applaud him for doing that because I think it is important that we do look at significant reform in the farming sector to help a group of people, very important Australians, who have been struggling for a long time. This type of measure is certainly intended to assist and support them to continue their operations. In my view, this Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998 will certainly help to address some of the needs of the farmers who have reasonably low asset bases and, as we all know from the statistics, very low personal income bases. In fact, I do not believe that there would be anybody in metropolitan Australia who would be prepared to work for the very low wages that most people in the farming community accept as a way of life. I think it is also important that they he able to transfer their family farm from one generati<;m to the next without impacting on their eligibility for the age pension. The amendment bill rightly takes into account this need in the farming community, while limiting the eligibility and period of opportunity for which the family farm may be gifted. In my electorate of Leichhardt we have a very strong farming base, particularly in the sugar sector. In fact, Far North Queensland was built on the back of the sugar industry with many of the old established farms having been in the family for many generations. I certainly support any measure that will enable a more equitable social security system that is extended from metropolitan Australia into the farming sector, and particularly one that takes into account the special needs of the farmers. Before I expand on the details of the amendment bill and some of the eligibility requirements, I believe that it needs to be fully explained to the farming community. It is important to renect on the circumstances that have led to the necessity for this amendment bill. As mentioned, this amendment bill will focus on the need for the Australian family farm to be transferred from one generation to another without affecting the eligibility of the pension-age farmer to receive retirement benefit. This initiative will focus on those farmers who experience the most financial hardship. It is true to say, though, that the successful transfer of the family farm from one generation to another affects all farming families, regardless of their net worth and annual income. However, for the families that are struggling to make ends meet, the intertransfer advice, which can cost upwards of $3,000, often makes the process prohibitive. This has led to the current situation where farms that can only adequately support one family are having to support two or three families because, if the transfer of the family farm takes place under the current guidelines, that would make the pension-aged farmer ineligible to receive a pension for up to five years. For many families that want to stay on the land, this predicament has meant that if this amendment bill is not enacted they would be forced off the land like many farming families before them. The health of the rural community is a national issue and one which, if left to deteriorate, will impact on all Australians. The family farm certainly is a unique organisation, one that provides food for the nation and enables small business to prosper in rural communities. It is certainly too easy to forget about the predicament of people on the land. Wc certainly have to appreciate that their need is very significant, irrespective of the type of farming involved-whether the farmers are involved in broadacre cropping, cattle, sheep, dairy, forestry, horticulture, aquaculture or in the sugar industry, as in my electorate. The amendments that we are offering here will complement the AAA package to provide appropriate recognition and assistance for the rural community, and the amendment bill will enable access to retirement benefit for eligible farmers. As the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) raised earlier, I think the biggest problem in this legislation is the limit of half a million dollars that it puts on the value of assets. I know that the member. for O'Connor was making reference to the wheat industry. In the sugar industry, for example, one harvester alone could cost anything up to $300,000 or $400,000. It is not uncommon to spend $200,000 to $250,000 on a single tractor. So you can see that it does not take long for the value of that asset base to appreciate significantly. Even if you get out of the cane areas into the pastoral areas, given the remoteness of some of these areas, it is necessary to provide accommodation, for example, for anybody that you have working on the place, so you can be looking at a lot of out laid money which continues to build up the value of that asset. Any property at all where you basically put in a house, buy a tractor and maybe buy a second-hand four-wheel drive, you have reached the $500,000 threshold and, as a consequence, you are starting to have problems. I know most of the cane farms in my area have nothing under about $1 Y2 million in assets, so it makes it difficult for them to access this benefit. But that seems to be one of the more negative aspects. It was estimated initially, when this was put up, that there were some 5,200 farmers who may have met that asset and income limit and that this would flow through to the estimated initial take-up rate which was estimated at about 2,100 farmers. I am disappointed to hear that there were in fact only 14 farmers to this date who have taken up this benefit. I think that that is a clear indication that something needs to be done with that asset base to allow farmers who have a need to access it to do so, and I certainly encourage the government to consider that. There is a window of opportunity over a three-year period. It started on 15 September 1997, but it will also apply to those who transferred legal title of their property in five years preceding that date. So it will certainly give people in that area an opportunity to access this. Another criteria is that farmers must have owned the property for at least 15 years or have been actively involved in farming for 20 years. Fanners must have had an average income of less than the age pension over the preceding three years from both farm and non-farm activities. Again, if the farms arc that viable that are paying a level of income that is significantly higher than the pension, I can understand farmers' reluctance to go onto the pension. By having a restriction like that, I am sure it will be providing access only for those most needy. I certainly have seen situations in my electorate where farms have been very asset rich but, unfortunately, because they have not been able to transfer the farms, the farmers have lived on very meagre incomes, sharing their homes with their elderly parents because they cannot afford to have the parents move. Their asset base means they have absolutely no opportunities to access the pension-or any government subsidies, for that matter, regarding housing or anything else. The income test is currently set at $15,000 per individual. This level of assessment excludes income support from Centre link or the Department of Veterans' Affairs and payments received under the Farm Household Support Act 1992 such as drought relief payments. Farm losses can be offset against income from other sources. Farmers must reach the pension age before 15 September 2000. In the case of a married couple, only one member has to reach retirement age at that time, regardless of which partner has legal title. Where the transfer happened before 15 September 1997, the pension will be backdated to 15 September 1997, and all transfers after that date will be paid from the date of the transfer. I think it is also reasonable that the next generation must have had an active involvement in the farm over the past three years, although you will find in a lot of rural communities or farming communities that is certainly the case. In some instances, a lot of the the kids, unfortunately, have been forced off the land, but they do maintain that active interest in it whenever they can, even though the farm cannot support them. This will be a window of opportunity for these kids to get back into the rural community. Another good feature is that the scope of eligibility for transfer is very wide. The application to transfer to a niece or nephew would be considered. The eligibility criteria they also recognise that the younger generation may have been off the land to undertake employment and to sustain the farming operation. That will be taken into consideration. This bill will certainly enable bona fide farmers to continue to be productive and remain part of their community. The bill will help farming families on the land. The extended family will certainly be more secure, and the rural communities will directly benefit from this initiative. In closing, I would very much encourage the government to look very closely at the asset criteria. If that can be adjusted to a point where it can be accessible for a broader range of farmers, it would put the icing on what is really a very good initiative from this government. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adams) adjourned.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' the NA AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed.,68
305,Mr ADAMS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"This from bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1995, is a bill to allow generational change-to help farmers who are approaching pension age to retire and hand over to their children so that they can get pension. It is a rather obscure bill eligibility under it is very tight and few, we believe, will be able to make use of it. I understand that the shadow minister said that just said. J4 farmers were all that could be found to make a claim under this legislation. That hard to believe but I think, with the tightness of the regulations, that is probably all there will be. Anyway, it is going to be very hard for people to utilise this piece of legislation. The history of this legislation goes back to a special rural task force that was set up and that reported to the Prime Minister (Mr con- Howard). The task force, unlike the tax one, actually made recommendations, because there was a recommendation from this task force which said: 8.00 p.m. To facilitate the inter-generational transfer of farm assets a short term (for example, two years) moratorium on the five year gifting provisions be applied for farmers planning retirement (from 63 years) or of pension age to give individual families a one-off 'window of opportunity' to plan and transfer the family farm. Then it went into some conditions. The Prime Minister decided in December J 997 to announce a rural package which would in part respond to this recommendation. All we have now is a very small number of people who are going to be assisted by this package. Mr MCGauran-How do you know that?",68
306,Mr ADAMS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"What we have read in this bill shows that that will be the result. I do not it will be any more people than that. Under the current Social Security Act, if the farmer disposes of assets over $10,000 then value of the assets over that threshold continues to be taken into account under the pension assets test for five years. It is still counted when someone is assessed. The 1998 purpose of this bill is to try to assist those farmers who are approaching pension age and who want to gift a farm worth less than $500,000-half a million dollars-to their children by exempting the value of the farm the pension assets test. The scheme will apply only to farm assets disposed of before ] 5 December 2000 and where the person or their partner reaches the pension age before that date. It is a pretty tight window of opportunity here. It is a shame the member for a Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) has left his place. because the r hope he is listening. Mr O'Keefe-He is confirming what you",68
307,Mr ADAMS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Yes, he probably is just is working out that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Treasury have won again and that this bill means nothing to farmers. That is about all the rural community has got out of this government: nothing. Farmers have to qualify, and that means they have to have had a legal or equitable interest in the farm continuously over the last 15 years. They or their partner will have had to invest significant amounts of labour and capital. 'Significant amounts' is the .operative phrase in that clause, and that will be defined, I guess. They have to have derived a significant part of their income from the farm over that period, or have acquired the farm assets in question before 15 September 1997. They or their partner would have to have been involved in farming in Australia over the last 20 years, and over that time they or their partner would have had to have invested significant amounts of labour in farming and have derived a significant part of their income - rom farming. 'Significant' plays a pretty Important part when someone is assessing who is going to get access to the results of this bill. The farm cannot be worth any more than $500,000. You must have had the farm for three years, except in exceptional circumstances, and someone will have to judge what is exceptional. The person's ordinary income from farming and other sources during the three years in question must have been less than the maximum base rate of the age pension. These criteria mean that the number of eligible people is just getting smaller and smaller every time you read a line or two of the bill. So far as I can make out, this bill is current for only three years and I am wondering if it is specifically written for somebody in this House who is probably going to retire. Maybe the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) has finished and his career is over, so he is going to leave us at the next election and needs this to pass on to his children. I really do not know how old the member for Gippsland is, but I think he has aged in recent years. I know his brief experience in executive government aged him considerably and probably taught him many lessons. So, if he is going to retire, maybe this bill was written for him. It is a pretty sloppy piece of legislation and it could do a lot better. You always get arguments with bills like this, as I did the other day. I was talking to a fisherman from my electorate who has a $500,000 fishing boat which he inherited from - is father. He wants to get out of the fishing mdustry and he has to get his son into the business, so they are going to have to refinance the fishing boat so that the father can retire. Those situations apply in industry and it is very difficult. It means that we have to teach people to plan retirement a lot better than we have in the past. There is a problem in helping those who have a legitimate problem and it should extend to all those who wish to quietly retire and let their children continue to operate the farm. There are a lot of small businesses other than farms in rural communities which also experience difficulties. Those people also look for some assistance where they have an asset but not - lot of caSh. flow, and I am sure they would lIke to benefIt from a bill exactly the same as this one. The non-farm small business person, the owner-operator, would also find it very difficult to transfer their business on to the younger generation. There are a lot of such people in country areas. As. far .a- I could make out from the very few mqumes that I made, no-one is eligible at the moment for these stringent guidelines. The word 'significance' and the question of its .interpretation will be one of the keys. I belIeve that it has been building up false hop-s for some people, and it has been very unkind of the government and some of their members to do that, because I believe that a lot of people will not be able to meet the guidelines. This is the Prime Minister's sleight of hand: 'Look, folks, here is a special --heme for struggling farmers. Oops, sorryIt s. gone now. It's too late. Bad luck.' If they senously want to do something for farmers it will take spending some money to assist them. There are older farmers in the community who genuinely do need to benefit from a scheme like this to allow young farmers into farming. There are some people who do not get an opportunity to make on-farm decisions until they are in their 50s. That is a little late-they may be losing their enthusiasm for new ideas to upgrade the farm into a modem way of working. There is a generation of thinking lost, and maybe that is part of the problem we are having getting properties into drought proofing and looking at new opportunities for the future. We should be doing this better and we should be doing it properly. It should not be a con on the rural community, as are most of the things that this government does. We need to work on getting people to plan for their retirement from the small business sector so that we do not have to try to come up with schemes like this, which actually does nothing that could not be better achieved in other ways. I fear for the older farmers who need to get off the farms and for the younger ones who want to take over. They do have a problem. We could do a lot better with this bill, and I believe that this bill will come back and bite the government sometime in the future.",68
308,Mr MCGAURAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"That was not only a banal contribution to this debate; it was highly inaccurate. In that, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) was just following the tradition that has been set for him by his colleagues' speeches in this debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998. You would think that the Labor Party would at least read the legislation and understand it before they made their wild assertions to this place. Could I reassure the people listening to this debate across the country: everything you have been told by the Labor Party in regard to this legislation is wrongcompletely and utterly. Those who are perpetuating a lie stand condemned. This is new, radical legislation proposed by this government to assist farming families to hand on properties to the new generations and also to assist farming families who are having desperate financial problems. The member for Lyons pontificated about the need to put in place transition arrangements and how you need to prepare estate planning and the like. Why didn't they do anything? They were in power for 13 years and they did nothing. We have done something. The biggest misrepresentation which infuriates me and my colleagues on this side of the parliament is that this legislation has benefited only 14 people to date. The shadow minister for primary industries-I want everyone to know his name: the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), from Victoria-is utterly wrong. He has completely and totally misunderstood this legislation. What he is referring to is the farm family restart scheme. That is not the legislation before the House. The 14 people who have taken advantage of that scheme have done so under legislation that started on I December last year. Let me explain this. Under the farm family restart scheme there are income payments equivalent to unemployment benefits. There are several hundred farmers across Australia getting them. The second part of that innovative scheme is the re-establishment grant. To date 14 have received that. Those are the exit provisions. So it does not relate to the legislation today, which is all about farmers being able to hand on their property. What a gross misrepresentation-a deliberate misleading of the Australian public! We believe there will be several hundredup to and probably exceeding 2,1 OO-farmers who, under the legislation under consideration by the parliament at this very moment, will benefit, whereas the shadow minister for primary industries has misled anyone who would dare or bother to take him seriously by saying only 14 people are going to be able to hand on their farms. He has been excited, he has been running around geeing up members of the opposition to contribute to this debate, and threatening members of the government with exposure of this supposedly terrible wrongdoing and with the supposed total failure of the legislation. I started getting suspicious earlier in the evening when I first heard his outrageous claims. I was thinking: how can only 14 people have benefited from this legislation when we are debating it in the parliament, which means it has not gone through the legislative process, let alone been proclaimed by the Governor General? How can he possibly claim only 14 people have benefited when we are debating the legislation? It would only be completely naive people or, worse still-and parliamentary rules prevent me from really describing my true assessment of them-members of the Labor opposition who would believe him. Didn't it occur to any of them to question why only 14 would benefit from the legislation before the House when the legislation has not been passed by the House? But no, either deliberately or stupidly, they disregarded that fundamental fact and have repeated this misrepresentation time and time again throughout this debate. The fact is that we have brought in legislation that will keep farm families intact and, if they cannot be viable after 12 months or more, we give them assistance to establish a new life or, alternatively, we provide, under certain conditions, for the passing on of the family farm. So it is no use Labor members like the previous speaker, the member for Lyons, talking about how we should have a scheme that passes on family farms. We have got a scheme. All they do is knock. All they do is criticise. All they do is oppose and reject. It is an opposition that totally and utterly opposes anything that the government puts up, whether it be for the benefit of sectors of the Australian community or the Australian community as a whole. You can go through the whole ambit. Mr O'Keefe-We support this legislation. Ml' MCGAURAN-The shadow minister for primary industries is interjecting, 'We support this legislation.' What a mealymouthed endorsement this truly is. Speaker after speaker has tried to poke holes in the legislation, has tried to discredit it, has tried to dissuade people from ever having recourse to it. Now that his falsehood is exposed, he says, 'We're jumping on the bandwagon. We'll actually support it.' How extraordinary! We provide income support to hundreds of Australian farmers suffering either climatic or commodity downturns. We provide very significant funding of up to $45,000. Mr Fitzgibbon-Did you say hundreds?",70
309,Mr MCGAURAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Hundreds of Australian farmers are receiving this farm family restart support. We provide an exit provision, if necessary, but we want to keep farm families doing exactly what they themselves want to do, which is to stay and work on the farm, to be productive, to be efficient and to contribute to their local communities and the Australian economy as a whole. We are not just about what Labor's high interest rate, high inflation policies lead to, which is the expulsion of farmers from their family farms. It has been fraudulent for the Labor Party to, on the one hand, come in here and hypocritically support the legislation and, on the other hand, try to undermine it and to weakcn public confidence in it, all on the basis of a total misunderstanding. Does the shadow minister for primary industries read the legislation before he concocts a position, before he advises his colleagues? I do not know who is more at fault here: the shadow minister for primary industries for misunderstanding the legislation or his colleagues in this debate who have parroted his line, which they accepted unquestioningly and uncritically from him. Mr Marek-They don't understand.",71
310,Mr MCGAURAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"They don't understand, said the member for Capricornia, who has sat in this debate with his temper rising all the time. He has seen time and time again in this chamber the Labor Party completely distorting the meaning, intent and benefit of this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, how can you deal with an opposition of that kind? If anybody wants to know just how they will approach this tax reform debate, which is of enormous potential benefit to country people because they are export industry orientated in that at the moment our export industries pay wholesale sales tax and under tax reform they may not necessarily do so",71
311,Unknown,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Opposition members interjecting,71
312,Mr MCGAURAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"There is no doubt about it: they will oppose it; they will scaremonger; they will exaggerate; they will deceive. We have seen their form here all through this evening in regard to this particular legislation when they tried to say 14 people have benefited-before the legislation has even passed through the parliament!-whereas, having recourse to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures in conjunction with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics figures on income, assets and age grouping, we believe 1,800 farmers and 300 veterans will be able to take advantage of passing on the property to their next generation. It is true to say, however, that farmers should be planning ahead for the transition from one generation to another. Of course, we are not by this legislation taking away the right, or opportunity, of farmers to gift that presently exists under social security. We are adding to it. We are enunciating a new dimension to the rights and entitlements of farmers to pass on properties if they meet the conditions, which are, firstly, that an average income of $15,000 equivalent to the age pension over three years be satisfied and, secondly, that there be net equity in the property of up to $500,000. We have added to what a farmer can decide to do in the future. There are mixed reactions in the farming community about this whole question of transition. It is true that farming communities have to pay more attention to it. I met a farmer over the weekend who transferred his property to his son several years ago and now, as he reaches retirement age, he will be able to access the age pension. As we all know, it is not always easy for a farmer to necessarily pass on the farm at an age when he or she is still very active to one or more of the children and then not have the registered ownership of the property for five years until they reach retirement age. However, there is a number of alternatives around. This legislation adds to that range of choices. So it is very inventive and innovative legislationwhich the Labor Party certainly failed to introduce during their 13 years. But this is a war cry from Labor that we are getting very used to around this place. Any time any of their deficiencies are exposed it is always replied to as being a job for their 14th year in office. It is always the 14th year-you would have done this in the 14th year; you would have done industrial relations and unfair dismissal in the 14th year; you would have done tax reform in the 14th year. It goes on and on. The fact is you have no credibility. If ever your base political motivafarmers. tions needed to be exposed it has been during the debate on this legislation when your spokesman on this issue, who is supposed to have the knowledge and the expertise to properly represent the constituency with which he is charged-namely, primary industries-has misled that very constituency by alleging that only 14 people would benefit from this legislation. It has nothing to do with this legislation. Why would we want more than 14 to benefit under the exit provisions of the farm family restart scheme? Instead, we want the hundreds enjoying the household income support under that scheme to remain farmers. I am very proud to be associated with a government that has introduced this groundbreaking legislation on behalf of the Australian farming community.",71
313,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"In his second reading speech on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who represents the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), explained the government's rationale for introducing this scheme. He said: This measure is targeted at those families who are in hardship because their businesses are capable of supporting only one family but are being required to provide a living for two or more families. It will remove a significant impediment to the intergenerational transfer of the family farm. It represents a significant concession for farmers. We found similar statements in the explanatory memorandum. Even though we have had an extraordinary performance-suitable for the stage-from the previous speaker, the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), there is no significant concession for farmers in this bill. In fact, the eligibility criteria contained in this bill are so restrictive one wonders whether this really is a serious attempt to deal with the issue addressed in the statements the minister made or whether it is really a mickey mouse scheme designed to give the appearance of helping farmers. That is really what this scheme is-a mickey mouse scheme designed to give the appearance of helping During the hearings of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee last year, the Department of Social Security said that they believed some 10,000 families were going to be affected by the scheme over time. They indicated that the scheme would cost about $5 min ion to set up. Given the strict nature of the qualifying criteria, we find figure of 10,000 families rather surprising. It is even more surprising when you look at the costings of the scheme contained in the explanatory memorandum, which indicate that net outlays for any of the given years that the scheme is going to operate in, that is, from 1997 to 2001, arc expected to be less than $13 million. Let us do a quick sum. Work out how many people can get a full single rate pension for $13 million. You can get 1,400 single rate pensions for $13 million. Of course, they will not all be single people; sorne of them will be married. So it seems that the figure the Department of Social Security is now giving us of 2, 100 is much more like the number that 'might' get access to the pension for $13 million-not 10,000 families. That is what makes it a mickey mouse scheme. Although we have $13 million a year allocated to spend on this measure that 'might' give a benefit to 2,100 farmers, we in fact find that the restrictions placed on this scheme could see many fewer than 2,100 actually fitting the very tight criteria. So it has come as no surprise to us that the government has finally had to revise its figures substantially. No doubt, once the scheme gets under way, we will find that very few people indeed are able to access this scheme. It is not unusual for this government to provide one set of figures in relation to proposals when it announces them-with lots of fanfare, lots of activity in the House and plenty of press outside---only to revise those figures later. They announced that there was going to be all this help for farmers. We also saw this with the government's announcement on the pension bonus scheme. This was another example where there was going to be an enormous benefit to those older people who wanted to keep on working--they were going to get some extraordinary benefit. In the case of the pension bonus scheme, just as with this farm support scheme, the government revises the figures down considerably once it gets into Senate committees and has to confront the serious facts. The government seems to be having an extraordinary amount of trouble estimating the costs and this effects of its proposed schemes. If we can believe the latest figures, they seem to show that this scheme is very limited. Another example of where the government has been caught out trying to show that it is a great reforming government, when it is probably better described as mean-spirited, is the case where, in a social security bill, the government said that it was going to extend the carer payment to people caring for under16-year-olds who are profoundly disabled-a proposal so tightly framed that very few people are likely to benefit from it. Here we have just three schemes where the government, through a lot of fanfare, suggests it is going to introduce major reforms and, when we look at the detail, we find that very few people will get any benefit. Under this bill, farmers will be eligible only if they earned up to an average of the maximum pension rate over the last three financial years. That represents $354.60 per fortnight for single farmers, or $591.60 per fortnight for couples. So people have a very real idea of the restrictive nature of what they can earn over the last three financial years. This includes income of the farmer and their spouse from the farm and other sources. It is a very restricted scheme. The scheme is also restricted to cases where the farm assets are not worth more than $500,000. This figure includes not just the its farm itself but all fixtures and equipment as well. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, such farms arc unlikely to be capable of supporting one family to an adequate level, let alone two or three. But, of course, if such a farm did generate enough income to provide a living greater than the pension rate, it would be excluded from the scheme for that reason. If these strict criteria are met, there are still further hurdles which a farming family must cross before qualifying under the scheme. They must have had a legal or equitable interest in the farm over the past 15 years have been involved in farming for 20 years. They must also have invested significant amounts of labour and capital in the farm and have derived a significant part of their income ants. from farming. The person to whom the farm is transferred must generally have been involved in farming for the last three years. These criteria might not seem unreasonable their own but, together with the rest of the criteria, they make it clear that the governstand ment wishes to restrict this scheme to as few farmers as possible. I note that the Australian Pensioners Superannuants Federation and the National Farmers Federation have expressed similar concerns. In a letter dated 11 February this year to the Department of Social Security, the problems. Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation said: While, there may be individually sound reasons including the previous conditions as a requirement for entry to the RAFSthat is, the retirement assistance for farmers schemeAP&SF is extremely concerned that, taken together, few of the people who actually need to avail themselves of the scheme will be able to do so in practice. If the requirements do not allow retiring farmers any entry point to the assistance available, scheme could be criticised as being a 'Clay scheme in that while looking good on paper, have no reasonable application to the lives farmers who are intended to be the beneficiaries a relaxation of the pension gifting rules. The scheme is also limited in that it will apply only if the farmer or their spouse will reach age pension age before 15 September 2000 and where the farm assets were disposed of before that date. In short, what is proposed as a temporary scheme which seems illa conceived could not possibly meet its stated aims except in very few cases. I conclude by referring to another issue which was raised at the Senate committee hearing a few weeks ago. It concerns the tax implications of transferring farm assets held by family companies. It appears that some these transfers are regarded under the income tax legislation as generating a notional profit which is taxable. It was also pointed out or during the committee hearing that there may be ways around at least some of these problems but that they are complex and likely to require the assistance of lawyers and accountFarmers whose farms are held by family companies and who do not receive sound advice about the best way to have the farm on assets transferred to the next generation may be faced with substantial tax bills. I underthat these issues are presently being discussed with the Australian Taxation Office. I wonder whether these issues were simply and overlooked when the bill was drafted. When the minister responds, the opposition would be pleased if the government would let us know what they intend to do about these tax As members of the opposition have made clear, we are very concerned that this is a for mickey mouse scheme, that it is not going to help those that the government said it intended to help. The restrictions put on the scheme are so tight that very few people who need assistance will be able to claim it. The APSF probably got it right when they called it a 'Clayton's scheme' because that is what it is.",72
314,Mrs STONE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the excellent Social Security and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment"" tons' (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill it may 1998-a bill which the honourable member"" of for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has just described of as a 'Clayton's activity'. That is not surprising, of course, because the opposition has shown itself to be singularly out of touch and beyond all understanding of what goes on in regional Australia. It is amazing that the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) was so out of synchronisation, arguing about totally different scheme. He suggested this bill was already in action and only a handful of farmers had been able to take advantage of it. I hope he very quickly does his homework before he gets back to his electorate. A retirement assistance scheme for farmers is essential for Australia and, of course, most of important for the electorate of Murray. The 1996 census figures indicated that 21.7 per cent of all those employed worked in primary production in Murray and 40 per cent of all families there had a weekly family income of less than $500. Only 6.4 per cent have a weekly family income of more than $1,500. It is an electorate of affluence in some areas but one of seriously low incomes in others, in particular in the section of the electorate that is primary production dependent. The contrast of high and lower income families is especially marked in the agriculture sector throughout the electorate. We are a very productive region, generating billions of dollars in export earnings annually. However, like primary producers throughout Australia, Murray's farmers are largely price takers in international markets where government intervention is commonplace, creating subsidised competition and non-tariff barriers. That makes it very difficult to compete. Margins in farming are cut to the bone and have been for more than a generation. It is not easy to survive in agribusiness today. The foreword of the ABARE report entitled Issues in the delivery of Commonwealth social support programs to farm families encapsulated the need for adequate social security assistance for some farm families. It stated: Low commodity pIiccs in the early 1990's, combined with widespread drought in 1993-94, continued the long downward trend in net value of farm production and income in Australia of the past four decades. This accentuated the need of farm families for fair and equitable access for social support programs provided by the Commonwealth Government. This bill is about dealing out some equity for low income, aged Australian farmers. It is not about charity. The scheme can be justified on humanitarian and economic grounds. It is certainly not a scheme dealing out special favours to all Australian farmers-that is why of course there are conditions. We are responsible in the way that we disburse the Australian taxpayers' funds. The Australian farming population is only too aware of the need to be discerning in terms of who is most in need and where this particular scheme needs to apply. ABARE's 1995 study of the social and financial circumstances of farm families showcd that, throughout Australia, 10.5 per cent of people living in family farm households were of retirement age and 15.1 per cent of these people were living in sub-commercial farm households. That ABARE study also concluded that, after excluding an average value for the family home, 14 per cent of the surveyed households had assets of less than $350,000 and incomes below $15,000. And remember, the costs of food, fuel, transport, health services, sport and recreation in country areas are substantially higher than in metropolitan areas. The in-depth interviews that ABARE carried out revealed that, in the two years before the study, 21 per cent of all of the low income farm family households had cut back on basic food, and over one-quarter were concerned about making ends meet either all or some of the time. These are the older farming families in low income situations that we need to target with this special scheme. Why do we have this phenomenon of asset rich and income poor farmers in poverty traps around the country? As well, you need to ask: why should aged, low income farmers be treated any differently from people in any other occupation in Australia? These are very important questions. The current system is mightily unjust given the income levels I have just described and given that the assets many farming families have simply do not generate the sorts of incomes that you would perhaps expect in some other business enterprise. Under the current system, the one that Labor has been happy to see in place for generations and did nothing to change in its 13 years in government, if an elderly parent gifts more than $10,000 worth of property or assets in one year, the amount over $10,000 is counted as an asset for the next five years when assessing eligibility for the age pension. So we have had this incredible trap. The next generation, the farmer's sons or daughters, may not be in a position to purchase the property at market value and the farm may not generate sufficient income for the older owners to distribute sufficient income to their sons and daughters, who carry on the everyday work activity of the property. Faced with that reality, too many elderly farmers or individuals have simply not transferred the title of the family farm to their sons and daughters, even though that next generation have been the full-time farm workers and part of the management team for decades. Where the low income younger generation is trying to derive income for the two or more generations-the grandparents or the parents-it is often at a cost well beyond the means of that farm. Investment back into the farm enterprise is stalled. The family farm becomes less viable. The younger generation, in despair, might simply move off the property, seeking employment elsewhere-a better deal somewhere else on a salary. The rural communities then shrink. The stewards of the land become fewer and less able to do the sorts of work that farmers always have done-minding the waterways, guarding the wetlands, trying to preserve the biodiversity and planting the trees that may not show any tangible evidence of maturity for perhaps 10, 15 or 20 years-the work that perhaps will not achieve an income increase for another generation. That sort of work is all stalled when you break family farm succession. In too many cases around Australia, the poverty in which the older generations have found themselves because of the difficulties our social security rules have imposed on them have meant a break in family farm succession. It is no accident that over 99 per cent of Australian farms are family farms. This is for the reasons I have just referred to. Farming in Australia is not a high return business in so many of our farm sectors. The work that one generation does is often to be reaped as a reward by the next generation. In particular, the work we do today on tree planting and underground water system management in rural Victoria, in northern Victorian with its high watertable, is work that has to be done today but for which we will not reap the benefits for another 10, 20 or 50 years. This scheme would never have been introduced by the opposition. We have heard tonight the cynicism, as they described the scheme as 'mickey mouse'. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said that it was a mickey mouse scheme designed to appear as if we are giving assistance to farmers. I ask: what did they do? People throughout Australia, particularly the older farmers, are grateful to see this scheme being introduced as some recognition of their extreme distress. Labor has consistently demonstrated a profound lack of understanding of the social structures, the economic realities and the environment sustaining work of the people who live outside Australia's capital cities. Farmers' livelihoods involve the day-today management of over 70 per cent of the Australian land mass. Remember the feigned outrage of the opposition when it occurred to it that the Natural Heritage Trust funding had predominantly been allocated to help sustain and improve the forests, lands, waterways and river basins; and-surprise, surprise-these make up regional Australia. Yes, rural electorates have consistently voted for the Liberal and National parties. And regional Australia is where these natural heritage phenomena are to be found. Is the Labor Party telling us that, if it had been in power, it would have allocated the Natural Heritage Trust funds on a per capita basis to the populations in the built-up, man-made environments in the cities? How can Labor argue that this legislation before the House tonight is anything but enlightened and long overdue? This government's special rural task force were asked to investigate the impact of the social security assets tests on customers in rural areas, including how the assets tests affected farmers remaining on small nonviable land holdings which cannot generate income beyond the age pension limit, and the social and economic implications of changing the assets tests rules relating to the intergenerational transfer of farms. In their report, they acknowledged that many needed urgent and immediate assistance-the form of assistance this legislation will deliver. But they also acknowledged that we need long term holistic approaches to planning for family farm businesses and an integrated whole farm planning process, including developing family agreements for farming together and intergenerational transfer planning. Our government's Agriculture-Advancing Australia package has a range of programs designed to assist fanning families to progress throughout their farming enterprise so that farm succession can occur without some perhaps getting into the difficulties that this current generation has found themselves in. The AAA package includes such programs as the farm business program-or Farmbis, as we call it-and many rural counselling services, in particular the rural communities program and the farm family restart scheme, which the member for Burke tripped up on. This government is addressing the realities of our primary industry in Australia. We understand the social structures. We understand the economic realities of having to farm in such a way so the next generation may benefit. When this legislation is enacted, we will make it a cornerstone of greater justice for farm families. I know that today is a very important occasion for farming families and that they are grateful that this government is in power on this day. Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (8.48 p.m.)-I enjoyed the contribution of the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) in particular on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998. I enjoy coming in here and watching members of the National and Liberal parties representing rural and regional Australia trying to justify their rather paltry representation of those areas. I like the way they always fall back to the Natural Heritage Trust funding, as the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) did. Those living in rural and regional Australia paid a very high price for that Natural Heritage Trust funding. They took the government on trust. Their high price was the loss of one-third control of Telstra. That was a very high price for them. They were very concerned that this was a risky game, but they were prepared to take the government on trust. And what is happening now? They are going to flog the rest of it, and people living in rural and regional Australia are not too happy, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker. There was some significant bias in the Natural Heritage Trust funding. The member for Murray would have us believe that the perceived bias is only because the Natural Heritage Trust funding went to rural electorates, but she can never explain to me the discrepancy between those rural seats that are held by government members and the amount of money they received and those rural and regional seats held by members of the Labor Party and the money they received. The member for Gippsland was particularly passionate, and he was particularly passionate for a very good reason: because the National Party has been rolled again in cabinet-and it happens again and again. When this proposal before the House tonight was announced as part of Minister Anderson's wonderful AAA package, it was done with great fanfare, and it was going to do lots for people living in rural and regional Australia. But it has been made quite clear now-and the member for Gippsland has conceded it himself-that nowhere near the number of people as was originally suggested are going to be assisted by this bill. The former minister tonight conceded that, notwithstanding the fact that the original estimate was something like 10,000 would be assisted, it is now-on their own figuring-more like 2,100 people. Prior to the election, members like the member for Gippsland were travelling the width and breadth of the country, jumping all over the Australian Labor Party saying that the Labor Party had failed the rural sector for 13 years but that they were going to do something about it. Drought was a perfect example. For months-indeed years-there were areas in my own electorate that had failed to gain a drought declaration. As would be recalled, that was a declaration made on the advice of an independent body made up of scientists-among other people. Unfortunately, for a long time that body known as RASAC was not prepared to designate many areas in the Upper Hunter as drought declared, and the then opposition were screaming how terrible this was. Thankfully, just prior to the last election, those regions were drought declared. But do you know what happened on the election of the Howard government? That designation was taken away. After all the screaming in opposition-and having the Labor Party finally secure that designation-the coalition government came into power and took it away. So no wonder you see the filibustering coming from members like the member for Gippsland. They are embarrassed by their failure to do what they proposed to do rural and regional Australia. But the bill before us tonight is based on admirable principle. Of course, it proposes allow low income pension age farmers, including veterans and their partners, transfer their farm and farm assets up maximum of $500,000 net of debt to the next generation without affecting their access the age or service pension. Before coming to this House, I was a local government councillor in my electorate and have seen this problem from a different I have been, as a councillor, part of a planning consent authority, and I have had people come to me pleading to allow them to subdifor vide their land contrary to the council's planning instrument because of the terrible way in which the assets test, with respect their farm, was impacting upon them. I have seen the genuine concerns and, like the shadow minister, I support this bill. I can so if for no other reason but for the letter have received from a constituent, Ms Sandra Reynolds, who says: The situation is that my mother has transferred Rural Farm Land to me her daughter 3 years ago. She is now 76 years of age. Now she is suffering from Dementia and soon will have to go into care, she has been self funded interest ratesstarted to drop and now she is basically on the poverty line. She says: After the announcement of the wait I applied to Centrelink and to my surprise after ringing their financial advisor this Act does not yet have Royal Assent. So 3 months later and no further ahead I hope that you will stir Mr. Howard to action. It sounds to me like my constituent will not apply under this current bill because her land was transferred too long ago. That is a matter I am taking up personally with the minister. But it highlights the point that previous speakers on my side have been making, that is, the very criteria which govern the operation of this bill. First, of course, the scheme will apply only to farm assets disposed of before 15 September 2000 and where the person or their partner reached age pension age before that date. Second, to qualify for for the scheme a person must be a qualifying farmer as determined under the act. Third, the an scheme will apply, as I have mentioned, only to where the value of the farm assets is not more than $500,000-again, as I said, net of debt. to Fourth, the person to whom the farm assets to a have been transferred must have been involved in the farm for the three years up to to the date of transfer, except in exceptional circumstances. Fifth, the person's ordinary income from farming and other sources during the three financial years prior to the asset I transfer must have been less than the maxiangle. mum basic rate of pension. There is something very confusing in that me and I suspect it is one of the reasons Centrelink is advising so many people they may not be eligible for this assistance. I pick to up what the member for Gippsland said in respect of none of us being sure about the eligibility numbers, but the act has not yet do gained the imprimatur of the Governor-GenerI al, et cetera. However, I do know from that letter that Sandra Reynolds has written to me, and from subsequent conversations I have had with her, that Centrelink is giving advice as to whether people are likely to qualify for this assistance or not. She was given advice that she certainly does not qualify because the bill until has not gained royal assent. But she also has some difficulties in terms of the time frame involved. We do know that very few-indeed, far fewer than originally indicated by the government-are going to be eligible for this waving of the 5 year assistance. I tum to criteria four and five, which say that the person dispossessing themselves of the farm must have been involved in the farm for up to three years before the transfer date. In other words, the person who did own the farm has to have had a very low income, yet the other person, who is receiving the benefit of the farm, must have had an association with the farm. I think there is conflict there. I do not see how the previous owner of the farm is going to be earning such a low income when the farm is supposed to have been providing for both parties. There is a conflict there and I suspect that it is one of the things driving down the number of people who are gaining eligibility under the bill or at least being advised by Centrelink that their eligibility for the benefits under the bill are very doubtful. The other thing I cannot understand about this bill is the fact that the government is allowing it to proceed through the houses of parliament without addressing the taxation concerns raised by the Australian Society of Practising Accountants. They are warning farmers not to avail themselves of the assistance that will be available under this bill without, first, considering it very carefully and consulting their accountants. They are referring, of course, to potential capital gains implications that might now as a result of anyone taking or attempting to take the benefits under the bill. They are also referring to potential tax liabilities on deemed profits from associated transfers of livestock. They are also referring to potential income liability for retiring fanners whose farms are in a company structure. I said earlier that the principle of this is right. It is a sensible principle, something that I appreciate the government attempting to do. But it is mickey mouse. The shadow minister may have taken it too far-I am not sure. He called it a hoax and over the course of time he will probably be proven correct on that. But, if it is not a hoax, at the very least it reeks of incompetence. We have a bill beforc us that is proposed to help 10,000; that, on the member for Gippsland's admission, is 2,100. It is a bill that does not have the support of the National Farmers Federation, but that is another story-they might have other interests in their mind. But it is a bill that has serious questions attached to it with respect to tax implications that are still unanswered by the government. I suggest it would be better for the government to withdraw its bill and go back and have another look. It is mickey mouse. It reeks of incompetence. We are not going to be silly enough to oppose it because the principle is correct. But I suggest that the government has a look at what it has done and should take shame and admit that this bill is going to go nowhere near as far as it had proposed it would when it was announced wi th great fanfare by the minister last year.",74
315,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"in reply-I thank the honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998. I did hear something of the comments by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) before dinner. He has been ably supported in this debate by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the member for ealare (Mr Andren), the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). We welcome the opposition's indications of support for the bill. Obviously, this is a bill which for the first time gives low income fann families struggling to feed two or three thing generations from one property a window of opportunity to reorganise their affairs so that their farm is able to prosper and grow. It is the first opportunity that people have had to take advantage of opportunities that are provided by this legislation. In a real sense, it is regrettable that, for many years, succession planning has been a very low priority for farm families. They have not ensured that farms are passed to the younger generation in an orderly way that ensures the older generation can retire in dignity. This bill says to rural families that they have three years in which to catch up on succession planning: to talk to their accountants, their lawyers, Centrelink's financial information officers and others who may be able to assist them in structuring their finances properly. In the context of the opposition's criticisms on the detail of the scheme, I can only repeat the words of the member for Calare: this is the first time a government has initiated such a move. Labor had 13 years to do somethingMr Fitzgibbon interjecting",79
316,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Labor did have 13 years to do something, and it did nothing in that time. Obviously, I have heard the new, feigned interest in these matters. But I can guarantee that, if there had been no attempt to deal with this issue in the way in which we have, we would not have heard any comments from the Labor Party about this matter. I think it needs to be seen in that context. In relation to the specifics of the comments by the member for Burke, I reject his claim that the take-up of this scheme is as low as 14 families. I am told that, since the Minister Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announced this scheme last year, 1,500 families have inquired about the scheme and 500 have actually registered their interest in claiming once this legislation has passed; this is before Centrelink has distributed any significant publicity material. I think it is important to note that, as the member for Gippsland pointed out, the figure of 14 that the member for Burke quoted is actually the number of claimants for re-establishment grants-a completely separate part of the package which has nothing to do with this new retirement assistance scheme for farmers. I would encourage the member for Burke to correct the record in relation to this matter. Mr O'Keefe-Would you give me indulgence to take a minute to do it?",80
317,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"No, I would not give you indulgence. But I would think that at the first available opportunity you would want to ensure the record is corrected in relation to that matter. The fact is that the honourable member for Burke also claimed that the government had undertaken a cruel rural hoax in relation to this matter. This, again, is completely false. When the scheme was announced, the government stated that 10,000 families could potentially benefit as they had sufficiently low incomes. The government has always stated that, once compliance with the assets test and other tests is factored in, 2,100 families qualify-l,800 in the social security portfolio and 300 in the veterans' affairs portfolio. The issue that has been most controversial here tonight is the level of the assets threshold. I want to stress that this scheme is clearly one which is targeted at low income, low asset farm families. In other words, it meets the framework tests which we generally apply to social security eligibility. It is not intended to give general access to the pension to all farmers, irrespective of their ability to provide for themselves in retirement. Rather, it is to be seen as a welfare measure focusing on the farmers who have lower incomes and lower asset levels. But there has been some misunderstanding as to how the half million test works. Firstly, it is a net figure. If a farm for is worth $800,000 but has a mortgage of $300,000 on it, then the net value is half a million dollars and this family may qualify. Secondly, it is only that share of the farm which the parents own which is counted. If a $1 million dollar farm is held in partnership between two generations, then the parents' share is worth half a million dollars and they would thus qualify. The other conditions of this scheme, such as the income test and the connection which both the older and younger generations must have with the land, are all fair measures which ensure the benefits fall as they are aimed. In conclusion, I respond to the endorsement by the member for Calare of the amendments proposed to this bill by Senator Woodley. Due to the intransigence of the opposition, the Democrats and other parties in the Senate, that chamber has a large backlog of legislation waiting to be considered. The practical effect of this is that this bill may well not be considered this sitting in the Senate and will therefore be delayed until August and possibly later. This is a huge problem for those farm families who are desperately hanging on and waiting for the legislation to pass. The one solution to this impasse is for the bill to go through the Senate as non-controversial. If Senator Woodley does not press his amendments, this bill could be passed within two weeks. But, if he insists on them, struggling families in the bush will have to wait would many more months before these beneficial measures are in place. That really puts the ball right back in the court of the opposition and the Democrats. They can pass the bill unamended or they can allow farm families who are eligible to go without access to these beneficial measures. It will be a measure of the extent to which the opposition has any interest in relation toMr O'Keefe-It is not a testosterone test. We've already said we'll support it.",80
318,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"We are making it very clear. The bill will be treated as non-controversial in the Senate? Give encouragement to the Democrats and we will ensure it is dealt with in that way. We look forward to your cooperation in that effort as well. Question resolved in the affirmative.

319,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (9.09 p.m.)At the outset, in the spirit .of cooperation which pervades the parliament this evening, let me indicate that the opposition in no way will hinder the passage of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1998 through either the House of Representatives or the Senate because, quite obviously, this bill is uncontrohost versial. It seeks to do essentially two things. It seeks to give legislative effect to the toms Tariff Proposal No.5 of 1997, which proposed a reduction on the rate of customs duty payable on aviation gasoline. That certainly is a very non-controversial element of the legislation. The second part of the bill which needs comment deals with the proposal to allow the importation of prescribed goods by non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic family members for both the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. There can be no more important and significant event in the coming couple of years in Australia than both the Olympics and the Paralympics in terms of what that will provide for Australia in showcasing this great nation of ours. It will be a celebration of athleticism, the likes of which Australia has not seen certainly since Melbourne and, probably, with advances in legitimate training techniques, we will see athletic and similar abilities on show for the rest of the world to see. Importantly, it will also give us an opportunity to cheer on Australians in their own environment and in a magnificent facility that is in the process of being constructed at Homebush. It is actually quite opportune that we are debating this bill today in respect of the elements relevant to the Olympics because the New South Wales state government delivered its budget today and, as an adjunct to that budget, gave an indication as to just how much the Olympics were to cost in terms of its overall cost to Australia but, more specifically, to New South Wales. Rather than being the subject of some derision, I think that Michael Knight, the Minister for the Olympics, the Treasurer, Michael Egan, and the Premier, Bob Carr, deserve congratulations for being the first government, as I understand it, probably ever to bring forward the costings associated with the Olympics before the Olympics take place. It has apparently been a feature of most Olympic events around the world that co stings are delivered well after the event. Final costings come in and the people of the nation discover just how much their city, their state or their country is up for in terms Cus- of paying for the Olympics. As I understand it, from the figures that were quoted today, something like $2.7 billion will be expended on the Olympic venue and it will be a matter of the state contributing a sizeable proportion of that. Revenue from the Olympics and revenue from the sale of housing that is being developed at the present moment to house athletes, et cetera, will go towards meeting the costs of those facilities at Homebush. As I have said, the fact that costings have been released now, in advance of the Olympics having been completed-and notwithstanding some commentary that the initial costs have blown out by comparison with those that were advanced at the time of the bid being made. I think is a credit to the New South Wales government. Quite often in this place we stand in front of each other and hold debate-and sometimes, indeed, even scream abuse-about whether or not governments and, indeed, oppositions are accountable. In the case of governments being accountable, of course that normally goes to whether or not all information is provided to the taxpayers of Australia in respect of any legislation, any tax measure or any other measure that the government brings forward. In the case of New South Wales, as I say, here for all to see, warts and all, are the costings associated with the presentation of the Olympics in the year 2000. As I said, the fact that it has been broken down to co stings like $144 million for transport, $99 million for other aspects of the games, $8 million-odd for hospital and medical facilities and so on is an indication of significance which the New South Wales government attaches to ensuring that the taxpayers of that state know about it. That extends to the taxpayers of Australia and, might I say, even the Commonwealth government, given that we are now a sponsor with the latest deal that has been done in handing over the $32 million-odd that was required for things like providing customs services and other facilities where there was some scrabbling around the edges between, I think, the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson) and his counterpart, Michael Knight, in New South Wales. I think it is very appropriate that that is the case. I might just say, while we are about it, to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) that I know that those in the Australian Olympic movement and the athletes in Australia who are looking forward to the challenges of the year 2000 Olympics and Paralympics welcome the support that has come from the Commonwealth government. I have had an opportunity to meet with a number of people and to discuss that. It is a little unfortunate that people decided that they wanted to play politics at the edges. Discussions that were going on behind the scenes would probably have achieved a reasonable outcome in the long term, but from the opposition's perspective we thank the customs minister who is at the table most sincerely not only for what his department will be doing to ensure that the Olympics goes off well but also for providing a briefing for me and my staff on this specific bill. I commend this minister; he goes out of his way to ensure that the opposition is informed on every aspect of customs legislation. It is something which we certainly appreciate. The only issue that emerged when we were looking at this bill was the fact that, as I have said, it was seeking to allow the importation of prescribed goods by non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic family members for both the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the Sydney 2000 Paralympics. The only problem that crept up for us was: just what is this definition of the 'Olympic family'? The definition lies in the hands of the International Olympic the Committee, and, as best as we could ascertain, the definition of the 'Olympic family' is not written down anywhere. It would also seem that under the very astute and esteemed guidance of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the President of the IOC, the definition apparently has widened somewhat. Initially, the definition included the IOC members and accompanying persons, the International Federal President and Secretary-General, the athletes, officials and accompanying persons. But that has now been widened to include people belonging to the host city delegations and accompanying persons and also the media at large. Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, as an avid sports fanatic yourself, representing the western suburbs of Sydney, with all of the facilities that are available there and the fact that your electorate is very close to the Homebush site and to a number of the other Olympic facilities that have been built in the western suburbs of Sydney, I am sure you would be interested to know that when you see an Olympic Games in operation you notice not only the number of support staff that go with the athletes themselves but also the media. There are all these official media coming from every participating nation around the world-and that includes the print media, the radio broadcast media, the television crews, the backup, the electricians and all the rest of it. It is fair to say that you would get the impression that quite a large number of people are now embraced by this definition of the 'Olympic family'. Very kindly, this afternoon, Customs officials came and briefed me; some figures have been put on this now. The approximate size of the Olympic family-and this should not excite too many people because there are some explanations behind it-is 40,000 for the Sydney Olympics, 20,000 for the Paralympics and 5,000-odd people coming for trial and cultural events, making a grand total of 65,OOO-odd personnel. That is not a bad family to belong to, is it? If that includes getting seats at the Olympics, Minister, there are a few of us on this side who would like to think that we could be adopted as part of that Olympic familyMr Truss-And on our side!",81
320,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,And perhaps even on your side there are a few that have put their hands up for adoption as well. Dr Kemp interjecting,83
321,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No, they have not stretched out the hand of friendship to you just yet, Minister. As I have said, athletes, officials, journalists, dignitaries and a whole range of people will be part of this Olympic family. In trying to quantify just what the cost to government might be in processing these people and the effects that this would have on Customs, I have been assured-and I think it is absolutely right-that the cost, as it was to me, is going to vary between zero and very little. At the end of the day, when people come into Australia and bring their equipment in there are ways in which Customs facilitates that. So there is no real reason for concern there. Many athletes who come and participate in the Olympic Games bring quite a range and variety of very expensive equipment these days; it is the latest and the greatest. Probably, in many cases, the most expensive part of an athlete's equipment is what they bring with them-for example, in the case of a yachtsperson or if they happen to be involved in some of the other events where expensive equipment is necessary. Gone are the days when you brought a pair of Nike shoes, a pair of running shorts and a T-shirt or whatever and that was it. It is fair to say that in most cases there is quite a bit of equipment which each of the athletes bring in, and this bill is there to facilitate the entry of that equipment on behalf of the athletes. I conclude where r started by again just saying that the opposition has no difficulty whatsoever with this legislation. I reiterate that all Australians are looking forward to this event. I do have some concerns-and I did raise it with the minister's officials this afternoon-about the capacity for the departmental people at the barrier to cope with the huge influx of people in the year 2000-and not only the athletes themselves; fortunately, though, I think they will be pretty much staggered. Athletes and countries' representative squads will be here well in advance of the actual events themselves. They will want to be here for final training and to acclimatise just prior to the events occurring in September. Many of them are going to come to Wollongong and go into residence, we hope, beforehand as part of the training regime because of the facilities that we have in our location. I think it will be a very difficult time for the Australian Customs Service to move the amount of people through Sydney airport and other entry points in Australia-not only the athletes but also the many thousands of people-who will come to the Olympics. put While he is the minister at the minute-and I cannot extend to him the hope that he might still be in that position in the year 2000-he is overseeing at the moment the Australian Customs Service as they plan how they are going to deal with these issues at the time. r think it is going to test our servicing r ability, but know that he has a tremendously dedicated group of individuals that make up the Australian Customs Service. I know that they will be doing what is humanly possible to facilitate the movement of athletes, spectators and visitors coming to Australia during the year 2000 both before, during and after the Olympics and the Paralympics. As part of the process of selling Australia to the rest of the world, it is those impressions that people go away with that will help enhance us as a potential major future tourist destination for some markets that we are trying to penetrate at the present moment. That impression comes with facilitation, the ease with which people come through the barrier, where they are processed quickly, where they can collect their bags, where they can get out of Mascot. Minister, I am sure that you would have been through Sydney in recent times. The amount of work that is going on in both the domestic and the international arenas at the present moment is staggering. I think it is all for the good. We wish this legislation speedy passage. We certainly wish all the best to the athletes that are going to be beneficiaries of the good hosting of Australia. The Australian Customs Service will help facilitate the movement of athletes and visitors through Australia. I that will be an appropriate welcome that we will give them. This legislation is timely in ensuring that the Olympics family, as broad as it may be-all 65,000 of them, God bless them-come into Australia and participate. I am sure we. all hope that they leave with a smile on their face but that they do not leave with too many gold medals.",83
322,Mr ANDREW,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I too am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 and to follow the remarks made by the member for Cunningham, the shadow minister for small business, Customs and the Olympics (Mr Martin). The shadow minister has a particular affinity with the operation of the Customs Service. I once served on a committee which he chaired in which a review of the Customs Service was undertaken. I freely concede that he chaired that committee in a very professional way. I think it was a very useful and constructive review with a very bipartisan outcome. He has challenged us tonight to celebrate the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and it is something that every member of this House is happy to do. He has endeavoured, in his usual disarming manner, to be as bipartisan as possible. He has been quite accommodating about what has been done by his New South Wales colleagues, particularly Premier Carr, in the run-up to the Olympics and about what he saw as Premier Carr's particularly concise and effective costing of the Olympic program. I thought his remarks would have been even more acceptable had he taken it one step further and conceded that we also owe a great debt of gratitude to the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) for the very existence of the Olympics here in Australia. I would like to make that comment in a bipartisan sense. Mr Martin-I concede that. John was at the forefront of that.",84
323,Mr ANDREW,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Which the member for Cunningham graciously concedes. As the member for Cunningham has said, the bill offers under concessional item 64 a concession for all of those who will be our guests in think Australia, who will come to the Olympics principally as athletes but also as people who are in one way or another involved in the import of commercial or non-commercial goods. To allow them to participate in the Olympics, this bill offers a concession on the import of those goods. It is a bill that clearly the government endorses because the government has introduced it. It is a bill which the member for Cunningham has welcomed and which he has indicated he intends to give speedy passage. Both the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), at the table, and the shadow minister enjoy a certain sort of affinity with both the Olympics and sporting activity-that a quick glance at their physique will reinforce. As the member for Wakefield, I have to say that I do not enjoy quite the same familiarity with sports or sporting activities. I rise tonight to focus not on schedule 4 of the bill, which has been the focus of the shadow minister's remarks, but on schedules 2 and 3. Schedules 2 and 3 involve a change in the way in which commercial aviation is administered in Australia. Schedules 2 and 3 allow approximately $700,000, which is currently being collected by way of an excise on avgas, to be returned to the users of avgas. The focus of schedules 2 and 3 is fundamentally to bring some equity into the funding of the general aviation services in Australia and the contribution that general aviation makes to the way in which Airservices Australia is administered. Airservices Australia basically polices the way in which our airports run and the way in which our general aviation air traffic is controlled. In the past, that has been funded through an excise levied on avgas users so that all piston engine aircraft using avgas, as opposed to avtur, which is used in most commercial aircraft, had the excise collected at a rate of 15.6c on all the aviation fuel they used. As you will appreciate, Madam Deputy Speaker, this was a cost being particularly borne by those who use piston engine aircraft, but frequently those same people did not use the services of Airservices Australia. If, for example-and I say this as a South Australian; the shadow minister at the table, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), will recognise this-you are using Parafield or West Beach airport in South Australia, you have the advantage of a control tower and of some sort of administration on the way in which you approach and depart from those airports. But if you are landing anywhere else in my electorate-in fact, I would think probably anywhere else in South Australiayou do not have a control tower and you are entirely dependent on messages that are relayed (the minister would know better than I) probably from Melbourne. So this was a case of people who frequently use aircraft and have no need for the detailed air traffic control that goes with aircraft usage paying for a facility they were not accessing. Imagine, if you will, for a moment what this does if you are the operator of agricultural aircraft solely used for the purpose of picking up fertiliser or chemicals in a paddock, carting it a maximum, I would have thought, of 10 kilometres, depositing it on the crop that needs it and returning to load again. You would go backwards and forwards all day, never needing the services of Airservices Australia other than to record with them first thing in the day that that is what you would be doing, that you would never be exceeding an altitude of, say, 500 feet anyway and so never would actually be in the way of any other aircraft, but being obliged, through the use of this particular charge, to pay for a service you did not use. I am indebted to the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who has been much more detailed in his coverage of this legislation than anyone else in the House, save the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) at the table. The member for Parkes indicates to me that if you are operating a crop sprayer in his electorate spraying cotton crops-I have that had some association with crop sprayers, but only 30 years ago when they were the old Pawnee aircraft and of a much smaller design than the ones that are used today-you could well be operating four Air Tractor units, the modern crop sprayer, piloted by professionals who clearly use GPS navigation techniques to ensure that they have not duplicated any of their runs and who are meticulous about where the fertiliser or chemicals are being dropped, which will consume 200,000 Htres of avgas in a season. The legislation we are currently dealing with would save that one crop spraying operator $31,200 in a season's activities. That is the employment of one more person, and it is $31,200 that has been leaving rural Australia for no just cause, paying for a facility that was not being used. It is $31,200 that is now being retained by that operator or retained in that local district. This is a case of the government doing what rural and regional Australia would expect it to do: ensuring that those who use Airservices Australia's facilities and who are advantaged through safe aviation because of the provision of those services are the people who pay. They pay now because the use of anyone of these airports with controlled air space and control towers carries with it a fee, and that fee goes to the funding of Airservices Australia. The legislation currently before the House gives us the opportunity, frankly,. to ensure that regional and rural Australia is not carrying the cost for a service it is not using and that in fact the cost is being more equitably collected from those who arc using the service, whether in flying schools, in small commercial activities or, as in the illustration I have given, as crop dusting operators. I am pleased to be associated with the legislation, and commend the minister on what he has done to bring it into the House in this form.",84
324,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"in reply-I begin by thanking the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for their contributions to the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998. In a sense, they provided a very balanced contribution to the discussion of this bill, because each one dealt with a different section of the bill. The honourable member for Cunningham referred to the new item 64, which introduces a concessional cargo item for Olympic family members and the member for Wakefield spoke about the effect of this bill in reducing the customs duty on aviation gasoline. I think both of these measures are important and will provide significant benefits to the community. As the member for Wakefield said, the reduction in the duty on avgas is part of a program by the federal government to eliminate the charges being imposed for aviation terminal and end route navigational services in this way and replacing them with more specific charges, and that has particular benefits for the general aviation industry. Item 64 is a new item to provide duty-free entry for goods imported by non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic family members in relation to the Sydney Olympics and related cultural and trial events. I thank the member for Cunningham for his kind comments. As minister, I always regard it as a duty and a responsibility to ensure fair and proper debate of issues in this House that the opposition should be properly informed about the contents of legislation. r will always stand ready to provide assistance in that regard wherever I can. This particular item does not of itself actually permit anything of itself. By-laws to the item will be drafted to allow defined goods to be entered duty free. Sensitive and high revenue potential goods, including vehicles, digital communication equipment, alcohol, tobacco and goods for commercial sale, are not intended to be included in the by-laws. Any other sensitive goods are nominated and these can be considered at the time of drafting of the by-laws. This item is intended to be uscd on cargo imported in the main by teams, officials, delegations and accredited media organisations. Imports by individuals who arc part of the Olympic family are covered by already existing concessional items. Sensitive and high revenue potential goods excluded from this item will be able to be imported free of duty and tax under a special temporary entry provision. The temporary entry provision was introduced into law in December 1997 to meet an obligation in the host city contract entered into by the previous government. It is this provision which will cover the big ticket revenue items. Because of the availability of alternative concessions, including those covering temporary and personal imports, the revenue impact of the new item 64 is assessed to be minimal, as indicated by the honourable member for Cunningham. Finally, I would like to comment on and concur with the observations of the member for Cunningham about the significance of the Sydney Olympics to Australia and to Australians. It will be one of the very greatest events ever hosted in this country, and federal and state governments and the local organising committee want to work constructively together to ensure that this is a memorable and smooth-running event. He was right to refer to the occasional prickles that have occurred in the relationship in endeavouring to determine who should take responsibility for particular duties and costs associated with the Olympics. It is not uncommon for states to seek to extract extra funds from the Commonwealth for whatever project may be in their mind, and it has been necessary to resolve some of these issues fairly and equitably. The member for Cunningham also made reference to the particularly important role that Customs will have in facilitating the Sydney Olympics. Let me assure the House that Customs takes this responsibility very seriously. It is true that the first face that many of the visitors coming to Australia will see and the first welcome that they will receive will be from a Customs officer. We want that welcome to be friendly and to be provided in the greatest of Australian traditions so that their visit to this country will begin on the best possible note. It will be an exciting challenge to process the number of passenger movements that will be required over the Sydney Olympics. We are already working towards upgrading technology, designing systems and developing the various techniques that will be necessary to cope with the additional traffic movements at the airports, the large number of ships that will be arriving and with the additional cargo. The international attention that will centred upon our country will certainly provide a large number of challenges. Whilst the majority of arrivals and departures are expected to be at Sydney, other major airports will also be operating at way beyond their normal capacity, so it is not just a simple matter of transferring resources to Sydney. We have to be equipped everywhere to undertake the task. Whilst this is a tremendous challenge and it is important that we do it right for the Sydney Olympics, it is also important to note that the sort of passenger load that is expected for the Sydney Olympics will be the norm by about the year 2005. The sorts of systems that will be required to be put in place to cope with Olympic traffic demands will be needed every day a few years later. So it is not money wasted on a single event; it is an investment in the long-term capacity of Customs to adequately address the issues involved. Ironically, the biggest challenge for Customs will not be the arrival of passengers but departure day. It is anticipated that, whilst visitors will arrive over a considerable period of time leading up to the games, the largest part of the Olympic family will want to leave on the day after the games or very soon thereafter. Processing these departing passengers will be the real challenge as far as logistics are concerned. Those sorts of things are in hand. This bill will help to make the arrival of the Olympic family smoother, more seamless and easier for Customs to process and will also provide the kind of hospitable welcome that I think all people coming to Australia can expect during the Olympics. I am sure it will get their stay in this country off to a wonderful beginning. I commend this bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Truss) read a third time. TAXATION LAWS. AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 April, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",86
325,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I was entertained to hear the Minister for Customs and Consumer Mfairs (Mr Truss) summing up on the previous legislation talking about the importance and value of the Sydney Olympics. One of the features of the bill now before the House is that it may result in some unfair outcomes, especially on low margin, fixed price contracts relating to some Sydney Olympics projects. There could be a situation where a developer has to pay the tax but will apparently not be able to pass on the cost to the owner of the infrastructure. This means that many contractors and subcontractors are now going to be subject to sales tax in respect of jobs that they reasonably thought were tax exempt. I will come back to this in a moment. The bill now before the House is an omnibus taxation bill containing many unrelated proposals, several of which are anti-avoidance measures. The first proposal in the bill is to amend the sales tax law to remove the current blanket exemption that applies to items for use in properties owned or leased to tax exempt bodies-for example, and typically, state governments, charities and foreign governments-and instead allow the exemption only where the tax exempt person actually uses the property. In addition to the general restriction mentioned above, certain types of property will completely lose the right to the sales tax exemption, even if these are operated by the tax exempt person. These activities include shops and shopping centres, hotels, casinos and apartment blocks. A windfall sales tax exemption currently arises where businesses which are ordinarily subject to sales tax are conducted on property owned by a tax exempt person. This provides an unfair advantage to such businesses, at the expense of the Commonwealth. This bill proposes to limit the exemption to circumstances where the tax exempt body itself will benefit from the exemption, not a private sector commercial interest which simply operating on a site owned by the tax associate exempt perSOl1. This move is supported by selection Labor in principle. However, the effect of the proposal as currently drafted is retrospective, as it applies to existing contracts in circumstates stances where the developer will be hit with a new tax liability but will apparently not be able to pass it on. As I mentioned just a exempt moment ago, this could result in some unfair outcomes for low margin, fixed price conwords tracts relating, for example, to Sydney Olymthis test. pics projects, where you will not be able to pass on the cost but you will now be liable for the tax. In our view, this is a very poor that example of effectively retrospective legislawords tion by press release which has been in operThe ation since 2 April this year. There are probproposals ably hundreds of people in the building industry who have already unknowingly broken the law by claiming sales tax exemptions. Will these contractors face fines if this legislation passes? Are they already accumulast lating interest rate penalties? How can they reasonably expected to operate under this of commercial environment? This issue should be investigated. I believe it will be investigatas ed in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Labor will be considering its final position on this schedule in the light of evidence provided to the cpmmittee and the impact of this proposal on the construction industry. The bill also proposes to amend the fringe benefits tax to exempt student exchange programs, to remove the need for some employers to keep FBT records, and to provide an alternative method of calculating FBT based on the previous year for those employers-who, I understand, are estimated at only some 30,000-who provide the same type of fringe benefits on an ongoing basis. These measures seem reasonable and are not opposed in principle. That said, the Taxation Institute of Australia has pointed out that there is some inconsistency between the explanatory memorandum and the bill. If I may quote from the submission by the Taxation Institute of Australia concerning this bill, it says: is The requirement . .. that an employer or an of the employer does not take part in the of the employee or associate as a participant in the exchange program should be clarified. The Explanatory Memorandum (at paragraph 2.71) that an employer would be considered to have taken part in the selection process where the employer controlled or influenced the selection of the recipient. Further, the benefit will only be where the recipient is selected independently by the student exchange body. However. the in the proposed amendment are stricter than So the Taxation Institute recommends: a further subsection be inserted reflecting the in the Explanatory Memorandum. provisions apparently represent the final relating to taxation which are aimed at cutting red tape on small business. Accordingly, one would be entitled to think that this might mean that 50 per cent of small business paperwork has been removed-as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised prior to the election. Clearly, this has not occurred. I be can confidently say that not one small busitype ness person has contacted my office or the office of anyone else in the opposition, so far I am aware, to rejoice in the idea that they now face only 50 per cent of the paperwork burden that they faced some two years ago. I the think this promise is taking on some of the proportions of the 'no child will live in poverty' promise of a previous Prime Minister. Clearly the paperwork promise was another non-core promise which has not been delivered on. Indeed, what we are going to find is that, through the imposition of a GST, there will be huge initial and ongoing compliance costs on all small businesses, who will find that, rather than being cut in half, their paperpower work is going to double. At present some 75,000 small businesses are involved in the collection of wholesale sales tax, but GST will spread the net to a million small businesses. Their paperwork will skyrocket dramatically. Schedule 3 of the bill proposes to amend the income tax law to ensure that the antiavoidance provisions concerning debt forgiveness-that is, the provisions which attempt to ensure that taxpayers cannot obtain a tax advantage in respect of receiving the benefit of a debt being forgiven-operate in their intended manner. Labor supports this antiavoidance measure wholeheartedly. Similarly, schedule 4, which seeks to amend the income tax law to allow the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission access to taxation information in the same way that other law enforcement bodies enjoy, is not opposed by Labor. Schedule 6 proposes to amend the income tax law concerning the tax law improvement program, the TLIP-which is a project designed to rewrite the taxation law in simpler, plainer English-to both correct technical errors and to take into account changes to the old taxation law arising from proposed legislation before the Senate at the time of drafting. This is simply fixing up errors and ensuring continuity of taxation arrangements and is therefore supported. Labor started the TLIP program and we have continued - to support it whilst in opposition. I recognise that criticisms are made of the process, but Labor considers that the benefits of the new simpler, plain English regime far outweigh the problems which do arise. The answer is to quickly pass measures such as these to ensure that the inevitable inconsistencies are rapidly dealt with. Another major matter dealt with in this bill is contained in schedule 10. This proposes to introduce the depreciation arrangements which set a limit on the amount of depreciation which can be claimed where an asset is disposed of by a previously tax exempt entity. The general case where this provision will apply is where a state government intends to privatise a specific asset, for example, a station, instead of selling a business as a going concern. The mischief-in legal parlance-that these amendments are aimed at is the fact that the current tax law allows full depreciation at the sale price to be available for the new owners of these privati sed assets, irrespective of their actual written down value. In effect, the Commonwealth is providing a generous tax subsidy for state governments to privatise their physical assets rather than to sell businesses as a going concern. Labor certainly supports removing a tax related subsidy for privatisation and is therefore happy to support this matter in principle. That said, there are claims that the new regime is too onerous. This matter should be and, I believe, will be examined closely in the Senate committee hearings later this month. Schedule 11 amends the income tax law to introduce anti-avoidance rules concerning the termination of hire purchase or limited recourse debt arrangements. Basically the intent of the rules is to ensure that taxpayers are not able to benefit from deductions in excess of the amounts they actually incur. In addition, the rules relating to hire purchase or instalment payment arrangements in general are amended to treat the hirer as the owner of assets and to treat the hire purchase or instalment payment arrangement as a loan. Once again, this is a sensible anti-avoidance piece of legislation which should be supported. The final anti-avoidance measures in the bill, and possibly the most important, are contained in schedule 13. This schedule proposes to amend the income tax law to limit the sources of franking imputation credits which are available from companies wholly owned by non-residents or tax exempt persons or those which have previously been owned by these exempt taxpayers which are likely to be used in franking credit trading arrangements. Put simply, trading in franking credits involves taxpayers arranging to get the tax benefits associated with imputation otherwise than in the legitimate manner of genuinely owning the shares. The proposals in this bill seek to limit trading opportunities by disallowing franking credits which are earned by entities whose owners, that is, the non-residents or tax exempt persons, cannot benefit from the imputation system and who are therefore very likely to seek to trade in these credits. The idea is to reduce the trading by reducing the supply of potentially tradeable credits. It is an idea which is strongly supported by Labor. We will examine representations on the fine detail but we are supportive of the thrust of these measures, which are designed to stamp out tax avoidance by the misuse of the dividend imputation system. The imputation system was designed to stop unfair double taxation; it was not designed to facilitate avoidance by high wealth individuals. The final schedule that ought to be tioned this evening is schedule 5, which is conflict of interest schedule. This proposes amend the income tax law to allow a deducmembers tion for donations made to the Menzies Research Centre Public Fund, that is, the Liberal Party's think-tank. The Prime Minister was in breach of his own discredited code ministerial conduct by being a director of public company-the Menzies Research GST Centre Public Fund-when he became a also minister. Further, he breached the code by agreeing, when he was still a director of that seen. company, to grant tax deductibility for donations to the fund, as is proposed in this bill. This involves a clear conflict of interest and, frankly, he ought to have resigned as someone who had breached his own code. We know the Prime Minister is not pared to enforce the code in relation to Senator Parer; he is certainly not prepared enforce the code in relation to himself. As result, the code now stands in tatters and has no credibility whatsoever. Thisjs a matter which my colleague the Manager of Opposithe tion Business in the House, the honourable October 1997 to: member for Hotham (Mr Crean), will be pursuing in the course of this debate. I would now like to tum to the tax reform debate, which the government is so keen not to have. The government has refused to do the nation the courtesy of unveiling the tax package so that we can all assess it and examine its implications for ourselves and for the nation. The government's intention now is crystal clear. It intends to release the tax package a matter of days before it takes us off to the polls, to give the minimum possible time for scrutiny. The government says, 'We have learnt the lesson of John Hewson and Fightback.' That lesson is: do not show the nation what your package is in detail; do not give them the opportunity to examine it because they may decide to give it the thumbs down. So the government intends to sneak the tax package through. The government still refuses to disclose the real options for taxation reform. If it were tax being honest about this, it would include the public in its thoughts and deliberations. We heard the Prime Minister talk about the great mentax adventure. There has been no public the process in relation to this. Senator Gibson's to backbench committee is a joke. Two former of this committee have left not only the committee but also the government; they have left the coalition. Paul Zammit, the member for Lowe, and Tony Smith, the of member for Dickson, have not only quit the a committee because of the unfairness of the and the arrogance of the government but taken it further and left the Liberal Party altogether. What an amazing process we have Indeed, the member for Lowe has put out a'Very interesting and revealing media release detailing the interference and the cynicism of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and, by implication, the Prime Minister. We have seen in the premember for Lowe's press release of just yesterday some highly revealing indications to about what went on behind the scenes with a the government's tax consultative task force. it In his press release, Mr Zammit says that there was a verbal directive expressly from Treasurer at its inaugural meeting on 23 · .. make no recommendations on tax reform proposals. The Treasurer had said to the parliament on 23 October that it had to involve itself in: · .. drawing up tax proposals. And that: This is a committee of people of exceptional ability. And that it was going to: · . . consult the Australian public in designing a new tax system for Australia. The Treasurer also said that the committee was chosen for its expertise. Despite thatia. and one would have been forgiven for thinkSo ing that there was going to be some real consultation here-according to the member for Lowe, the Treasurer was unequivocal his instructions that the task force should seen but not heard. The member for Lowe went further in the House, calling on the Prime Minister to acknowledge that the task force has been muzzled and indicating that was not going to accept any responsibility personally for what came out in the team government's tax package. We saw the Prime Minister misleading the House, indicating that these sorts of instructions had not been given to the task force, when clearly from the remarks of both the member for Lowe and the member for Dickson this is exactly what occurred. Dr Kemp-I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy Chair. I ask the member to withdraw that remark. He accused the Prime Minister of misleading the House. There has been a debate on this matter and that charge was refuted by the vast majority of members of the House and he should withdraw. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Holl. J.A. lunch Crosio)-The minister has drawn a long bow. The statement 'misleading the House' is used time and time again in debate in this ment. I do not believe there is a point of order. Dr Kemp-A substantive motion should be moved if someone is going to be accused of misleading the House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It was a comment made in the debate before the House and I do not believe that at this stage there is a point of order.",87
326,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I thank you for your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker. It goes further than that, of course, because the Prime Minister told the Australian people back in May 1995: Suggestions ... that I have left open the possibility of a GST are completely wrong. A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy. Nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda in Australmuch for the Prime Minister's credibility. I draw the attention of the House to the words 'a GST or anything resembling it'. Today in there was a report in the Financial Review be concerning the federal government's move to find an advertising agency to handle a separate campaign on tax changes, including the intr6duction of a goods and services tax. This he was said to have surprised many in the advertising agency. I can tell you what this new is going to be paid to do. It is going to be paid to come up with new words-any words, as long as their initials are not GST. I dare say that the agency will be told, 'Your mission, should you choose to accept it, and at least to accept the cheque that comes with had it, is to come up with a new expression.' A GST by any other name will still have the same effect on ordinary families who will be forced to pay a tax on the necessities of life which are presently tax free, including food, the cost of child care, prams, cots, nappies-all kinds of things which are essential for those bringing up a family. School fees-for those paying them-the cost of at the canteen, the cost of public transport to get to school and the cost of books when children are at school will all be subject parliato the GST by any other name. A GST by any other name will still impact on older people, on retired people, for whom it is too late to go back into the work force to try to earn extra dollars under what we assume will be lower rates of income tax. But they will have to pay for all the extra impositions coming from a GST and they will find their savings being devalued accordingly. A GST, by whatever name it is called by this whiz-bang new advertising agency, will still impact on retired people. A GST, whether by that name or any other name, will still impact on small business. I said before that we presently have some 80,000 or so small businesses acting as collectors of wholesale sales tax. What this measure will do is tum some one million small businesses into unpaid tax collectors who have to pay the compliance burden of setting up a GST-monitoring regime and who have to pay the ongoing costs of administration of the GST. So it will be of no value to small business. A GST, whether called a GST or something else, will do nothing towards stamping out tax avoidance. I know there are people who think, 'If we could get those who are wealthy to stop avoiding tax and pay their fair share, it might be worth it.' In fact, what a GST actually does is increase the incentives for tax avoidance because it encourages people to avoid reporting transactions. By avoiding the reporting of transactions they are able to not pay income tax and GST. By whatever name it is called, it will have an effect on many ordinary Australians. This comes against the background that this government has failed to stamp out tax avoidance. It has failed to take the measures that have been open to it to protect the revenue. By way of example, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald towards the end of April talked about some hundreds of millions of dollars leaching from the tax system from independent contractors. The article reported that the Treasurer had ignored tax office warnings, delivered in a detailed confidential paper in 1996, that the existing tax law was unfair and had to be changed to stem the flow of sham contractors avoiding PAYE tax. As a result, ordinary employees have to pay more than their fair share of the tax bill. Soon after the 1996 election, on 20 June, the Treasurer promised: I make it clear on behalf of this government where anomalies and exemptions are being exploited they will be addressed. But in this case he has wilfully failed to correct a major tax anomaly where a section of the work force uses artificial schemes to avoid paying their fair share of income tax. He refused to proceed with Labor's legislation introduced before the 1996 election which, by broadening the definition of salary and wages under the PAYE system, would have ensured that individuals doing the same jobs face a similar tax regime. Further, the Treasurer refused to follow up on the Labor initiative to cut down on tax avoidance by artificial schemes involving interposed entities-that is, companies, trusts or partnerships. Instead of paying PAYE income tax like other workers, some independent contractors set themselves up as companies, partnerships or trusts. As a result, they are able to take advantage of the tax law to claim deductions not available to PAYE workers, to defer income tax, to split income and so on. Millions of ordinary taxpayers pay higher taxes as a result of this erosion of the tax base. Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis began a more detailed analysis of legislative remedies to cut down on tax avoidance by artificial schemes of this kind and announced the release of a public discussion paper with legislation to apply from 1 July 1996. However, in the 1996 budget, incoming Treasurer Costello announced that 'in a boost to small business' he would not be proceeding either with Labor's PAYE amendments or with any legislation to deal with the interposed entity problem. So how can we take seriously the government's claim that the tax system is broke when they fail to take action on a tax scam which is costing hundreds of millions of dollars every year? Their deliberate refusal to do anything about bogus independent contractors makes a mockery of their claim that they want a fairer tax system. It was also interesting to hear, back in April I think, from a visitor to Australia, Professor Neil Brooks, concerning the implementation of the GST in Canada and how it had gone that there. In an interview, Professor Brooks was unfairly asked about the GST in Canada and his response was: Well, it's been a disaster in Canada almost at every level. First of all, it was a political disaster for the party that introduced it. They went seats in our House of Commons down to two. Mr Latham-How many?",91
327,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"From 189 seats down to two-and we think that in a couple of elections we have not done so well. A part of us thinks it should say to the government, 'Go ahead, make my day. Go ahead and introduce the GST.' Professor Brooks goes on: It's been a disaster for small business. The compliance costs on small business have just been mous. It increased the size of the underground economy so that it meant that dishonest small business people were suddenly advantaged over honest small business people. The tax has proven to be enormously regressive. I mean, it falls heavily on large families, on people who are, effect, consuming all of their income. So that been a disaster, I think almost at every level. Professor Brooks was queried about the fact that the Liberal government here thinks an electoral plus. He went on to say: I am surprised. I must say the only group Canada that consistently supported it was big business because it was an enormous tax break them. They, in effect, shifted about $5 billion the tax burden from large corporations to housebe holds; and, indeed, poll after poll showed per cent of Canadians opposed the tax even after it was enacted. They wanted it repealed. So that imagine that a party thinks that they've got a winning election with a goods and services astounds me. In relation to this shifting of the tax burden onto households, the head of the Council of Australia, Stan Wallis, gave the game away just a few days ago when in the Australian he stated that the Business Council of Australia were going to go into bat for GST. He said: ... the GST holds out the prospect of significant reductions in the indirect tax burden currently by business. There are only two tax paying sectors in the economy: the household sector and the busihas ness sector. So, for Mr Wallis, a reduction in the indirect tax burden means that there will be an increase in the burden to be borne households. For this government to say, 'We are going to transfer the tax burden from big business onto ordinary families,' from 189 good enough. Professor Brooks went on to say: All sales taxes are regressive and this one, in particular, was regressive in the way it was designed . . . high income people pay about 3 per cent of their income in the goods and services tax and low income people in fact pay more than 7 per cent of their income because they're actually dissaving. As a result, this measure turned out to be regressive in Canada. One of the areas I am concerned about, if enorit werc to be introduced in Australia, is the impact on rctail tenants and franchisees. I have made a numbcr of contributions in the House about what I think are the difficult most circumstances faced by retail tenants in large in shopping centres and the like. If we take a it's typical case, a retail tenant who presently pays about $150,000 in rcnt and outgoings would see that amount increase with a 10 per it is cent GST, for example, to $165,000. A franchisee who has to pay, for example, $50,000 per annum in franchise fees would in see that increase to $55,000 under a GST. for There is no way that they would be able to of recoup that. They are certainly not going to able to recoup it from the shopping centre that 80 management via the leases. There is no prospect of them recouping those additional to costs, and to say that their company tax is tax going to be reduced is of no value to them unless they actually make a profit and are able to make ends meet. I am concerned about the way in which the GST will impact Business on those small businesses. I cannot let my contribution finish without mentioning that it will impact on the Citylink the in Melbourne within my own electorate of Wills. I personally think that the Citylink project has been appallingly handled by both the state government and the authority inborne volved in its construction. The noise walls have been built. In Europe the Berlin Wall has come down but the trans-urban wall here gone up, and it is somewhat more serious for those who are living on either side of that trans-urban wall to see these walls being built. by They have not done us the courtesy of showing us the designs. They say, 'We are designing them as we go,' and that is highly regretsimply is not table. (Time expired)",93
328,Dr SOUTHCOTT,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The parliamentary secretary has just highlighted the moral bankruptcy of Labor's position when it comes to tax reform. He mentioned that the coalition refused to release the tax package to allow them time to scrutinise the reform. I would ask the member: where was he in 1993 when, after the election, Paul Keating opposed the GST and then subsequently increased the wholesale sales tax rates in the 1993 budget? He increased the 10 per cent wholesale sales tax to 12 per cent, the 20 per cent tax to 22 per cent and the 30 per cent tax to 32 per cent. He did not just increase the rates; in the 1995 budget he also broadened the base to try to include things like household items, building materials and so on. In the 1995 budget he also increased the wholesale sales tax on cars from 15 per cent to 22 per cent. As Neil Warren from ATAX has highlighted, this raised something like $3 billion in indirect taxes. Labor are now trying to show a lot of concern for the battlers yet they increased, regressively, indirect taxes which fell more on the battlers-and they did it without giving them any sort of compensation. Labor had also done it before; they have got some form on this. In 1985 they actually broadened the wholesale sales tax base again. They did not go to an election saying what they would do; they did it without seeking any mandate. They did it without raising it during an election campaign. Biscuits, icecream, savouries and so on were all suddenly taxed. It was a hidden tax; no-one even knew they were paying it. In fact, from 1993 to 1995 Labor increased the wholesale sales tax revenue by 14 per cent. They also increased taxes, excises, on petrol and the excise on tobacco. Neil Warren has estimated-if you look at the 1992-93 rates-what Labor had operating before the election and what they had operating in 1996 when they left. An extra $6.2 billion in goods and services was raised in 1996 based on those higher tax rates. He said that, of that $6.2 billion, $541 million of those taxes fell on exports. He pointed out that the indirect tax hikes that Labor introduced bctween 1993 and 1996 impacted on the imports into the production processes and that they were non-transparent. He mentioned the fact that indirect tax changes eroded household real disposable income by 2.1 per cent. However, the impact was heaviest on the unemployed and the aged. People recognise that indirect taxes impact on people on low incomes. That is why you have to look at compensation for those on lower incomes. The Labor Party never gave compensation to those on lower incomes. When they left office, Labor in effect had the equivalent of an 8.1 per cent GST. Labor had their own GST. It was a hidden GST, a Clayton's GST. But, more importantly, the Labor indirect tax system was inefficient. It attacked production exports. It harmed export competitiveness. It was not transparent. It was not efficient. The previous speaker, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), mentioned the zero rating of food. People feel quite good about the zero rating of food; however, it does not apply to biscuits, confectionary and ice-cream. In fact, Australia's finest minds do not really know what to do with frozen yoghurt. Is it food? Is it confectionary? Is it ice-cream? At present, under the wholesale sales tax system, we have the zero rating of food, and those who benefit most are people on higher incomes. What it means is that every member of the BRW top 200 does not pay tax on their food; they do not pay tax on caviar. The 100 high wealth individuals that Ralph Willis was chasing in the fin a] month of Labor's 13 years do not pay tax on food either. As Neil Warren has pointed out, most of the benefits of that zero rating of food go to those on higher incomes. Those on the top 20 per cent of incomes benefit twice as much as those on the bottom 20 per cent. It is not a very good way of targeting how you are going to deliver fairness in a tax system to the battlers. There are better ways of delivering compensation and better ways of targeting to those on lower incomes than by zero rating food. As we all remember, Labor raised indirect taxes to fund their income tax cuts, which were not delivered. They offered no compensation for indirect tax hikes which added $6 billion in indirect tax in their last year, and they also taxed production inputs. Neil Warren said: While Labor outwardly despised the distributional impact of a broad based GST, they in effect introduced such a tax but without any compensation for those adversely affected. Tax is something that we should not be having a political debate about. If you read Paul Kelly's comments, you realise that when Paul Keating went to the tax summit in 1985 he did not have many supporters in cabinet for option C-the broad based consumption tax at 12- per cent-but his supporters included the shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans; the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley); former Prime Minister Bob Hawke; and Susan Ryan. John Edwards's biography of Keating confirms that the supporters were the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition. He also mentioned that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) saw a consumption tax as being inevitable, but that he had some concerns about it. David Morgan, in Labor in power, tells us that the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition was convinced in 1985 of a need for a consumption tax. He waited for two days for a hole to be punched in the argument, and it never happened. We have also heard recently that the annual negative impact of the wholesale sales tax on Australian exporters is almost $5 billion. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that the cascading of indirect taxes adds something like four to nine per cent to our costs. That detracts from Australia's competitiveness. The wholesale sales tax is a hidden tax, but it is Labor's tax. It might have been introduced in 1930-the differential rate might have come in with Artie Fadden-but this is the tax that Labor wants to defend. What we need to know is what Labor want to do about things like the black market economy-and Labor have a bit of form. Are they going to do a 1993? Are they going to go into this election opposing any sort of tax reform and then increase indirect taxes like they did before? What we need to know from Labor is: why do we have a tax system where we tax sinks at 12 per cent but the pipe leading to the sink is not taxed? Why do we have a tax system where we tax engagement rings but not wedding rings? Why are aircraft tax exempt but people pay 32 per cent tax on televisions, radios and cameras? It used to be 30 per cent, but Labor increased it in 1993. They pay 32 per cent on other things like watches, clocks, tape recorders and video recorders. What the Labor Party should explain is: why, in 1998, do we exempt horseshoes and horseshoe nails? This highlights the fact that this tax system was introduced in the 1930s. Very few countries still maintain a wholesale sales tax system. Here are some of the things on the schedules that are wholesale sales tax exempt: yam and threads for netting and sewing, raffia, sewing twine, food for nondomestic birds, tallow, scoured wool, acetylene, liquid oxygen, ammonia, toluol and explosives. They are all things that are targeted at the battlers. The reason that they are tax exempt is presumably for equity reasons. At the same time, we have a 12 per cent tax on sponges, matches, baths, sinks, toilets, water heaters, storage tanks, toilet cleaners, maps, atlases, globes, confectionary, flavoured milk and fruit juices. Flavoured milk and fruit juices were not always taxed. It was introduced in 1985 when Labor-again without going to an election and without telling the people what they were going to do-added these things to the wholesale sales tax system. Presumably that is what they are going to do after the next election. Presumably they realise that goods are declining as a proportion of the economy and that services are increasing and perhaps they want to expand the V{holesale sales tax system more. This is an omnibus bill. There are a number of tax measures in here, some of which are anti-evasion. An important one will allow deductions for the Menzies Research Centre of $2 and above. It mirrors a deduction which has been there for the Evatt Foundation since 1981. I support that measure, and I commend the bill to the House.",94
329,Mr ROCHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I have not heard much about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1998 from the two previous speakers, although the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kclvin Thomson) did touch on it in his earlier remarks. Since then it has been a debate on a tax reform prospect that none of us know anything about. Anyway, it has been interesting to observe what has gone on so far. The government has seen fit yet again to introduce into this place another omnibus bill complete with 13 disparate schedules. I have previously lamented that such bills place members in the unenviable position of attempting to speak to all schedules in a very superficial man ncr or speaking to one or two schedules in some depth at the expense of the rest, or you might opt for the tactic of the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) and talk about none of them. I had not considered that, to be perfectly honest. I receive regular feedback from tax professionals expressing outrage at the lack of scrutiny in this chamber of tax legislation, and I want to have my misgivings about the composition of this bill noted. Schedule 12 of the bill sets out the government's proposed amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 through the introduction of a record keeping cxemption for small business operators. In analysing the nature of this amendment and its relevance to the business sector, it is worthwhile revisiting events which led to its genesis. The coalition entered into the last election campaign keenly aware of the economic malaise that had beset the small business sector under the former Labor administration. It was equally aware of the considerable clout that this constituency could wield at the ballot box. For this reason the then opposition leader, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), unashamedly pitched his campaign at Australia's small business proprietors with promises of a less cumbersome regulatory regime and policies that would elicit a powerful and strong business environment. He promised swift action in addressing the problems associated with complying with the rcd tape burden. Soon after the March 1996 poll the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs in this government, the member for  about regulatory reform that would prove to be a thorn in the side of the coalition. We were told repeatedly that the coalition was committed to reducing by 50 per cent the overall compliance burden on small business during the life of this parliament. Accordingly, the government appointed an independent task force to comprehensively identify the major regulatory burdens faced by the small business sector and to make recommendations on how this burden could be reduced by half. The 62-recommendation Bell report was handed down in November 1996. To its credit, the government responded to this report within four months of its release. Unfortunately, the quality of the response failed to match the timely reply. The government produced a statement which, while embracing more than half of the Bell committee recommendations, would make only a small dent into the regulatory problems confronting the small business sector, thanks to the proviso that only those recommendations which would have a neutral effect on revenue would be considered. In evaluating the government's More Time for Business statement, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA-the CCIWAstated that it met 'neither the government's promises or small business expectations'. As the I have said in this place on another occasion, the government would have most likely found it difficult to meet all the expectations of the small business community even without the promise of a 50 per cent reduction in compliance. To tout a halving of the compliance burden when the revenue neutral caveat was always a part of the coalition's plan was an act of very poor judgment. On 5 February 1997 the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs had this to say during question time: ... we are committed to tackling the compliance burden that has the greatest impact on small business first so that we can reduce those regulations that are the most onerous to comply with. Presumably the then minister was familiar with the report that was released by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia some nine months before into the activities and requirements of government which were seen to have a substantial impact on small business performance. That report showed that compliance with the fringe benefits tax regime presented the biggest and most costly problems for the small business sector. The results of that particular report were backed up by the findings of the Bell committee, which produced a series of recommendations calling for a thorough overhaul of FBT, owing to its huge impost on business. It is now some 15 months since the former minister promised to tackle 'the compliance burden that has the greatest impact on small business first' and we are debating the merits of this amendment for the very first time. Meanwhile, the FBT net continues to expand, having brought in a total of $3.16 billion in the 1997 FBT year-almost 10 times the revenue that was forecast when the tax was first introduced by Labor back in 1986. With FBT payments of that magnitude, it is no wonder the government has dragged its feet in attempts to bring about meaningful reform in fringe benefits tax legislation. This bill purports to provide FBT record keeping relief to those employers who submit an FBT return in a base year of no more than $5,000 in taxable benefits and who do not substantially alter the level of benefits providing ed in the future. At a glance, the amendments read very well indeed. Debate interrupted. NA",95
330,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. ANZAC Service: Overseas Delegation",97
331,Mr TED GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"Fowler) (10.30 p.m.)It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise tonight in the adjournment debate. I wish to inform the House of what I consider to be a great privilege which was bestowed on me as a member of this House. I refer to my recent visit as a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European Institutions from 20 to 30 April 1997. Apart from the exceHent comradeship I enjoyed with the other members of the delegation, a most successful delegation, I was overwhelmed by our visits to what I consider to be Australia's sacred sites overseas. By sacred sites, I mean the Commonwealth war graves-graveyards scattered all around Europe where thousands of young Australian soldiers are buried after paying the ultimate sacrifice in two world wars. Visiting the war graves across France and Belgium is something one has to do to really gauge the utter futility of war. Nonetheless, one feels pride when one considers the bravery of those young men who died so that we could live in freedom from tyranny in a world where we all have a say in the composition of the government which we think should govern us. Time does not permit me to give the House a commentary on the whole war graves tour, but I would like to dwell on what I consider to be the most important monument in that region. I refer, of course, to the Australian monument at Villers-Bretonneux, which is just outside the town of Peronne. The great privilege I referred to was my attendance at the ANZAC service held at the Australian memorial at 10 a.m. on the 80th anniversary of the battle of Villers-Bretonneux; 10 a.m. being the precise time that the battle started 80 years ago. It was probably the most movservice I have ever been to on an ANZAC Day-and I have been to quite a lot during my political career. Afterwards, at the schoolhouse at Peronne itself we were entertained by the town folk and the mayor. Speeches were made by all concerned, including our leader. Military representatives from Australia attended also. I will never forget the sight in the schoolyard. Signs metres long had been hung out, and they read: 'Never forget the Australians and what they did for our country'. It made one feel very proud. The following evening we attended a service at the Menin Gate at Leper, another truly moving memorial service. The region of Villers-Bretonneux, Bullecourt, Brugge and the Mons Valley is of special significanee to me as both my grandfathers fought in the region in the 1914-1918 war. My late father-in-law, Colonel William Harris, was the youngest member of the Royal Horse Artillery to fight at Mons. My wife, Connie, was thrilled to wear her father's medals at the Villers-Bretonneux memorial service. Her father's medals included the Mons Star. She would like to thank everybody concerned for the service that she was given. I personally would like to thank everybody. I thank all the staff who accommodated us before we left to go to the European Institutions. I pay particular thanks to the embassies in France and Belgium for the excellent way that they conducted our itinerary. I am sure that any Australian group that goes to Europe in the future will receive the same service which was accorded us. I thank everybody concerned. I completely enjoyed myself. Australian Labor Party",97
332,Mr ROSS CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"My comments tonight begin with a cartoon by Moil' in a recent edition of the Sydney Morning Herald. In the cartoon we see the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) gathered together under the ALP policy tree. The Leader of the Opposition is poking a long stick at a book titled New Ideas. Mr Beazley asks his deputy leader, 'Will it bite?' Mr Evans responds, 'I can't remember. It's been so long.' That cartoon resonated with a lot of Australians because of their feeling that, despite the occasional rhetorical flourish, there is very little evidence whatsoever of a new idea emerging from the Australian Labor Party. The one conspicuous exception to that is presently seated at the dispatch box, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who has actually generated some new ideas for the Labor Party. We, as an open, responsive, listening government, have responded with the applause that those ideas merit. But, beyond the member for Werriwa, we find a black hole of negativity and reactionary response. There is no evidence whatever of the green branches, the green shoots, of new life, new ideas and new direction. Today in question time we saw the extraordinary revelation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) of the principal source documents for Labor's new foreign affairs strategy titled Securing Australia's Place in the World, ALP Platform, May 1998. Most Australians would have thought that when the opposition spokesman for foreign affairs released his policy on foreign affairs the source, the inspiration, for the document would be somewhere in the grey matter of his own mind. I find the member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Brereton) to be a perfectly companionable bloke. If you are at a diplomatic cocktail party somewhere and you get stuck in a corner, he is not a bad bloke to have a chat with. But what we are talking about tonight is his capacity for creativity, for original thought and for new directions and vision for Australia's engagement with the rest of the world. What we find is that the principal source for Labor's securing of Australia's place in the world are not the spokesman himself but one coalition document titled 'A Confident Australia', the coalition election manifesto for 1996, and a second original source document, the coalition's white paper on foreign policy and trade titled 'In the National Interest. If you actually go through and look at the remarks and the content, we are not talking about an echo, a faint reflection, an occasional borrowing of an idea; we are looking at a number of instances of a direct quote from the coalition documents. They are simply being incorporated and reproduced in a cut and paste exercise from the coalition to the Labor Party. For example, in the white paper you see our document, the original release by the minister, in what was a great innovation, the first white paper putting Australia's defence and foreign trade in fullMr Laurie Ferguson-This is the man who circulates Tony Blair's speeches.",98
333,Mr ROSS CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"That is exactly right, I do circulate Tony Blair speeches. Let me just quote from our white paper. It says: ... the changing relativities of power and influence which tlow from the economic rise of East Asia. From Labor's document we get: ... rapid economic change, especially in the Asia Pacific Region, is producing major shifts in regional and global power relativities. But going on in the same vein, see what we get. I think it is important that Hansard record the identical nature of these two statements. From 'A Confident Australia', the coalition policy document, you get: The forces of economic globalisation, and in particular the ongoing revolution in technology and communications have broken down long standing barriers between people, states and economies. From Labor's document: The forces of economic globalisation, and in particular the ongoing revolution in technology and communications are eroding long standing barriers between people, states and economies. I could go on. What you find is that the member for Kingsford-Smith has obviously sat around with a few mates and a couple of beers, and he has got three documents up on the screen. You can hear the scissors snipping away in the background, you can hear them cracking open the old can of glue, and here we go producing Labor's foreign policy statements. We are producing original new directions in foreign policy, we are demonstrating vision for Australia; we are a new breeze in foreign policy. (Time expired) Employment National",98
334,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"There have been many policies of this Howard coalition government that are leading to job insecurity for ordinary working Australians. Tonight I would like to mention a few examples of how job insecurity is hurting battling Australians. The announcement in the budget that a further 9,000 jobs are to be cut from the Public Service-this is on top of the 23,400 job losses in the first two budgets-is just one example. We are also seeing a growth in part-time and casual work in the general economy at the expense of full-time work, with· the erosion of award conditions and workers sitting by the phone waiting for a call to perform a few hours work. The growth in part-time and casual work was highlighted in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Paul Cleary on 26 May when he said: The number of casual full time workers with no job security has increased tenfold in the 1990s while the total casual workforce has more than doubled a new survey shows. While the government has begun promoting its policies with the mantra of security, stability and safety, a new Bureau of Statistics survey on work patterns underscores the depth of job insecurity. This survey shows that the number of people in New South Wales working in casual full time jobs rose from 14,000 in 1991 to 148,000 in 1997. The total casual and part-time work force swelled by 50 per cent to 685,000, but the casual work force alone expanded at a faster rate, at 60 per cent, to 454,000. While two-thirds of casual workers are women, the fastest growth has been in men moving into these jobs. This trend means that more Australian workers are working casual full time but without job security and certain award conditions. In the same newspaper article, reference is made to a study of two Reserve Bank economists, Mr Guy Debelle and Mr Troy Swan, who found: The number of men moving into part-time jobs has far outstripped the number of women. At the same time traditional full time work for men has been at a standstill. Between 1991 and 1998, male part-time employment grew at an average annual rate of 5.4% compared with 2.9% for women. As a result of these changes the number of men working fuUtime has fallen from 67% of total employment in 1960 to 50 per cent in 1997. The question I ask is: where is the government's answer to these problems or is the government happy to have an insecure, servile work force? Another area of job insecurity that has arisen as a direct result of the government's policy comes with the privatisation of the CES and the creation of Employment National. We now find that the free access to job network services is available only to eligible job seekers, those who are on some form of government assistance. Labour market economists estimate there are about 400,000 unemployed people not on benefits. If you are a housewife looking for work and your husband is working, you get no assistance from Employment National. If you are a long-term unemployed husband whose wife is working, you get no assistance or you are told, as one of my constituents was, to join the queue until they had dealt with the money-making clients. If you are a retrenched worker living on your accrued award entitlements, you will not get any assistance from Employment National. All of the foregoing is not helping our unemployed and is throwing additional costs onto business, like the Lane Cove restaurant owner who was told that if he wanted a fully screened prospective employee he would have to pay $800, a major change because for years this service was free to employers. A further attack on job security is that the government has gutted industrial awards. It has removed provisions such as the need for consultation prior to retrenchment and the provision that dismissal should not be harsh, unjust or unreasonable. These provisions have provided some form of job security for ordinary Australians. The government's action on the waterfront has lifted the issue of job insecurity to new dimensions. If the coalition government's tactics on the waterfront were successful, workers could be moved from one employer to another without even knowing and the employer could do as Patrick did and move employees to a shelf company without assets. Employees could be sacked for belonging to a trade union or for some other equally outrageous reason. Employees could be sacked, even though there were no productivity problems. (Time expired) One Nation Party",99
335,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to make some comments about the contemporary phenomenon of One Nation. Grief is a necessarily painful emotion which, to varying degrees, we have all experienced at some time in our lives. When anger at the loss also competes for expression, confusion reigns and it makes those who suffer from it susceptible to false prophets. Nations, like people, grieve-as Australia did after the inexplicable, yet preventable, tragedy of Port Arthur. We faced our moment of truth with grim determination, both to understand and to pursue a course of action that would serve the nation's interest. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has become a lightning rod for grief and anger, the expression of which has legitimacy. Many Australians grieve changes that few want and even fewer understand. Others are angry that the Australia they once knew has changed, and they are lunging for someone that they feel is an everyday person who seems to offer an expectation that reality cruelly will never meet. There is also within each of us a constant tension in what we want for ourselves, a self-interested resentment of people and things that we do not understand and an anger at people perhaps that we do not want. Every day in Australia we see further evidence of change, over which we appear to have little control. You have only to open a newspaper or tum on a radio or a television in any part of the country on any day of the week to read or hear about such things as BHP announcing the closure of its steelworks and collieries, Berlei closing to relocate in South-East Asia, APPM announcing the possible loss of 150 jobs and so on. The member for Oxley is popular for many reasons, but one of them is that if many Australians held a mirror to themselves they would say, 'She is like me: she looks like me, she thinks like me and she talks like me. She is saying things that I do not always agree with but with which I identify.' The challenge for those of us who profess to lead and who have undertaken the responsibility to do so is not to personally repudiate the member for Oxley and her supporters. Most of the supporters, as I see it, of the One Nation Party are basically decent people: they are people who went to war, they did not buy something until they had saved up for it and they thought their rights were less important than their responsibilities. Unfortunately, however, there are a small number of people who pursue the interests of One Nation who, frankly, are evil. What we need to do is to understand that the phenomenon of One Nation has evolved from a decade of us being patronised. We were told that we were racists if we questioned some of the policies of the previous government. Largely, we were ignored and our everyday concerns were trivialised and dismissed as being mundane. Those Australians who, understandably, are looking for an understanding as to why we send money to the poorest people in the world, why we contribute to the United Nations, why we do anything at all for indigenous people despite impropriety and waste, and why we have an immigration program at all and for whose benefit it ought to be run-those people who perhaps feel attracted to the false prophesy that is being offered by One Nation-need to reflect, amongst other things, on the consequences of political instability. New Zealand did an enormous amount to get its economy back on track; now it has political instability. is is essentially ungovernable and has been close to recession or in recession for nearly two years. In other parts of the world where there is not political stability, unfortunately, not only do you see economic turmoil but you also see turmoil in society as well. Grief can be a powerful force for change when it is harnessed to seemingly intractable problems. The important point that needs to be made, whether it is to us here or our colleagues in Queensland of whatever political party, is that when parliamentarians merely follow public opinion rather than recognising the need to lead it the whole nation is vulnerable. When we allow facts to bow to bias, and some of the nonsense paraded as facts by the member for Oxley and some of her supporters, then truth is vulnerable and evil in all of its guises finds an environment in which it may nourish, if not triumph. Political Parties Federation Fund",100
336,Mr ANDREN,ADJOURNMENT,"I have been contacted by many New South Wales schools in recent weeks as senior debating teams have been given the pleasant task of debating the topic 'That Independents are good for government'. I have greatly enjoyed assisting both the 'for' and 'against' arguments which, I might say, proved an intellectual challenge. I am certain those teams debating the affirmative side in particular will have many convincing arguments to back up their case. This parliament and other Australian parliaments have been corrupted by the two-party system. We have government dominated by executive and bureaucracy. The resignation of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) from the Liberal Party has again demonstrated how frustrated and largely impotent party backbenchers are. When the member tried to bring about changes to issues such as child support, he was frustrated and ignored. Many of us share the frustrations of the memher for Dickson's concerns over child support; it is an area in far greater need of reform than has so far occurred since the 1994 joint parliaTasman- mentary inquiry. The absolute dominance until recently of the Liberal-National-Labor Party club means that, whichever is in office, the political needs are attended to long before the real needs of individual electorates-and when they are rural they seem to matter even less. Rather than working as legislators, members of this House are most often doing nothing more than rubber stamping bills drawn up by bureaucrats. How many times have I had party members come up to me and ask, 'What are we voting on?' How many divisions are party political exercises-a whole lot of time wasting divisions, as the Leader of the House described it in this House last week? Why should an Independent show up for such party games? If an MP crosses the floor to vote against his or her party on an issue that is in the best interests of their electorate, as the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) did last year on the sugar tariff issue, it gets great coverage in the media. In a true democratic system it should occur all the time. The Australian system is corrupted to the point where the parties are now being funded by taxpayers. The ALP think-tanks received more than $13 million during the HawkeKeating years; the Howard government is now paying money to the Menzies Foundation and to the Labor Party equivalent, the Evatt Foundation. Because both parties benefit, neither side is prepared to oppose this hlatant and corrupt waste of public money. I called on the Australian Electoral Commission last week to fast-track their audit of the Liberal Party campaign donations, including the mysterious Greenfields Foundation's $4.6 million loan, about which the Australian public knows nothing. I have been condemned by many of my colleagues here for pushing for even basic reforms to the travel allowance system; reforms that still do not go far enough. There is a strong club mentality pervading federal parliament that overrides any political differences, ensuring no party politician dares question any of the allowances and benefits paid to politicians. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has rightly questioned why public servants and staff are not subject to equivalent scrutiny. The most significant reform to have occurred in the New South Wales parliament in recent times was the decision to introduce four-year set parliamentary terms. This was instigated by independents. Here we are on the federal election trail again after just two short years. Look at how expensive and disruptive this is. Imagine how much better it would be with fixed threeor even four-year terms coinciding with state polls on the same day so there is no room to play wasteful political favourites between like governments, state and federal. Reform such as this is too threatening for party politicians. Former New South Wales Independent John Hatton was also the driving force behind the Wood royal commission into the New South Wales police force. Major political parties were prepared to deny and ignore this corruption. Finally, I would like to say a few quick words about calls in Sydney for Federation Fund moneys to be used for the purchase and demolition of the toaster, that apartment building near the Opera House. According to some reports, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) has offered $30 million if the New South Wales government matches it. It is ironic that many of the politicians who had a hand in approving the development of this eyesore are now leading the charge for public money to have it pulled down. There are much more worthy projects the Federation Fund can be used for, job generating projects in country New South Wales like the Inland Marketing Corporation's Parkes export airport project for example, championed by the newly installed independent candidate for the seat of Parkes, Councillor Robert Wilson. Tourism: Cairns",101
337,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise here tonight somewhat as a salesman. I have a postcard that was prepared in my electorate from Cairns: 'We live here. We love it. Come up and say G' day'. This was an initiative that evolved out of a period of time recently when there was a lot of negative reporting in the press on a whole range of incidents in the region. It seemed that almost on a daily basis when you picked up the paper any of the good news stories were relegated to pages 6, 7 and 8, and it was also always a headline with some form of negativity. As a consequence, given the reliance on tourism in the region, it was certainly putting forward a very distorted view of what the region was all about. A group of local community people and business people decided to get together. They organised a meeting in February which attracted some 120-odd people. They also took the time to invite the local media, and they discussed ways in which they could overcome the perceived negative view that was being run by the media and which was certainly affecting the number of people that were likely to come into our area. There were certainly some serious concerns. The meeting stressed that the media had a responsibility to get the facts correct, to cut out' a lot of the drama that they put in and to start to print some good positive news items. There was certainly no shortage of them. As a result, severa] other meetings were held and we had the formulation of this postcard idea. At this stage I would like to pay a special tribute to Geoff Smith, the HIA regional manager, who was one of the three individuals who came up with the original concept. There was also Alan Black from Barbeques Galore and Rob Goodwin from the local REIQ branch. We have produced 148,000 of these postcards. A lot of people have contributed to this, and I would like to acknowledge them. They are Ansett Airlines; Billabong Car Rentals; Cairns Hilton; Cairns City Council, particularly Tom Pyne, who contributed significantly; Sunlover Cruises; REIQ; Barbeques Galore; Radio Rentals; and Tourism Tropical North Queensland. The idea of this is that they are sent out all over Australia. My colleagues here may recall that the other day I gave a postcard to both members of the House of Representatives and the Senate inviting them to come and say 'G' day' . Mr Latham-I would certainly love to come and say 'G' day', but I haven't got an invitation.",102
338,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,I will certainly pass one on before I leave. On the back of the postcard there is an opportunity to put your name and send it back. Mr Latham-The whole shadow ministry will come and say 'G'day' to every voter.,103
339,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,"We would love to have you up there. You may even win a free trip to stay at the Hilton and do some Sunlover Cruises. We have had an excellent response. At this stage over 4,000 replies have been posted back to Tourism Tropical North Queensland. At the moment they are receiving on average about 200 per day. I draw the attention of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to the fact that the competition closes on 30 June, so I will give him one before I leave the chamber. I encourage him to post it. It has been a great initiative, and it has worked very well. It has certainly put a whole different slant onto Cairns. We are looking at proceeding with a similar promotion as a second level of it. I commend all of those who were involved. We had a problem, and the community have pulled themselves up by the socks and found a solution which is working very well. I congratulate the Cairns community for their excellent effort in this. Ml' SPEAKER-It being almost 11.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted.

Main Committee adjourned at 9.44 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Federal Police (Question No. 2835) Mr MCClelland asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 31 March 1998: Has he received a submission from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) regarding the resources the AFP needs to carry out its statutory obligations; if so, (a) what resources did the Commissioner indicate were needed; (b) how has the Government responded to that submission; and (c) have the additional resources been provided. Mr WiHiams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Other than in the context of nonnal budget processes, I have received no such submission from the AFP. However, I am advised that, in accordance with nonnal practice relating to Government reviews, the AFP and other interested organisations and individuals have made written submissions to the Review of Resourcing Needs of the AFP, chaired by Mr Tony Ayers, AC. Mr Ayers has been requested to report to Government by 30 June 1998. Resource decisions relating to the AFP will be made by the Government following its consideration of the report from Mr Ayers. (Question No. 2836) Mr MCCleJland asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 31 March 1998: (1) Has the period that an aged care resident be away from a hostel without suffering a reduction in benefits been changed; if so, (a) what are the changes and (b) have the changes been made retrospective. (2) Will the changes referred to in part (1) prevent residents ill aged hostels from spending more time with their friends and or relatives. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA (1) (a) Under the Aged Care Act the Government has increased the amount of recorded leave that a care recipient can take from a residential aged care service from 28 days to 52 days per year which can be used for any purpose. The only situation wherc a reduction of benefits occurs is when an aged care resident has been on extended hospital leave for 30 days or more. Where this occurs the resident's classification level will be reduced by 2 levels. The amount of hospital leave is unlimited. (b) These changes have not been made retrospective. (2) The changes referred to in palt (l) will not prevent residents in hostels spending more time with relatives and friends. In addition to overnight leave, there is no restriction on the number of days a resident can be away from the hostel whcre no overnight absence is involved. Military and Education Funding (Question No. 2875) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 April 1998: Is he able to provide (a) data on changes in recent years to the ratio of military to education spending in each Western nation and (b) details for Aged Care comparison between Australia and other nations since 1996. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Recent reliable information on education spendcan ing by other Western nations is not readily available. Furthennore, there are difficulties making meaningful comparisons between nations, given the differences in defining education expenditure, the varying involvement of different levels of government and the varying part played by the private sector in education. As a proportion of Commonwealth Outlays, the ratio of Defence spending to Education spending by the Commonwealth in recent years is as follows: DefencelEducation (b) The following table shows an indicative trend Australia and a selection of other nations Country 1993-94 1994-95 Australia 2.3 Canada 1.7 China 1.4 France 2.7 Gennany 1.5 India 2.7 Indonesia 1.3 Malaysia 3.0 New Zealand 1.2 Singapore 4.6 South Korea 3.7 Sweden 2.7 Thailand 2.5 UK 3.6 US 4.3 92-93 93-94 94-95 95-96 96-97 97-98 1.07 1.00 .96 .94 .91 .96 of Defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP for 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 (est) 1998-99 (est) 2.1 2.1 2.0 1.9 1.9 1.6 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.3 1.1 1.0 1.1 1.1 2.7 2.6 2.5 n.a. n.a. 1.4 1.4 1.4 n.a. n.a. 2.7 2.6 2.0 2.4 2.4 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.4 0.9 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.3 1.6 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.0 4.3 4.7 4.3 4.5 4.9 3.4 3.2 3.3 3.2 3.0 2.7 2.5 n.a. n.a. n.a. 2.4 2.2 2.2 2.5 1.6 3.4 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 3.8 3.7 3.5 3.3 3.1",151
