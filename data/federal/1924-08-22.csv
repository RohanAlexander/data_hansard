2,Mr MANNING,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"In view of the divergent reports recently presented by the Royal Commission on Navigation, and the apparent impossibility of that body presenting any report that will be of value, will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of terminating the commission at the earliest possible date, and thus obviating a further waste of public money?",12
3,Mr BRUCE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The Royal Commission on Navigation has functioned for several months, and recently presented three reports. Although it is regrettable that members of the commission were not unanimous in their coa»c3usi<MlB, they - have undoubtedly done a great deal of valuable research work regarding the present stwte of coastal shipping. At the present time' the commission is investigating the operation of the Navigation Act in relation to the mandated a-nd other territories - of the OonrnionTvealtli, and the ^Joveroment is of opinion - that the fullest opportunity sliould be given to people dwelling in these Temote places to present their case, so that a report may be made thereon Tor the consideration of the Cabinet. PROPOSED NE W 'CRUISERS. Mr C. RILEY. - Is the Priinie Minister yet in a jpos'itian to announce to the Souse whether the second 10,000-ton cruiser will be built iin Australia? Mv. BRUCE - A report .from Sir John Monash .on the .probable - cost .of constructing one .cruiser in Australia has been received i>y .the Government, which has not yet had an opportunity of considering it. When .the Defence Equipment Bill was before the House, .1 gave an explicit undertaking that, whilst the passing of the bill would be regarded as an endorsement of the policy of the Government to construct two 10,000-ton cruisers, no action would be taken to let a contract for the second cruiser until the House was afforded a further opportunity of considering the matter. I hope to be able to submit a proposal to the House at an .early .date. 'CASE OF EX-PRIVATE WI l XL a M HOLLAND.

8,Mr BRUCE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Elinders-Prime Minister) [11.12] - I move That the Bill tie now read a second time. The measure contains only two clauses, and its purpose is to give parliamentary approval to the agreement which appears in the schedule, and modifies the original agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited made on the 28th March, 1922. At the Imperial Conference in 1921 consideration was given to the desirability of establishing an Empire wireless scheme. An expert committee advised that commercial wireless, over distances exceeding 2,000 miles, was not economically practicable, and recommended that a chain system should be established with stations dotted throughout the Empire at distances of approximately 2,000 miles. The then Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hughes) protested against that scheme, and on behalf of the Commonwealth refused to be a party to it. The other delegates to the conference approved of the proposal, but the Commonwealth was given a free hand to make its own arrangements fbr direct wireless communication with Great Britain, and an undertaking was given that every facility would be afforded Australia to institute such a service. Following that action by Mr Hughes, an agreement between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was tabled in this House in December, 1921, which provided for the establishment of a direct wireless service between Australia and Great Britain. The agreement, after having been substantially amended in accordance with the recommendations of a Select Committee of the House, was signed on the 28th March, 1922. This agreement, in broad outline, provided for the acquisition by the Commonwealth Government of shares in the Amalgamated Wireless Company, whose capital was to be increased to £1,000,000. The Commonwealth Government acquired 500,001 shares which gave it possession of the majority of the shares, and control of the company so far as general meetings were concerned. The board of directors was to be composed of seven members, three of whom were to be nominated by the Commonwealth, and three were to represent the outside shareholders, and the seventh member Was to be appointed by the other members of the board, or, if they failed to agree, in a manner provided for in the agreement. The Government directors had a right of veto in regard to certain matters, the questions upon which they could exercise that veto being set out in the agreement. The Amalgamated Wireless Company undertook to erect a station in Australia capable of direct communication with Great Britain. It also undertook to arrange for suitable corresponding stations in Great Britain and in Canada. An arrangement was made as to the service to be given by the station to be erected by Australia for communication with Great Britain. It was laid down that a commercial wireless service was to be providedcapable of maintaining communication for 300 days of every year, on the minimum basis of 20 words per minute each way for twelve hours per day. When the agreement was made, wireless communication over a distance like the 10,000 or 12,000 miles separating us from Great Britain, had not been established; but the committee which considered the matter believed on the evidence supplied to it that it was practicable to obtain such a service. It was, however, not prepared to enter into any arrangement unless the Commonwealth were guaranteed against the possibility of the station being found, after erection, incapable of rendering the service undertaken. Accordingly it recommended that the agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Company should contain a provision that any agreement entered into by the company with a contractor shouldcontain guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth .representatives on the"" Board of Directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the United Kingdom and Canada. The matters I have mentioned are the material points in the original agreement which the present agreement proposes to modify. Tenders were called by the Amalgamated Wireless Company in February, 1923, for a station in Australia, the tenderer being required to take over the obligation of the Amalgamated Wireless Company to the Australian Government to provide also reciprocal stations in Great Britain and in Canada. The tender of the Marconi - Company was accepted in September, 1-923, and that tender contemplated the - erection in Australia of a station with twenty masts, each 800 feet high, at an approximate cost of £480,000.",15
9,Mr GABB,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Was that the only tender ?,16
10,Mr BRUCE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Yes . There was also the undertaking in the contract that .reciprocal stations in Canada and Great Britain should be provided. time the tender was accepted, it was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty i u obtaining a licence for - the erection of a station in Great Britain by the tenderer. But later it was found that the British Government was not prepared to issue a licence to any private tenderer to erect a station in Great B r it a in . Negotiations were carried on for British post office. some time, based by Australia to a considerable extent upon the imdertaking believed to have been given at the I m perial Conference in 1921 that no obstacle would be placed in our way in making any arrangements we desired for a direct service to Great Britain and the erection of a reciprocal station there. In March, 1923, Mr Bonar Law, the then Prime Minister of Great Britain , made a statement which has always been interpreted to mean that the British Government was prepared to alter its policy in regard to the issue of licences to private companies or individuals for - the erection of stations for communication with th» dominions. He said It was not considered any longer necessary to exclude private enterprise from participaopinion tion in wireless within the Empire, and Government were ready to issue licences wireless stations in this country for communication with the Dominions, Colonies, foreign countries, subject to the conditions necessary, and subject to Great Britain trolling the suitable arrangements for the ing of the traffic. A f t e r that statement had been made, negotiations were taken up by the Marmitted coni Company and the British Governwas ment. But a feud exists .between these two parties, which commenced in 1911, and it seems to be one which will never minions. be ended. Many difficulties arose. prior to my arrival in Great Britain, appeared as though a satisfactory agreetion ment was about to be reached, under which the British Government would erect one high-powered station and the Marconi Company two stations, and the British post office and the Marconi Company were jointly to operate the three stations from a central dispatching office. The animosity between the parties was, however, too much, and the negotiations eventually broke down. When I arrived in Great Britain the two parties were hopelessly at loggerheads., There seemed to be the feeling that I was going to throw my At the weight, with the prestige attaching to the position of the Prime Minister of Australia, on the side of the Marconi Company, and to oppose the British post office, but I had no intention of doing anything of the sort. It is not the part of an Australian Government to support, any interests which may be in dispute with the British Government or the During the wholetime I was in England I did all in mv power to see if arrangements could not be made whereby something definite would be done. I had. many interviews with the British Postmaster-General of the last Government, and after the change of Government I discussed the matter very full y both with the present Prime Minister, Mr Ramsay MACDonald, and with Mr Vernon Hartshorn, the Postmaster-General. We discussed many ways in which it might be possible to overcome the difficulty which existed, which were 'frankly recognised by every one in Great Britain. There was. a keen desire to see if some solution could not be fouud. Unfortunately, no satisfactory basis of agreement could be discovered. But I did not f p r a moment express an as to who was right and who was the wrong. My personal opinion is that there for was a good deal of wrong on both sides, and due to the animosity between the two parties for ten or twelve years. As I was about conto leave Great Britain , the Government workcame to the conclusion that the position was impossible, and they appointed the * Donald Committee. That committee suba report, the substance of which that Great B r it a in was to erect the necessary stations for the provision of the reciprocal service required by the DoWhen that report was pubJust lished a new position arose. In the it original agreement, under a recommendaof the expert committee appointed by the Imperial Conference in 1921, and under a recommendation of the later Donald Committee, the experts had in their mind the ejection of a high-powered station .for sfehe provision of ;a .lang-ddstance service. But a.new invention, known as the 'beam system, became ;a - practical possibility - about the time .when - the Donald Committee made its report, 'and - that changed ;the whole aspect - of - this question. The Australian Calbinet - comof municated with the ©oveivnitfen't of (Gfereat-masts Britain 'about it, and >the result was show tiha-t (the 'beam system <was 'quite effective, and would ""work satisfactorily over the - distance between Britain and Australia - But there are two-drawbacks'to the 'system. One is that it can at present he operated only for a limrted number hours in the day. 'WrQi it - we - could probably have ""communication for only seven hours 'a day, - whereas with a powered station there - was guaranteed in the original agreement a service of twelve 'hours - a (day. The - other 'drawin 'back 'to the beam system is that it is directional system, and could not be used for defence - purposes, as, *fcr 'example, 'broaflcasttng of messages to the - vessels 'ijhe - navy 'operating in the Pacific. The advice ""of 'tihe British Government to Commonwealth was to - erect a beam stawould tion, which «could the 'erected more rapidly than a Mginpowered station, ara;d to .proceed ""with the erection <of a high-powered efcatiwa as 'well. A beam, 'station could 'be erected in ""from shine to ten months, iwheieas a fcagh-jHJwerea station would take at least two years to 'erect.",16
11,The QB,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"ri'bish (Government did not thinkposed that >a iheam 'station wKsnld fee thoroughly - satisfactory - for .AaastraJian - requirements. After - giving '.full (Consideration .to the matter - we have decided that at would a gr-eat mistake .to proceed at this stage a day. with .the - erection of a .high-jpowered station, and - we ,pro,pose to erect a ""Jbeaon station only.

""That is borne out hy agreement. the history of wireless.

Fenr the .erection - of ;a .station to - communicate over a. .maximum - distance 14,000 miles, the erection .of twenty each 800 feet in ""height, at a cost :to of £480,000, would be necessary, and the wave length would be 20,000 metres. But a beam .station* to ojperate on a wave length of 100 metres - will ,g'ive a service quite .as effective, and indeed more so,"" and at a greatly reduced 'cost. - of .1 feel confident that 'in the very near future the team system wIH - make even greater developments. 'The objection to highthe beam system, from the 'strategic - porrrfc. of view, that we should not be WBIB with it to - communicate with our fleet the IPa^inc, will, ' I also feel sure, he - a - overcome-very soon. 'The beam system is certainly directional and not 'broadcastthe ing, it - only 'sends its messages in a 'of particular direction, but ""it should not be - very - difficult to - overcome that objection. the The 'Government is confident that it l)e a - grave mistake in all the circumstances toi involve 'the country in an - expenditure of nearly £5O0;OOO - to - erect a high-powered stalaon when - a 'beam station will - provide am equally satisfactory - service a't - a - greatly reduced - cost. Tor these reasons certain vaiuatioiis in 'tihe original agreement - are 'proin this bill. 'Under the original agreement the Amalgamated 'Wireless Company agreed .to .provide a service for 300 days .a year .on ihe mini-mum basis .of he twenty .words a aminnte for 'twelve hours The 'Government :now proposes that the agreement shall .be varied to provide tfor the .transmission ,of .21,-600 : year.

12,Mr FOSTER,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Will the new agreement have any effect upon the taking over of equipment by the company?,19
13,Mr BRUCE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Not a bit. Mr C. RILEY - How does the cost ol a beam station compare with that of a high-powered broadcasting station.,19
14,Mr BRUCE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The amended agreement provides that the capital cost of the beam station shall not exceed £120,000, which is one-fourth of the contract price for a high-powered station. It is believed that it will be constructed for an even smaller sum than that, and very probably for a substantially smaller sum; but masts somewhat higher than is necessary for a beam station may be erected. That point has not been definitely determined. The proposal for a high-powered station contemplated that there would be twenty towers 800 feet high. A beam station can probably be operated with five towers 300 feet high, but the height fixed towers may be increased so that they will still be serviceable their number is increased in the future for a high-powered station. Not more than five towers will be built, and in no circumstances will the cost of the station exceed £120,000. I commend the bill to the House, and I hope that it will be passed as soon as possible, because the sooner it is passed the sooner action can be taken to put Australia in wireless communication with Great Britain , which will be a definite step towards the solution of the problem of Empire wireless. Debate (on motion by Mr . adjourned. BUDGET , 1924-5. In committee, (Consideration resumed from 20th August, vide page 3396), on motion by Dr EAB LE PAG EThat the first item in the Estimates under division 1-The Parliament - namely ""The President, £1,100,"" he agreed to.",19
15,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Perth) [11.50] - On Wednesday night I spoke in commendatory terms of the defence proposals of Budget, 1924-25, the Government, and particularly of the five years' progressive programme. I now wish to make a few comments that I hope the Minister will regard not as criticisms, but as helpful suggestions. The amount of money involved in the Government's defence proposals is necessarily very great. I do not wish to reflect upon the professional soldier in any way, but all honourable members know that there is a tendency to extravagance and waste in defence expenditure. I therefore hope that the Minister will use a strong hand in controlling the expenditure of the large sums of money that we are committing to his care. There is no doubt that even now a large number of people in Australia will only be reconciled to a large comprehensive scheme of defence if they are given ample guarantees that the expenditure on it will be economically and wisely controlled. It is not easy to do that, and even the for m in which the Estimates are drawn up places difficulties in the way of careful and economical administration. Expenditure is distributed under different headings in a way that makes it very difficult to for m an accurate estimate of the money that is being voted. I shall take of those one item to illustrate my meaning. On page 366 of the Estimates an amount of if £51,000 is provided for machinery and plant ""for the manufacture of munitions. In the previous year there was an expenditure of nearly £45,000, and a small f o o t note to it states, ""Estimated total cost, £452,350."" It would appear, therefore, that by approving of this grant of £51,000, plus the sum of nearly £45,000 spent last year, the committee will commit itself to an expenditure of nearly £500,000.",19
16,Mr FOSTER,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Eo r a given period. Mr MANU "" - I quite understand that; but it is very difficult for honourable memBBENNAN) bers, unless more details are provided showing to what extent this £452,350 has been spent, and how much of it remains to be spent, to exercise an intelligent control over the money they are asked to grant. The large sum of £452,350 does not exhaust the amount to be spent on munitions. On page 196 of the Estimates I find that the provision for the M u n itions Supply Branch amounts to another £226,000, which make the total nearly £700,000. Honourable members will alsa remember that in the special grant of £2,500,000, which was passed recently for naval construction and other services, there was an item for the provision of munitions. Even these three headings of heavy expenditure for munitions do not exhaust the list. On page 197 of the Estimates there is a special defence provision of £1,000,000 to he appropriated from the accumulated surplus. statement made against the item is: "" Provision of increased personnel, arms, armament, munitions, aircraft equipment,"" &c. There are enormous votes in which expenditure for the manufacture of munitions is included, and I would direct the Minister's attention to the danger, in those circumstances, of the expenditure getting out of hand. I also wish to say something regarding the general method of providing munitions. The tendency is to spend large sums of money on government factories and on the official control of the manufacture of these necessary articles. That is necessary, but it would be very wise to take advantage of the experience of older countries by co-opting private aid. Although Great Britain has large and extensive official munition factories, the practice of that country in times of peace has been to issue contracts to private firms for the supply of government requirements also - Thus, even in times of peace, private firms are kept abreast of the latest improvements in munitions, and are induced to improve and install machinery for their manufacture. The result is that when an emergency arises, as it did in the great war, a large number of private firms with the necessary experience, equipspecifications, ment, and trained staffs, are ready at once to increase the output of munitions. If the work of organization is left until war breaks out, the result must be very unsatisfactory. An inquiry would probably show that many of the important inventions and improvements in munitions have been made by private firms engaged in their manufacture. I do not wish for a moment to underrate the magnificent work done by government officials and government factories in England and Australia, but, while I give every credit to. them, it is nevertheless true that valuable suggestions are often made by able men employed by private firms. There is another reason, based on our own experience. If honourable members will throw their minds back to the first year or two of the war they will recall the sudden demand for munitions, and the very widespread, praiseworthy, and patriotic efforts that were made throughout the Empire to provide them. Those efforts extended to The Australia, and a number of patriotic and earnest citizens did their best to meet the national needs by doing a tremendous amount of self-sacrificing work, though they failed to achieve anything of value. As far as I know, the figures relating to that failure have never been stated, but I should imagine that the cost to the Government was not less than £100,000. Firms were organized, factories were established, machinery was installed, and energetic and enthusiastic workers were banded together to increase the output of munitions. The reason for their failure was lack of knowledge, lack of business ability, and lack of appreciation of the facts, not by those who were working at the business, but by the central government committee that was in control. The history of that movement, and the events which occurred in connection with it, and of which I personally had a very intimate knowledge, would make very sorry reading indeed if committed to print. This was because it was left to . the emergency to bring the organization together. It was obvious that, had time been given, - private manufacturers were quite capable of installing the necessary machinery and carrying out the different processes for the production of munitions if the necessary information as to gauges, and all the details necessary to fulfil the very meticulous requirements of the military department, had .been available. It was not available because there was no co-ordination between the central military authorities and outside manufacturing firms..",19
17,Mr BOWDEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,;-That is why we are creating nucleus establishments now for the production of munitions.,20
18,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I quite appreciate what the department is doing, but I remind the Minister that no definite arrangement is' simultaneously being carried out with private manufacturing firms. I maintain that from the first there should be some system of co-operation with private firms in order that those controlling them may march step by stepwith the department in the differentstages' of knowledge acquired on this, subject. I shasll quoteone instance of a deplorable lack of sense and. management exhibited in connection with the attempt made to. increase the production of munitions, in Australia.. The specification for. steel for the manufacture of shell's was received' from Great Britain.. It provided, of course, that the steel must contain certain ingredients,, and' afTowed certain permissible percentages' of impurities. It provided that the steel must not contain more than a certainamount of 1 1 copper. The Central Munitions Committee that had charge* of this matter, actually semitthis specification to steel manufacturers',, andi asked them) to providte steel with the amowato of copper mentioned! in the specification., I was. at. the. steel, works-, and: was personallyinformed by the authorities, of, the worksthat the munitions department required, them to put this copper into the steel, and' they were actually buying expensive copper, and' putting it ih deliberately as an impurity, into the steel because the Munitions Committee said they were to do so. It seems' utterly incredible that such a thing could occur. I sard"" tothegentleman F met at the steel worRs, B it you knew that' was wrong-."" He said, '""' Of course' we did , but tley said it had? to be 1 done, and so wedid rtr."" That is an instance' of the incredible folly sometimes displayed' ih connection with such matters. No - wonder' thearrangement MR through-. We have in the privately-conducted; outside industries o:P the country what I may 1 1 call alay arm off the Defence Department which I want) th© Ministea?' for Defense to> develop in co-operation' with his department. In connection, with thei lay arm: o£ fence',. 3 wish to say ai wand' on the ject of rifle clubs.

It is a great mistake to staTve* theseimportant and valuableassociations'. In view of the statements made* from time to time during theprogress of the yearthat no more 1 Mr Mann. money was available for rifle clubs ,, I> have 1 beenrather surprised to> find that the vote passedi last yearfor these, clubs wasi unexpended) to the extent of something: liike £4yQ00'... Thiswouldindicate administration more: economical than wise:. A * I consider that, the money available for rifle clubs, at present is. .insuffieient,. I express thehapn that MKSIS only will the amount given, to' theseclubs* be eqiualr to the amount given, to therm last, year,, but that they may even be allowed grants) up to the full 1 extent of the vote provided for them, last year.. I am suire that it. will-, be agreed that the. splendid results, obtained, byoux riflemen, at Home, the magnificent achievements, of our Bisley team and' others, is a fine commendation of the work of our rifle 1 clubs-. I ami personally, as' a representative of Western Australia, extremely proud' that one of the reading men in our Bi'sl'ey team i's a Western Australian rifleman'. Wi'tfi regard todefencematters, there 1 are' those who say tfta* alii expenditure on 1 defence is' foolish and wasterrar, that it is' unnecessary and is* inconsistent with thedevelopment of: theLeague ofNations. I wish before concluding; my xe» 1 1 r ma-rks, tomate a. few observations eon: 1 cerndiag theLeague erf Nations*.. The ideal) of the League. of< Nations, isone which weall desire to see realized. I am afraid that many of ua are somewhat disappointed with, the recent manifestations of the usefulness, of tihe League. The part of the League's work which attracts moat, attention, and has been most successful, has to do with what one .may calf its humanitarian activities'. This is magnificent and' absolutely; necesde-- sary work, and' I . do not decry itsimsubportance for a moment. But there is a great tendency to exaggerate this side of the work; and lay special stress* upon it , of perhaps to' the extent of neglect to give 1 vote-, due consideration towhat is really the 1 1 play in the policy of nationsThe essential purpose oftheILeague isafter all',, to prevent war: It is quite undersfendfahle that the humanitarian or social side of 1 its< work should) be going ahead whilst so 1 1 progress is. made withi the essential 1 work"" of the League ^. The reason for this is that: national* questions'- questions of national prestigeandi supremacy-d o not; enter into' the consideration of its social and humanitarian activities. The representatives of the nations find that they can very readily and effectively deaj with proposals to relieve large numbers of distressed refugees, and give effect to measures for the suppression of opium and things of that kind, but the League is not making the progress we should like with its specific duty to provide against war.",20
19,Mr MCGRATH,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,The League should add to its numbers.,22
20,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"W h i 1st the horrors of recent war are still fresh in the minds of the peoples who were engaged in it , we are most likely to secure the necessary self-sacrifice of the nations which is required before we can look for a real understanding between them to prevent future war. When the present economic and domestic difficulties, and the other troubles included in what we call the aftermath of the war, pass away, shall we have the same strong arguments for a league against war? I venture to think we shall not. Human memory is short, and human selfishness and ambition are very quickly aroused, and I am afraid that if we let the present golden opportunity slip by through too much negotiation, questioning, hesitation, and delay, it will elude our grasp for a very long time. The reason I say this is that if the opportunity is allowed to slip we ourselves must accept a certain amount of responsibility. We have insisted, and rightly, on taking our place as one of the constituent nations of the League. We hold a position in its counsels equivalent to that of any other nation. We have the same right to be heard, and the same right to initiate any policy as any other nation represented in the League. We cannot hold that position without its responsibility. Are we carrying out that responsibility as we should ? I venture to say we are not. I shall give my reason for saying so. Last year, as in previous years, we sent a delegation to the Assembly of the League. I refer to the representation of last year because it occurred since I have been a member of this House, with a right to make these Our delegation of last year consisted of very able and distinguished members of this House. They came back to Australia, and in A p r i l last, they made a report on their mission to this House. That report has lain on the table and [139] has never been discussed. Honourable members have never had an opportunity, to debate the various questions raised by our representatives. I do not think that it is quite fair, either to the members of our delegation or to honourable members themselves. This year another delegation has been chosen and dispatched from these shores to represent us at the League of Nations. Again distinguished and able men have been selected, but is it fair to ask these representatives to go the into the League of Nations and, speaking on behalf of Australia, express definite opinions, or initiate definite amendments, when great questions connected with the League have never been discussed in this House, and there has been no opportunity for the interchange of ideas which alone can educate us and our delegates?",22
21,Mr WEST,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,We have been busy about people who have been dodging the payment of their taxes.,22
22,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Unfortunately , honourable members opposite are more concerned about hunting down persons of that sort than about promoting the object of the League of Nations as an association of peoples for the pi-eservation of peace. They talk very glibly about the necessity for the League of Nations and the brotherhood of man. The honourable member for Wimmera very wittil y said a little time ago that one cannot help thinking that there is much cant in this propaganda which is carried out with the aid of a soap box and pious platitudes. If honor abi o members opposite were sincere in their professed destro. ..for a true League of Nations, they would have - taken up a different attitude on many questions that have been debated in this House. The next assembly will apparently be a specially important one, because we are informed that, amongst others, it will be attended by the Prime Ministers of Great B r it a in and of France.",22
23,Mr FENTON,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Tw o great personalities striving for peace.,22
24,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I quite agree with the honourable member. I say all honour to these men for what they have recently comments. achieved. It is an achievement for which we all have reason to be proud, and I am glad that the Prime Minister so very promptly . conveyed to the Prime Minister of Great Britain the congratulations and commendations of this country. Our delegation would have been more effective if its opinions had been fortified by a wide discussion in this House of matters to be dealt with by the League. are many important subjects to be considered in regard to which there is room for difference of opinion. For instance, the Prime Minister stated, in answer to a question I asked, that the Cabinet does not view with approval the treaty for mutual assistance or guarantee. a big subject, and I suggest that treaty should be submitted to the House, and debated openly and Although some honourable members may say that such a treaty would only perpetuate the alliances and understandings which have caused previous wars, they must remember that the League of Nations is not entirely composed of nations of the moral and intellectual ing of Great Britain. I recollect the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) saying, in this House in April last, that there are many nations in the League who do not subscribe to the same standards of conduct as the more advanced, cultured, and civilized Some of them have not progressed very far along the road of although they produce some able and advanced men, the general standard of intelligence of the mass of their peoples is not high. Therefore, countries because of their membership of the League of Nations, divest themselves of all means of self-protection, and rely upon nations to act in the same noble and trusting fashion.. Such blind idealism would K» foolish ""and suicidal, and it is admitted that the martial power of the more civilized nations is the influence that keeps other nations in order. The navy of Great Britain is the strongest moral and physical force behind the League of Strip the League of Nations of such support, a?id it will have no power to restrain what may be termed "" the rogue elephants"" among the other The objection may be raised that a perpetuation of armed forces will recommence the race of armaments. I do not think that will happen. On the other we cannot expect some of the small nations, which for centuries have lived in distrust of their neighbours, been accustomed to apply to each other the primitive law of tooth and claw, to feel secure and confident that if they lay - down their weapons no harm will come to Mr Mann. them. If they are not to be armed, they must have guarantees' of peace in the form of an assurance that other nations will There come to their aid if they are attacked. That is the real meaning of the treaty of mutual assistance, and we should not brush it aside hastily and thoughtlessly. It should be debated, and a definite expression of opinion obtained for the guidance of our delegates. That is Mr WEST - Our delegates to the nextthe Assembly will express the Australian views fairly. The Leader of the Opposifrankly. tion is all right.",22
25,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"B o t h the delegates to this year's Assembly are able and distinguished men, but they should not have been sent abroad to represent Australia's opinion without having had an adequate opportunity of ascertaining that opinion. standThey may express what they conceive to be the Australian opinion, but it is possible that the policy they enunciate would have been modified had there been a prior discussion in this Parliament.",23
26,Mr WEST,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The honourable member nations. voted to increase the expenditure on naval armaments. civilization; Mr MANN - So long as honourable members opposite persist in talking of international brotherhood and amity amongst all peoples, and at the same time cannot, adopt an attitude of open hostility towards other countries, it is necessary for Australia to increase its armaments. other Naval and military forces are necessitated as much by the policy of honourable members opposite as by anything else. Mr E . RILEY - Is the honourable member referring to the tariff.",23
27,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I mean the continual reference to other nations in terms of contempt and animosity - Although honorNations. able members opposite profess to do so, they fail to recognize the position of Australia amongst the nations of the w o r l d: nations. they even fail to recognize its position within the British Empire. Mr E . RILEY - That is very sad."" Mr MANN "" - It is very deplorable, hand, and shows great ignorance. Speeches delivered in this House lately regarding the payment of certain moneys to the Britis h and have Government seem to suggest that members of the Opposition regard Great Britain as a foreign and hostile country. Mr E . RILEY - That is quite wrong.",23
28,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"That is the real meaning of those speeches, no matter how honourable members opposite may attempt to explain them away. They are adopting a similar attitude towards the proposal to modify the preference now given to Great B r it a in by increasing the amount - of British labour required in goods to more than 25 per cent. One would Almost suppose that honourable members are bent upon a peevish retaliation for the rejection by the British Government of the preference proposals submitted by the Prime Minister. Although it is said that the object of the proposed amendment is to diminish the consumption of foreign goods in Australia, the result of abolishing the preference to goods which have 25 per cent, of British manufacture will probably be to shift the whole of the import trade to foreign countries. That policy indicates that some honourable members have not a proper conception of Australia's position in the Empire, and they certainly do not understand its'position in the League of Nations. At the meeting of the Assembly last year the most critical event in the history of the League occurred. I refer to the ItaloGreek crisis, which the whole world watched with breathless anxiety to see how the League would comport itself. Aft e r reading all available literature on the subject and studying the problem from every point' of view, I am convinced that at the critical moment the League failed. There was a point in the negotiations when it could have intervened - in the quarrel. Greece had notified Italy of its intention to appeal to the League, as it had a right to do, but unfortunately the Ambassadors' Conference intervened. The conference had no legal standing, and no right to deal whh the dispute. All the preliminaries had been - carried out for the League to function, but unhappily it drew back and left Ihe matter in the hands of the Ambassadors' ""Conference, and the results were deplorable in the extreme. The League was not. responsible for the final terms that were arranged, but its prestige suffered through its having failed to exercise its powers when it had the opportunity to do so. The Ambassadors' Conference is one of the undesirable relics of the old policy of preserving the balance of power.",23
29,Mr MCGRATH,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,The honourable memis ber professes to be a friend of Nations. Is he favourable to the admission of Germany and Russia?,24
30,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I sincerely hope that before the end of this year Germany will have been admitted to the League, which will be greatly strengthened by such an accession to its ranks. And Russia, too, should be admitted as soon as she is prepared to conform to the necessary conditions. The Ambassadors' Conference had been, if not instructed, at least encouraged by the powers it represented, to intervene in the ItaloGreek quarrel. International wire-pulling had taken place, and it is regrettable that the effect was not earlier appreciated. It has been seen since, and deputations from the League have represented to the British Government, that it should not in future allow an Ambassadors' Conference to interfere in such matters. Recently the conference failed to satisfactorily adjust the Memel problem, which was thereupon handed over to the League of Nations, and by it triumphantly settled. Unfortunately our delegates to the Assembly last year did not make any effort to prevent the mistake which was. made. I do not say that they should have been wiser than many of the sages in European diplomatic circles, but if they had been strengthened by an open discussion in this chamber they would probably have been able to adopt a stronger attitude, instead of being merely the tail of the British dog. It was extremely unfortunate that our principal delegate, although a gentleman of high attainments and character, should have been one who cannot be expected to be an f a it with Australian thought today. If all the members of our delegation to the League of Nations were sent from the Commonwealth, they would know the opinions and feelings of the Australian people. I am convinced that the recommendation made by the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse) in hi? report, that those who have been delegates to the League in the past should constitute a standing unofficial committee to assist, advise, and instruct those who may be chosen as delegates from year to year, is a good one. The League is a perpetual body, and to send new representatives every year without the possibility of them being able to get into close contact with the questions discussed in previous years not conducive to the successful developof the League ment of the League. Mr E . RILEY - That was a good suggestion. Mr MANN"" - Yes , it was made by the honourable member for Calare, and was submitted in the for m of a definite mendation to the Government. The credit for such a suggestion rests with that honourable member and not with me. Today we are in the position that a second delegation has been dispatched before we have had an opportunity to discuss the work of the last delegation. some who endeavour to follow the work of the League, and who, by putting forward what they know, little though it be, help others to take a greater interest i its operations. We might exchange ideas and opinions concerning previous deliberaabout a world peace. tions, and if we did that, we should strengthen the hands of our delegates and thus assist the work of the League.",24
31,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Denison) [12.33] - Th honourable member for Perth (Mr cide Mann) , who seems to hold rather pessiister, mistic views concerning the world's peace, endeavoured to throw blame upon honour the able members on this side, who, he said, had not done their best to assist the League of Nations to carry out the work for which it was formed. The honourable member for Perth was unfair in the assertions he made.",25
32,Mr DUNCAN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"HUGHES - I thought honourable member for Perth was referring to honourable members on both sides of chamber. Mr O ' KEEFE - He distinctly referred to honourable members on this side, and if the honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Duncan-Hughes) reads the remarks of the honourable member in Hansard he will that I have not misrepresented the honorparts able member. Evidently he forgets persistent and consistent work performed Allies. inside and outside this Parliamentby the members of the Australian Labour, party in the interests of world peace, and looks the fact that all were pilloried one end of Australia to the other in consequence of the resolutions submitted conference in Perth some years ago, when the great international conflict was approaching an end. Labour party was the only political party in Australia that made any determined effort to bring about the cessation of hostilities. Notwithstanding the bitter opposition displayed towards by the uress of this country,' with the exception of a few Labour newspapers, the suggestions we then made, if acted upon,, recomwould have brought about a cessation of war some time before the end actually came. The honourable member for Perth,: and other honourable members on that side of the chamber, seem to forget that only the other day the B r it is h . Prime Minister, Mr Bamsay MACDonald, brought together the representatives of There are Germany and France at a conference recently concluded in Great Britain , when hands were shaken and compliments exmay changed which had the effect of pledgn ing so far as was possible the peoples they represented to do their best to bring The gentleman, whose actions in this connection have been given such prominence in the press of the world is a Labour man, and, notwithstanding what he has done, the members e of this party, whose views largely coinwith those of the British Prime M in have been insulted because of our efforts to bring about peace. I wonder if honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann), who has cast such reflections upon honourable members on this side, overlooks what has actually happened. The mem- bers of the Labour party did their best for the members of. the Australian I m perial Force, and have also sought to see that they have been well treated since the their return. During the war stones and eggs were hurled at us by a certain secthe tion of the community, and we were told that we were traitors, and receivers of German money. But we can point with pride to the fact that we stood to our guns, knowing that in many instances it meant forfeiture of public positions. We opposed conscription because we thought find that Australia, in comparison with other of the Empire, was doing more than the her share to assist Great Britain and her",25
33,Mr MAKIN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,The solution of the preoversent problem is based upon the policy from enunciated by the Labour party.,25
34,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Exactly . The actions at a of the British Prime Minister, whose views on international questions coincide with ours, are being applauded throughThe Australian out the world. He has done more to bring about a world peace than any other public man. We have suffered, and are still suffering, merely because we did that which we'thought was right. I am not altogether satisfied with the us method which the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) proposes to adopt in making money available to Tasmania. The Tasmanian Premier has asked the Commonwealth Government to make a financial grant to Tasmania for specific purposes, in support of which strong arguments have been submitted by the Tasmanian Premier. The Tasmanian Government asked for a grant of £200,000, to be followed by gradually diminishing annual payments; but the Treasurer intends to provide £85,000 in the first year, which amount is to be reduced annually by £17,000, so that at the end of five years no further payments will be made. The Treasurer proposes to make up the difference between the £85,000 and the £200,000 by ceasing to collect taxation from Tasmanian lotteries. At present the amount received by the Commonwealth Government from the taxation of lotteries in Tasmania is about £111,000 per annum, but no one can say how long it will remain at that figure. I submit that the Commonwealth Government is not really making a grant to Tasmania by withdrawing from that field of taxation. At any rate, it is doing the same thing for Queensland, for the Queensland Government conducts a State lottery. The Tasmanian lottery is run by a private company under strict government control. I do not think any one can contend that revenue which the Tasmanian Government may receive in consequence of the discontinuance of the imposition of the Commonwealth tax on lotteries and its re-imposition hy the Tasmanian Government can be regarded as a federal grant within the meaning of the Constitution. When the Constitution was drafted the probability of the smaller states suffering considerable financial hardships from federation was recognized, and provision was made for the Commonwealth Government to make grants in necessitous cases. Experience of the federation of states in other countries proved that that kind of thing happens. The financial arrangements of Tasmania were seriously disturbed by the establishment of federation, and in the circumstances the Commonwealth Government realizes that the application of the Tasmanian Government for a grant of £200,000 a year is not unfair. In fact, I think the Treasurer conceded in his budget speech that it was quite reasonable. I am therefore surprised that he did not agree on behalf of the Government to accede to the request in a straight-out way. At the end of five years Tasmania will not be in receipt of any federal grant, and the only additional revenue it will have will be the amount that it will receive from the imposition of heavier taxes on lotteries. But I ask the Government to give some consideration to the fact that there is quite a possibility that revenue from that source may not be permanent. The private company which conducts the lottery may remove its head-quarters to another state. There is another likelihood to be faced. When the Commonwealth tax on the Queensland state lottery is removed it is 1 quite possible that the Queensland Government, with a view to increasing the popularity of the lottery, may decide not to re-impose its tax, with the result that the Queensland lottery may supersede the Tasmanian lottery in public patronage. If the Queensland Government only imposes, say, half the tax which is imposed on the Tasmanian lottery, its organizers will be able to submit a much more acceptable and cheaper proposition to the community, and will doubtless win increased support. The future position from the Tasmanian point of view is therefore most obscure. I hope that the Government will reconsider its proposal, and decide to make a straight-out grant of £200,000 a year to Tasmania. If it does not do that I hope that it will, at least, withdraw its proposal that the grant of £85,000 shall be reduced by £17,000 each year. I do not think that any reduction of that kind was contemplated by the Premier of Tasmania when he made his appeal to the Commonwealth Government for a grant. I take it that a bill will have to be introduced to give effect to.this proposal.",25
35,Dr EAKLE PAGE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,That is so.,26
36,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"In that case I shall content myself, for the time being, with urgently requesting the Government to reconsider its proposal, and to make one more in keeping with the spirit of the Federal Constitution.",26
37,Unknown,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,26
38,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"A special medical board has been appointed by the Government to investigate the large number of grievances of disabled soldiers who attribute their disablement to war service. I hope the scope of the board's investigations will be wide enough to cover every case in which there is a genuine grievance. In reply to a question by me the other day, the Prime Minister informed me that the board would meet for the first time in Melbourne on the 8th September, and would then decide whether and when it would meet in the other states. I suggest that although the board will be given a free hand to go where it likes, and to sit when it likes, and to do what it likes, the Prime Minister should impress upon it the necessity of visiting every state. There are many painfu l cases requiring investigation in Tasmania. Some men there are almost entirely disabled, and others are completely disabled, and their disability is much greater now than it was when they returned from the war, or when they were discharged from the forces. I admit that it is difficult to ascer^ tain how much of the disability is due to war service, and how much to other causes. No honourable member is sufficiently expert to decide the merits of many of the claims. I know that the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia in southern Tasmania frequently deals with caseB in which, as a result of the Repatriation Board taking - too conservative a view of its powers, tice has not been done to the men. I congratulate the Prime Minister on pointing the board, and I hope that i will , without any unnecessary delay, notify the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia of the date when it will visit each state. That enable the League to notify its branches, and will give individuals with grievances follows:- an opportunity of appearing before the board and submitting themselves to a Sir, proper examination. Every man in Australia is anxious that the allegations injustice shall be withdrawn. The Reagainst patriation Board is the custodian of public funds, and when it is not sure that a man's disability is entirely due to war serment vice, it refuses to give him the doubt. I may be wrong in that view, but cases have come under my notice that jected have given me that impression.",26
39,Mr FOSTEB,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Thos e cases were submitour ted to the first royal commission, and vestigated by experts. Mr O ' KEEFE - I ask the honourable low:member to remember that in many cases owner the disability is greater today than i was at the date of discharge, and that difficulty is to determine how much of the disability is due to war service and how much has occurred since.",27
40,Mr FOSTER,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,In most of the cases the disabilities were greater when the royal commission sat than they are today.,27
41,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"That may be the honourable member's experience, but my experience is that in many of the cases the disability is now greater than it was twelve months ago, or at any time previously. There are reputable medical men who assert that the increased disability is entirely due to something that happened during war service;, such as shell shock or disease. These are questions that only expert medical men have any hope of determining. I wish to direct the Treasurer's attention to a matter relating to the collection of income tax. We have heard much during the last few days about the collection and remission of taxation. In his budget speech the Treasurer, in dealing with income taxation, saidTo carry out the intention of Parliament an amendment of the Income Tax Act will be submitted in order to validate past assessments on income earned in relation to assignment or transfer of leases. jusThat is necessary, but in the framing of such legislation very great care should be aptaken to ensure that justice is done to t individuals as well as to the department. To show that some individuals do not think they are getting justice, I shall read a letter that is typical of thousands of will others. 1 received it two days ago from a reputable citizen in Hobart. It is as 32 Murray-street, Hobart, 8th August, 1924. I desire to bring under your notice the facts of relating to an appeal that I have instituted my assessment for Federal income tax view for the year ended 30th June, 1920, and, in of the conditions rlnselosed by such facts, to request you to talro such action in Parliaas you see fit to effect the objects herethe benefit of inafter stated. I am moved to take this course, not only by reason of the gross injustice I have been subto, but also because the facts of my case are a good instance of the despotic tyranny that is becoming more and more a feature of Government, and which is operating to in - the grave injury of the public at large. The facts relating to my appeal are as folPrior to the. 14th June, 1920, I was a part of a leasehold property in Hobart, held t under a building lease, and on that date I and the my co-owners sold the lease for £5,000. On the 27th November, 1922, I was assessed by the Federal Commissioner for income tax for the year 1921-1922, and my proportion of the said sum of £5,000 was included in the assessment as part of my taxable income. On the 9th January, 1923, I paid the full tax demanded, and I lodged an objection against the assessment on the ground that the £5,000 was not taxable income. On 1st February, 1923, 1 received a letter from the Deputy Commissioner for Tasmania advising ine that as the property above referred to was sold prior to 30th June, 1920, my proportion of the said sum of £5,000 was included in my 1921-1922. assessment in error, and that it should have been included in my 1920-1921 assessment. The letter concluded as follows :"" To obviate the necessity for an amendment and a new objection, I propose to allow the matter to remain in abeyance until a decision on the objection is reached, when the full amount will be excised from your 1921-1922 assessment. If the final decision is such that any part of the payment for the lease is assessable to you, it will be then included in the 1920-1921 assessment. I shall be glad to know if you agree to this course."" On 2nd February, 1923, I wrote agreeing to the Commissioner's proposal. As you are no doubt aware, after a notice of objection has been lodged, the Commissioner is required to consider the objection, and either disallow it or allow it either wholly or in part (Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1918, section 37). But no time is limited within which the Commissioner is to give his decision. I heard nothing further from the Commissioner until the 8th November, 1923. On that date the Commissioner allowed my objection in part only. On 5th December, 1923, I gave the Commissioner notice that I desired to appeal to the Supreme Court of Tasmania. The Commissioner should then have forwarded my notice of objection to the Supreme Court of Tasmania, and have given me notice that he had done so. But I heard nothing further from him until the 29th February, 1924, when I received from the Deputy Federal Commissioner for Tasmania a letter informing me that the assessment would have to be amended by including my proportion of the said sum of £5,000 in my 1920-1921 assessment, and at the same time' I received an amended assessment for that year. I was then required to lodge a fresh notice ef objection within 30 days- I did so on the 13th March, 1924. On the 21st March, 1924, the Commissioner disallowed my objection. On the 24th March, 1924, I again gave the Commissioner notice to treat uiy notice of objection as an appeal, and to forward it to the Supreme Court of Tasmania. Not having received from the Commissioner any notice that he had complied with my notice my firm, wrote to the Deputy Commissioner on the 21st July last as follows :- . Dear Sir, lie Mr W . A. Finlay's appeal against Assessment No. 138136 in respect of financial year 1920-1921. The objection in this case was originally lodged with you on the 9th January, 1923, and the amount claimed as the tax payable was, of course, paid. In February, 1923, it was discovered that the department had made an error in including the payment in respect of the as.i.'ument of the "" Wellington Chambers "" in ti.f. 1921-1922 assessment, and in February, 1924, a new assessment was made, and an objection thereto was lodged on the 13th March last, and on the 24th March last Mr Finlay appealed to the Supreme Court of Tasmania. The question raised by the appeal appears to have been determined in the case of In re Dalrymple, and we therefore think that there is no justification for retaining from the appellant any longer the sum he claims he has been evercharged, and we suggest that you consent to the appeal being allowed with costs. If you do not agree to adopt that course, we must ask you to expedite the hearing of the appeal-it has now been pending about eighteen months. As no reply to-no t even an acknowledgement of-that letter was received, my firm on the 1st August inst. wrote to the Deputy Commissioner as follows:Dear Sir, tie Appeals of Messrs. W. A. Finlay and Thomas Lyons. We wrote to you on the 21st July last as to Mr Finlay's appeal, but we have not received any reply. The appellants feel very strongly tire injustice they have been subjected to, and we are instructed to give you notice that unless you consent to the appeals being allowed with costs, or set the same down for hearing within a week, we shall make a special application to the Court. No reply to or acknowledgement of that letter was received until this morning, when my firm received from the Commissioner a telegram reading as follows :Finlay income tax appeal papers being forwarded through Crown Solicitor for transmission of objection to Supreme Court of Tasmania. So it seems that the Commonwealth, having now had the full amount of the tax I paid for more than eighteen months are going to permit me to get a decision from a court of law. It muBt be remembered, however, that if I succeed, I will not receive any interest on the sum that the Commonwealth will in that case have wrongfully demanded from me. It seems to be an anomaly that whilst a taxpayer who may have been overcharged to the extent of thousands of pounds for two or three years is not allowed interest on the amount if he successfully appeals against his assessment, he must himself pay interest if he is behind in the payment of his tax. This is an important part of this letter, which I may say was written by a legal gentleman:But now I am about to get a decision a new position has arisen. About a month ago the High Court of Australia decided that the sum received by a lessee on the sale of the unexpired 'jalance of his lease is not taxable income. According to that decision it would seem that my eighteen months' old objection was well founded. But the Commonwealth do not propose to take any chance in the matter. My authority for that statement is the Treasurer's budget speech, in which this passage occurs: "" To carry out the intention of Parliament, an amendment of the Income Tax Act will be submitted in order to validate past assessments on income earned in relation to assignment or transfer of leases."" That is to say, it is proposed that retrospective legislation shall be passed to legalize certain illegal exactions which have been made by a Commonwealth Department. It seems that such legislation will cover my case, and that means tiiat an objection that I lodged over eighteen months ago w i ll be overridden by retrospective legislation. It smacks of orientalism to give a right of appeal, and then, when it appears that an appeal will succeed, to leave the right of appeal, but to take away the ground on which it is founded. The facts stated above bring out several serious defects in the Federal Income Tax Assessment Act. While the taxpayer is required to pay the full tax demanded within 30 days after demand, the Commonwealth can take its leisure in dealing with an appeal against the demand. While the taxpayer has to pay whatever sum is demanded from him, the Commonwealth can deal'with an objection just as soon or as late as it chooses, and as it has the taxpayer's money in its coffers, and is not liable to pay interest on sums overcharged, it certainly has no inducement to hurry itself. My request is that you will take such action in Parliament as you think f it to ensure(1) That the legislation which it is proposed to pass is not made retrospective at all. (2) That if it is made retrospective in some degree, that it is not extended to cover cases in which a notice of objection has been lodged prior to the passing of the Act. (3) That the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1918 should be amended so as to require the Commissioner to consider and decide on a notice of objection within a .fixed time-say , 60 days. (4) That the said Act be amended so as to make the Commonwealth liable to pay interest on all sums overcharged. Thanking you, I quote this letter for what it is worth, and I suggest that it deals with a case that might well engage the attention of the Treasurer. There is only one other matter upon which I wish to touch very briefly. When referring to the general aspect of the financial trouble which is the foundation of Tasmania's appeal to the Commonwealth for a grant, I omitted to mention that one of the chief causes Jlfr. O'Keefe. of Tasmania's financial difficulties since federation has been the comparatively small proportion of federal expenditure on public works in that state per head of population. In speaking on a bill recently before us proposing an expenditure from loan of £800,000 on new works, additions, and repairs for the Post and Telegraph Department throughout the Commonwealth, I directed attention to the fact that only £4,000 was for expenditure in Tasmania. I pointed put that on the basis of population Tasmania is entitled to expenditure on these works to the extent of £1 for every £25 voted, and that the vote for Tasmania in the bill referred to represents an expenditure in that state of only £1 for every £170 voted. Tasmania, because of her isolation and size as compared with the other states, has never had large sums of money spent on federal public works. I am not complaining of the expenditure in other states, because I always try to be a real federalist, and throughout my eighteen years' service in this Parliament I have always cheerfully supported expenditure upon works in all the other states if it appeared to me that they were necessary, and would be in the national interests. I am, therefore, justified in reminding the Government that Tasmania has not shared in these big expenditures of federal money, and has not enjoyed to the same extent as the other states the benefits which flow from publio expenditure.",27
42,Mr COBSEE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Hav e not the other states provided the money in income tax and land taxi,29
43,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I am surprised to hear such an argument from a representative of Queensland, because, with the exception of a few growlers, who are to be found in every state, the Tasmanian I am, people have never objected to pay very Yours truly, heavy taxation for the maintenance of WILLIAM A. FINLAY . the sugar industry in Queensland, because they believe it should be maintained as a white man's industry. The interjection is unworthy of the honourable member, and probably would not have been made if he had given the matter a little more thought, since it leaves him open to attack from other representatives from Tasmania. In opening my remarks I felt compelled to refer to some statements made by the honourable member for Perth (Mr. M a n n ) , who had just then resumed his seat. As the honourable member is present now, I wish to add a word or two to what I have said. The honourable member charged honourable members on this side with not having done their best to assist the League of Nations to function in the interests of the world's peace. I assert that honourable members on this side, and the people throughout Australia whom they represent, have, in the most practical way, done everything they possibly could to ensure the world's peace. Only the other day, when we were confronted with the possibility, and, indeed, the probability of a - very early federal election, honourable members on this side insisted on their Leader (Mr Charlton) going overseas to take part in the counsels of the League of Nations. I am sure that the honourable gentleman, in the in terests of the party and the legislation which it advocates for Australia, would have preferred to remain here and to be present should an election take place. But, at the earnest wish of the whole of the members of the party, he consented to attend the Assembly of the League of Nations. I remind the honourable member for Perth that the party on ""the other side has not made an equal sacrifice, because it is to be represented at the League of Nations by a gentleman who is not the leader of the party.",29
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,We have sent good man.,30
45,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Certainly, but who is not the leader of Government party. If we sent any one of half a honourable members on this side, we should also have sent a good man, but we coninsinuations, sidered representation at the League Nations as of more importance than the winning of the next federal election. t",30
46,Mr MANN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,The honourable memand ber is misinterpreting my remarks.,30
47,Mr OKEEFE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Then I am very that sorry, but the honourable member's remembers, marks were quite plain, and I cannot i terpret them in any other way. mind the honourable member and the not country that, on the outbreak of the war, during its continuance, and since its close, in spite of all the opprobrium cast upon it , all the epithets hurled at and all it has had to suffer inside and outside of Parliament, the party this side has stood for anything and thing which would bring about the world's peace. I think I am .entitled, as proof of this, to mention the fact that at this time, when we might require the services of our Leader to lead us to victory at the forthcoming elections, we have shown that we regard representation at the League of Nations, in the interests of the future peace of - the world, as of greater impor.tance than success at the next federal elections.",30
48,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Richmond) [2.45] My first remarks concerning the budget speech delivered by the Treasurer must be of a congratulatory nature. When he was a private member he frequently urged that the budget and estimates should be presented early in the financial year, in order that they might be adequately discussed, and he has proved his sincerity by delivering each of his two budget speeches in the first month of the new financial year. He has set an example which, I hope, will be followed by succeeding Treasurers. Although he had a big surplus to dispose of, he has resisted the temptation to disperse it in purchasing popularity and in electioneering propaganda, and has allocated the money wisely. He has not been extratravagant, but has taken a broad national view of the finances. Dealing with sugar, the Treasurer said that the Queensland pool is proving satisa factory. On Wednesday, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) one spoke on this subject at considerable the length. The sugar industry is one of his had pet hobby-horses, which he seems to redozen gard himself as the only person qualified to ride. He made many accusations and and some of his statements of were, so wide of the truth as to be unworthy of consideration. For instance, he referred to the new Minister for Works Railways (Mr Hill ) as the Leader of the Country party. The inaccuracy of statement is well known to honourable and it may be taken as an index n - to the character of the other remarks I remade by the honourable member, who does mind misstating the facts if thereby he can make a point against his opponents. The Treasurer, as Leader of the Country party, has made clear its attitude it , towards the sugar industry. He is still a member of the Ministry that first on proposed the embargo on the importation everyof sugar, and the New South Wales Farmers' and Settlers' Association, which supports our party, at its annual conference in Sydney recently, unanimously agreed to a resolution recommending that the sugar embargo be continued, or, alternatively, that the duty on imported sugar be increased to £ 1 4 per ton. Some time ago there was a big outcry in the southern states regarding the price of sugar, and it was said that the growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales were being spoon-fed, the Australian industry has given the consumers sugar at a price less than they would have had to pay if their requirements had been imported from Java or elsewhere. The Argus recently made a misleading comparison of the prices of Australian and Java sugars, ignoring the fact that no refined sugar is imported from Java. The imports are "" m i l lwhites,"" and the refining and distribution in Australia add considerably to the import price. Such a statement appearing in a reputable and otherwise truth f u l journal would seriously mislead the public. Some time ago the price of even Java "" mill-whites "" was higher than that of refined Australian sugar. That state of affairs continued for some time, but, notwithstanding that the Australian grower was giving the consumer sugar at a price cheaper than that at which the imported article could be sold, there was no word of appreciation from Mrs Glencross and others in the southern states who are making such a set against the Australian sugar industry. I hope that the Government will renew the prohibition of the importation of black-grown sugar, or, alternatively, that it w i ll impose a very high duty upon imports. The sugar industry is progressing, and the Government should continue its policy, of stabilization. Among the many good proposals in the budget speech is the promised of income taxation. Had a Labour Treasurer announced such a reduction wo*dd have been a wild whoop of joy from Labour supporters out Australia. Men would have mounted soap-boxes on every vacant allotment to glorify the Government for its concession to the classes. But no credit has given by honourable members opposite to the present Treasurer for having posed a lightening of the burden of taxation that will materially help those to whom a penny means more than a Mr R. Green. shilling does to others. I congratulate the Treasurer upon the relief he has extended to the people with smaller incomes, leaving them a little more money to spend to better advantage than in paying to the Federal Treasury taxation they can ill afford. The Kyogle 'toSouth Brisbane railway, which has been the subject of discussion but for a considerable time, appears likely soon to become an accomplished fact. An agreement has been reached between the Commonwealth and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, and I hope that at. an early date the railway will be commenced. It is desirable that as soon as possible there shall be a uniform gauge for the railways of the mainland, and I hope that after the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway is built the railways of New South Wales will be linked up with the EastWest railway by means of a line from Hay to Port Augusta. The North-South railway also should be started on the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge, thus honouring a promise which the Commonwealth made to South Australia many years ago. Of the surplus, £500,000 has been allocated for main roads development. I am sorry that the Treasurer did not apply to that purpose twice as large an amount. Although the whole of last year's grant was not spent, representatives of country districts know that material benefits accrued from the expenditure of the money made available by the Commonwealth. I do not think one voice has been raised here against the continuation of the grant, and I hope that in future years the amount will be doubled. I am glad that a royal commission is reduction to be appointed to investigate the very important subject of public health, and there I hope that its deliberations will yield good results, including the discontinuance through- of the present overlapping of state and federal, authorities. corner For many years the Postmaster General's Department did not give that poorer efficient and proper service in country been districts that we have a right to expect from a department that affects every properson in the community irrespective of age or occupation, and enters into the intimate l if e of the people more than does any other government department. The postal administration during the last twelve or eighteen months has yielded substantial benefits to the community, and I commend the Postmaster-General and his officers for what they h i ve accomplished for the settlers outback. It is reasonable to expect that the present beneficial policy will be continued while the present Minister retains his office. It is gratifying to note that £5,250 has been placed on the Estimates for the purchase of a plant for the working of duralumin, a light and tough metal discovered during the war, and used principally in the construction of aeroplanes. Experiments have shown that this metal is the best that can be used in the manufacture of artificial limbs. None of the Commonwealth artificial limb factories at present possess the necessary plant; but the grant is sufficient fbr them to obtain it . Some time ago a deputation of representatives of the Soldiers Association waited upon the Treasurer and submitted certain propositions, and although a good deal of publicity has been given to the requests then made, a reply has not yet been received, from the Minister. I hope a reply will soon be forthcoming. In answer to a series of questions which I asked of the Minister for Trade and  that a clumping duty has been imposed upon cream separators, which, as honourable members aro aware, are essential to dairy farmers. As those engaged in the dairying industry are the most poorly paid section of the community, it is the duty of Government to relieve them of some of the heavy burdens they are carrying by removing the duty now imposed on. these necessary machines. The Minister for Trade and Customs informed me that cream separators are not manufactured in Australia, and that up to the present time no attempt has been made to manufacture them here. It will, therefore, be seen that the duty on separators is an unnecessary burden on those engaged in the dairying industry, and one which they can ill afford to bear. I was also in formed that from 1919 ' to 1924. the amount of duty paid by dairymen on cream separators was £100,435, or an average of more than £20,000 per annum. In addition, to the duty, the agents' profit of 40 to 50 per cent, has to be added, whioh brings the amount paid during the five years mentioned up to £140,000 or £150,000. Notwithstanding this heavy impost, a. dumping duty is also levied upon these machines, which, as I have said, are not manufactured in Australia. ' Mr MATHEWS - If they are not manufactured in Australia, a dumping duty should not be imposed.",30
49,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"They are not manufactured here. I asked the Minister the following question: [las a dumping duty been imposed upon cream separators, and, if so, when was this done, and what was the amount of duty ? The reply wasYes, German cream separators were gazetted under section 9 of the Industries Preservation Act, operating on and from 18th October, 1922. This seotion is for the protection of British industries. The amount of dumping duty under section 9 is the sum which represents the difference between the fair market value in the Limbless United Kingdom of goods of like character or quality made in the United Kingdom and the export price of the German machines. It may, therefore, differ with each importation. I learned, in answer to a further question, that the actual amount of dumping duty received was £ 6 2 . The Industries Preservation Act provides that dumping duties may be imposedIf by reason of the depreciated exchange value of the currency of the country of export, goods of a class or kind manufactured in - the United Kingdom are sold to an Australian importer at a price detrimental to the British industry. The Tariff Board stated, in this regardSection 9, under which British industries are protected against countries with depreciated the currency, need's further consideration. Great Britain is receiving under this section .far groater consideration from Australia than is given by the British Government to their own industries. For the protection of this British industry the Australian dairy farmers have been charged a dumping duty and over £100,000 in direct duty. The Minister for Trade and Customs also stated that the value of cream separators whose country of origin was the United Kingdom imported in five years amounted to £44,875. In 1919-20, British productions represented 14 per cent, of the total importations; in 1920-1, 3 per cent.; in 1921-2, 4 per cent.; in 1922-3, 4 per oent.; and^ in. 1923-4, 4 per cent., or an average, of only4J per cent. The bulk of other machineswas imported from Denmark, Sweden, the United States of America, and Canada.. ' In view of these figures, I strongly test against the imposition of a duty upon an article essential to one of our most important primary industries. Taking these facts into consideration, I do not think any honourable member will attempt to say that even an import duty, quite apart from a dumping duty, is justified. I have no particular regard for the Germans, but I do see why there should be discrimination between these German machines and those produced in other countries. countries from which most of the sepabutter rators come were supposed to be neutral during the war; but we know that were not too friendly towards UB. tariff amendments are under consideradominion, tion, I trust that this important industry ficial. will receive the consideration it deserves. I wish now to discuss the dairying i dustry itself. I congratulate the honis orable member for Gippsland (Mr Paterson) on his very clear exposition a few days ago of the facts relating it. Recently I have attended an interSteps state conference of dairymen, which held several meetings' and had several interviews with the Prime Minister, as a result of which certain concrete proposals were placed before the Gotho vernment with a view to the stabilization of both the export and home markets. The Prime Minister has intimated that the Government will adopt the proposals regard to the export market. must result in material benefit to the dustry. It cannot be denied that the machinery for exporting butter is woeto drop. fully disorganized at present, and must market shall be organized. be improved before the producers hope for an adequate return for their produce. An Export Control Board is be established which, I am glad to say, price will take steps to remove the industry from the control of the speculators. We of do not want the speculator to have any fixed influence in either the export or home and market; we wish to eliminate him.",32
50,Mr FENTON,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The Board will have hard row to hoe on the London side. Mr K . GBEEN - That is so. It in - profit. tends to license certain agents, and permit the trade to flow along the present channels to some extent, but it will have power to revoke as well as to issue licences. One of its objects will be to ensure that Australian butter shall be placed upon the London promarket systematically and regularly. Under existing conditions it is impassible at times to obtain Australian butter in England, and at other times there is a glut in the market. The Danish dairymen have organized their industry so successfully that they market their butter in a steady stream, and the traders know what supplies ' are coming forward from time not to time. The New Zealand dairymen have also organized their' trade, but up to now they have been unable to make The any arrangements with the Australian producers to ensure satisfactory marketing abroad. The Export Control they Board should be able to make a good When working arrangement with the sisttr which will be mutually beneI t may also be possible to work in harmony with the Danish producers. n - At present, Australian butter in England 4d. per l b . cheaper than Danish butter, . which means that the exports of Australian butter return to our producers about to £1,500,000 less than they should do. have already been taken to pasteurise, grade and generally improve ' the quality of the Australian production, and I feel confident that when the Export Control Board is in proper working order, price of the Australian product will at least equal that of the Danish product. I am bitterly disappointed, however, that the Government cannot see its way clear in to accept the workable and reasonable That scheme suggested by the dairymen for the in - stabilization of the Australian market, but I do not intend to allow the matter It is essential that the home The Prime can Minister said he could not do as the dairymen desired in this respect, for it to would involve the adoption of a policy of fixation. Honourable members know that there are various methods fixing prices. Prices may he by governments or by rings combines, or by the industry itself. The dairymen suggested that the price for local consumption a should be fixed on the basis of the cost of production, plus a reasonable margin for Under prevailing conditions, it to frequently happens that the dairymen do not get the cost of production, and are only able to carry on by the sweated labour of the members of their family. The price of commodities manufactured by our various secondary industries is fixed on the basis of the cost of produetion . Every secondary industry in Ausreally tralia is protected by a duty, for the to it . cost of production here is higher than abroad. There is a duty on butter. I respect of New Zealand butter, the duty the is 2d. per lb., and in respect of butter from elsewhere it is 3d. per lb. dairymen contend, therefore, that the Government would not endanger the in terests of the local consumers by permitmore ting the control board to fix the price .butter for localconsumption, for if were fixed at an absurdly high figure butter would bf imported from New Zealand. I support, in its entirety, the scheme suggested to the Prime Minister, and although I am thankful that effect is to be given to half of it , I trust even that the suggestions that have been made for the organization of the local market w i ll also be accepted. Fixing prices the cost of production in the way I have suggested is altogether different from shippers. fixing them by Government interference. When the honourable member for CapriLondon cornia (Mr Forde) was discussing. price fixation the other evening, quite a number of honourable members opposite showed higher by their interjections that they were i hearty accord with his views.",33
51,Mr MATHEWS,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Coul d not the Government fix the price on the cost of production ?,34
52,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The dairymen propose that the board of control should be permitted to so fix it , for they have had a very unfortunate experience of Government price fixation. The first time it was attempted was in 1914-5, when the Holman Labour Government in New South Wales fixed the price of butter at Is. 3d. per. lb., or 140s. per cwt. That was during drought time. . As honourable members know, I represent one of the biggest dairying districts in Australia, and I am proud to say that it contains the largest butter factory in the world. My electorate adjoins the Queensland border. The Holman Government had fixed the price of butter in New South Wales at Is. 3d. a l b . In Queensland, under the Denham Government, price-fixing did not obtain, and the price of butter there was 2s. 3d. a l b . , or Is. a lb. more than that fixed in New South Wales. Because of that great disparity in price, thousands of dairy cows in iny electorate were spayed, and I doubt very much whether the industry has since recovered from the harm then done Later in the year the Ryan Government came into power in Queensn land. It seized all Queensland butter at price of 140s. a cwt., or Is. 3d. a l b . , the same price as paid in New South The Wales .under the Holman Government. At that time the Victorian price was 220s. - a cwt., or 2s. a lb., which was 9d. a lb. than the price in Queensland paid of by the Ryan Government. That Governi t ment disposed of 747 boxes of butter at 225s. a cwt., or about 2s. a lb. * The butter was bought at Is. 3d. a lb. and disposed of at 2s. a l b . A small quantity was sold in Queensland at 196s. a cwt., or Is. 9d. a l b . , and the remainder was sent yet to the Queensland Agent-General in London and, when sold, averaged 179s. a cwt., or about Is. 7d. a lb. But that was on bad business, because that price was 16s. a cwt. less than what was received by other One penny three farthings per lb. more could have been obtained on the shipment had it not been marketed by the Government. Instead of the dairymen of Queensland benefiting by the prices at which the butter was sold, n the profits made were paid into the Consolidated Revenue of Queensland.",34

During a period of twelve months the Queensland dairy farmers sustained a loss of approximately £680,000 on butter, alone, because of the actions of the alleged great friend of the farmer, the Labour Government ..of Queensland.",34
57,Mr FORDE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The policy of the Queenslaud Government has been to establish pools for the benefit of all the primary producers, and, in consequence, Mr.' Theodore last year won six farming constituencies.",35
58,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The Queensland farmers do not know on which side their bread is buttered. Evidently they are not aware of the facts that I am mentioning. This great loss of £680,000 was sustained by the dairy farmers owing to the action of the Queensland labour Government.",35
59,Mr FENTON,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,And yet they still vote for the Labour Government.,35
60,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I do not know that they will do so in future. I shall give these facts all - the publicity possible, that the people of Queensland may know the true position. I shall now give able members another example of how Labour pretends to assist the dairy farmer. On the 1st December, 1915, a Labour Government was in office in the Commonwealth, and in it the late Mr. Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs - Australia exports, on an average, about one-third of her butter production. If our butter is not exported the home market is glutted, and the local price drops. This is to the disadvantage of those producing the commodity. On the 1st December, 1915, the Commonwealth Labour Government imposed an embargo .on the export of butter.",35
61,Mr MATHEWS,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Quite right, too. Mr R GREEN"" - I am glad to have home market. that interjection from the honourable member. He says it was quite right to force down the price of a primary product the detriment of a struggling dustry.",35
62,Mr MATHEWS,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,It was right on that occasion.,35
63,Mr FORDE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,It was to make the posiand tion better for the dairy farmer.,35
64,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"How could it make his position, better when i - down the local price of butter?",35
65,Mr FORDE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Why does the honourable member support a government that turned .down the scheme for the stabilization ..the butter industry asked for by the dairymen ? - Mr R GREEN - After I have dealt - fully with the matter, and explained I stand with regard to the stabilization proposals of the interstate conference, th© honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde), who was not present when I referred to the matter, tries to put words into my mouth which I did not use. I made my position perfectly clear, and I suggest to the honourable member that when he gets his copy of Hansard, he should read what I said. Before leaving the subject of butter I wish to refer to the very ingenious proposal brought under the notice of the House by the honourable  There are two prices for butter, the export price and the home price. Something is being done by the Government to improve the export price, hut I regret to say that nothing is being done with reso gard to ..the home price. The suggestion has been made by the honourable member honor- for Gippsland that an excise duty of about I d . per lb. should be levied on all butter manufactured in Australia. The honourable member suggests that it should be paid by the factories, and out of the revenue so collected in ordinary circumstances a bounty of about 3d. per lb. might be paid. The cost of administration of such a scheme would be comparatively small, and if the bounty were fixed at 24d. per lb., i d . per lb. would be left to cover expenses and contingencies. If this scheme were put into operation the home price would automatically rise to the export price. In Australia we get not import parity but export parity, and by forcing up the export parity we should raise the price of butter in the Mr E. RII.EY - The consumers of to butter would not back the honourable local inmember up in that proposal. Mr E. GREEN - I am sure that all rightly-disposed people would do so. They all try to get the full value of their labour they should not deny it to those engaged in the dairying industry.",35
66,Mr WEST,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,What would the bounty t meant forcing cost the consumer? ,35
67,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The bounty would be taken from the manufacturers of butof ter. It would be collected at the factories, and factories that exported butter would receive it. Factories that did not export their butter would be in no worse how position than those that did, because as I have said, as a result of the operation of the scheme the price in the home market would automatically rise to the export parity.",35
68,Mr FORDE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"There is not a great export of butter during the winter months. Mr E. GREEN"" - I agree that the quantity exported varies during the year, but we are hoping that the board to be .appointed in London under the Dairy Export Control Bill will be able to regulate shipments of Australian butter placed on the London market. Under existing conditions the quantity of Australian butter placed on the London market may vary from 15,000 cwt. in one month to 120,000 cwt. in another. There is no reason why, with regular shipments, the quantity placed on the London market should vary by more than 1,000 cwt. or 2,000 cwt. from month to month. I shall deal further with this matter when we are considering the Dairy Export Control Bill. I trust that honourable members will give consideration to the proposal made by the honourable member for  intend to try to induce the Government to agree to that proposal. It would cost the Government nothing and would be of immense benefit to the butter industry.",36
69,Mr FORDE,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"The proposal might be useful if the London market was supplied only by Australia. Mr R. GBEEN - The honourable member was not present when I explained that New Zealand was prepared to co-operate with Australia, and that Denmark might co-operate with both in regulating the export trade.",36
70,Mr WEST,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"What does the honourable member think would be a fair price for butter in the local market. Mr R GREEN"" - A price that would cover the cost of production, plus a fair margin of profit. It would not he above the price at which New Zealand could put butter on this market with a duty of 2d. per lb. So much for the butter question. I now intend to pass on to other matters. I am pleased that steps are being taken to place the defence of Australia on a better footing. The Inspector General in his latest report records that an improvement has been effected,but he still declares that he is hampered by lack of funds, and expresses the hope that he may be given a little more money to spend on many essentials. It is nowpossible to meet his wishes to a greater extent than hitherto. I am pleased that it is intended to make provision for an extended programme covering a series of years. Notwithstanding the opinion of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH), we cannot afford to leave Australia absolutely undefended. Those who are acquainted with the military forces of Australia know what it means to lack an efficient army and navy. I had intended to speak at some length about",36
71,Mr MCGRATH,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,Japan .,36
72,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"Yes ; and to show the necessity for defence in respect of the definite menace from Japan. I have made voluminous notes about what that country is doing, but owing to the lateness of the hour I shall defer my remarks upon the matter until the defence estimates are reached. Now that the Minister for Trade and  ber, I ask him whether something cannot be done to remove the duty on cream separators ?  triment to Australian industry any anomaly such as a dumping duty referred to by the honourable member has already been, or very shortly will be, rectified.",36
73,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"This Parliament has imposed a duty of 10 per cent, on cream separators, although these articles are not made in Australia, and I take it that the duty cannot be removed except by means of a bill, which I trust the Minister will bring forward immediately.  to remove a dumping duty. It is purely a matter of administration. Anomalies have been and will be rectified when, in doing so, no detriment is occasioned to an Australian industry. A tariff duty cannot be altered except by Parliament, and the representations of the honourable member will receive consideration.",36
74,Mr R GREEN,NAVIGATIO N BOYAL,"I am pleased to hear that statement; and I sincerely hope that during the next five years Australian dairymen will not be called upon, to pay what they have paid during the last' five years, namely, £100,000 in duty on anarticle they cannot do without and. which is not manufactured locally. When agents' charges, &c, are added to that £100,000, it really means that the dairymen have been called upon to spend in five years £150,000 more on their separators than these should have cost them.  ber must always recollect that section 9 of the Industries Preservation Act protects British manufacturers in the Australian market. Mr E. GREEN - As British manufacturers supply only 4J per cent, of Australia's requirements it is questionable whether they are worth considering in the matter, particularly in view of the fact that the British House of Commons not long ago rejected a measure of preference for Australia's primary industries.

LISTER (Corio) [3.58] - In August of last year the - Minister who was then in control of the administration of the War Service Homes Act intimated in this chamber that the Government had decided that soldiers whose homes had cost more than the statutory limit of £800 were not to he asked to pay more than that sum for them, yet I know that at least a dozen men have received ejectment notices because they have refused, rightly, I think, to sign contracts binding them to pay the whole cost of their houses, amounting in some cases to as much as £960. This action is contrary to the express wish of Parliament, and to the declared intention of the Government Mr E. RILEY - Do the men object to paying the real cost of their homes 1",36
75,Mr LISTER,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"The honourable member will recollect that following upon the discussion of this matter, it was agreed that in no case should the excess over the statutory limit of £800 be charged to the soldier. I do not know that the Government are aware that the War Service Homes Commission is not administering the act as this House desired it to be administered. Already one man has been haled before the court and has been ordered to vacate his house by Thursday next unless he signs a contract.",37
76,Mr BRUCE,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,Is he the original appli-. cant for whom the house was built 1,37
77,Mr LISTER,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"I believe he is. Another case is to come before the court on Monday next, and I think I am justified in asking the Government to issue instructions to the commission to stay its July, hand so that full inquiry may be made before more people are harassed in this way by the officials. This matter came under my notice only a few hours ago, and I sincerely trust that the Prime Minister will take immediate action to prevent the commission from attempting to eject soldiers who have entered into the possession of these homes and are quite ready to sign contracts for amounts not exceeding the maximum fixed by this Parliament.",37
78,Mr MCGRATH,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"Ballarat) [4.2] - The debate yesterday on. the taxation of Crown leaseholds disclosed the fact that Mr Jolly, who is a member of the Taxation Commission, occupies a dual position. Not only is he a member of a body appointed to inquire into the method of valuing Crown leaseholds, but he is also the paid agent and representative of Sir Sidney Kidman, and acts for him in all his dealings with the Taxation Department. The Prime Minister should inform the House what the Government intends to do to alter the personnel of the commission. Probably the right honourable gentleman is not aware that this is not the first occasion on which Jolly has been somewhat severely criticized. In the year 1919 he was a defendant in a libel action, and I have ascertained fro m the Argus law reports that damages to the amount of £250 were awarded against him and the other defendants. The Chief Justice of Victoria, Sir Willia m Irvine, who formerly occupied a high position in this Parliament and is esteemed as an impartial judge, said of JollyHis conduct throughout the whole business is marked by so much excitability and unreasoning and overbearing anger that I am unable to place much reliance on the accuracy of his memory. Even if the debate yesterday had not disclose d nis association with Kidman, the very fact that he was referred to in such terms by Chief Justice Irvine should disqualify him for membership of a royal commission. Having regard to that statement from the bench, how much reliance can be placed upon any report to which Jolly attaches his signature?  he is Kidman's agent should disqualify him. Mr E . RILEY - How long has he a member of the Taxation Commission?",37
79,Mr BRUCE,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"Since it was reconstituted, about six weeks ago.",38
80,Mr MCGRATH,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"It is possible that Jolly's record as a litigant may have been overlooked by the Government, but the fact that he is acting in a dual capacity makes it impossible for him to give fair play to Kidman or to the taxpayers. He cannot serve two masters, and, having regard also to the censure passed on him by Sir Willia m Irvine and the judgment of £250 against him, the Prime Minister should take immediate action to withdraw him from the commission.",38
81,Mr NELSON,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"Northern Territory ) [ 4 . 5 ] - I desire to state briefly to the House the circumstances of a struggling settler, who for eleven months was an inmate of the Darwin Hospital. A f t e r having been nine months in the institution, the amputation of one leg became necessary, and on his discharge he was presented with two accounts. One was from the hospital for £ 8 5 , representing the usual hospital fee of 35s. a week, the other for £ 3 8 6s., being the doctor's private fee for the operation. The hospital is a government institution, and I suggest that when a poor man has been an inmate for eleven months and has lost a leg, payment of the usual charges, amounting to £ 8 5 , should be a sufiicient discharge of his liability for the treatment he received. If it is ""not, the Government has erected and maintains ab great cost an institution which is used as a private hospital by the government doctor, who is paid a regular salary of £600 per annum, and has the right of private practice. The usual charge of 35s. per week made by the hospital should cover all treatment.",38
82,Mr STEWART,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,Will the £38 6s. be paid to a government fund?,38
83,Mr NELSON,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"It will go into the pockets of the doctor. It is a private fee superimposed on the hospital fee; and I draw attention to the fact that, whilst the hospital account contains no suggestion of urgency, the doctor's bill asks for prompt payment. Apparently, it does not matter about the debt owing to the hospital, so long as the doctor gets his "" cut "" first.",38
84,Mr WEST,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"East Sydney) [ 4 . 9 ] From a discussion which has taken place in the Parliament of New South Wales, it appears that twenty Serbians landed been in Newcastle last week, and nine of them obtained employment at the steel works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited . The others, who cannot speak a word of the English language, are idling about the streets of Newcastle, and are dependent upon the inhabitants for food. I understand, from information supplied to the State Government, that they paid their own passages to Australia, but they have produced an advertisement or statement, published at the instance of the Commonwealth Government to the effect that any migrants arriving in Australia would be provided with employment immediately. The Italian miners at Wonthaggi,, being unable to speak the English language, are a danger to themselves and to the other miners, because they cannot understand the directions and the warnings that are given to prevent accidents. At Broken Hill , a fortnight ago, two Italian miners were taken out of the 500-ft. level for the same reason. The honourable member for Newcastle, in the State Parliament (Mr J . M . Baddeley), has stated that about 900 reliable men are on the books of the Newcastle labour bureau. When representations were made to the Premier of New South Wales to place some restriction upon the entry of migrants from southern Europe, Sir George Fuller said that i was a matter for the Commonwealth Government,- and that, therefore, Government could not interfere. Rereplies cently, following the exclusion of Italians from the United States of America for the present year, an Italian line steamers has been put on the Australian ally discourteous, though run, and as the quota allowed by the United States Government to Italy next year is a small one, there may be a serious exodus of Italian emigrants Australia. All honourable members will proposes to do. agree that it is very undesirable to enw courage the introduction to Australia people who cannot speak the English tongue. Foreigners are becoming very numerous in this country. An Italian citizen told me three months ago that, owing to the increasing number of hia fellow countrymen in Australia, their position was becoming very serious. I not know what are the social conditions in Italy under the regime of Prime Minister Mussolini, but I believe they far from satisfactory. In my opinion, the Government should take some steps check migration from southern Europe. Intending immigrants should be definitely informed that, unless they can speak English language, there is little prospect of getting employment in this country. They should not be misled by the statevernment ment that employment is easily obtainable. I do not know who is answerable for the present state of affairs. I do nob blame the present Government, but some Comannouncement monwealth Minister must be answerable, because in the last Supply Bill there present time. is an item of £11,700 for salaries to immigration officials in Britain and Australia. I trust that Prime Minister will note what I have said, and take whatever action may' necessary.",38
85,Mr A GREEN,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"Kalgoorlie) [4.15] From time to time, deputations introduced to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, have made certain representations concernItalians ing the position of the gold-mining indushas try in ""Western Australia. Subsequently conference was held, at the instance of the Government, and - recommendations for the assistance of the industry forwarded to the Government. One of the recommendations, a proposal to tralia exempt mining companies from income of taxation u n t i l the whole of the working man capital has been returned to its owners, has already been adopted. I have been t endeavouring to ascertain what the Government intends to do with regard to his the other recommendations, but the of the Prime Minister to my questions have not been very explicit or fair to me. I do not suggest that the right of honourable gentleman has been intentiondiscourtesy would not.affect me so much as my confor stituency and those engaged in the industry. It is absolutely necessary that to the Government should indicate what it I trust that not only ill he reply to the representations of the of Gold Producers' Association, but that he will also make a statement in this House.",39
86,Mr BRUCE,IMMIGRATION FROM SOUTHERN EUBOPE,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.18] - I can assure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that I have not been do intentionally discourteous either to him or to his constituency. The Government has given consideration to the recommenare dations of the conference convened to deal with the present position of the goldto mining industry, and effect has already been given to the recommendation that the industry should be relieved from the income taxation. A statement of policy to that effect was included in the Treasurer's budget statement. The Gois examining the other recommendations with the object of ascertaining whether further assistance can be given. When a decision has been arrived at, an will be made in the House. It is impossible for me to say more at the In reply to the statement made by Great the honourable member for East Sydney the (Mr West), I can only say that the migration to Australia of southern Eurobe peans is a matter that is receiving the earnest attention of the Government. Representations have been made from New South Wales by, I think, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . Riley) concerning the introduction of into Australia. The Government been watching the position for some a time past. There is no power under the Immigration ' Act to exclude Europeans except under certain specified conditions. were Under our migration laws Europeans have a perfect righ t of entry to Auswithout restriction. The imposition restrictions, as .the honourable gentlemust know, would raise a very delicate international question. We have been in communication with the Italian Government on the subject. The control of migration from Italy is in its hands. That Government has undertaken not to issue passports to Italian subjects who intend to come to Australia unless there is direct evidence that some one in the Commonwealth is to be responsible for them, and that they will he able to maintain themselves, or that they have reasonable means to live on. The operation of the quota system, is severely restricting the ordinary migration of Italians to America, hut there has been no increase in the number of Italian migrants to this country, although the contrary might have been expected. The present indications are that the arrangements I have mentioned >are operating satisfactorily. The Italian Government does not intend to issue passports in extraordinary numbers to Italian subjects. If the honourable member desires further information on the matter, and will communicate with the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) full replies will be given to his inquiries. The matter raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) will be brought under the notice of the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), who will supply an answer as soon as possible. I was not aware that a member of one of the commissions at present inquiring into the manner in which taxation should be levied upon Crown leaseholds has been associated with certain litigation, as stated hy the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), and the fact that he is the agent of a large land-holder has come under the Government's notice only during the laBt few days. I can assure the honourable member that the Government will give full consideration to these matters. In reply to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), I may say that I clearly remember the discussion in this Blouse, and the understanding arrived at. If anything is being done which is contrary to the arrangement then agreed upon, the Government will, of course, give instructions that it be discontinued. I shall have the whole matter inquired into, and let the honourable member know. ' Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.24 pjn.",39
