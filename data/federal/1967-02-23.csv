0,NA,Unknown,"the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the seminar on decentralisation that was held at Orange in June 1965. No names no pack drill. Referring to parliamentary representation, he said: Now the politician has to, unless he is completely rash, take some note of the people who put him in power, and you are not going to find many politicians who will stand up and tell you that they are prepared to support a programme which is going to say that the city of Sydney or the city of Melbourne or the city of Brisbane Adelaide or Perth is going to grow so far further. Let us put it on the line. There we had a Labor member of parliament admitting that he would be dominated by the people he represented. If Australia were divided into electorates with equal numbers of voters, it would be a mathematical certainty that as the cities of Sydney and Melbourne grew the number of members representing electorates in those cities would increase. As a consequence, yet more and more of the available finance would be channelled into those cities. We hear from the Labor Party much talk about decentralisation, but it is all part of a sham fight. The honourable member for Bendigo has covered everything very nicely and glibly in the terms of his notice of motion in an attempt to hoodwink the Australian people, but that notice of motion makes no reference to the abolition of rural representation in the parliaments of Australia in accordance with the principle of one vote one value. I hope that the members of the joint Commonwealth and State committee that I have mentioned will have heard or will read my remarks, which, I trust, will stir the convenor of the committee into action and cause him to put the needle into the members of the committee and get some action from it, for that is what we really need.",52
1,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Hunter) [4.9]- Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with previous speakers in congratulating you on your appointment again as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of this House. I have always been impressed by the manner in which you read the Lord's Prayer when you have occasion to take the chair at the opening of the days proceedings. My first signincant impression of you was gained early in my political life when I visited Wingham to attend a political meeting. On the occasion of that visit, I heard you read the TwentyFourth Psalm at the opening of a rodeo. Your rendering of it brought soberness to all the roughriders who were about to saddle their nags to take part in the rodeo. We on this side of the chamber expect that you will display the same measure of impartiality that we have experienced from you for some time now. Admittedly, you or have made errors, but we all realise that and no we could have a much worse person in the chair presiding over our proceedings than you are. We have just heard an oration by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Holten), who was one of Victoria's outstanding athletes. Having heard the oration that he has just delivered in the National Parliament, I can say confidently that he was a much better player of Australian rules than he is a politician. He set out to criticise the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who earlier had suggested the adoption of economic planning. In time economic planning will come to every nation in the Western world. Those that have resisted it most up to date are those which are dominated by monopoly interests that control the money bags. When private industry plans its development and expansion over a period of years in the way in which planning is undertaken by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and other monopoly enterprises throughout Australia, the enterprises concerned are applauded for possessing farsightedness and having great business minds at their head. But when a government institutes economic planning it is immediately branded as being Socialist or pro-Communist, and this arouses the indignation of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, which has begun to play an important part in Australian politics and which, I believe, was responsible for the election of so many members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Country Party at the general election on 26th November last. However, as the Australian electorate becomes better educated concerning the activities of this nefarious organisation we shall find a complete reversal of the relative numbers in the ranks of the present Government parties and the present Opposition in this Parliament. We are at present debating the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is known as the Address-inReply debate. Before I turn directly to His Excellency's Speech I shall make some further comments about the remarks made by the honourable member for Indi. He suggested that governments, both Commonwealth and State, should make a greater effort to bring about decentralisation. Honourable members on this side of the Parliament have been appealing to this Government for a long time to undertake effective measures to promote decentralisation and to prevent the drift of people from country areas to the cities. The honourable member for Indi is a prominent member of the Country Party. In the last sessional period of the last Parliament, only a short time before the general election was held, he refused to support decentralisation proposals that were presented in this chamber by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Beaton), who is an outstanding Labor man. The honourable member for Indi is totally inconsistent. When I say that I am using very moderate language. This afternoon he devoted the major part of his address to decentralisation. He also mentioned the wheat stabilisation scheme, which was introduced by the Labor Government years ago at a time when members of the Country Party were clutching at each other's throats and undercutting one another in attempts to sell their wheat. The Labor Government, in effect, said: 'This will go on no longer. We shal' establish a wheat board which will take the wheat and give the growers a reasonable price for it. We will sell it for them.' Today there is peace in the wheat industry as a result of the wheat stabilisation legislation introduced by the Labor Government. Only recently I have read that the barley growers- I think in Victoria - ar e asking for an Australia wide barley board so that growers throughout Australia may have an equal opportunity to sell their barley in seven recognised markets as is the case with wheat under the stabilisation scheme introduced by Labor. How inconsistent is the honourable member for Indi. His arguments can be cut to ribbons in a few moments. The honourable member, in his remarks on decentralisation, failed completely to mention that one of the most important ways of inducing private enterprise to establish plants in country areas, under the capitalist system that the Australian people at present sponsor, is to allow tax concessions and concessions on telephone rentals and charges to those establishments that are located in country regions. This is the sort of thing that the former Labor Government in New South Wales was trying to bring about, particularly in the Hunter electorate. The Labor Government in that State induced industry to go to the coal fields centres of Cessnock and Kurri Kurri in the heart of the Hunter electorate at a time when economic changes in the coal mining industry had caused half the men employed in it to be displaced. It was the practical, common sense way but there was no suggestion from the honourable member for Indi that taxation concessions should be given to those people in private enterprise who are prepared to take their factories out into the country. Mr Holten-Sectio n SI of the Constitution will not allow it.",52
2,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"How can we expect to induce people to establish, say, a tailoring factory at a place like Inverell, away from a market of three million people in Sydney and bear the cost of transporting goods to Sydney while there are other clothing factories operating in the suburbs of Sydney close to ready markets? It could not compete with these. We will have to compensate people who are prepared to set up factories in the country in order to put them on an equal footing with manufacturers in close proximity to the city areas where the markets are. So much for the inconsistent talk of the honourable member for Indi. I want now to refer to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, a copy of which has been supplied to all members. In outlining the Government's proposed business for this sessional period, His Excellency said: My Government will persist with its search for the attainment of a just and enduring peace. I intend to speak mainly about Vietnam this afternoon, but first I shall mention a serious personal matter that arose shortly before the last election. It affects a fifth generation Australian, a man named Francis James who is managing director of the 'Anglican' newspaper in Sydney. His home was invaded by two customs officers on 13th November at about 1.40 p.m. Incidentally, this outspoken Australian believes more in the Liberal Party's ideology than he does in that of the Labor Party, although he agrees entirely with the Labor Party on the question of Vietnam. As I have said, his home was invaded by two customs officers who, when questioned, claimed that they were searching for narcotics. Most honourable menibers will know that customs investigators possess a search warrant covering the full twenty four hours of the day and have very wide powers. But to search the home of Francis James for narcotics was just as ridiculous as it would be to search your home, Mr Deputy Speaker, or rhe home of any honourable member of this Parliament. The Government was in a dilemma. It was desperate. It was worried about the Liberal Reform Party. I have never seen a man look more contented than has the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Bridges-Maxwell) since the election. He thought that as a result of the intrusion of the Liberal Reform Party in the campaign for the Robertson seat he would lose his place in this Parliament. The Government was worried; it was desperate. There is no doubt that something was done to cause the customs investigators to go into the home of Mr Francis James, which is situated at 65 Billyard Avenue, Wahroonga. I understand from the honourable member for Watson (Mr Cope) that Mr James was a Spitfire pilot in the last war. He is a very loyal and patriotic Australian. The customs investigators claimed they were searching for narcotics. I want the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Howson) to stand up in his place here and tell us why these men were searching for narcotics. What caused them to go there? On what information did they act? They said it was anonymous information. 1 suggest that this is absolutely ridiculous. They went to the home of Mr Francis James on the advice of either the Commonwealth Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. In my opinion, they went into his home in an endeavour to find subversive literature, because he defied the Government after being refused a visa to go to Vietnam last year. It is atrocious that a man of virtually unblemished character, a fifth generation Australian who is the managing director of the 'Anglican' newspaper should have his home at 65 Billyard Avenue, Wahroonga, invaded by customs officers who purported to be searching for narcotics. It is absolutely ridiculous. It shows the desperation of this Government and the low actions to which it was prepared to stoop in order to retain control of the treasury bench in this Parliament. The situation has been reached in Australia where the secret police can go info the home of a man of the integrity of Francis James. This man, in my opinion, has been subjected to persecution since he took a stand against the Government on the Vietnam issue. On 9th January last he applied for a visa to go to North Vietnam. Tha immigration authorities or the Attorney General's Department refused him a visa. The authorities replied to him on the first day of this month saying: 'No. What are the special circumstances?' This man is a respected and fair minded journalist who writes the truth. The Government is refusing this man a visa to go to Hanoi because he is in conflict with its policies on Vietnam. But that is not the attitude that is adopted by the Government of the United States of America. The United States Government issued a visa to Mr Harrison Salisbury, one of the editors-in-chief of the 'New York Times'. He wrote about what he saw; it was not favourable to the United States Government. Mr William Warby, a well known politician in the United Kingdom, was granted a visa by the United Kingdom Government to go to Vietnam. The West German Government gave a Lutheran pastor authority to go to Hanoi. In the 'Australian' of 12th January last this report appeared: In New York, three American women, on their return trom an 11-day visit to North Vietnam, charged that the United States 'was waging a war of civilian terror whioh could lead to racial extermination.' One of the women, Mrs Grace Newman, said that after seeing the atrocities of anti-personnel bombing among civilians, she was convinced 'the conflict was a war of genocide and of extermination against the Vietnamese people.' As I indicated, the United States Government, with all its faults, is not preventing its nationals from visiting Vietnam. But the Australian Government is refusing prominent, fair minded, honest-writing Australians permission to go to North Vietnam because it is afraid that they might write about what they see. I have no doubt lhat the Government would not refuse Mr Alan Reid of the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph' or Mr Bob Santamaria, who writes for the 'News Weekly' permission to go. The Government knows that their minds are so warped in its favour that they would write stuff that was suitable to it. But honest Mr Francis James, who depends upon writing for his livelihood, is refused permission. If ever I saw a Minister in an embarrassing situation it was in this House at question time this morning when the Minister for Immigration (Mr Snedden) had to extricate himself from the difficulty in which the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Mclvor) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) placed him when they raised the matter of refusing a visa for North Vietnam to an Australian journalist. I believe that every true Australian agrees that this Government has gone too far in withholding visas from decent Australians, whether they be clergymen or writers, and in preventing them from going to North Vietnam in case they come back and write something that is detrimental to the Government. The Government claims to be a protector of freedom. It says: 'We must protect the frontiers of freedom'. The freedom of the Australian people is being whittled away every hour, every day and every year that this Government is in office. The sooner the Australian people wake up to the situation, the better it will be for them. There is only one party that will protect the freedom and liberty of speech of this nation and that is the Australian Labor Party, which sits on this side of the House. I come now to the Governor General's Speech from which I was about to quote before I raised the matter of Mr Francis James. His Excellency said: My Government will persist with its search for the attainment of a just and enduring peace. During the suspension of the sitting today I took pains to see what the Governor General said when he was Minister for External Affairs in this Parliament at about the time of the 1954 Geneva Conference agreements by which peace was brought to Indo-China. Let us look at what the Governor General said to the Parliament on that occasion when he was Minister for External Affairs under Sir Robert Menzies. He said on 10 August 1954, as reported at page 96 of Hansard: The French, despite all their efforts and despite great sacrifices of French life, never really succeeded in rallying the Vietnamese themselves to resist the Communist Vietminh. In the same speech as reported at page 97, that distinguished Australian, the former Minister for External Affairs, said: I felt we should look for a political settlement of the problem in Indo-China- a negotiated settlement-recognisin g the realities of the situation. Mr Curtin-Who said that?",53
3,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"It was said by Lord Casey in this Parliament on IOth August 1954 when he was Minister for External Affairs in the Menzies' Administration. That was at the time of the Geneva Convention agreements. Ts not that what the Australian Labor Party has been asking for in the Parliament for some time- a negotiated settlement? Has not this been sought by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), the honourable member for Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS) and the overwhelming majority of Labor members in this place? Let me quote a little more of what was said by this distinguished Australian Governor General when he was Minister for External Affairs. He said: In April, the French and Vietnam forces were waging an unequal conflict at Dien Bien Phu against the Vietminh. Talk of intervention, particularly in the air I interrupt myself to remind honourable members of the relentless bombing of the north which is going on todayin order to save the situation, was being widely canvassed at that time. Our Australian view was that such intervention would be wrong for the following reasons: It would not have the backing of the United Nations, lt would put us in wrong with world opinion, particularly in Asia. It would probably embroil us with Communist China. It would wreck the Geneva Conference, and it was most unlikely to stop the fall of Dien Bien Phu. These were the views that I expressed on behalf of the Australian Government to Mr Dulles, Mr Eden, and other leaders at Geneva. These are the words of the former Minister for External Affairs taken from Hansard, verbatim. Has not the Labor Party been protesting at the intervention in and the relentless bombing of North Vietnam? The British Government has dissociated itself from the relentless bombing of Vietnam. I think this nation faces a most serious situation today because of the war in Vietnam about which the people of Australia were misguided at the last election. At that time, the then Leader of the Opposition warned the Australian community that if the present Government were returned to power Australian commitments to Vietnam would be in the vicinity of 30,000 men within the three years that it would be in office. What do we see? We see this in the newsfront papers after the elections but they did give it such prominence before. Each day we see reports of Australian kids being blown lo pieces. In today's 'Australian' read: 'Vietnam mine kills seven Australians'. What disgusts and hurts me is this: the kangaroo. members on the other side of the Parliament are in favour of conscription and sending the children of Australian mothers over to Vietnam- I reluctantly say this it is true-bu t on that side of the Parlialians ment there are many men of military age, many men under thirty-five years of age, and I do not know of one member of the Government who has initiated steps to put on a uniform and suffer some part of what our boys are suffering today in Vietnam. Those honourable members are prepared to send other people's children who are conscripted but they are not prepared go themselves. I say, Mr Speaker: how low can you get? I have said this in the Hunter electorate from the time this Government introduced conscription, and the people honoured me for it and returned me with the largest Labor majority in Australia. will continue to pursue that course as long as there is breath in my body and as long country. as my vocal cords will ring out, because this is an immoral, unjust and cruel war in which the world's most powerful is among a peasant people who are virtually fighting with bows and arrows. I recommend this latest book, 'Vietnamappointment Vietnam', by Felix Greene, that has just come from America at my instigation to our Parliamentary Library. I recommend it particularly to new members before they become hard core, professional, cold hearted politicians like some of their older mates who have been on that side of the Parliament for too long, far too long. Get hold of this book and read it. It should touch the most cold, iron hearted men in the Parliament. Read what is going on. The younger members opposite might take the stand that has been taken by a man in another place who could not wrestle with his conscience any longer and who recently resigned from the Liberal Party. He said, in effect: 'We hold the right to criticise our Prime Minister. We believe we have that right and we hope that that right will never be taken away from us.' I do not altogether look with great pride at the cartoon on the of the 'Far Eastern Economic Review', not a magazine that supplies from time to time some very useful information. Our newspapers do not, I am reluctant to say. It we depicts a kangaroo, with Air Vice-Marshal Ky's head replacing the head on the",55
4,Mr HANSEN,Unknown,Who is in the pouch?,56
5,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is in but the pouch of the kangaroo. Many Austrabelieve that he might be a pouched man, but this is the first time that I have seen that. It depicts him as a person who is prepared to jump into the pocket of one of the world's most vicious dictators of our time. Also in this paper is an article written by Alan Reid. This paper stated some short time ago that it is strongly suspected in Hong Kong that thirty-eight periodicals, to newspapers and magazines there are gradually being subverted by the powerful finances of the American Central Intelligence Agency. I hope that the Australian people will study more the activities of this nefarious anti-espionage organisation. I do I not believe that any country has the right to set up espionage organisations in this",56
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable nation member's time has expired.,56
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Parkes) [4.34]-Mr Speaker, may I commence my speech by offering you congratulations on your to the high office which you now hold. Secondly, I think it only proper that I should express my gratitude and my thanks to the electors of Parkes for having been kind enough not only to put up with me for three years but to send me back for another three. I am grateful to them. ",56
8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I suggest to the honourable member for Scullin that he recognise that he is one of a very long tail of a very small party and should try to behave himself better and not interrupt. 1 suppose I should say something about the emanations that have just poured forth from the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). I would pass over them very quickly, because in my view he said nothing that was worth answering. He does little service to the House or to country, 1 suggest, at this point of time in trying to rehearse and retrace in a highly histrionic way the issues and debates that were fully covered during the course of a very intensive election campaign and in this place during the last twelve or eighteen months. I suggest that the country at large would be better served if the Australian Labor Party and particularly the honourable member for Hunter were to take the view at last that, after all, the people of this country have spoken their mind through the medium of the ballot box on the correctness of our commitment in Vietnam; and there the matter should, in broad principle, rest. J do not propose in my speech on the opening of this Parliament to cover issues of the election campaign. 1 feel that more useful purposes would be served if at this stage private members tried to concentrate on some aspect or aspects of particular legislative policy and endeavoured to put before the House some reasonably constructive ideas, particularly on subjects which may not have been debated in the House during the last Parliament or, if debated, not debated very extensively. I would like to invite the attention of the House to the fact that there is in the Australian community a degree of nonarticulation and lack of co-ordination as between the various statutory bodies which have important functions to play in the direction and formulation of our economic policies and practices. The four bodies to which 1 refer in particular are the Tariff Board, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Trade Practices Commissioner and the Trade Practices Tribunal. The Tariff Board and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission play a tremendously important part in the directing of our economy-indeed , even the formulation of economic policy. It is my belief that we should endeavour to secure more co-ordination than presently exists between these two bodies. After all, in some important respec'ts their work is complementary. I should imagine, therefore, that there would be little opposition to a proposal that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Tariff Board exchange more information than perhaps t'hey do at present and that they the should indulge in more consultation on various aspects of the Australian economy in which, in their separate ways, thcy are interested. I do not think any machinery exists at the moment for consultation between the two bodies. But, perhaps mow importantly, we should consider the interrelation between the Tariff Board and the Commissioner of Trade Practices. We must bear in mind that when the work of the Commissioner of Trade Practices and the Trade Practices Tribunal begins, the Commissioner and the Tribunal will be charged, in substance and in large measure, with the task of investigating agreements and practices which really amount to a sort of unofficial or private protective tariff wall operating or standing within the official boundaries o, the statutory tariff. I should think therefore that when, for instance, the Tariff Board has to consider whether a particular Australian industry is deserving of protection or, to use the term now commonly applied, whether the industry is 'economic and efficient', it should be in a position to know what, if any. restrictive practices or agreements falling within the ambit of the Trade Practices Act that industry may be participating in. It seems to me a fair enough proposition that if an industry seeking tariff protection is in fact engaging in practices within the ambit of the Trade Practices Act, the propriety of which in terms of public interest has to be determined, then the Tariff Board should know this. It should be given the information by the Commissioner of Trade Practices. This should be borne in mind in considering whether a particular industry is in fact economic and efficient and deserving of protection. In the same way, looking at the problem from another point of view, when the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has to consider the capacity of a particular industry or of industry in general to pay increased wages, as it frequently has to do, any relevant information gained by the Commissioner of Trade Practices and his staff in the course of their inquiries should be given to the Commission. I would have no sympathy with any Australian industry which sought to resist a claim for increased wages in proceedings before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on the ground that it would not be able to absorb the increased costs consequential upon an increase in wages, if in fact its incapacity to absorb those increased costs was due to the industry engaging in restrictive practices which distorted the market economy by the establishment of a sort of private tariff wall within the framework of the statutory tariff. So I look forward to legislative proposals, the effect of which should be to provide a full exchange of information between Commissioner of Trade Practices and the Tariff Board and between the Commissioner of Trade Practices and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I feel certain that if some means can be found of achieving this objective will get more articulation and more ordination in the general framing of economic policies. The next matter to which I want briefly to refer is perhaps a rather larger matter. The time has come when the Parliament should give serious considerabecause tion to the question whether the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as it is presently contains adequate and effective criteria for the guidance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its task of fixing wages in those industrial disputes that within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The problem is by no means lacking in claims. complication, as I would be the first to agree. The starting point to any consideraway: tion of this problem is to be found in some words written by Sir Owen Dixon, when he was Chief Justice, in a case reported in 89 Commonwealth Law Reports, 'The Queen v. Kelly, ex parte the Australian Railways Union'. Sir Owen Dixon said: While an arbitral tribunal deriving its authority under an exercise of the legislative power given by section 51 (xxxv) must confine itself to conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes including what is incidental thereto and cannot have in its hands the general control or direction of industrial social or economic policies, it would be absurd to suppose that it was to proceed blindly in its work of industrial arbitration and ignore the industrial, social and economic consequences of what it was invited to do. Those words appositely and aptly sum up the essential nature of the problem. The power of this Parliament to legislate with respect to industrial relations is a qualified and limited power, as has hitherto been thought at any rate. The main head of power is the placitum in the Constitution which gives the Parliament power to legislate with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. The theory has developed that the dominant objective or purpose and function of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is the prevention and settlement of disfor putes and that, while the Commission cannot the disregard the consequences to the economy of what it may do, these are, as it were, matters on the periphery of its deliberations and do not go to the central problem. There has been, of course, a degree of divergence among members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from time to time we as to the importance which particular coeconomic factors should or should not assume in the hearing of wage cases. I should like to put before the House for its consideration a general proposal, which I make inevitably in fairly tentative terms its validity will have to be examined very carefully and very extensively. I would framed suggest that there are ways and means while acting within constitutional power of enlarging and extending the criteria which may permissively be taken into account by fall the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in determining wage 1 should approach the problem in this for the purposes of my argument, I start with the Report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry and refer to chapter 7, 'Costs. Prices and Wages'. In that chapter of its Report the Vernon Committee was very anxious to press the view that wage policy should ensure as far as possible price stability. It took a view with which various members of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission quite strongly disagreed to the effect that the Commission had become de facto a sort of incomes tribunal. Now, that view was pretty strongly rejected, amongst other people, by Mr Justice Wright. He rejected it in the 1965 basic wage case. But while the view may be rejected that the Commission can act as an incomes tribunal, it cannot be denied that because of the pervasive outspreading effects of the decisions of the Commission, it has a tremendous innuence on the movement of wages and prices generally. The Vernon CommiUee was firmly of the view that price stability should be a major objective in wage fixation. It took the view, perhaps a little optimistically, that by means of a relatively simple amendment to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act the Commission's position as an arbiter which in its arbitration would concentrate on price stability could be established. I quote in this regard from paragraph 64 of chapter 7 of the Report where at page 137 the Committee said: Without wishing to support any particular wording, we think that the Act could be amended so that its objects include the maintenance of price stability in a context of full employment and the promotion of the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. This is, perhaps, open to doubt, as was pointed out by one of the judges of the Commission in the basic wage case last year when he queried whether such an amendment cast in such bald terms would be within constitutional power. ",57
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think that it might have been Mr Justice Wright again. I think that there may be more subtle ways of approaching the problem than the particular way suggested by the Vernon Committee in chapter 7. It seems to me that there is no reason why careful consideration could not be given to relying upon the Commonwealth's trade and commerce power to support new provisions in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act designed to establish specifically as a criterion in wage fixing the objective of price stability. I know that there has been a great argument over the years in submissions and debates before the Commission in wage cases as to the proper part to be played by the concept of price stability in wage fixing. But my belief is that price stability goes to Ihe very root of good industrial relations because unless we can achieve price stability within the context of full employment, a rising standard of living and increased population then we are not really eradicating, perhaps, one of the basic causes of industrial disagreements. One of the basic causes of industrial disagreements is the discontent which naturally and properly is engendered when prices outstrip wages and a disastrous wage spiral ensues. What I would like to propose in a very tentative way is this: there is no reason why the trade and commerce power should not be invoked so as to include as one of the objectives of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the promotion of Australia's export trade by means of ensuring, as far as possible, that wage fixations cause no undue disturbance of price stability. It goes without saying that increases in internal costs are calculated to disable our export industries. We have all heard about the cost-price squeeze to which some of our primary industries are presently being subjected and have been subjected for some time. My honourable friend from Bendigo (Mr Beaton) will know more about that than I do. Mr Beaton-Is the honourable member advocating price supervision?",59
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am advocating no such thing. I believe that the best way of maintaining price stability is to allow a free market economy to run with proper supervision at the manufacturing end, proper supervision of harmful restrictive trade practices. That is the real answer to those who would support an elimination of the market economy by price control and price fixing. I have been able to put this in only a very sketchy and tentative way. Internal costs affect our exports. Price stability, if it can be achieved, will keep internal costs down and thereby help to promote our exports. The trade and commerce power has been described by most eminent judges as one of wide and flexible application, and while I would be the last person to want to appear dogmatic on any question affecting the IJW of the Constitution, I do suggest to the Government that if, as I believe, the objective of price stability should be given more significance in wage determinations, then something should be done to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide some sort of additional objective such as I have proposed. There is only one other thing I want to say. By reference to the conciliation and arbitration power itself, it may well be possible to enlarge the scope of the objectives of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act so as to raise in importance and status the objective of price stability. After all, the chief object of the Act is the promotion of goodwill in industry, and I do suggest that at bottom, when one analyses the matter, goodwill in industry will in the long term be promoted by a conscious attempt to achieve stability of prices. I am not denying the tremendous importance of distributive justice, of equity, but if we can achieve stability of prices through the arbitration system we will be doing something well worthwhile.",59
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
12,Mr HANSEN,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [4.59J-Firs t of all, Mr Speaker, let me add my congratulations to those that have already been heaped upon you. Whilst I was not one of those who voted for you, I do respect the authority you hold, and I believe you will dispense justice and follow in the footsteps of the man who has just retired from the office of Speaker. 1 also congratulate the mover and seconder of this motion. Making a maiden speech is always a problem. It is not so many years since 1 made mine. I do not know whether one is lucky to be, as it were, the first cab off the rank. gratulate both honourable members on the speeches that they made about their districts. They both follow men whom I have been proud to call my friends and whom 1I have held in the highest regard. If I am here in three years time or at any future time, I will be pleased to express the same sentiments in relation to them. We are considering the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech. It is usual to expect the Speech to outline actions of prominence and importance to the counSpeech. try which the Government will take in its term of office. I think this year's Speech is one of the shortest that I can recall, although quality is what counts. However, I find that little initiative is shown in the Speech. I believe that that is an indication of the stolid stuffiness of a Government which is comfortable in a larger majority and which believes that it has effectively answered any efforts for a better deal for wage and salary earners, pensioners and supporters of greater Commonwealth assistance in development, by reference to a threatened invasion of Australia from Asia and our need to maintain a few thousand troops in Vietnam. The Labor Party recognises and has always recognised the need for adequate defence. But, for how long can the Government hide behind this as an excuse for not doing very necessary things? I remind honourable members of the dilemma in which the President of Indonesia, a man who once was thought of as the leader of one of these supposed invasions, now finds himself. For many years he has drawn the minds of the people of Indonesia away from their own economic and domestic problems by hiding behind a shield of military projects. I do not wish to deal with South East Asia at all; but I believe that that point should be made. I heard a comment- I think it was made by the seconder of the motion-to the effect that today we see fewer and fewer sunburnt, independent Australians who are prepared to give it a go. It is quite obvious why that is so. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Hughes) touched on some of the reasons for it when he referred to the many restrictive trade practices and takeovers which are damaging and destroying initiative. I believe that one of the major factors in this respect is lack of I confinance. Today the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) held up a copy of a magazine called the 'Far Eastern Economic Review'. I do not know whether any Australian had anything to do with the production of the cover of that magazine; but if one did and if he is a friend of Air ViceMarshal Ky I think he has done him a certain amount of injustice by placing his head on the body of a female kangaroo. I wish to deal with some of the matters referred to in the Governor General's One of them is very close to me as a Queenslander; that is, the sugar industry. Actually, very little was said about it. The Governor General said: The sugar industry, although attaining high production levels, is experiencing serious difficulparticularly ties through the depressed international price for sugar, and faces an uncertain world outlook. My Government, in close co-operation with the Queensland Government and the industry, is actively seeking acceptable international arrangements which will ensure Australian sugar producers access to world markets at remunerative prices. Wc heard the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr MCEwen) say today in reply to a question by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) that, he had so far been unsuccessful in his efforts in this regard. 1 know that his task will not be a light one because the expansion in the sugar industry took place not only in Auslralia but also in many other countries. It is interesting to note that the expansion of the sugar industry in Indonesia was encouraged by Japan. Japan has financed the construction of sugar mills in Indonesia. I do not know to what extent the Japanese are interested in the purchase of our sugar but it is interesting to note that the Minister for Trade and Industry no longer acclaims our sales of sugar to Japan as being very beneficial to the industry as a whole. It is known that through customs and excise duties the Japanese Government makes much more out of the sugar than do the people who aclually produce it. The sugar industry in Australia is very concerned indeed. The full peak of the expansion has not yet been reached. Some people who have been granted assignments have not yet been able to obtain the necessary capital to go ahead with the clearing of land in preparation for the planting of crops. Here, again, is something that I have emphasised before: Australian initiative has been damaged by the lack of finance. The Australian Labor Party drew atlcnl.'on in its policy to the need to make cheap money available for development, especially rural development. In the sugar industry it has been the practice at the end of each crushing for the engineering firms in Bundaberg and Maryborough in my electorate of Wide Bay to carry out repairs and overhauls to existing mills. Owing to the depressed state of the industry orders have not been forthcoming. There were fewer last year and still fewer this year. This is creating a fear of unemployment in sugar towns. There are other industries but they do not provide anything like the employment that the sugar industry offers, in engineering works. So there are grave fears about employment. 1 know that representatives of engineering firms in Bundaberg and Maryborough, are touring the couniry looking for contracts. These firms have been recognised always as specialists in the sugar industry. They have manufactured sugar mills for Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, and other countries. Because they were recognised as specialists they did not have the problem of obtaining contracts. If they turn lo other work thcy are faced with having to compete with engineering industries in centralised areas where there is a large labour force available and where, if a job is wanted in a hurry, incentives can be offered and skilled men found to push those jobs through. This is not the case with industries away from the capital cities. Decentralisation i.s a subject which has been touched on by a number of honourable members. But no mention is made of it in the Governor General's Speech. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) whether he was interested in decentralisation. We hear from Country Party members that they are interested in the subject. But if we read the policy speeches for the three major political parties, we find that the only party that gave any attention to decentralisation and balanced development was the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party proposed to set up a balanced development fund to make money available to States for use in establishing industries in these areas. One of the aspects on which the Government could act and has not yet acted is sales tax. Goods sold in these areas bear sales tax on the last wholesale price, that is, sales tax is applied on the manufactured price plus freight and handling costs. This system works very much against people in decentralised areas. In many cases they are paying much more sales tax-this applies particularly to motor vehicles, which are essential-tha n are their brothers and sisters in the capital cities. I believe the answer lies in imposing sales tax on the article at the point of manufacture. This would mean that people throughout Australia would pay the same rate of sales tax, irrespective of their location. To some extent this would also assist industries in decentralised areas. I know wholesalers in the city of Maryborough, particularly those dealing in groceries, who have had to close down. I know wholesalers in Bundaberg who are facing the same problem. They have to charge sales tax on the last wholesale price and so are unable to compete with firms which send a traveller from Brisbane who sells at the Brisbane price plus freight. In those cases sales tax is levied on the capital city prices. This is working against the interests of decentralisation. The Governor General also mentioned other matters which may seem to other honourable members to be of small importthis ance but they are matters in which I have been interested. He said that ment will introduce legislation to give the Department of Housing discretionary power to deal with certain cases of hardship which have arisen since the commencescheme ment of the homes savings grant scheme. I am sure this is appreciated by all able members, particularly those who in this place in the previous Parliament and who had raised with them many queries on the administration of the scheme. I recall that when the scheme was introduced in May 1964 the Minister said that if he had not prepared the Bill self he would not have understood it. Many of us had the same difficulty, so we cannot blame the couples who wondered whether they were entitled to receive the grant. Twelve months later, in March 1965, the scheme was amended to remove some of the anomalies but there are still borderline cases in which the Minister's discretion should be exercised. One interesting point is that the scheme now will extend to widows of less than thirty-six years of age who have children. This is something the Labor Party proposed when the Bill was introduced. On that sion we asked why widows and were excluded. In reply to a question along these lines by the then honourable member for Hughes, Mr L. R. Johnson, one Go the vernment member said that widows were not a very good financial risk. I am happy the scheme has been extended at last widows and widowers, but this will apply, I understand, only from 29th November last year and not from the inception of the scheme. There have been instances of hardship. In some cases, as a result of the tragic death of the husband, a mother has been able to provide a home of her own for her children because she received a lump sum compensation payment. She is not entitled to it. Yet she is probably more in need of it than many others who do qualify for it. What about the widower who finds himself left without a wife and who wants to purchase a home for his family? Is he to be denied the assistance because he has not got a wife? What sort of a qualification is this? When Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin was appointed Minister for Housing I asked that she give special consideration to widows and I am pleased to see that has been done, but why should a widower be excluded if he qualifies in the Governevery other respect? The limitation on the value of a home that qualifies under the home savings grant will now be increased from $14,000 to $15,000. Has this been done in recoghonornition of the fact that home building were costs have increased? The maximum loan available through most banks, State housing commissions or the War Service Homes Division is $7,000. It is a long way short of the $15,000 that is proposed-les s than half way. An amount of $7,000 is the himmaximum that is loaned. If the Government recognises that costs have increased how does it reconcile this with the low maximum loan that is available? Recently in Queensland the State Housing Commission increased the maximum loan available from $7,000 to $8,000. If honourable members look through statistics they will find that of all the capital cities the cost of building is cheapest in Brisbane with the possible exception of Hobart. I wonder whether the raising of the amount from $14,000 to $15,000 indicates that couples who are able to afford a better type of home occaare the ones who will qualify for the widowers maximum savings grant. I referred a short while ago to the War Service Homes Division. I wish to direct attention of the House to an interpretation of the Act in regard to the method that of holding land on which a war service to home has been built. There are many instances in country areas- I am speaking aboul Queensland because I am not certain of Ihc position in other States-wher e people have been assisted to build homes on what are known as 'perpetual leases'. They pay an annual rental to the State Department of Lands. This land is recognised under the War Service Homes Act as a holding. In Queensland, if the people in possession of such a home find themselves in a better position and wish to convert holding to freehold the State Department allows them twenty years in which to do so. However I am reliably informed that immediately they do this the arrangement is not recognisable under the War Service Honies Act and they are faced with no alternative but to obtain a second mortgage with the permission of the War Service Homes Division. They have to make a cash payment for the conversion and then pay a higher rate of interest than they would pay to the Department of Lands. This is only a small thing but it is something that is giving concern. I believe that the Minister for Housing should have a look at this matter and introduce an amendment so that the problem can be solved. Also in relation to housing, I am pleased to note that local authorities will now be recognised for benefits under the Aged Persons Homes Act. This has been part of Labor's policy and amendments designed to achieve that objective have been proposed by Labor in this place for a number of years. It seems that when the Government is looking for ideas it turns to the Australian Labor Party's policy so that it may introduce something new. It is pleasing to note that the permissible income of age, invalid and widow pensioners is to be raised by $3 a week. It is many years since the limit was lifted. The value of money has decreased considerably in the meantime and I believe that the time is not very far off when Australia could well follow the lead of countries such as New Zealand and abolish the means test. Employees of local authorities in Queensland are obliged by law to contribute to superannuation schemes. Are contributors to such schemes making their payments only to receive a reduced pension when the time of retirement comes? While the additional allowance of $3 a week is welcome, it is not enough. However, I am sure that it will be appreciated by many people who at present are denied some of the fringe benefits available to pensioners. It is interesting to note also the reference to Commonwealth participation in the field of tourism. I judge from an anssver given their this morning by the Minister for the Navy (Mr Chipp), who is in charge of tourist activities, that he is right on the ball in respect of tourism; unless, of course, he gave the answer to a prepared question. However, he certainly gave a full and precise answer. I suppose, on reflection, that if it is a good answer it does not matter whether it is an infringement of the Standing Orders. My friend, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant), may have something to say on that subject. I believe there is room for greater Commonwealth participation in tourism. State governments are limited by the funds available to them. This is an industry that may be used to assist decentralised areas by bringing a considerable amount of money into them. Queensland has many miles of shoreline, most of it behind the Great Barrier Reef, which is one of the wonders of the world. I am surprised that more is not made of this attraction. I do not believe that in developing such areas we should go in for the Honolulu pattern of bright lights. We may have learned something from the experience of people there. We have an Australian way of life which is acceptable to the people of most countries. I do not believe that it is inferior to that of other countries. The amenities we can offer visitors to Australia by sticking to Australianism and not introducing facets of another way of life will bring tourists to Australia.
