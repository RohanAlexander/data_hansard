Mr Truss-The Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS) is committed to meeting the needs of a diverse workforce, which will in turn, assist the Department in the provision of services to a diverse client base.

Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry (AFFA) personnel computer system indicates that: (a) 7 employees have their principal conditions of employment set by awards. These are Senior Executive Service officers that are currently on extended leave from AFFA and are yet to be offered an Australian workplace agreement. (b) these same 7 employees are also covered by an industrial agreement. (c) 2973 employees have their principal conditions of employment set by certified agreements. (d) 152 employees have their principal conditions of employment set by Australian workplace agreements. (2) The AFFA personnel computer system indicates that the classifications of officers who have Australian workplace agreements are: 70 Senior Executive Service officers. 25 DPIE Band I officers. 22 DPIE Band 2 officers. 35 DPIE Band 3 officers. Exports: Live Cattle to Israel (Question No. 359) Mr O'Connor asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: (I) Did the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy issue a media release on 28 July 1998 stating that (a) he had called for a full report following the death en route of at least 346 of a shipment of 1200 cattle sent to Israel in June 1998 and (b) the exporter had been asked to show cause why his licence should not be suspended. (2) Has he or his Departrnent received a report on the incident; if so, (a) when, (b) will the report be made public and (c) did the report recommend the suspension or cancellation of the exporter's licence. (3) What action has he taken with respect to the exporter's licence. (4) Is it a fact that details of the incident have been known since the ship arrived in Israel on I July 1998 but that results of departmental investigations into the matter are yet to be made public; if so, why has there been a delay. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) Under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 (AMLI Act), the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is responsible for a decision in this matter. To assist him in discharging this responsibility he received a number of reports including a report prepared by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority under the Navigation Act 1912 and a number of reports prepared by the Department. The departmental reports included reports prepared by AQIS under the Export Control Act 1982, an incident report, a Bureau of Rural Sciences report on mortalities and two reports analysing possible action under sections 23, 24 and 17 of the AMLI Act. The Minister was provided with a copy of the incident report on 22 December 1998. These reports are not to be released in their entirety, as they deal with commercially sensitive information and cover issues of privacy. The incident report did not recommend suspension or cancellation of the exporter's licence. The Secretary of the Department based his decision on the facts before him having due regard to the requirement of administrative law and the provisions of the AMLI Act. (3) In addition to a range of measures already taken to achieve a satisfactory animal welfare outcome, the Secretary on 11 February 1999 issued a direction under section 17 of the AMLI Act to the exporter not to export live cattle from ports south of the 26 th parallel to the Middle East and North Africa during the Northern Hemisphere summer (between 1 May and 31 October). Details of the Secretary's decision were announced in media releases issued by the Minister and the Secretary on 12 February 1999. (4) While information on levels of mortality was available soon after the event, there was a need for full and thorough investigation of events prior to, during and after the voyage. Information was not easily accessible due to the fact that there was a time lapse between events occurring and the reporting, as well as the fact that the event occurred some distance from Australia and beyond Australian national jurisdiction. Superannuation: Tax Concessions (Question No. 364) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 8 February: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the report entitled The Cost of Superannuation Tax Concessions which was prepared by Access Economics and released by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Investment and Financial Services Association Australia, Australian Stock Exchange and Financial Planning Association of Australia in September 1998. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to claims in Appendix 1 of the report that (a) the Treasury TES model for costing superannuation tax concessions assumes that the income taxed as superannuation is otherwise taxable in the hands of the employee (b) the Australian Taxation Office and his Department therefore calculate the concession as the gap between an assumed marginal personal tax rate and the contributions rate of 15 per cent, and (c) the official marginal personal tax rate is not revealed but is likely to be around 40%. (3) Is it a fact the official marginal rate referred to in part (2) is not revealed; if so, why. (4) What is the official marginal rate referred to in part (2). (5) Will he respond to the report; if not, why not; if so, will he present his response to the Parliament or make it available to the public. (6) Does existing tax policy discriminate against superannuation rather than incur a cost in terms of forgone revenue; if not, why not. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) and (4) The counterfactual marginal tax rateS have not been published in recent years. However, it has been noted in earlier statements to be 40 per cent for superannuation income, and this rate continues to be used as the benchmark. ' (5) No public response is planned or required. (6) No. The taxation of superannuation is concessional. Pyridostigmine Bromide (Question No. 411) Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 February 1999: (1) Does' the Australian Defence Force use pyridostigmine bromide, a nerve agent pretreatment tablet. (2) What is the purpose of the tablet and what side effects does it have. (3) Was the tablet taken by Australian troops during the Gulf War; if so, (a) were they warned of side effects and (b) did they take the tablets (i) voluntarily or (ii) under orders. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The purpose of the tablet is to reduce significantly the number and severity of casualties from a nerve agent attack and to increase the number of personnel who can continue their duties. The tablet should be taken eight hourly from eight hours before, and for the duration of, the period when the threat of nerve agent attack is deemed to occur. The side effects are short lived and include increased salivation, nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. At the designated dosage, these side effects do not impair job performance. (3) Yes. (a) Yes (b) The operational commanders were given the responsibility for determining when pyridostigmine pre-treatment should start and end, based on the level of threat from nerve agent attack. The commanders therefore instructed their troops when to commence and cease taking pyridostigmine.",179
