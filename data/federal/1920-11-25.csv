2,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"On the 28th August, 1919, when dealing with the prohibition of the importation of sheep dip, I quoted a number of cablegrams which had passed between the general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephews and their head office in London. Amongst them was one, which appears thus in the Hansard report of my speech (vol. LXXXIX . , page 12060). Require general description of Leggo's and what is the present actual capacity able us to decide adaptability of process. Messrs. Cooper and Nephews have no desire to re-open the controversy, notwithstanding that they are still distinctly at variance with a number of statements which were made by their competitors, and which I quoted in this House, but they attach great importance to the cablegram which I have just read. Unfortunately the Hansard record of it is not quite correct. The cablegram should have appeared in Hansard as it appears in the official file, as follows:Require general description of Leggo's plant, and what is the present actual capacity enable lis to decide adaptability our process. Ir. Hansard the word "" of "" appears instead of the word "" our."" I make this correction, as the matter has been brought under my notice, and I express regret that the mistake has occurred. UNIFORM ELECTORAL ROLLS.",20
3,Mr BLUNDELL,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister for Home and Territories whether he has been successful in his negotiations with the South Australian Government, and has secured the adoption in that State of a uniform State and Federal roll?  follows:-'The Electoral Bill introduced by the Premior of 'South Australia for the purpose of providing for co-operation with the Commonwealth in the preparation, printing, and maintenance of a joint electoral roll which will meet the requirements of Commonwealth elections and State House of Assembly elections has now passed through all stages in the Assembly, and its second reading in the Legislative Council. I am informed that the third reading in the Council will be taken today, and that no opposition is The Commonwealth roll will be the foundation of the joint roll, which it is proposed shall be utilized for the purposes of the State general elections, to be held, it is understood, during the earlier part of the next year. NA MINISTER.",20
4,Mr CONSIDINE,TESTIMONI AL TO THE PRIME,"I ask the Leader plant, of the Government whether, in view of enthe statements that have been - made from time to time about the sources of revenue of various public men in the Commonwealth, the Government will seriously take into consideration the publication of a list of the subscribers to the testimonial presented yesterday to the Prime Minister, and the amount subscribed by each.",20
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TESTIMONI AL TO THE PRIME,I think we have too much to do this session to undertake a laborious enterprise of that kind. r * BASIC WAGE: PUBLIC SERVICE.,21
6,Mr BLAKELEY,TESTIMONI AL TO THE PRIME,"Yesterday I asked the Treasurer a question regarding a promised interim payment to the Publio Service. Has his attention been drawn to a telegram sent by Mr O'ConnoT to Sydney, stating that Â£4 4s. a week has been fixed as the basic wage? Can he inform the House whether any such decision has been arrived at, and, if so, by whom? , Sir JOSEPH COOK - I Tead that a telegram had gone from Mr O'Connor to those whom he represents in New South Wales, but I do not know where he got his information. There is nothing in it whatever. PORT PIRIE GANTRY.",21
7,Mr MAKIN,TESTIMONI AL TO THE PRIME,"I wish to know whether the Minister for Home and Territories can advise the House whether a rumour prevalent in Port Pirie, that the gantry now installed at the town is to 'be. transferred to Port Adelaide, is correct?  have heard of the matter. NA SHIPBUILDING. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE REPOBT.",21
8,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"I wish leave to move a motion. Recently the House rethat ferred to the Public Works Committee a matter of very great urgency. The Public Works Committee Act makes it imState, also. perative that the Committee's Teports shall be presented to Parliament, but it is impossible for the Committee present its report on this subject before the Christmas adjournment, I desire obtain the formal permission of the House to present it, in the first instance, to the Governor General. It will, course, come before Parliament directly we re-assemble. - Mr MAHOKY - I object. SUPPLY OF SUGAR. VICTORIAN SUPPLIES: REFUSAL TO UNLOAD STEAMER.",21
9,Mr STORY,COMMONWEALTH,"Can the Minister for Trade and Customs make a statement as to the trouble that has arisen in connection with the unloading of supplies of sugar at Port Adelaide? 1 Mr MASSYGREENE - My attention has been drawn to this unfortunate occurrence. We have had the greatest difficulty in' obtaining sugar from abroad, because there is a world's shortage of sugar. We have, however, endeavoured by every means in our power to obtain sugar, recognising how much an ample supply of it means to the comfort and convenience of the citizens, and remembering also that we have a great fruit growing industry whose prosperity largely depends on the securing of adequate sugar supplies. Those from whom we have bought the sugar, however, have absolutely declined to repack it in 200-lb. bags. We had either to take the sugar in such packages as we could get it in, or not buy it at all. We have offered to the wharf labourers in South Australia every possible additional assistance for the unloading of the sugar, and are prepared to pay the extra cost of it ; but so far we have been unable to get the unions to agree to take the sugar out of the ships.",21
10,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH,"I have already mado a statement in regard to the quantity of sugar available in New South Wales, and the price at which it is being sold there. I now ask the Minister, who seemed to doubt my statement, whether he will make a special effort to see Victoria gets a fair supply of sugar?",21
11,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALTH,And every other,21
12,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH,"My attitude in this as matter is provincial, because I know that to New South Wales is getting more than its share. I ask the Minister to make to an extraordinary effort to get some of the excess supply in New South Wales for the people of Victoria. I can furof nish him with the names of some men in New South Wales who have so much sugar on hand that they can afford to sell it .at 5jd. .per lb.",21
13,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH,"I have stated, on a great number of occasions, that the existing supplies of sugar in Australia are distributed pro rata to every State. In addition, we are making special arrangements to purchase from outside Australia an extra supply of whitesugar in order to meet the requirements of the fruit season in all the States. A shipment of 5,000 tons of white sugar is due to arrive in Victoria at the end of this week or at the beginning of next week, and the whole of it will be made available for this State. In regard to the price at which sugar is being sold, all I can say is that we have pooled all freights, and are selling sugar at exactly the same price in every State. Of course, if a retailer in any portion of the Commonwealth chooses to sell it for less than the proclaimed price of 6d. per lb., it is his affair. He is perfectly entitled to do so if he wishes to attract trade by that means.",22
14,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform me whether he has seen a statement to the effect that the sugar which the wharf labourers in South Australia have refused to handle would be handled by the wharf labourers in Melbourne, and whether that statement is correct?",22
15,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH,"I have not seen a statement to that effect; but the position is that if we cannot get the Fort Adelaide wharf labourers to unload the sugar in South Australia we shall be compelled to bring it on here, and I understand that there will be no difficulty experienced in regard to the handling of the sugar at this port. RETURNED SOLDIERS' BADGES.",22
16,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,"Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that a decision has recently been given by a magistrate in Launceston that a person other than a returned soldier does not unlawfully and falsely represent himself to be a returned soldier if he wears a returned soldiers' badge, as long as he does not trade on it?",22
17,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH,"Regula t i o n s 80A. and 80B provide that any person who is not a returned soldier who represents himself to be one is liable to be prosecuted, and I take it that the wearing of a badge can be regarded as representing oneself to be a returned soldier.",22
18,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH,"Supposin g a person is wearing the badge of his f ather, who has been killed?",22
19,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH,I do not know; but I should say that the wearing of: a badge to which one is not entitled is to f alsely represent oneself as a returned soldier. NA BILL.,22
20,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"After reading the leadingarticles in this morning's Age and Argus dealing with the War Precautions Act Repeal Bill, which was passed through the House so expeditiously last night, will the Government seriously conown sider whether they will proceed any further with that measure?",22
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"After reading the articles in question, I came to the conclusion that, in each case, the writers were not conversant with what took place here. NA RAILWAYS.",22
22,Mr BAYLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will the Minister for Works and Railways cause surveys to be made of all likely routes for the nortksouth railway, so that this House may be provided with sufficient knowledge to enable it to decide upon the best location for that line?",22
23,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The general policy in regard to Northern Territory railways is, of course, determined by the Government; but it is a matter that more particularly concerns the Department for Home and Territories-. The Department for Works and Railways is only responsible for the work of construction in the Territory, and, of course, also for the management of a line when it is built. I hope to submit to the House a motion asking the Public Works Committee to inquire and Teport upon a specific proposal for a railway line; but, in addition to that, the Department has caused an inspection to be made of another line to the border of Queensland, and the information gathered in that way will be made available to the House. The Prime Minister has also promised, so I am in formed, - to have inquiries made in regard to railway routes in other portions of the Northern Territory, and that information, when obtained, will also be made available.' SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE .",22
24,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Mr Speaker, by your courtesy, I would like to ask whether it is a fact, as stated by the President of another place, that you have refused permission to officers of the Joint House Departments to give evidence before a Select Committee appointed by the Senate?",23
25,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY," As a matter of fact, no application has ibeen made to me by the Senate or any Committee thereof for permission for any officer to give evidence before a Select 'Committee appointed by the Senate for the purpose of making certain in vestigations, which, ' so far as I can see, do not cover any officers of this Parliament outside those immediately under the control of the Senate. According to the Senate Journals, this Select Comper mittee was appointedTo inquire into and report to the Senate the question of the' officials engaged in about the Senate, and the working of the Public Service Act, so far as it concerns officers to attend and give evidence. controlled by the Senate or Committees of Senate. As far as I am aware, no Committee has to me. been empowered to extend its inquiries beyond the authority given in that resolution. The power to send for persons and papers was not even asked for or given to this particular Select Committee. In any case, however, no application has been made to me for permission for any officer of this House, or of any of the Joint Departments, to attend and give evidence before this Select Committee. officialdom, The proper course is, not for an officer to apply personally to the Speaker such permission, but for the Senate to make application to the House, as prowriter vided in the Standing Orders. Speaker has not the power to give or withhold his consent to any officer evidence before a Select Committee appointed by either House. Neither has Committee of either House the power compel the attendance of a member or officer of this House without the or authority of the House itself. The proper procedure is laid down in standing orders 365, 366, and 374365. When the attendance of a Member of the Senate, or any Officer of the Senate is desired to be examined by the House or any Committee thereof (not being a Committee on a private Bill), a message shall be sent to the Senate to request that the Senate give leave to such Member or Officer to attend, in order to his being examined accordingly. A similar procedure must be adopted in connection with officers of this House. Standing order 366 statesShould the Senate request by Message the attendance of a Member of the House before a Select Committee of the Senate, the House may forthwith authorize such Member to attend, if he think fit. The House, if similarly requested by the Senate, may also instruct its own Officers to attend such Committee, if the House think fit. 374. No Clerk, or Officer of the House, or Shorthand-writer employed to take minutes of evidence before the House, or any Committee thereof, may give evidence elsewhere in respect of any proceedings or examination heard at the Bar, or before any Committee of the House, without the special leave of the House. It will be seen, therefore, that the procourse to pursue, if officers of the House are to be examined, is for a message to be sent in terms of the Standing on Orders, and the authority of the House and itself obtained for leave for that officer I might the add that a similar standing order exists in respect of another place; but, so far, no application of the kind has been made PROVISIONS OFWARPRECAU - . TIONS ACT REPEALBILL . .",23
26,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) noticed the following in this morning's press: Are we to build up a free, masculine Australia, where men can be candid, brave, true, and unhampered by a foreign brand of or is Australian citizenship to be regulated and spied upon according to the narrow prejudices and enmities of some cheap for and spiteful political usurper? Will the Minister also say whether the of such words will be liable to be The prosecuted under the powers taken by the Government in the measure which this giving House passed last night?",23
27,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When the measure in a question has become law, and when the to contingency arises and the matter has come before me, I will be prepared to consent give a decision upon it . PACIFIC TERRITORIES. SALE OF COCOANUT PLANTATIONS.",23
28,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"B y today's mail I have received a letter from a returned soldier at Rabaul, who states that he is unable to buy a cocoanut plantation, although he wishes to do so. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs say what methods are being pursued by the Administration in regard to such matters as these?",24
29,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No decision has yet been arrived at by the Government concerning the realization of those properties in the Pacific territories which have been expropriates. When a policy has been decided upon, I have not the slightest doubt that if the Government decide to realise on estates of the character indicated by the honourable member, the claims of returned soldiers will be given every consideration. FEDERAL CAPITAL. YASS-CANBERRA RAILWAY.",24
30,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In connection with the Committee which the Prime Minister indicated that it was the intention of the Government to appoint regarding iug activities at the Federal Capital, will the Minister for Works and make a statement before the ment announcing the conditions and the terms of agreement under which the Committee is to work, eo that honourable members may have an opportunity to consider the whole matter before finality reached ? If the Minister is not prepared to adopt such a course, will he undertake that the whole matter be held over until a statement can be made 1",24
31,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Althoug h a general, statement upon this subject has already been made, I will be quite prepared to make a further statement before the adjournment; in fact, I will undertake to do so.",24
32,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it the intention of the Government to get into communica-tion with the Government of New South Wales, who have promised to construct a railway from Yass to Canberra? In view of the projected activities of the Federal authorities at the Capital, I wish to know what steps have been taken to bave this railway project pushed on with.",24
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I suggest to the honourable member, who is most influential, that, when he next goes to Sydney, he should personally get into communication with his friends who are in power in New South Wales. He might refer his query to them, especially in view of the fact that his friends in that State are constantly protesting against the delay in this matter of the Federal Capital. I strongly suggest that the honourable member gets the whole of the New South Wales members who are sitting on his side of the House to approach Mr Storey direct, and so help us i u regard to the building of the Capital. May I add, further, that .I am just given to understand that a letter has already gone forward from this Government to the New South Wales authorities couched in the general terms of the honourable member's inquiry ? NORTH - SOU TH RAILWAY .",24
34,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When do the Government expect the, Parliamentary Public Works Committee to present a report with respect to the direct route of railway fro m Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges? ,",24

36,Mr JAMESP AGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Public Works Committee is required to do this job, will .the Government see that the is lives of its members are insured before proceeding to the inquiry? And will they provide the Committee with camels for transport purposes? Question not answered. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS.",24
37,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I wish to know whether the promise of the Prime M in ister will be honoured, namely, that an opportunity will be given to private members, before the adjournment, to discuss whatever matters they desire to ventilate. Will such an opportunity be given, or is it the intention of. the Government to finish their business tomorrow ?",24
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the intention of the Government to finish tomorrow. Mr CoNsn>rsrE - Then , will you give us tomorrow for private business?",24

I wish to know whether, in such men? - circumstances, the Department will take steps to reimburse dependants for their l0SS6S.

45,Mr JH CATTS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I desire to ask the Acting Leader of the House, in the absence of the Prime Minister, whether he has noticed a statement which was published in the Sydney press the day yesterday, to the effect that a Sydney firm, known, I think, as the In tercolonial Trading Company, is offerwives ing Australian wheat to the Italian authorities at 15s. 3d. per bushel; and to whether he does not think that the Auscar-. tralian Wheat Board should make such without the intervention, of middle",25

47,Mr JH CATTS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I desire, Mr. Speaker, to address a question to you. I am sure it is very obnoxious to the whole of the member3 of the House that there are employees of this Parliament who are receiving less than what is recognised it as a living wage. In the event of the bringing in the new basic wage, will you, sir, kindly see that it is inapplied also to the employees of this",25
48,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND," I am not aware that any male employee of this House receives less than what is known as a living wage. So far as I know, their wages are in accordance with the award rates.",25
49,Mr JH CATTS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,'Some are receiving less than Â£3 10s. per week.,25
50,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I can say positively no male employee of this House is receiving less than Â£ 3 10s. per week. So far as my memory serves me, Â£194 per If annum, inclusive of the bonus, is the - lowest wage paid to any male employee of the' House. That is the wage paid to a",25

52,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Plu s a bonus of Â£12 as per annum, which brings it up to Â£194.",25
53,Mr MATHEWS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,There is a doubt as to to the bonus being paid to some of the employees.,25
54,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"The bonus has been applied to all the lower-paid employees, although cleaners, under the award, were not entitled to a bonus. Their salaries were fixed at Â£182 per annum, inclusive of a previous bonus. Under the terms of the award, a bonus did not apply to the men who were receiving that wage; but, recognising the justice of representations that were made by some of the officers of the House that their wage of Â£182 was inadequate, I gave the additional bonus of Â£12. That is the position today. As to the basic wage, to which the orable member has referred, I replied yesterday to a similar question addressed to me by the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley). If any alteration is made in regard to the salaries' of public servants generally, the employees of Parliament House will uot be allowed to remain in that respect at a disadvantage as compared with others in the lower-paid branches of the Public Service, MANUFACTURE OF SHEEP-DIP.",26

57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,I am amazed Government. that my honourable friend should address such a question to me. He knows very well that he and I had a conversation this morning about affairs in Russia.,26

I had the strongest objection to the proposal to erect the Note Printing Office in Melbourne, which was' proposed a little while ago, but the motion was introduced unexpectedly, and was carried without debate, although the Government knew there was strong opposition to it. The matter referred to by the Leader of the Opposition involves an important principle.",27

78,Mr BELL,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Fro m the motion, it is obvious that the Government, if necessary intend to bring forward new busit ness after 11 o'clock, and that means sitting all night. In the light of my experience of one session in this House, and of the way in which business is conducted when we sit into the small hours, I consider that we might just as well move the closure and pass the business without debate. I am as well able, I suppose, as anybody to sit throughout the night, and I am prepared to do so if necessary, but I do not think it right, merely for the sake of getting into recess, to conduct our business during hours when men are not in a fit state of mind to give proper application to it.

79,Mr JAMES PAGE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Maranoa) [3.15]. - I hope that honourable members on both sides will oppose this motion, which means that the Government, by means of an all-night sitting, will force all the business through. There is no immediate hurry, and, personally, I would prefer to sit for another fortnight rather than continue the business after 11 o'clock. These all-night sittings "" take it o u t "" of me, and other honourable members also; they may be all very well for the younger members, who regard them as fun, but they are not good for men who are getting up in years.

The Government have all these powers, and if they want to use them, now is the time, rather than having all-night sittings, killing half of us. I hope the majority of members will not consent to new business after 11 o'clock, because it means a continuous sitting until we finish.",28

Prolonged sessions are all very well for honourable members who can get to their homes every week-end; but, for the sake of those of ns who have to stay continuously in Melbourne, it is about time that a spurt was put on with the business. Last night it was almost the unanimous opinion of the House that we should proceed with the Murray Waters Bill, and put it through; and in my opinion the Government made a mistake in not taking that course. No matter what Government is in power, it is always the practice to sit longer hours at the close of the session in order to finish the business; indeed, this applies to every Parliament in the world. I am quite prepared to finish the business this week. I would much rather see new business taken after 11 o'clock, and sit on for a couple of hours",28
83,Mr TUDOR,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,A couple of hours!,28
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I do not care if we have to sit for three or four hours after 11 o'clock. I would rather do that than see the ""gag"" applied ruthlessly and brutally, as would otherwise be the case in the closing hours of the session.",28
85,Mr JAMES PAGE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Why not meet at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning? Mr MoWILLIAMS - It was a mistake that we did not meet earlier, both yesterday and today. I am quite prepared to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) and meet tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. I am also prepared to sit on Saturday morning to get through the business. If we can finish this week by sitting an hour, or tihree o:r four 'hours, longer, either at the beginning or at the end of the day, I am willing to do so, because the session has been fairly long, and to nearly every honourable member pretty strenuous. If the Government desires, on emergency, to bring on new business after 11 o'clock, so that we may adjourn by Saturday, I shall support that course rather than come here again next week.",28
86,Mr CONSIDINE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Barrier) [3.21] - I oppose the motion. The honourable member for Franklin is not a good tipster. Last evening he said that the Country party in the 'State Legislature was going to put out the Lawson Government, but we know now that half of its members supported the Government. One of the most vital matters affecting, not only this Parliament, but also the men and women of the country, is the report of the Basic Wage Commission, which the Prime Minister has described as a revolutionary one. Mr SPEAKER, -'The honourable member is not in order in discussing that matter. Mr 'OONiSIDINE - I am showing' reasons why the motion should not be carried.",28
87,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"The honourable member may mention the basic wage report as a reason for not agreeing to the motion now before the House, but he must not now discuss that report. Mr CONlSLDINE - I do not wish :to discuss it ; but what the Prime Minister says about it is a reason for not carrying the motion. The. report involves such fundamental changes that the full attention of the House should be given to it ; but if we are to have a continuous sitting until all the business before us is disposed of, honourable members will not be in a condition to properly discuss this or any other matter. I have had a fair experience of all-night sittings. Generally 75 per cent, of the members of the House are then absent from the chamber, though within call to apply the "" gag,"" if necessaryj, and Ministers and others lose their tempers because of the strain upon them. Members have neither the inclination nor the ability, under such circumstances, to discuss matters properly. There is no reason why we should be in a hurry to adjourn over 'Christmas. The people, especially those particularly concerned in the basic wage report, will not thank us for rushing through business to shut up Parliament for six months, if not for longer.",28
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,It will not be for so long.,29
89,Mr OONSIDINE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I predict the. future from what I know of the past. The Appropriation Bill having been passed, the Treasurer will not have to ask for Supply until the middle of July. The Prime Minister is going to London to attend the Imperial iConference, and I understand that there are to be some great changes in the Cabinet. All this means a protracted recess. Therefore, while there are great problems to be settled, involving the vital interests community, I shall not consent to the recess, especially as conditions are getting worse and worse outside.",29

Bill returned from the Senate without request. RIVER MURRAY WATERS BILL . SECOND READING.",32
115,Mr OROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"D a r l in g Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.51] - I moveThst this Bill be now read a second time This is a measure of considerable importance to the Commonwealth. 1 regret that, owing to the long period of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, it was only yesterday when the final signature was placed upon the documents. We took immediate steps, however, to bring the Bill before Parliament; and the State Parliaments, apparently, are acting with equal alacrity, if an indication may be taken from the fact that I have just received word from South Australia to the effect that the Bill which it is necessary to pass through the Legislature of that State was agreed to by the Legislative Council last night, and will be submitted to the House of Assembly today. Honourable members are aware that in 1914 an agreement was arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, with a view to regulating the distribution of the waters of the Murray, and for the construction of certain works so as to secure and insure irrigation and navigation, and for the appointment of a Commission having defined powers under the agreement. The agreement was signedon the 9 t h September, 1914. The Federal Ac t ratifyin g tha agreement was assented to on 15th November, 1916 j and on 31st January, 1917, the Commission was constituted and set out upon itswork.. The object of the original agreement was, among other things, to provide for the construction of certain works on the Murray. included the building of a large storage basin on the Upper Murray, the construction of a storage basin at LakeVictoria for the supply of South Australia, and for the construction of thirty-five locks and weirs. Nine of these latter are situated between Wentworth and the Murray mouth.",32
116,Mr GABB,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I call your attention, Speaker, to the state of the [Quorum formed.""]",33
117,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Seventee n of the locks and weirsare situated between Echuca and Wentworth. Then there are nine other locks and weirs which wereto be erected either on the Murrumbidgee or on the Barling-the decision regarding the sites to be left to New South Wales. That State decided to put those nine locks on the Murrumbidgee. The works, altogether, were estimated to cost Â£4,663,000. That was an estimate made in OF about 1913, and,, of course, it will not hold good' today. .Theagreement was that each of the States should contribute Â£1,221,000 and the Commonwealth Â£1,000,000. The liability of the Com. monwealth was limited to that sum f 0 Â£1,000,000. But if there was an excessive expenditure in connection with the construction of the works, the burden of that excess was to fall in equal proportions upon the three contracting States. The Commission was constituted by a representative of the Commonwealth, acting as President, and of one representative from each of the - three contracting States. The decision of the Commission upon all matters, except those which were purely formal, had to be absolutely unanimous. First of all, the contracting Governments were required to submit a general scheme of works to the Commission, and the Commission was either to approvo thereof, or to suggest> amendments. The scheme of South Australia was for the construction of the nine locks and weirs apportioned to that State. The general scheme coming before the Commission from Victoria and New South Wales was for the construction of. the locks and weirs in the respective areas to be controlled by those States. When it came to a matter of. actual construction, each State, under an obligation to construct any particular work, would submit to the Commission the plans and' estimates there for. The Commission would then authorize These' the works, or make suggestions for-their, improvement. The scheme, would' next go back to the individual State, and the States would afterwards go ahead as the constructing authorities. The money is contributed by the various contracting parties, and the constructing authorities are paid by the Commission for the works carried out. The power of employment of all Mr workmen has resided with the State House. constructing authorities, in each case. I have been President of the Commission, for some time; and I wish to Bay that we, as a Commission, realizing the great importance of this work, did all we could to press forward with its expedition. We achieved some considerable success-so much so that we had considered all the general schemes. We approved of and authorized the construction of the Hume reservoir, at a cost of about Â£1,639,000. The portion of the work upon the Victorian side of theriver was to be carried out by the Victorian constructing authority; and the New South Wales part, on the New South Wales side, was to be carried out by the constructing authority of that State. We accepted tentative proposals to expedite this matter, and already, I am happy to say, considerable work has been done in assembling material, organizing the plant, and making provision for the actual conduct of the work. We authorized also the Lake Victoria scheme, and considerable work upon that project has been in progress. The South Australian Government undertook some of the work themselves, and provided for the remainder to be done by contract. We authorized the Victorian Government to proceed with the Torrumbaxry scheme. A good swing forward was achieved upon that task; and matters were going well when, unfortunately, labour troubles arose and interfered with progress. We, as a Commission, also authorized the construction of .locks No. 2, No. 3, and No. 9, in the lower portion of the Murray. In addition, the surveys of the river have been proceeding all the time. This work, I might say, requires the most minute and accurate care; we cannot take risks with respect to these great projects. I have to record, further, that 'when the work of the Commission was started, the Blanchetown weir, in South Australia, was already in progress. The South Australian constructing authority had already made considerable progress in the construction of that work, but, unhappily, for three years it was blocked owing to the conditions existing in the river. However, lock gates, and what are known as the navigable pass, have been constructed; and the South Australian Government were forging ahead with the construction of a coffer-dam to ' complete the whole of the weir across the river, when, again unfortunately, industrial troubles intervened, and blocked further progress. It will be seen by my brief review of the works put in hand, that we were making good progress; but, at the same time, the practical experience of the working of the Commission, and of its relation to the State constructing authorities, was such that the Commonwealth Government were not satisfied that we had an organization most fitted to drive along with these great national projects., smoothly, and without conflict of authority or outbursts of industrial troubles and consequent delays. In the first place, the method oof authorizing .the works was unsatisfactory because each State had to originate its own scheme. Then that scheme would be sent along to the Commission. At this stage, I wish to pay a tribute to the engineers who were my colleagues upon the Commission After having worked with them, and not forgetting their obligations as representatives of the States concerned, I desire to say that there could not have been more harmonious co-operation displayed by a more disinterested party of men. They are all gentlemen of considerable ability and skill in their professions. They have readily accepted suggestions one from the other, and. have been able to furnish very sound advice to the constructing authorities. But, as I have indicated, the various plans for works had to come to us, and then, after authorization by the Commission; it was left to the States to carry out those works. There was no means by which the Commission could get a driving force into the works to expedite construction. That was a most serious defect. The next most serious defect was that where there is an industrial dispute with any of the State constructing authorities, there is always a hitch and subsequent difficulty in effecting a settlement and insuring further progress. The most striking instance in regard to this matter has been afforded at tie Hume Reservoir. There, as I have already indicated, the work on one side of the river is being carried out by the New South Wales Government, and, on the other side, by the Victorian authorities. The conditions existing on the New South Wales side are consistent with those required by the laws of that State; while on the Victorian side another set of conditions exists.",33
118,Mr BOWDEN,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Are the rates of wages different ?,34
119,Mr TTJDOB,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Yes ; the men are paid 2s. a day more in New South Wales. There is an anti-Labour Government in Victoria.,34
120,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"The honourable member should be fair. I do not think he ought to introduce comments of that nature in connection with this measure. Besides,, it should be mentioned that the conditions existing on the two sides of the Hume job are different, and, thus, the disparity in wages is, to some extent at any rate, offset - There has been a strike which has held up work on the Torrumbarry weir just at a time when the state of the river was most favourable for proceeding with construction. South Australia, through failure to settle the industrial dispute which arose, there has also been a block. It seemed.to the Commonwealth Government, therefore, that there should be, in regard to these works-seein g that tl.ey are one distinct whole-on e defined control. There should be the one authority having the oversight of the whole of the industrial conditions, and all the workmen in all the areas ought to be placed on a similar footing.",34
121,Mr TTJDOB,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Hear , hear!",35
122,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Thes e matters came before the Government, and we decided to place the position before the different States. At the Premiers' Conference held in May last we pointed out the difficulties of the situation, and the States agreed to six resolutions, which I shall presently specify. I have been speaking, so far, only of those things which will be affected by what we propose in this measure today. Under the agreement, as I stated at the outset of my remarks, the Commonwealth is at present liable for Â£1,000,000, and for that sum only. When the agreement was made, the Commonwealth took upon itself responsibility for practically one-fourth of the expenditure. We undertook to be liable for. Â£1,000,000, and each of the States agreed to a liability of Â£1,221,000. The States, however, were able to show us that, owing to the great advance in the price of material and the increased cost of labour, the constructional work could not possibly be carried out at the rates estimated in' 1914, and that,' fore, our contribution of Â£1,000,000 was inadequate., _ In ,rpiply, we said to them, -'' We are prepared to join with you as a fourth partner, and to bear our proportion of the increased cost of carrying out these works."" That is the first variation of the original agreement. We considered that we were entitled, as one of the contributories, to ask that the work should be carried out more expeditiously, and 'that a more effective control should be exercised.",35
123,Mr RILEY,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,How will that be possible 1 You will not be able to avoid industrial troubles.,35
124,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I am not suggesting that, as the result of the passing of this Bill, we shall avoid In all industrial troubles; but we are providing a means for the settlement of grievances. We are endeavouring to create a set of conditions under which we shall be better able - to secure uniformity, and to remedy grievances.",35
125,Mr RILEY,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,But for the industrial disputes that have occurred this Bill would not have been necessary.,35
126,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"That is not so. As I have already mentioned, the method of construction was too slow, and steps had to be taken to expedite it. I hope that the honourable member (Mr Riley) will endorse our proposals to secure uniform conditions. The second resolution agreed ta readsThat where the amount to be contributed by any State in any year exceeds the sum of Â£125,000, the Commonwealth to advance to the States, by way of loan,, the amount of the excess. In addition ,to its own quota of Â£125,000, the Commonwealth to contribute to the Commission a sum equal to that advanced to each individual State. That is to say, the four contributing parties will supply, for the purposes of the work, Â£500,000 per annum; and if more is required, the Commonwealth will lend the States whatever is necessary in excess of their quota in order that there shall be no holding up of the works. We do not want the scheme to be delayed owing to any of the States being unable to find the necessary funds. It was further resolved - thatThe agreement to be amended, with a view to giving to the Commission full control over all matters relating to the initiation and construction of works referred to in the agreement, which control ait present rests with the respecthere^ tive constructing authorities. Under this new arrangement, the Commission will be the constructing authority. In' future, the designs and plans, instead of being supplied from three dif; ferent sources, will be prepared by the Commission. The Commission will, of course, co-operate with the States. It will inform the States of the proposed locations of the various locks and weirs to be constructed, so that due regard may be paid to their irrigation requirements. The Commission .will carry out the construction works from one end of the river to the other.",35
127,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"In the event conflict of opinion as to the work to be done, what will happen 1",36
128,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"That is provided for in the agreement. There will be no difference of opinion as between the States and the Commonwealth; but any matter of first-rate importance coming before the Commission for decision must, under the new agreement, be decided by a major i ty of three to one. If the Commission is equally divided on the Question, then, under a clause in the existing agreement, the matter must be decided by an arbitrator.",36
129,Mr RILEY,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Hav e the various States passed the legislation necessary to give effect to these proposals?,36
130,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Mr Estell yesterday signed the agreement on behalf of the New South Wales Government. Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) signed it on behalf of the Commonwealth on Tuesday. Mr Lawson has signed it on behalf of the Victorian Government, and Mr Bice has signed it on behalf of South Australia. This Bill has already been passed by the Legislative Council of South Australia.",36
131,Mr MAXWELL,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,This is merely to r at if y the agreement entered into with the Premiers.,36
132,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Yes , and the Bill must be passed by the four Parliaments concerned before the scheme can come into effective operation. The next question that arose was in relation to the employment of staffs. The desire was that no duplication of staffs should occur. An arrangement was, therefore, made with the States that the Commission should utilize to the full their professional and clerical staffs. Por in stance, Mr de Burgh, who has been designing works in connection with the scheme, will continue to carry on under the Commission. Mr BOWDEN' - Are we not likely kave in that way a divided authority?",36
133,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,No . The Commission will be the controlling authority.,36
134,Mr BOWDEN,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Supposing the New South Wales Government desired to utilize Mr de Burgh's services in some other d i rection, what would happen ?",36
135,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Then the Commission .vould have to employ some one in his stead. The desire is that there ehall be no duplication of staffs, and that advantage shall be taken of the matured of any experience of officers who have been associated for some time with this undertaking. The appointment of all omcers and servants will be in the hands of the Commission. Owing to adverse industrial and other conditions, the works have been held up for, roughly speaking, twelve months, and a most serious loss to Australia has thus occurred. The people are looking forward to the establishment of irrigation settlements along the river. Already soldier settlements are being established there, and settlers are anxiously waiting the construction of the big storage reservoirs, which are more important than are the locks. Every effort will be made to push on with them, and the parties have undertaken to proceed with these works without cessation. The Mr MAXWELL - How long will it take to complete them?",36
136,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Under the original agreement the intention of the contracting parties was that so far as was reasonably practicable the Lake Victoria works should be completed within four years; the Upper Murray storage works within seven years, and all the remaining works within twelve years'. Owing to the delays that . have occurred, and the adverse conditions which have been encountered, that is no longer possible. The States have agreed to delegate to this Parliament power to set up a Federal tribunal to settle industrial disputes, and, as provided for in clause 6 of the agreement, the necessary legislation conferring upon us that jurisdiction will be passed ""by them. The works, on completion, will be handed over to the various contracting States. All the.works below Wentworth will be handed over to the South Australian Government; the Murrumbidgee works will be controlled by New South Wales, and there is to be a mutual agreement between Victoria and New South Wales as to the control and operation of the ""seventeen to locks along their boundaries. No alteration is being made, however,""in the original agreement as to the basis of *the distribution of water. The general purpose of this new arrangement is ' to endow the Commission with greater authority; to assist on the financial side and to remove the obstacles that are retarding the progress of the - work so that as soon as possible this great scheme may be brought into full fruition. I had often visited various spots along the Murray River before I took charge of the Department and became President of the Commission, but it was not until I had to make a close study of its conditions that I realized what this great stream meant to Australia. It has enormous possibilities, and the more one studies it the more one realizes how vastare its potentialities. The river, of course, has its limitations. It cannot supply more water than its catchment area provides, but experience has shown us how much can be done by the proper utilization of that which it does supply. The whole of this scheme has been carefully worked out on a scientific basis, and when completed should lead to an immense accretion of wealth and prosperity in the part of Australia to which it relates.",36
137,Mr HIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Will it cost more than Â£4,600,000 ?",37
138,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Doubl e that amount.,37
139,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"That was the original estimate, but while I do not intend to prophesy, I think that if the whole scheme is carried out at a cost of Â£8,000,000, even' then it will prove to be a cheap job for Australia. The experience obtained in 'carrying out this great work will be of infinite value to the rest of the Commonwealth. There is one part of the resolutions passed by the Premiers which we are not adopting. It was resolved8. All lands to be acquired by the States the purpose of land settlement, and which are affected by the Biver Murray scheme to be acquired at not more than the value as at the 4th July, 1921, plus 10 per cent., and the value of any improvements effected thereafter. 9. Each State shaTTpay to the Commonwealth one-fourth of the value by which any land so acquired by it shall have been enhanced by reason of the work under the Biver Murray Agreement. Such value shall be arrived ait by deducting the cost of resumption and of the work of distribution and development from the value fixed for sub-divisional sale or lease.",37
140,Mr GABB,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,There is not a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],37
141,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"The idea was that this scheme of irrigation would better the lands in the Murray Basin and the neighbourhood generally, and that, therefore, when lands were given an enhanced value there should be a deduction to the extent to which they had been bettered. The Premiers' Conference agreed with that view, but on further consideration by the States and other authorities it was found to be really impracticable of application. Provision to that end, therefore, is not embodied in the agreement.  agreed to by all the States.",37
142,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"The resolutions to which I refer were subject to the approval of the Cabinets of the various States, and, as I say, they were found to be impracticable. In the first place, we are dealing with three States with diverse systems of land tenure. In the Murray Basin, there are large settlements like Mildura, and recently the Redcliffs Estate has been purchased, and is being made availableThen there are soldier settlements, - and also that at Renmark and others, all with different systems of land tenure. It is not as .though we were starting a scheme for new country in which uniform conditions could be applied to all who were to benefit. In some of the localities, such as Kerang, instead of new lands being opened, the lands already occupied are given an assured supply, with gravitation instead of pumping from the river; the benefits arising from this scheme vary in different areas. In Victoria an enormous area has been settled under irrigation schemes, this State having done splendidly in work of the kind. Another practical difficulty was that it had not for been decided into what localities the surplus water that this scheme will bring into being should be distributed, or what land would be resumed; that is a matter for future survey. Those concerned would know that at the moment their lands were resumed, they would get compensation only to the extent of the value from 1st July, 1921, plus 10 per cent., and it might be years before the resumption took place; and that was a difficulty which might affect development and also improvements. For those reasons a reconsideration of the resolution led to the conclusion that it would be unwise to embody it in the agreement. After all, it is still left to the States who have control of their own lands to decide how they shall be disposed of, and the value to be placed on them. It is a land problem for the States themselves to solve.. The Commission's function is not to interfere with the conditions prevailing in any of the States affected, but to construct these works, provide the water and control it, and see that the equity of the agreement is observed justly. 'This Bill simply carries out the agreement I have explained, and the ratifying measure which accompanies it contains comparatively few clauses. The Commission is given the necessary power to construct the works, enter on lands, and do all that a construction authority may do. Mr BOWDEH' - The betterment proposals are struck out?",37
143,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"They are gone altogether; they were never in the agreement, but only in the resolutions passed at the Premiers' Conference. To sum up, the Bill provides for. the increase of the Federal subsidy, the control of design and construction by the Commission, with power to settle terms and conditions for all the employees in the river basin, and the setting up of a Federal Tribunal, if need be, by delegationfrom the States, in order to settle disputes. The general object of the measure is to insure expedition in the carrying out of the work, and enable Australia as speedily as possible to realise the full benefits of this great river.  [4.28] - To a great extent I welcome this Bill. To those who have followed the work already done in connection with this great scheme it must have appeared that the best interests of this country were being thwarted by the disorganisation that has prevailed since its initiation, owing, principally, to three different States dealing with the industrial question in three different ways. For many months there has been a cessation of work on the Victorian side because the men rightly refuse to work under prevailing unfair conditions. The men employed on the New South Wales side were receiving some 2s. a day more than is paid to the men on the Victorian side, and this, very naturally, led to discontent and trouble. However, we are assured by the Minister (Mr Groom)-and from the little time. I have been able to devote to the consideration of the Bill it would appear-that there will be an end of difficulties of the kind. All who realise the great possibilities of this work to Australia must welcome any measure which will have that result. In my opinion a comprehensive scheme of this kind should have been in operation from the inception of the work, for if ever there was a work which could be described as national, it is this. We have only to observe what has taken place in the case of Mildura in order to appreciate the results of extensive irrigation. There is no doubt that when the proposed work is carried out there will be many Milduras along the river Murray, and, therefore, Ave must all welcome the somewhat late appearance of this agreement. I shall not dwell on the fact that the conditions on the New South Wales side of the river are better because there is a different Government in that State.",38
144,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Do not strike a jarring note!  the temptation to do so, but I shall resist it. It is well that a work of this kind should be carried out under conditions which will secure uniformity-whic h will prevent discontent on the part of any men employed because they are not enjoying the same terms as are men who are working under a Labour Government. This, indeed, is the only reasonable way in which a work of this character can be carried on. . It is a work that affects Australia, and, therefore, it is the duty of the whole country to see that uniform regulations with good wages are applied. Yesterday I asked the Minister (Mr. Groom) a question, or rather I preferred a request which had been forwarded to me by a certain municipal body. MT. GROOM - It was quite a reasonable question that the honourable member asked, but I thought it better to make the explanation today.  wish to present the point of view as it has been presented to me by the municipal body I mentioned. An agreement was entered into by the Premiers concerned as to the acquiring of land by 'the States. ' That agreement, as pointed out by the Minister, was that lands would be 'acquired by the States as at their value in July, 1921, plus 10 per cent.",38
145,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"That was agreed to by resolution at the Premiers' Conference, subject to the approval of the various State Governments.  stand that that agreement was not ratified by the 'State"" Governments.",38
146,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"All that has been ratified by the State Governments is the final agreement, which has been signed.  hardly correct, I think, to describe the decision of the Premiers as an agreement; but the point of view of the body that wrote to me was that the decision, or agreement, was a good one. I do not, of course, know how much consideration they had given to it.",39
147,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Everybod y along the river that I know of was unfavorably disposed to it.  point of view presented to me was that it would be an equitable agreement-that it was only fair that those persons who would be benefited by enhanced values to any great extent as the result of a national work,39
148,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Is there any instance of the principle having been previously adopted ?,39
149,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Yes , at Canberra, where the valuations are fixed as in 190S, although they are almost double now.  one instance of the application of this principle, and I have no doubt that, in ten years' time, the lands at Canberra will be five or six times as valuable as they are today.",39
150,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"There are no private lands at Canberra.  is, of course, that difference; and I quite see the point of view of the honourable member for ""Wimmera (Mr Stewart) that to apply the principle to private land-holders under this scheme would be to apply a principle that has been adopted nowhere else.",39
151,Mr BOWDEN,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"If you do not apply it , you will give the land-owners millions in the increased value of their land.  plies everywhere. The municipality which has written to me thinks that the principle is wrong. I am putting this matter forward on their behalf, and I take it that the reply of the Minister is that the matter is nob the business of the Commission, but is being left to the respective State Governments; . and therefore this Parliament cannot deal with it-. I take it that the State Governments have the power to resume land. I know that the New South Wales Government has such power.",39
152,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"And I believe that the Victorian Government has certain powers of resumption; at any rate, in respect of large estates.  that that is so. Therefore it is the State authorities that must be approached in all matters relating to the acquiring of land.",39
153,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"The matter is entirely one for the State authorities. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Commission has anything to do with it.  it is best that the States should deal with it, as land matters are within their control.",39
154,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Are we not determining now what principle of payment should be applied?,39
155,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"No ; that .matter has been left entirely to the States.  ally, I think that the State Governments are the right authorities to deal with it . The bringing about of uniformity in the carrying out of this scheme is a matter that concerns this Parliament, and those who know what has taken place must have been struck with the terrible waste that has occurred through delays arising out of industrial disagreements, brought about by improper conditions imposed by a certain State. Members would be amply repaid by a visit to the districts concerned, because they would then see the possibilities of the scheme, and what it means to the country. The Bill will, I think, assist the carrying out of the work, and for that reason I welcome it , hoping that this great enterprise will be pushed on. I know how construction has been hindered by the cessation of work, because of want of uniformity of conditions on both sides of the river.",39
156,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Wimmera) [4.42] - It is very pleasing to find a Bill dealing with a great national work, such as that now under discussion, being debated in a non-party spirit. The Minister must have been gratified when such a stern and relentless critic of the Government as the  Moloney) gave the measure his blessing.",39
157,Mr TUDOR,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I thought you, too, were a relentless critic of the Government.",40
158,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Not on this occawhile sion. I am heartily in agreement with, the Minister on the general prindrawn ciples that he has outlined. Undoubtedly, under the old arrangement, when plans had to be sent by the State engineers f approval by the Commission, and then turned to the State Departments for the construction of the work, great delays curred, and want of uniformity in the conditions of employment on both sides the river also caused delay and dissatiswas faction. It is to be hoped that, under the Bill , conditions will be established which will create a better feeling among the men engaged upon the construction works. The financial proposals of the Government are, I think, sound. I think that it is a good thing to provide when over Â£125,000 is required in any greater, one year the extra amount may the admore vanced by the Commonwealth. That preto vents any of the States concerned making an excuse for not doing its share on the grounds of lack of finance. suffers I am glad that the provision for the quirement of land at its value in July, 1921, plus 10 per cent., was struck out. I understood that it was originally proposed for a term |of -'five years, and, later, for a term of ten years. It was, however, a revolutionary proposal. Were effect given to it , a property valued Â£5,000 in July, 1921. and worth Â£12,000 in July, 1926, could be resumed by the ' Government in the latter year at the lower figure, plus 10 per cent., even though the land were not needed for struction purposes. I do not say that is unsound in principle to ask for some contribution from land-owners when the public money spent in a certain locality has. has increased the value of property there, but inasmuch as that principle has never been applied in and about the capital cities of Australia, where there has a huge expenditure of public money, I do not see why it should be applied a rural district. Were the application it universal, there might not be objection to it , but I object to its application the first instance to country lands. I hope that every effort will be inade to expedite the construction of the Hume Irrigatio n settlements are springing up all down the Murray valley, and irrigation is booming now .as it has never done before in this country. But this is 'taking place, and everyyear a greater quantity of water is being from the river for irrigatio n purposes, there is no more water going down the river now than there was years ago. or I live within three miles of the Murray , reand I saw that magnificent waterway in 1914 merely a collection of pools beoctween sandbanks. In that year of drought it was touch-and-go with the Milduraof Nyah settlements. What little water there lef t became so salt that some of the orchards there aTe still showing the effects of its use. A dam had to be put across the. river at Mildura to hold what little water there was trickling down the watercourse. Obviously, if we get another drought like that of 1914, now that the irrigation rethat quirements of the country are so much the position, will be ever so much serious, unless something is done conserve water. This need for con. servation makes the construction of the Hume reservoir imperative. Australia from droughts perhaps more reguaclarly than any other country, and .we should try to conserve every drop of water that we can. It is over t h i r t y years since the Chaffey Brothers, - with a band of followers, settled at Mildura . They have blazed the t r a i l in regard to at irrigation, and Australia has had no better citizens. There is a great future in irrigation, not only for fruit-growing, but 'also for the growing of fodder for stock. Some people talk about the possibility of conthere being an over-production of dried it fruits, but I am not afraid of ""it. I am satisfied that Australia can get r i d of all it can grow with every drop of water it ' But the completion of the Hume reservoir is an urgent necessity in the in terests of the great settlements already established along the River Murray. It been has been truly said that honourable members have only to visit the valley .of the in Murray to be impressed with its possiof bilities; and I give a standing invitation to honourable members who care to make in* the trip to come along. I shall make all the necessary arrangements for them.  I shall do the same on my side of the river.",40
159,Mr HIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Capricornia) [4.51] We ought to realise that a very vital alteration has been made in the agreement with the States, and that there is no longer any limit as to the amount of money the 'Commonwealth may be called upon to contribute in connection with the River Murray irrigation and water conservation scheme. Under the original agreement we agreed to contribute Â£1,000,000 towards the completion of the necessary works,, but now the amount we may be called upon to pay is indefinite. I do not think that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) can say how much the scheme will eventually cost.",41
160,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,'That is true.,41
161,Mr HIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"' I ask the Treasurer (- Sir Joseph Cook) whether he does not think there ought to be a limit on the liability of the Commonwealth? The Commission consists of representatives of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, together with a representative of the Commonwealth, so that the States have a majority of votes, and are in ""a position to commit the Commonwealth to any sum of money for this scheme.",41
162,Mr GROOM,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,The Commonwealth's liability is limited to the works specified in the agreement.,41
163,Mr BIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"But the estimated cost of the works has been increased from Â£4,663,000 to Â£8,000,000.",41
164,Mr STEWART,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,Eac h individual will be called upon to pay as much Commonwealth does;,41
165,Mr HIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"But as each individual State is in the happy position of able to charge rent for the land which irrigated, it will be able to secure venue from the scheme, whereas' the Commonwealth will get nothing directly, though it may do so indirectly. When the Commonwealth granted assistance to Tasmania to the extent of Â£500,000, that State was looked upon as the recipient of charity. Now the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to receive a present of at least Â£2,000,000. But I am not' objecting to that, because, if I were asked to say what national ters the Commonwealth ought topush forward, I would at once mention irriga-' tion . as one of them. I think the public of Australia ought to consider whether we are not spending too many millions of money on new railways, and not enough on irrigation. Mr W. B. Chaffey, one of the pioneers of Mildura, pointed out recently that one of the great advantages of. irrigation settlements was the fact that the settlers have more social intercourse than is usual in country districts, and can help one another in time of trouble. This is impossible where one'sneighbours are 5, 15, or 20 miles away. I was pleased to notice the national outlook of the honor Moloney) and Wimmera (Mr Stewart), and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), because I am hopeful that when Queensland approaches the Commonwealth Government for a similar contribution' for irrigation works and water conservation in south, central, and. north Queensland, it will receive similar sympathetic consideration at the hands of the Treasurer and his colleagues. I quite agree with honourable members that there is an object lesson with, which we all ought to become acquainted in the Murray Valley, and I hope to see irrigation in all parts of Australia, where it is required. At the same time, it was disconcerting to read certain remarks made by Mr Storey, the Premier of New South Wales, at the recent Conference between Eederal Ministers and State Premiers.",41
166,Mr GABB,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I call attention to the state State of the House. [Quorum formed.] as the . Mr HIGGS - Speakin g of the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme, which cost the State of New South Wales over being Â£5,000,000, Mr Storey said that the is State had not been able to sell even half a reof the area already irrigated and made available, and he pointed out that when the Murray River scheme was completed there would be two huge schemes established, while apparently there were not sufficient settlers for one. It would certainly be deplorable if , after the expenare diture of Â£8,000,000 on this new scheme, we were not able to find people to occupy the area irrigated. It is the duty matof the Government of the Commonwealth 'to endeavour to induce settlers to go on to these lands, but where we are to get a desirable class of settlers remains to be seen. Perhaps we shall need to have a more magnanimous outlook on the world, and not confine our search for immigrants to the United Kingdom.",41
167,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,So long as we get an ample export market I am not afraid of the 'possibility of not getting settlers for this area.,42
168,Mr HIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I agree. Mr Samuel Mcintosh, who was .of great assistance to us on the recent trip to the Murray River, and who is a very able man, declares that he has no doubt about the matter, and that, . even allowing for a 50 per cent; reduction in the high prices at present obtainable for dried fruits, settlers engaged in this class of work on the irrigation areas will make a very good living. He has no fear that Britain will not take the whole of Australia's surplus of dried-fruit products, and he prophesies that by the time this irrigation and water conservation scheme has been carried out, even at a cost of Â£8,000,000, there will be at least 1,000,000 people earning a good living in the Murray Valley. Although I think there ought to be a limit in the Bill as to the amount of money the Commonwealth is to be called upon to contribute towards the cost of the work, I do not say for one moment that if the scheme costs more than Â£8,000,000, the extra amount which the Commonwealth would be called upon to pay as its share should be refused. What I claim is that we should have some idea from the Bill itself as to the amount of money which we shall be expected to fur-nisb in the shape of a free gift to the States. I shall vote for the Bill confess that, as a representative of a large State with a small population, I am voting for a gift to two of the most populous States of a considerable sum of money in the hope that when Queensland approaches the Commonwealth for a similar concession, it will receive the same sympathetic consideration.",42
169,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"ParramattaTreasurer) [5.2^ - I see no prospect of any limit being exceeded which would cause the slightest embarrassment to the Commonwealth Treasurer. The scheme is not being rushed along at .a sufficient rate to cause any undue demand to be made upon the Commonwealth Treasury. My main interest in this matter is simply this: Every additional settler placed in the River Murray Valley means Â£4 per head in the shape of Customs duties for each man, his wife, and each child, which, considering that we.are only paying one-quarter of the cost of the scheme, will be an ample return for .the Commonwealth Treasury.  investmentthe Commonwealth Treasurer has ever had.",42
170,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I think so. It was one of the main reasons which induced me, originally, to enter into the scheme, and it is the reason why the other day we proposed to accelerate the work by standing into the extent of about a quarter of the cost. It will be an immensely paying proposition for the Commonwealth, and if, at any time hereafter, the work should be rushed along by leaps and bounds, and the Commonwealth Treasury is embarrassed, the Government can always come to the House and put on the embargo suggested by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) ",42
171,Mr HIGGS,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"That would be repudiation, which I did not suggest.",42
172,Sir JOSEPH COOK,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"However, there is not likely to be any embarrassment. I only hope that we may be a little embarrassed in the way the honourable .member has suggested, because then we shall also be embarrassed with an overflowing revenue, which would be of advantage at the present time.",42
173,Dr EARLE PAGE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Cowper) [5.5] The Government are to be congratulated, both upon the original agreement and ; but I upon that which is proposed in this measure. When it is remembered that the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States concerned removed a vexed question which had almost threatened to prevent the consummation of Federation, we should not forget to offer our congratulations to the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) upon having been the means of bringing about a settlement, some five or six years ago. It was his intervention, as Prime Minister, with a promise on behalf of the Commonwealth to be responsible for the quota of Â£1,000,000 of expenditure, which removed the impasse that had existed for thirty or forty years. Whatever other titles to fame the right honourable gentleman may have, his contribution to the solution of the Murray River problem should be among the most lasting. I take a different point of view from that of the honourable member for Capfioornia (Mr Higgs). I regard this subject as one in which the Commonwealth, as a whole, is vitally interested. The money expended by the Commonwealth, being simply one-fourth of the total outlay, is sure to be amply repaid. whole question of conservation of water in the Darling and Murray systems is a national matter in the truest sense of the term. I would support the appointment of a Commission to handle all the problems and projects arising out of those great water systems. Not only have there been considerable vexations and difficulties among the interested States in connection with the control and allocation of the waters of the Murray from its source to its mouth, but there are problems arising in connection with the Cbndamine and Dumaresq Rivers, on the border between New South Wales and Queensland. Because of the attitude of the New South Wales authorities during the past ten years, nothing has been achieved in the direction of securing con- to be exported. servation and irrigation. Settlers have agitated for it for a long while. Queensland Government, six years ago, carried out an extensive survey which indicated that a huge reservoir could be constructed at comparatively .little cost, and provide for the irrigation of an enormous area, suitable for such purposes. However, those interested have not been able to get the New Sputh Wales Government to authorize a survey and an examination iuto the possibilities which lie on the New South Wales side of the Dumaresq. If a Commission had been appointed to enable the Commonwealth to intervene and take over all such schemes of conservation and irrigation, a great deal more would have been done i u those directions. I was much impressed, when in Egypt, by reading the statements of Sir William WillcockSj that great engineer who carried to completion the construction of the Assouan Dam. In his book dealing with that enormous work, he remarks that it would have been well for the statesmen of Australia and South Africa if they had had the good fortune to be trained in India and Egypt, for the money which has been expended in Australia and South A f r i c a upon railway construction would then have been' used for water conservation and irrigation projects, with the results that the railways would have been able to build themselves.",42
174,Mr CORSER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"Wide Bay) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I also support the Bill . I have had an opportunity to inspect the irrigation schemes along the Murray , and I am convinced that the work there has been well The done. Fortunately for Australia, and for the settlers themselves, there are excellent . men on the job. I do not think it would be possible to secure better officials than Mr Hill and Mr Mcintosh, both in relation to the schemes themselves and with respect to the settlement of returned soldiers. I would like the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to bear in mind that Australia is extending its production of dried fruits and citrus 1 products to an enormous extent. I heard it remarked during the tour of inspection that the output would probably reach at least eight times the total of the pre-war figures. Supposing that the people of Australia can consume twice as much as before the war, there will still be left a huge surplus which will have Prior to Federation, dried fruits from other parts of the world, The more particularly from Greece, were coming into Australia at 2Â£d. per l b . , and a protective duty of 3d. per lb. had to be imposed to encourage local (production. Although the cost of production overseas has risen, and the consumption of these products has increased very rapidly, I question - very much whether the world's parity will be anything approaching that which has been foreshadowed. It would be wise for the Government to try to make arrangements for preferential treatment with respect to our dried fruit s imported into Great Bri tain. Otherwise, it may be disastrous to leave the producers to sell their output under the same conditions as prior to the war, when settlers were able to get only 2d. per l b . for their surplus products.",43
175,Mr TUDOR,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,There are no prices for any dried fruit s as low as 2d. per l b . today.,43
176,Mr CORSER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"I am speaking of conditions which existed before the war. The surplus was sold to distilleries at 2d. per lb. I saw thousands of cases of f r u it which could have been sold in Queensland without difficulty at 6d. per l b . , and yet. the growers were getting only 2d. per l b . The reason was that there is an association which controls price and the quantities which may be despatched to any one of the States. I told the growers that I would be pleased to give them 5d. per lb. for 10 tons of f r u it I saw at the distillery ab Mildura, but they could not sell, seeing that the quantity to which Queensland was entitled had already gone on to that State.",43
177,Mr TUDOR,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,It must be remembered that the distilleries have to make a certain quantity of spirit for the fortification of .wines.,44
178,Mr CORSER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENT A ND,"There was no wine produced in the neighbourhood of the distilleries of which I speak. The surplus production of the fruit-growers was bought for 2d. per lb., and turned into a white spirit, about 70 per cent, overproof, which was subsequently sold to wholesale chemists and druggists, and winemakers, in various parts of Australia. The producers had to be content with the price offered by the distilleries, because there was no other market. There is no danger in the near f u t u r e that the people who are being settled in large numbers upon these areas will be handicapped with a surplus such as is likely to render their labours unprofitable. But such a contingency could be entirely obviated if the Government were to step in . I urge them to make arrangements by which the surplus products of the returned soldier settlers shall find markets in other parts of the world at a remunerative price, even if the Commonwealth Line of Steamers has to be utilized for the carriage of the produce overseas to profitable markets. As the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has said, Queensland members support this measure. But we trust that, when we may be asking for the authorization of any similar project, which Queensland hopes to be able to do-w e long for i r r i gation and water conservation-the same cordial sup.oort will be given by honourable members from other States.

The eastern and northern - part of Western Australia has as much right to expect to be developed from the proposed transcontinental line as has the western portion of Queensland.

237,Mr GROOM,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [5.59] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for its report, viz - Extensio n of the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. I lay on the table the plans and specifications connected with this proposal. The length of the proposed extension is 297i miles.",50
238,Mr BAYLEY,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,How much of it would be with in the Northern Territory?,50
239,Mr GROOM,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"About 180 miles. was estimated thirty years ago that the cost of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line by this route would be Â£1,735,000, or Â£5,876 a mile. Since then, however, the cost of labour has at least doubled, the price bf rails and sleepers will be about three times as much, and general stores and material will probably be twice as expensive. It is proposed to construct this line so that it may be readily converted to the standard gauge. If 80-lb. are used, the cost is estimated at Â£4,109,446, or Â£13,813 per mile, and if 60-lb. rails are used, the estimated cost will be Â£3,878,398, or Â£13,036 per mile. Numerous water-courses of considerable extent have to be crossed, and there will be 4 miles of high-level bridging. The line south from Darwin is a 3-f.t. 6-in. gauge line, but the earthworks and other construction are designed for easy conversion to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line. revenue is estimated at Â£16,000. As to the matter about which the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) asked, a preliminary inspection has been made from Maree into Queensland by Mr Hobler, and the Prime Minister has promised that information regarding the territory will be obtained from practical men.",50

Before any railway can be constructed, this House has to approve of the recomdates of the Public Works CommitRAILWAY. tee, and then Parliament must pass an 1 Act authorizing its construction. A f t e r that it is for the Treasurer to provide the necessary funds. Question resolved in the affirmative. BALLARATELECTIO N. COMPENSATION TO MB . MCGBATH .",50
242,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S," I moveIn view of the fact that the settlement of the questions in connection with the disputed Ballaarat election was delayed for many months, and that the Ballaarat election of December, 1919, was declared ;null and void through official errors, this House is of opinion that some compensation should be made to David Charles MCGRATH, who, by reason of It such official errors, was compelled to contest two elections, and, as a result of such official errors and of an additional election, was involved in much unnecessary but unavoidable expenditure for which the Government should make allowance. It will be remembered that at the last election Mr Kerby was declared to have won the Ballarat seat from Mr MCGRATH by one vote, but on an appeal to the High Court the Judge found that thirty Tails or for ty errors had been made by the departmental officials, and he was unseated. On a second election being held, Mr MCGRATH was declared to be elected. That Mr MCGRATH was not given the seat in the first instance is due to no faul t of his own; 'he lost the election through the mistakes of departmental officials. The Prime Minister and Treasurer promised that the House should have an opportunity to deal with The this matter. Question resolved in the affirmative.",50
243,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S," I had in tended to speak to the motion to which the House has-just agreed. I quite agree that something should be done to compensate the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) for the unfortunate results of the Ballarat election in December of last year, and I rise simply to be suggest some lines upon which I think There have been similar cases. The precedent of recouping candidates for the expenses in volved in re-contesting elections has already been established., and both candiat the Ballarat election have been recouped tbose expenses, but whereas in each other prior case the member eventually returned a.t the fresh election was out of the Chamber for about three months only, the present member for Ballarat was absent from this chamber for over six months. My idea is that the honourable member should be treated as the other cases have been treated up to the same period, namely, three months, but that in the circumstances it would, perhaps, be fair to pay him three months' salary, accounting for the difference between the three months' loss of salary the others had to suffer, and the six months' loss of salary he has suffered.",50
244,Mr RYAN,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,Why should a successful candidate be called upon to suffer any loss of salary?,51
245,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,Everybod y who goes to law suffers except,51
246,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,The lawyers.,51
247,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,They are the only people who do not suffer. I think that the case of the honourable member for Ballarat would be substantially met if we paid him a sum of Â£250. That is the direction in which my mind is leading me at the present moment.,51
248,Mr RYAN,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,It is unfortunate that the .opportunity of ascertaining the sense >Â«f honourable [members upon the proposal to pay the honourable member for Ballarat only three months' salary was not taken. The honourable member ought to be placed in as good a position as that of the gentleman who was declared wrongly elected' in December last. He should be paid his salary right up to the time when the December election was declared void. Surely the person who ought to have - rightfully elected should draw his salary all the time.,51
249,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"But Mr MCGRATH was not rightfully elected. If every vote had been allowed and polled properly, there would still have been a tie.",51
250,Mr RYAN,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"I can speak with some authority on the matter, because I took part in the case.",51
251,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,I am referring what was contained in the report of Judge.,51
252,Mr RYAN,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"The right honourable statement. gentleman's statement of the case is not quite correct. It is quite true that there would have been a tie if the votes polled that were not properly counted had been counted, but there were some persons who were entitled to vote who were prevented by an official error from voting for Mr MCGRATH. Had the election been conducted properly, the present member, for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) would have been member for Ballarat from December last.",51
253,Mr MAXWELL,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"It all turns on that point. If that is the case, the honourable member should receive his salary for the full period.",51
254,Mr FLEMING,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,Who is to prove that those who did not vote would have voted for Mr MCGRATH?,51
255,Mr RYAN,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"The sworn evidence showed that the only persons who were prevented from voting were those who would! have voted ,for Mr MCGRATH. They were prevented from voting by official errors. If these official errors had not taken place, Mr MCGRATH would have been declared elected for Ballarat on the 13th December. Other honourable members may be in the same position at any time. Surely the State should bear the expense a parliamentary candidate is put to through an official error. There is no doubt Mr MCGRATH would have been member for Ballarat as from 13th December, and he ought to be placed in at least as good a position as that of Mr. Kerby from the 13th December. Perhaps the Treasurer can see his way to (get the sense of honourable members on the matter.",51
256,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,I think the honourable member should let well alone. Mr. been MCGRATH is getting a fair thing.,51
257,Dr MALONEY,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Melbourne) [6.17] As the only honourable member who bas been placed in a similar position, I would like the leave of the House tq make a statement.",51
258,Mr SPEAKER,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"It is most irregular to carry on a debate in this way by means of speeches made by leave of the House, to but of course it rests with honourable the members to say whether any honourable member should have leave to make a Leave granted.",51
259,Dr MALONEY,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Honourable members may recall the fact that I appealed against the election won by i Sir Malcolm MCEacharn, upon which Â£5,000 was spent. In the little area bounded by Elizabeth-street, Bourke-street, Victoriastreet, and Spring-street, Melbourne, more postal votes were recorded than were recorded in the whole State of , Queensland at one election, or in the whole Slate of Western Australia in two. elections. In the High Court it was shown clearly that bribery and corruption had been used. I felt at the time that I was wronged by the sum of money paid to me' to recoup me for my expenses, and I feel certain that if the matter were left to the decision of Mr Kerby, whom I regard as a personal friend, he would say that Mr. MCGRATH should have been placed in the position he would have occupied if the .electors of Ballarat had been permitted to cast their votes. Of course, Mr. MCGRATH's case differs from mine. In niy case bribery and corruption were rampant. In Mr MCGRATH's case the election was upset because of mistakes made by the electoral omcers, which I hope will not occur again. I appeal to the Treasurer to be generous, and not to keep too tight a string upon the Treasury bag. The honourable member for Ballarat has been put to the expense of two elections, just as I was, and I do not think any honourable member or the public outside would object to his being paid the ful l six months' salary to which he would have been entitled had he been elected at the first election. I hope that the wisdom of the House will see that that is done. PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES members BILL (No. 2).  leave.)- I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1920. My reasons for desiring to introduce the measure indicated above are various. is not that I feel that honourable members have committed a crime or done any wrong, or that they have departed from the procedure which is rightly theirs in passing the Parliamentary year. Allowances Act. My main reason is that, since we have been elected by the people to manage the affairs of Australia, and conduct its destiny through the most troublous times in its history, following upon the greatest of all wars, we should be examples to the people. If the payment of the basic wage is to be made upon lines similar to those which we have followed in granting to ourselves increased allowances, where will Australia be? We cannot very well enjoin economy upon other sections of the community in view of our OAvn actions. I believe that, for the sake of Australia, a better policy would be, instead of granting increased wages to all and sundry, to agree, from one end of the land to the other, to accept exactly half the salary which each individual is now receiving. That would rapidly tend to lower the cost of living. The probabilities are that commodities would come down to a similar extent; and Australia would thus be left a margin with which to pay her huge obligations. If we give the lead to increases on all hands, we will be merely adding tD the difficulties which are laid upon our shoulders as members of the National Parliament.",52
260,Unknown,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 9.19 p.m.,52

I appreciate, as much as does any honourable member, the additional Â£400 a year, and I do not wish to represent myself as being the only member prepared to make a sacrifice. I have been receiving the a'dditional allowance since ib was passed, but, with the object which I have already stated, I am ready, if honourable will join with me in passing this measure, to sacrifice it. The prestige of y this Parliament would be greatly improved if , at a time like this, we made such a sacrifice.",52
262,Mr JH CATTS,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"It would be no sacrifice to the honourable member.  It I gave up a larger emolument than that which I am now receiving in order to enter this Chamber. When I came here I understood that the amount payable to honourable members was to be Â£600 a I am one of those who believe that the public are not the best judges of what a member of Parliament should receive. I think there is. some difficulty in the way of a member of Parliament, or any one else, establishing his own worth. A wise and independent tribunal, representative of all classes, should be able to recommend to the Parliament an amount that it would be reasonable for us to receive. The fact that I am submitting this motion when we are so close to the Christmas vacation is not my fault. The motion has been hung up for four or five mouths; but in the circumstances I desire to be as brief as possible. I have cast no aspersions on any honourable member, and have taken this action only because I do not consider that the Parliament acted wisely in deciding to increase the allowance.",52

268,Mr ATKINSON,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"The honourable member, I suppose, was supplied with a copy of the report a week ago, whereas we were not.",53
269,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"It was laid on the table of the House when the Prime Minister dealt with it on Tuesday last. I took a  from the table, and received a printed copy of the report from one of the messengers. In October last it was my privilege to introduce to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) one of the most representative deputations of trade unionists that has ever waited upon a Minister of the Crown in Australia. That deputation represented organizations that were prepared to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the redress of their grievances, and the Prime Minister promised that he would appoint a Commission as requested to inquire into the question of the basic wage. In support PROWSE, and of my statement as to the representative character of the deputation, I think it only right to say who were present, and what organizations were represented by REPORT. them. The carters and drivers were represented by Mr R. Cheney, the engine drivers by Mr H . C. Gibson, the Australian Workers Union miners by Mr . Little, the tramway employees by Mr J . Jewell, the bootmakers by Mr . - I regret Richards, the builders' labourers  workers by Mr Sinclair, the Commonwealth Clerical Association by Mr T. C. Maher, the fuel and fodder employees by Mr MCPherson, the storemen and  mated Society of Engineers by Mr . Barker, the clothing trades by Mr . Carter, and the gas workers by Mr . Croft. There were, I believe, other organizations' representatives, and every one of them was of a Commonwealth character, and they represented over a quarter of a million trades unionists. The gentlemen whose names I have mentioned are the general secretaries of the organizations who have conducted many cases in the Arbitratio n Court, and their request to the Prime atMinister was that such a Commission should be appointed. On the SOth October last year the Prime Minister delivered his policy speech at Bendigo, and a portion of that speech is quoted in the report of the Commission as f o l lows :Tho intention of appointing this Commission was first announced by the Prime Minister, the Sight Hon. W. M. Hughes, P.O., in delivering the policy speech of the Government at Bendigo on the 30th October, 1919, for the general election of that year. The announcement was thus reported:"" If we are to have industrial must be prepared to pay the price, that price is justice to the worker. Nothing less will serve. We have long adopted in Australia the principles compulsory arbitration for the settlement know exactly where they stand. of industrial disputes and of the mum wage. The cause of much of the industrial unrest, which is like fires of Bolshevism and direct action, arises with the real wage of the worker-that is - Mr BRENNAN to say, the things he can buy with the money he receives. This real wage decreases with an increase in the cost of living. Now, once it is admitted that is in the interests of the community such a wage should be paid as will enable a man to marry and bring up children decent, wholesome conditions-and point has been settled long ago-it seems obvious that we must devise bettor machiing - here now. nery for insuring the payment of such a wage than at present exists. Means bo found which will insure that mum wage shall be adjusted automatically, or almost automatically, with the cost living, so that within the limits of the minimum wage at least the sovereign shall always purchase the same amount of necessaries of life. The Government therefore, appointing a Hoyal Commission to inquire into the cost of living tion to the minimum or basic wage. Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated ing the war; also how the basie wage be adjusted to the present purchasing this debate. power of the sovereign, and the best means, . when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and sovereign. The Government will, at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect ito these principles. Labour is entitled to a fair share of the wealth it produces. The fundamental question of the basic wage having thus satisfactorily-becaus e permanentlysettled, there remain other causes dustrial uiirrsi which must be dealt with if we are to have industrial peace. . ."" The Commission quotes that extract from the Age of the 31st October last year. I agree with the Prime Minister when he says that this question must be settled, and I leave it to the Governowned ment to honour the definite pledge given to the people of Australia that they would at the earliest possible date create effective machinery to give effect to the principles they profess. The report of the Commission is now in the hands of the Government, and I ask them to give effect to their recommendations-it is for the Government to decide. Was this only an election promise, like many peace we ethers, made for the purpose of fooling and the electors into voting for Government ago nominees?

Then the right honourable gentleman went on to quote the terms of the memoran prepare at at 5 o'clock on Monday afternoon, and he furnished the Prime Minister with matter, represented by five pages of print , at 9 o'clock the same evening, only three or four hours later.",55
289,Mr WATKINS,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,And we are expected to believe it !,56
290,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Honourable members can please themselves. The members of the Commission were not consulted, be ter was outside the terms of their commission. Compare the Prime Minister's procedure on this occasion with his procedure in 1918, when he received a report on meat from the Inter-State Commission. Deputations waited on him at that time, not of consumers, but of selling agents, and, as a result of the protest made by the latter, the Prime Minister had no fewer than two other reports prepared before Parliament ever saw the original report. The right honourable gentleman did that because, in his opinion, the report was an unwise one. On the present occasion he did not ask  Commission together and supply the information which was desired. The Commission was composed of seven gentlemen, three representing the workers, and three the employers. The employers' re preventatives were Mr G. M . Allard , representing the Chamber of Commerce of Australia; Mr J . A . Harper, of Adelaide, representing the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia; and Mr E . E . Bleep, on the nomination of the Central Council of the Employers of Australia. The first two gentlemen resigned their position, but Mr Keep re-, tained his t ill the finish. Mr AHard's* [285] place was taken by Mr Morley, and Mr Harper's place by Mr Gilfillan. The President, as I say, did not call the Commission together, but I can tell honourable members that Mr Gilfillan was in the lobbies of this House on Monday evening at the time the Prime Minister was ask information. As honourable members know, my room is next to that of the Prime Minister, and I know that Mr . Gilfillan was in the lobby. Why were not the members of the Commission called together to give the ' Prime Minister the information he required? Six of the seven members of the Commission were in Melbourne. I know that Messrs. Cheney, Gibson, and Maher, the Labour members of the Commission, were here. I am informed that the Commission met yesterday morning, after they had furnished their report, but they were not called together to be asked their opinions on the subjects  give his opinion. He was asked for a memorandum on the following matters: 1. The true incidence of the cost of living. 2. How the findings of the Commission as to cost of living may hie distributed between (1) man and wife, (2) each of his three dependent children. 3. How the said findings of the Commission can be made effective so as to secure for every employee the actual cost of living according to its true incidence, accepting the finding of Â£5 16s. as the actual cost of living for a man, wife, and three children. 4. The effect upon industry, domestic and for foreign countries, of making a basic wage for all employees of Â£5 16s. 5. The effect of that course upon prices and the actual realization of the desired standard of comfort. 6. The effect upon the Commonwealth's obligations to its employees, permanent and temporary, of whatever course ""is adopted. Although the public servants were represented on a deputation, which waited on the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), this Commission was appointed to fix a fair basic wage, not for the Public Service only, but for the men who were continually appealing to the Arbitration Court. The Prime Minister stated that the history of this matter goes back to 1907, when Mr Justice Higgins, in what is known as the Harvester case, laid down a basic wage: In 1906 Parliament passed an Act to provide that employers who were afforded protection by the Tariff should give fair and reasonable conditions to their employees, and should sell their manufactures at a fair price. It was alleged that MCKay, of the Sunshine harvester factory, did not do that. The honourable member for Ballarat will bear me out in the statement that MCKa v shifted his factory fro m Ballarat to Braybrook to evade the Factories Act , as Braybrook was then in a shire. MCKay was willing to take all the Protection he could get, but he would nob give fair and reasonable conditions to his men. I have said that on the platform when MoKay was present. I have said it at Richmond, Collingwood, Ballarat, and in this House. On an appeal to the Court, Mr Justice Higgins raised the wage of men to whom MCKay was paying 5s. 6d. a day to 7s. a day. Mr Justice Higgins confined his figures to rent, groceries, bread, meat, rmilk, fuel, vegetables, and f r u it , and the average of the list of nine house-keeping women caime to Â£ 1 12s. 5d. That expenditure did not cover "" light, clothes, boots, furniture, utensils, rates, l if e in surance, savings, accident or benefit societies, loss of employment, union pay, books and newspapers, tram and train farÂ«s, sewing machine, mangle, school requisites, amusements and holidays, in toxicating liquors, tobacco, sickness and death, domestic help, or any expenditure for unusual contingencies, religion, or charity."" Mr Justice Higgins allowed 9s. 7d. for clothing and the miscellaneous requirements just enumerated. any honourable member say that those items could be purchased for 9s. 7d. per week? According to the CommissionThe Commonwealth Statistician's figures (published five years after the Harvester case) showed that the rent of a four-roomed house in Melbourne in the year 1907 was 8s. l i d . , nearly 2s. per week more than was laid down in the Harvester case. It would seem to be a fair inference that the rent of 7s. included in the Harvester wage was that of a four roomed house in Sunshine . . In 1914 the Commonwealth Statistician found that rent and food together constituted (speaking approximately) 60 per Cent, of the ordinary expenditure of a household, leaving 40 per cent, for clothing and miscellaneous It was, however, strongly contended in the years of the war that clothing, in particular, had increased in price at a greater ratio than any other section of the cost of living, and this contenMr Tudor. tion the figures now ascertained by this Commission fully justified. In 1914 the Judges of the Arbitration Court were asked to reconsider the fixing of a basic wage on the then cost .of living. The Commission says The invitation extended to re-open the Harvester case was accepted by the Federated Carters and Drivers Union in their case, begun in April, 1917. During the hearing, the representative of the union submitted, in a written address, statements and arguments why the Court should no longer derive its basic wage from the Harvester basic wage. The Deputy President of that Court refused to re-open the matter upon the ground, amongst others, that it would involve his departing from the practice of the Court since its inception, and His Honour suggested that the representative of the' union should offer himself as a witness '' when the Commission or Board is appointed to make the muchneeded inquiry into the cost of living."" He did not offer himself as a witness because he was appointed a member of the Commission. Then, in 1918, Mr Justice Powers saidThe representative of the Acting Public Service Commissioner, the representative of the Employers Federation' of Victoria and New South Wales, and the representative of the seven unions now before the Court joined in urging that the Federal Government should appoint a Commission, or some body, to take evidence with a view to fixing a Federal living wage for a man, his wife, and family of three on a scientific and humane basis, or to authorize the Commonwealth Statistician to do so. He went on to say that he had, on more than one occasion, recommended that Will course to the Federal Government. If any member of this Parliament votes against the acceptance of the Commission's - finding, he must be prepared to answer the question, "" Do you believe that the workers have a right to live? "" I believe that every worker has a right to live in decency and comfort.",56
291,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Hear , hear!",57
292,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"The representatives of the Employers Federation, of the Chamin 1907. bers of Commerce, and other employers' representatives on the Commission signed the report. The only objection they take is that the unions will not speed up. But practically the whole of the boot factories in Australia are now closed. How can there be any speeding up when there is no work to be done ?",57
293,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,Why have those factories closed?,58
294,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Because there is no Pootscray. work to be done; the closing is not due to any industrial trouble. Minister has said that the industries Australia cannot pay this living wage; but I say that no industry has a righ t exist in the Commonwealth or anywhioh where else that cannot pay a living the wage to the men engaged in it . Mr Piddington, in his memorandum, says of the conjugal conditions of that, of the total male wage-earners, 438,735 have never married; 90,617 have families the children of which grown up ; 69,174 are married but childless; 78,288 are married, with one 77,752 are married,- with two children; the balance of husbands and children being 220,400. In any attempt at averwhich aging, regard should be had to the fact that a man cannot keep himself and, wife for what a single man could live and so much is required for each child. The basic wage that has been recoming mended does not allow for the saving a great deal of money for the complete furnishing of a house. The Commission speaks of it as the amount required keep a man, his wife, and three t a children in reasonable comfort. members say that our industries cannot afford to pay it ? In Melbourne ""and in with the wages paid. Sydney at the present time the trade is brisk, and carpenters, plumbers, stonemasons, and bricklayers are all getting more than Â£ 1 a day. Of course, they are not employed every day in the year.",58
295,Mr ATKINSON,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,And the cost of living is going up.,58
296,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"Are not the profits of the employers increasing also? themselves admit that they are. Mr . Piddington, in his memorandum, speaks of 879,000 children; but I ascertained from the Commonwealth Statistician today that the present population of the Commonwealth is 5,300,000, of whom 2,970,000 are of twenty-one years of age and upwards; 750,000 between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one; and 1,580,000 under the age of fourteen. Wbere are most of those children to be found ? Not in residential suburbs such as Toorak, South Yarra, Hawthorn, and K e w ; but in the working-class suburbs like Richmond, Brunswick, Collingwood, and The birth rate is 50 per cent, greater in the working-class suburbs The Prime than it is in the residential suburbs. The of honourable member for Melbourne Ports. (Mr Mathews) has immortalized himself to because of a little poem on this subject he put into Hansard. More of 1,580,000 children in Australia belong . to the workers than belong to the nonworkers; probably 80 per cent, are childthe people dren of the workers.",58
297,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,Why ?,58
298,Mr MAHONY,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"There are more children are in Balmain than in Mosman.  child; dington's memorandum was made hurriedly. He himself said so. I maintain that there are more than the .90 children  allotted to every employee in Australia. a But when we consider the enormous proon, fits made by the manufacturers in comparison with the decrease in the purchaspower of the wages paid to the emof ployees, no one will contend that the industries of Australia cannot pay higher wages than they are paying to-, to day. I.have taken the trouble to asceri n the output of the factories in AusW ill tralia according to the latest statistical returns available, and compared them The following building table is most illuminating:Per- Per Year. Wases. Output. centage. Â£100.

Â£4,773,181 Output increased .. .. Â£64,192,858 From 1913 to 1918 the wages have in creased by Â£4,773,181, while the value of the output of the factories has increased by Â£64,192,858. These figures are supplied by the manufacturers themselves to the Statistician, and are not prepared at the Trades H all , or by any representative of a trade union. The manufacturer may make misstatements about his income in order to avoid the payment of income tax, but he is not likely to underestimate the amount of the wages he pays or overstate the amount of production in his factory. He knows all the time that the Income Tax Commissioner may challenge his figures. Mr Ewing, the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation, told the Taxation Commission the other day that he had secured information from every available source. Now let me take the other side of the question from the employers' own figures, as set out in the following equally interesting table:Year. Wages Paid. Process ot Â£ Â£ 1913 .. 33,606,087 65,153,286 1914 .. 34,103,703 66,661,444 1915 .. 33,210,654 66,310,618 1916 .. 33,828,840 67,394,400 1917 .. 36,618,218 74,093,550 1918 .. 38,379,268 79,571,745 209,746,770 419,185,043 The share which has gone to the manufacturer is quite apart from whatever he. draws in the way of remuneration for his services, as the wages of working proprietors are always included in the wages returns. While the _ wages of the - workers have increased from 1913 to 1918 by Â£4,773,181, the share which the manufacturer has drawn has increased from Â£31-,547,199 to Â£41,192,477 in the same period. How, therefore, can it be said that the industries of Australia, cannot pay more wages? In this House we asked the Treasurer to supply information compiled from income tax returns to show how some people in Australia are building up enormous profits. We did not ask for the names. suggested that the taxpayers might be designated by numbers, as had already been done in a Teturn placed before the Victorian State Parliament. as we were told that the information coijld not be furnished, I have been compelled to fall back upon the figures wbicb Six Alexander Peacock quoted in the Victorian Parliament in 1916, showing the profits made from year to year iby Mr Tudor. 265 taxpayers.

Though I am as strong a Protectionist as is any other member of this House, if the manufacturers in the Yarra district chose to fight this case in the Courts, I would vote to give them a dose of Free Trade rather than afford them Protection solely for the purpose of enabling them to sweat their employees.",59

Mr TUDOR, - I presume that each workman's child uuder fourteen would be registered, and as the employer would be taxed so much for each employee, it would make no difference to him whether his workmen were married or single. complaint is that this particular matter should have been re-submitted to the whole Basic Wage Commission, and not to the Chairman only. It was unfair place on him the onus of answering in a few hours all these questions which are w so important.",60

303,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"The Government rener, ferred the report of the Inter-State mission on Meat back to it three times.

304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"There is nothing i that, because these very men have just got an award fro m the Court.",60
305,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"I am not speaking the public servants, but of such organizawhile tions as the employees in the clothing trade, engine-drivers, gas workers, the - is getting less and less? amalgamated engineers, the builders'"" labourers. The other day I iutroduced deputation of the last-mentioned to the Prime Minister. Their spokesman they had been waiting for about four years since they had last'secured an award from the Arbitration Court, and now they wanted a more speedy method of obtainable ing justice. Th?.y desired to come within the scope of the Industrial Peace Act, so that they might obtain a direct conformed ference with the employers. As for the public servants, the Prime Minister said some days ago that he was going to make their wage Â£4 4s. per week. That is [286] matter for the Government to decide; but the conditions under which the public servants are working today are such a3 to have created seething discontent. The way in which the best of our public servants are dropping out and seeking better prospects in private spheres of activity out the constitutes a matter of grave concern. When we see employees in the Public Service dissatisfied, as they are today with Mr Justice Starke's award, and claiming that under it they will be in a worse position than they were eighteen months ago, Ave must be impressed with the feeling that it is high time the Government considered the whole grave subjrct. My Sir JOSEPH. COOK - That is quite a misrepresentation. The award to which the honourable member has just referred to will cost this country Â£350,000.",60
306,Mr TUDOR,MATARANKA TO DALYWATER S,"And the Treasurer ill say, I suppose, that that will r u in the country. When, during the discussion of the first Commonwealth Public Service Bill , I moved for the insertion of a clause to provide a minimum wage, the then Treasurer, the late Sir George Tur said my proposal would r u in the Comcountry. This is a country which seems to stand an awfu l lot of r u in without being any the worse off for it . I now ask for consideration for those who have been waiting for years to secure justice through the Arbitration Court. Is it any wonder that the workers should become n more and more restless, and be determined to obtain justice for themselves, when they learn how their toil is piling up of enormous profits for the employers, their share-owin g to the ever-receding value of the sovereign In the annual report of the Bureau of Coma merce and Industry for 1920, there is a return showing total issues authorized in said respect of new and existing companies from 26th January, 1916, to 31st December, 1919, together with the purposes for which the issues were authorized. Honormembers will recall that during that period no company could increase its capital, and no new company could be without official sanction. D u r i ng the period in question, the total issue of new capital was more than Â£111,000,000. Of that, nearly Â£63,000,000 was subscribed a in cash; Â£12,500,000 was subscribed by the transfer to capital of reserves and undivided profits; while more than Â£36,000,000 was subscribed by the transfer of assets other than cash. Honourable members know full well that that lastmentioned total largely represents goodwill. In other words, the Â£36,000,000 was water, and the workers of Australia 'had to make profits to provide dividends upon that capital, which really had .no existence. Now the Govermnent are trying to rush this House into recess without giving justice to the workers. I , at any rate, shall not permit that course without vigorous protest. I have quoted from the figures of the employers themselves. Let me now turn to the findings of a Nationalist Commission appointed by the late Holman Government in New South Wales to inquire into the enormous profits made by the coal companies of that State. The Worker, from which I shall quote, has turned its attention to three typical cases, and the statistics are so interesting that I quote them in full , as follow:District. Year. No 1- f 1914 28,006 255,481 Southern \ 191S 31,403 293,648 No 2- f 1914 40,000 118,370 Western \ 1918 40,000 124,391 No. 3- f 1914 7,427 Northern \ 1918 5,491 I emphasize that this was an independent Commission. The particulars set out in the table furnish eloquent reasons why the workers of Australia are anxious to secure redress of their grievances. In connection with the Basic Wage Commission's findings, the Government deliberately stated that as soon as possible they would give effect to the report of that Commission;"" they said that at the - earliest possible date they would create effective machinery to that end - In view of that promise, and in order to bring matters to a bead, I move That the following words be added to the motion : "" and, in accordance with the definite pledge given by the Prime Minister in his Mr Ttidor. policy speech at Bendigo on 30th October, 1919, the Government should give effect immediately to the finding of the Commission.""  of the Commission ?",60
