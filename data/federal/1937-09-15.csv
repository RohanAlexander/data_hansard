Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",17
55,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Cowper-Minister for Commerce) [3.7] - by leave- I move That the bill be now road a second time. The object of this bill is to overcome hardship suffered by certain officers of the Commonwealth Public Service by reason of their service with the Development and Migration Commission. The Development and Migration Act 1926, in made provision for the preservation of the existing and accruing rights of Comthe monwealth and State public servants appointed to the staff of the commission, but did not specify what those rights were. In 192S, the Officers' Eights Declaration Act was passed specifying the rights preto Commonwealth officers appointed to the staff of the commission, no action was taken to specify the rights of State officers appointed to it. This bill indicates the rights which it. intended to preserve to State officers the Development and Migration Under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, an officer of the State Public who transfers to the Commonwealth Public Service is entitled to have the period of his employment by the disState counted for the purposes of computing sick leave and furlough, provided, of course, that his service with the State and the Commonwealth is continuous. In the case of certain officers whose service with a State, with the Development and Migration Commission, and subsequently with the Commonwealth Public Service has been continuous, the period during which they were on the staff of the commission represents, under the law as it now stands, a break in such continuity. This means that for purposes of sick leave and furlough, the service of these officers is regarded as having commenced only from the date of their appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service aiter the abolition of the Development and Migration Commission.",17

61,Mr THORBY,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Calare-Assistant Minister for Commerce) [3.12] - I moveTliat the bill he now read a This is a very short bill of only one clause of any consequence. By a-n amendment of the Dairy Produce Control Act 1935, the name of the board appointed under the principal act was altered from the Dairy Produce Control Board to the Australian Dairy Produce Board. In the Dairy Produce Export Charges Act 1924-1929, the old name still appears and this amendment is necessary to alter it. In 1936, the levy under this act was amended on the recommendation of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, although the Dairy Produce Export Charges Act at that time provided that the recommendation should be by the Dairy Produce Control Board. The present amending bill, besides providing for the alteration of the name of the board, validates the action taken in 1936.",18
62,Mr FORDE,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,Was the industry consulted on this subject?,18
63,Mr THORBY,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Yes. ' The present board is quite in accordance with this proposal which is, in fact, necessary.

At the end of last session the Wine Overseas Marketing Act 1929-36 was amended to provide, among other things, for a change of designation of the Wine Overseas Marketing Board to the Australian Wine Board. Consequently, it has been found necessary to amend the Wine Grapes Charges Act 1929, by substituting the words "" Australian Wine Board"" for the words "" Wine Overseas Marketing Board "" wherever they occur.

65,Mr HUGHES,THERAPEUTIC SUBSTANCES,"North Sydney-Minister for Health) [3.18] - I move- That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to give control over the importation and exportation of that group of medical remedies which are designated in the bill as therapeutic substances. They are to be distinguished from drugs in that they are biological products. Perhaps the two most familiar examples of these substances are diphtheria anti-toxin, which is an example of a substance prepared by bacterial action, and insulin, which is an example of a substance prepared from animal glands. The object of the bill is to ensure that these substances shall be of the right strength and purity, because it is recognized that they are very potent, and would be capable of working great havoc in the community if they were defective in quality. The bill, therefore, proposes to ensure that they shall comply with the following basic requirements:(a) They shall be true to a determined standard, thatstandard having an official and legal status; (6) They shall be free from contamination, more especially from bacterial contamination; (c) They must be properly and safely packed; and (d) They must be accurately labelled as to dosage. The standard adopted is that fixed by the League of Nations. It is international in its acceptation, and is recognized everywhere the League of Nations is recognized. The bill applies only to importations and exportations; it does not apply to serum anti-toxin and vaccines manufactured at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which are covered by laws and regulations designed to ensure their absolute purity, and compliance with standard' requirements. The bill provides simple machinery giving the Minister power to licence importers so as to give official supervision over the channels of importation, and to supervise the preparation of these substances for export. Every container of these substances must state clearly what it contains, the'biological formula for its manufacture, and the standard dose, together with a statement that the contents are free from contamination, and comply with thewstandard laid down and recognized. The subject could be amplified at great length, but it is sumcient to say that, in eifect, this is a bill which extends that kind of protection which is afforded by the Pure Foods Act to foods, and the Pure Drugs Act to drugs, to those biological preparations which are so extensively used today, and upon the purity of which the health and lives of our citizens depend.",19

67,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.26] - by leave- I move That Standing Orders Nos. 7 to 13 be repealed and the following new Standing Order, recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in its Report, be adopted in place thereof:7. The election of Speaker shall be conducted in the following manner:(o) At the opening of Parliament, after the' Members present have been sworn, or whenever the office of Speaker becomes vacant, a Member, addressing himself to the Clerk, shall propose some Member, then present, to the House for their Speaker, and move that such Member ""Do take the Chair of this House as Speaker"", which motion shall be seconded. A Member when proposed and seconded shall inform the House whether he accepts nomination. - (6.) The Clerk shall then ask, "" Is there any further proposal?"", and if , within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal, the Clerk shall say "" The time for proposals has expired "". No Member maythen address the House or propose any other Member, and the Clerk shall, without question put, declare the Member so proposed and seconded to have been elected as Speaker, and such Member shall be conducted to the Chair by his proposer and seconder, and shall take the Chair of the House as Speaker. (e) If more than one Member is proposed as Speaker the Clerk shall, after the second proposal and after each subsequent proposal ""(if any) is made and seconded, ask "" Is there any further proposal?'', and if , within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal, the Clerk shall say "" The time for proposals has expired "". (d) When the time for proposals has expired, debate may ensue, but it shall he relevant to the election. (e) No Member shall speak for more than five minutes. (/) At any time during the debate a Motion may be made by a Minister rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other Member is addressing the Chair or not "" That the Question be now put "" . The Clerk shall then put the question, without debate, "" That the Question be now put "" . In the event of the numbers being equal the Question shall be decided in the negative. Upon the carrying of t i e Question "" That the Question be now put "" , or - upon the cessation of the debate other* wise, the election shall be proceeded with as provided in this Standing Order. (g) Before the House proceeds to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a Division. (h) When only two Members are proposed and seconded as Speaker, each Member shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot paper in writing, containing the name of the candidate for whom he votes; and the candidate who has the greater number of votes shall be the Speaker, and be conducted to the Chair. (i ) When more than two Members are so proposed and seconded, the votes shall be taken in like manner, and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be the Speaker, provided he has also a majority of the votes of the Members present; but if no candidate has such majority, the name of the candidate having the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall be done as often as necessary, until one candidate is declared to be elected as Speaker by such majority, when such Member shall be conducted to 'the Chair. (;) If at any ballot it is impossible by reason of the equality of votes to determine which name shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, a special ballot shall take place at which there shall be submitted .only the names of tliose candidates. who have received equal votes. At such special ballot each Member shall write on his ballot-paper only the name of the candidate he wishes to retain. The candidate whose name appears upon the smallest number of ballot-papers shall then he excluded from subsequent ballots. (k) At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of the second or other subsequent ballot, a candidate may withdraw his name from the election which shall then proceed as if he had not been nominated. (I) If by reason of equality of votes a ballot or special ballot is rendered inconclusive, the Clerk shall so declare, and. unless by a withdrawal another ballot, or (as the case may be) another special ballot is rendered unnecessary, he shall cause such other ballot or special ballot to be taken. If after the counting of votes the equality continues he shall so declare. Thereupon the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes and when the House reassembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. (vs.) Whenever at any stage a withdrawal leaves only one candidate remaining he shall without further voting, be declared elected as Speaker, and shall then be conducted to the Chair. (») Having been conducted to the Chair, the Member elected returns his acknowledgments to the House for the honour conferred upon him, and thereupon sits down in the Chair, and then the Mace (which before lay under the Table) shall be laid upon the Table. (o) The Speaker having been congratulated, a Minister shall inform the House at what time the Governor General will "" .be pleased to receive the House for the purpose of presenting the Speaker to His Excellency, and the sitting of the House shall then be suspended until that time. (p) Before proceeding to any business, the Speaker, with the House, shall present himself to the Governor General; and, on returning, shall pass through the Chamber, and, having resumed the Chair, shall report his presentation to the Governor General. Standing Orders proposed Ir, be repealed7. A Member, addressing himself to the Clerk (who standing up, points to him, and then sits down) shall propose some other Member, then present, to the House Speaker, and move, "" That Mr do take the Chair of the House as Speaker."" 8.. If only one Member be proposed seconded as Speaker,' he shall be called Chair of the House without a Question put. !). Such Member, on being called to Chair, shall stand up in his place, aud liis sense of the honour proposed to be conby ballot in the event of a contest. ferred upon him and submit himself to House. 10. If more than one Member be as iSpoaker, the Clerk shall, in the which the Members shall have been proposed, put the question "" That Mr <lo take the Chair of the House as Speaker""; which shall be resolved in the affirmative or negative. 11. Having heen conducted to the Chair, Member elected returns his acknowledgments to the House for the honour conferred upon him, and thereupon sits down in the Chair, and then the mace (which before lay under the Table) shall be laid upon the Table. - 12. A Member having congratulated Speaker, u Member of the Government shall inform the House at what time the OovernorGeneral will be pleased to receive the House the purpose of presenting the Speaker to Excellency, and the sitting of the House then be suspended until that time. 13. The Speaker, with the House, shnll sent himself to the Governor General: and, returning, shall pass through the Chamber, aud, having resumed the Chair, shall report his presentation to the Governor General. This motion does not cover all the remore commendations of the Standing Orders liament. Committee because, as appears in the committee's report, there was a reservadid tion by one member. What that reservato tion related to I do not know, but I do unfair to us. not think that there can be any difference of opinion regarding the advisability adopting the new Standing Orders relatwas ing to the election of a Speaker and Chairman.",19

70,Mr BLACKBURN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Hi s objection was to certain disciplinary clauses.,21
71,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"So I would imagine. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Blackburn), being a member of the committee, is familiar with what transpired. Tliose clauses, however, are not covered by the motion I have just moved. for its .

76,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"West Sydney) [3-30]. - I wish to repeat what I have already said to the effect that, in regard to the business of this Parliament, it is customary, if it is not at least a matter of ordinary courtesy, for the Opposition to be advised of the business the Government proposes to call on. Last week we complained about the long list of bills that was being continually tabled, and were anxious to know just what business the' Government proposed to finalize. Subsequently, the Leader of our party informed my colleagues and myself in the party room of what the Government's intentions were, and we proceeded then to adjust our arrangements to meet the business that he indicated. This particular business was not included among the list he gave.",21
77,Mr BKENNAN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,No r does it appear on i lie notice-paper.,22
78,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,No reference whatever was made to it in any discussion in the Opposition party room and honourable members on this side heard nothing about it until three or four minutes ago.,22
79,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I do not think that is correct; the Deputy Leader was informed about this matter?,22
80,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,When ?,22
81,Mr FORDE,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"The Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) this afternoon told me that if there was sufficient time available this business would be brought on, but, I confess, I have not seen this report of the Standing Orders Committee, and, a3 I am not a member of the committee, I am not aware of its contents. Mr Hor,T - The report was circulated.",22
82,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Hundred s of reports, if not more, are circulated.",22
83,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The honourable member is a member of the Standing Orders Committee?,22
84,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Yes , and I was interested in the doings of the committee to the point that I refused to agree to its report being presented to Parliament' without my dissent in respect of certain recommendations being recorded. I took that step with the object of safeguarding my position, because I realized that when the committee's report was submitted to Parliament I would find in it many suggested alterations of which T did not approve. As the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) is now present in the chamber I wish to know if he approves of this business being brought on at this hour. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) was notified of this measure only this afternoon, and he has not had time to inform any honourable members on this side of the intentions of the Government. I suggest that it is unfair to ask the Hotise to decide this matter now. In order that I shall have an opportunity to inform myself and my colleagues of the recommendations contained in this report, I shall be obliged to read it over now. I take it that the motion before the House deals with Chapter III . , which is headed "" Election of Speaker and Chairman "". That chapter readsII . . The election of Speaker shall he conducted in the following manner:(a) At the opening of Parliament, after the members present have been sworn, or whenever the office of Speaker becomes vacant, a Member, addressing himself to the Clerk, shall propose some Member, then present, to the House for their Speaker, and move that such Member "" Do take the Chair of this House as Speaker"", which motion shall be seconded. A. Member when proposed and seconded shall inform the House whether he accepts nomination. I take it that that is part of the procedure followed at present. Standing Order No. 11 continues- (6) The Clerk shall then ask "" Is there any further proposal?"", and if , within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal, the Clerk shall say "" The time for proposals has expired "" . . .",22
85,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Is the honourable member reading this for the information of honourable members ?,22
86,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Yes , and for my own information.",22
87,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,But the honourable up member was a member of the committee and went so far as to dissent from its recommendations.,22
88,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Propose d Standing Order No. 11 continues. . .

89,Mr BIIACXBTJKN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"No , by the comcharge mittee.",23
90,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Is this being proposed by the Attorney-General?,23
91,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The whole of proposed Standing Order No. 11 has been proposed by me as it has been recommended by the committee.,23
92,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I want honourable members on this side to note that while was in the House the Attorney-General made no reference to paragraph d which L have just read. The right honourable gentleman went on to refer to the which could arise in the event of more than one member being nominated position of Speaker and mentioned some difficulty which had occurred in these f:ircumstances in the Victorian ParliaClark) ment.,23
93,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,If the honourable memportant ber accuses me of not having read that the House he is right. I assumed that honourable members would have read the report for themselves seeing that it was distributed to them on the 28th June last.,23
94,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I suggest that the Government has adopted the procedure lished followed by it in this instance not only for the purpose' of securing alterations custom! of the Standing Orders in the absence of certain honourable members, and at a time when certain honourable, members have not had an opportunity to peruse the report, but also with the idea of getting away with something really worse.",23
95,Mr LYONS,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Honourable members have had the report since June.,23
96,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I say to the Prime Minister that he has had many reports much longer than since June last. If the Prime Minister is to be given credit for what he has said there are many reports which he did not read when they came into his possession.,23
97,Mr LYONS,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,It is no excuse for a member of the committee to say that he has not read the committee's report. . Mr BEASLEY - And it is no excuse for the right honourable gentleman as head of a department to place himself in a position of not having read reports subhas ex- mitted to his department.,23

99,Mr LYONS,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The honourable member is not telling the truth because I am not in of the department which he has in mind.,23
100,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I am referring to the time when the right honourable gentleman was in a cabinet with me.,23
101,Mr LANE,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Why did you put him out ?,23
102,Mr LYONS,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,He did not put me out. He put out his own leader.,23

107,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I am reminded by the honourable member for Darling. (Mr. that the alterations proposed to Standing Order No. 11 raise a very imaspect regarding the exercise of to the privilege, right and freedom of honourable members in discussing, on the occasion of the election of Mr Speaker, questions which they are ordinarily denied the opportunity to discuss.

110,Mr LANE,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,You do not rule Parliament.,23
111,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I will rule you at the elections with much more effect.,23
112,Mr LANE,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Like you ruled a municipal council in Glebe the other day!,23
113,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Order ! - I shall not allow the debate to be carried on in this way. The honourable member for West Sydney is the only honourable member entitled to be heard.,23
114,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Eve r since this Parliament was established certain provisions have governed discussions on the occasion of the election of Mr Speaker. Those provisions gave honourable members an opportunity to offer criticism to men who hold high positions in this country and who, we believe, had, in the period since the election of the previous Speaker, taken advantage of their positions to apply decisions and cause injustice to many sections of the community, whereas in the ordinary course of. Parliamentary affairs we were unable to bring such matter*) under notice. Therefore, I shall never cast a vote to allow that privilege to be taken away from honourable members. Irrespective of whether the Standing Orders Committee recommends 'li or nor, I do not agree with proposed paragraph d of Standing Order No. 11 because I remember the occasion on which this matter was first brought up before the committee. T was not present at subsequent meetings of the committee when it reached its final decision on this matter. When it was first raised before the committee, however, I noted it carefully and intended, when the opportunity arose for its discussion in this Parliament, to do all in my power to see that the committee's recommendation was not adopted. I ask my colleagues to take notice of the real change which is being effected by this recommendation. The full import of that change was not suggested, or referred to, by the Attorney-General when he moved that the alteration be made. He just went on to refer 'to something that had happened in the Victorian Parliamentsomething of which honourable members know nothing, and which has no particular reference to this matter at all. Proposed Standing Order No. 11 d readsWhen the time for proposals has expired, debate may ensue, but it shall be relevant to the election. This has to be in the hands of the Clerk of the House, and he has to determine whether the matter is relevant or not. On the motion for the election of Speaker, I have listened to some of the finest speeches that I have heard in this House. I well remember a speech of the predecessor of the honourable gentleman who now represents the constituency of Bourke. Consequently, I do not intend to allow that opportunity to be withdrawn from any honourable member. Nor shall I permit this alteration to be sneaked in, in the manner proposed by the Attorney General today.",24
115,Mr MENZIES,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"On a point of order, I ask whether the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) is in order in saying that I am sneaking something in, when, in fact, it has been recommended by a committee which included the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), the honourable member for JBourke (Mr Blackburn), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), all of whom concurred in the report ?",24
116,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"That the honourable member is in error does not signify that he is out of order. The honourable member for West Sydney, however, is not in order in saying that the ""- Attorney General had sneaked anything in.",24
117,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I 'shall state the matter in another form. The impression conveyed by the Attorney-General was that there was nothing contentious in the proposed alteration. He particularly failed to make any reference to this alteration. Paragraph e readsNo member shall speak for more than five minutes. That also is a new proposal. Even in determining the merits or demerits of the candidates who are offering for the position of Speaker, an honourable member will be permitted to speak for not longer than five minutes. Some honourable members may consider that that is sufficient; I do not. Consequently, I shall not agree to such a limitation being imposed. Paragraph / readsA t any time during the debate a motion may bo made by a Minister rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not "" That the question be now put "" . The Clerk shall then put the question, without debate, "" That the question be now put "" . In the. event of the numbers being equal tin, question shall be decided in the negative. Upon the carrying of the question *' That the question be now put "" , or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the election shall be proceeded wit h as provided in this Standing Order. That again is a new provision. graph <j readsBefore the House proceeds' to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a division Paragraph h readsWhen only two members are proposed and seconded as Speaker, each member shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot-paper in writing, containing the name of the candidate for whom he votes; and the candidate who has the greater number of votes shall be the Speaker, and he conducted to the Chair. In this case, the ballot-papers are to be handed to the Clerk. It is customary in all ballots for scrutineers to be appointed to check the counting of the votes. No such provision has been made in this Standing Order. These ballot-papers are not to be available to the representatives of the candidates for their perusal, consequently, I do not approve of that change being made. The opportunity should be provided for those who are interested to satisfy themselves that the ballot-papers have not been counted in an irregular manner. Paragraph i readsWlien more than two members are so proposed and seconded, the votes shall be taken in like manner, anil the member \v,ho has the greatest number of votes shall be the Speaker, provided he has also a majority of the votes of the members present; but if no candidate has such majority, the name of the candidate having the smallest number of votes shall he ON eluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh hallot shall take place; and this shall be done as often as necessary, until one candidate is declared to be elected as Speaker by such majority, when such member shall be conducted to the Chair. Paragraph j deals with an equality of votes - It readsI f at any ballot it is impossible by reason of the equality of votes to determine which name shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, a special ballot shall take place.at which there shall be submitted only the names of those candidates who have received equal votes. At such special ballot each member shall write ou his ballot-paper only the name of the candidate ho wishes to retain. The candidate whose name appears upon the smallest number of ballot-papers shall then be excluded from subsequent ballots. I can find no further provision to meet the contingency of an equality of votes again resulting. That is quite likely to happen. The candidates could continue to "" go to the post"" so long as the votes were properly regimented; and they would be in this House. Para- Mr BLACKBURN - Paragrap h I deals with that.",24
118,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Paragrap h h reads- it any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of the second or other subsequent ballot, a candidate may withdraw his name from the election, which shall then proceed as if ho had not been nominated. That is followed by paragraph I which readsI f by reason of equality of votes a ballot or special ballot is rendered inconclusive, the Clerk shall so declare, and unless by a withdrawal another ballot or (as the case may be) another special ballot is rendered unnecessary, ho shall cause such other ballot or special ballot to be taken. If after the counting of votes the equality continues he shall so declare. Thereupon the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes and when the House - re-assembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. That does not solve the problem.",25

120,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The suspension of 1 the sitting for 30 minutes is not what I regard as the proper procedure to adopt on the occasion of the election of a Speaker. What real reason can be advanced for action of that nature? It has be?n suggested that an attempt might be made to buy a couple of votes.  honourable members opposite.,25
121,Mr ROSEVEAR,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) said that 'the honourable gentleman'3 leader was bought.,25
122,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The party opposite has said that whenever it cared to pay the price it was always able to effect its purpose.,25
123,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Order !,25
124,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I throw back in the teeth of every honourable member opposite who interjected, the aspersion cast on honourable members on this side of the House. All of them should pay heed to what occurs nearer home. I want to know what reason is advanced for the suspension of the sitting. What is the purpose of the suspension ? If we arc assembled here to elect a Speaker, and we proceed by a series of ballots to accomplish that purpose, what need is there for the suspension of the sitting?  able member suggest as an alternative?",25
125,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I cannot see the need for the suspension of the sitting, and I want to know why it should be susvotes pended. After all, the same men will as they were before it. return to this chamber and the same question will have to be decided  tlieir minds in a period of three years; we might change ours in a period of 30 minutes.",26

127,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I am not regarding a member of the House. the honourable member's statement in that light. At the same time, the public would regard the proceedings as strange if the sitting were suspended to enable a determination to be reached in conSpeaker. nexion with the most important position that this House has to fill. I want to know reasons are advanced for the suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes. The posed Standing Order provides that when the House re-assembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this unnecessary by a withdrawal. That does not place the position in a very favourable light. I am certain that if a candidate for election as Speaker returned to chamber after.the sitting had been susmembers. pended for 30 minutes, and withdrew his nomination, a certain degree of suspicion versial would attach to his withdrawal. Paragraph m readsWhenever at any stage a withdrawal only one candidate remaining, he shall without .further voting, be declared elected as Speaker, and shall then be conducted to the Chair. I should have thought that the next paragraph would have provided, in the case continued equality of votes, for a further suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes, but there is no such provision. Therecould fore, it could happen, as the result adoption of this suggested new procedure, that equality of votes would continue. After all the procedure contained in with 'the suspension of the sitting thrown in, it is quite possible and competent for honourable members to be just as equally divided in their after the resumption of the sitting What would happen then? Apparently there is no by them. answer to that question.",26
128,Mr NAIRN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Eithe r we must have the Clerk give a casting vote or decide the matter by lot. Has the honourable member any better alternative?,26
129,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"There is no provision for either of those courses in the proposed new standing order. I was prepared to allow matters to remain as they are. If we are to have the Clerk giving a casting vote or drawing lot3, why is it not stated?",26
130,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The Clerk cannot give a casting vote. He is not,26

The recommendation continuesand thereupon sits down in the chair, and then the mace (which before lay under the table) shall be laid upon the table. I remind the House that, whereas there is to be a time limit on speeches made prior to the election of the Speaker, no provision is made in this proposal for a time limit on speeches congratulating the new Speakei' on his election to the Chair.",27
145,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,The Speaker would put a time limit to the congratulatory speeches.,27
146,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,What would happen if he did not?,27

149,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,That enough.,27
150,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I am sure it would take the honourable member much longer . Mr Archie CAMERON - I could reckon the honourable member up in half a minute.,27
151,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I would not require even that time to reckon up the honourable member for Barker because long ago I reckoned him up. The recommendation continues The Speaker having been congratulated, a Minister shall inform the House at what time the Governor General will be pleased to receive the House for the purpose of presenting the Speaker to His Excellency, and the sitting of the House shall then be suspended until that time. Before proceeding to any business, the Speaker, with the House, shall present himself to the Governor General; and, on returning, shall pass through the chamber, and, having resumed the chair, shall report his presentation to the Governor General.",27

153,Mr BLACKBURN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Bourke) [4.11] The whole of the draft Standing Orders was the work of a committee which represented all parties in this House and included three party leaders, two former Speakers, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin)> and our late lamented friend, Sir Littleton Groom, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley), who was a leader, and myself. I think I was appointed because of some experience I have had in the matter of Standing Orders. The Standing Orders were considered very elaborately at a great number of meetings and the one now before the House gave the committee considerable trouble. In my opinion, as proposed, it is a very good standing order, and one that the House should adopt. So strongly did I feel on this point that I went, as I believe others did, to the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and asked that he should bring the matter before the House before it rose. This will be the last meeting of this Parliament and, if the Standing Order is to be of any value in the election of the new Speaker in the next Parliament, it is necessary that it should be passed now. I am not able to speak for the honourable member for Hindmarsh or for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), who are absent, but I believe that I was not the only member of the Standing Orders Committee from this side of the House who approached the Prime Minister upon this matter. The House realizes of course, that we have had no complete revision of the Standing Orders since first we provisionally adopted Standing Orders in 1903. All attempts at a complete revision have been fruitless. It is realized- I realise at any rate-that the whole of the proposed new Standing Orders are not likely to be speedily passed by this Parliament, hut I do think, from my own experience in this House and elsewhere, that it would be excellent to adopt this Standing Order, which provides for the election of the Speaker. I regret that it has come to us late, but I understand the matter was mentioned last week. I was told this morning by a member of my own party that this business would come on today.",27
154,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,How did the honourable member know it would come on today?,28
155,Mr BLACKBURN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"I was not here last night, but I was told by a member of my own party that it would come on persisting today.",28
156,Mr BRENNAIT,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I was not told.,28
157,Mr BLACKBURN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"The position at a present is that the Speaker is elected a House of 74 members. He is elected with the Clerk in the chair who is not a was recommended. member of the House and has no casting vote. It is perfectly possible for a tie result. In the opinion of the committee, the best possible means of settling issue' is that now proposed. Only Speaker has a casting vote under our Constitution. The situation foreseen by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) might arise in an open election in. the House. When this subject was under the consideration of the committee two defects in the present system were. apparent- a major and a minor defect. The major defect is that the Speaker is a government nominee. The choice of the Government becomes the choice of the House, and the Speaker is chosen on a party division. If a secret ballot were necessary, the Speaker would become, in a very real sense, the choice of the House The minor difficulty is that the officer in charge of the proceedings at the election of the Speaker, being an officer of the House, is not a member of the Parliament, and is not, in the nature of things, entitled to demand from honourable members the same respect as would be required by a presiding officer who is the choice of the House. In this Parliament, and also in another Parliament, I have seen the Clerk of the House put in a most unfortunate position in connection with the election of Speaker. The former Clerk of this House was put in the unhappy position of having to accept a motion that an honourable member be no longer heard. The proposal now submitted by the Standing Orders Committee would obviate both ' difficulties. A secret ballot would ensure that the choice of the presiding officer would really be the choice of the House. The Clerk of the House could not, of course, be given a casting vote. No provision is made in the Constitution for _ such a situation; nor is there any j>rovision for lot3 to be drawn. The Standing Orders Committee was of the opinion that, in the event of a position of equality after the second ballot honourable members should be given an opportunity to think about the subject before further ballot was taken, and in a difby ferent atmosphere. It was for that reason that the suspension of the sitting The honourable member for West Sydto ney should realise that both the honourable member for Hindmarsh, a memthat ber of his own party, and an the ex-Speaker of the House, and the late honourable, member for Darling Downs, Sir Littleton Groom, also an exSpeaker, approved of this proposal. I believe that all honourable gentlemen would approve bf it if they would approach it dispassionately and on its merits. Unless'this proposal is adopted now we shall probably find ourselves at the inception of the sitting of the next. Parliament in a similar position to that which faced us at the inception of the sitting of this Parliament. I suggest, with respect, as a comparative tyro in the House, that such a situation does not become the dignity of the House; nor does * it tend to increase the esteem in which Parliament is held by the people. It is not calculated, either, to cause the public, my or even honourable members, to believe that the Speaker is actually selected for his personal capacity, and not merely because he is a government nominee. I am sure that any Speaker would be happy to feel that he had been really selected by the members of the House, and was not beholden in any way for his position to the party in power, in which case, a weak man might show a tendency to lean, towards the Government party. We have had ample evidence, of course, that you, sir, have discharged the duties of your high office with absolute impartiality nnd very high ability indeed. I have felt pleased and proud to sit under your chairmanship in this House. A weaker man might have felt obligations to the Government, and might have been disposed to defer to the wishes of the Government, with the result that government supporters might have enjoyed privileges not accorded to honourable members of the Opposition. We should avoid any situation of that description. The object of the Standing Committee was to provide, within limits of the Constitution, for such sistent case of equality as might easily arise with this Parliament constituted it, is at present, for 37 honasked orable members might vote either side. 'In such a case, the only possible means of reaching a decision would be by the common sense of honorOrders able members. I, myself, favour a. secret ballot for the election of Speaker for same reason that I favour a secret ballot tious in it because there for the election of candidates for Parliain the committee ifr. Blackburn. ment, so that a man may, without fear, favour, or affection, feel free to cast his vote for the best man available. The merit of the. proposal now before the House is that it achieves that end. This is an urgent matter. If .this proposal is adopted now it will-enable the new procedure to be applied at the opening of the new parliament. I am sorry that suggestions of bad faith have been made in this matter.",28
158,Mr ROSEVEAR,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I am sorry that the honourable member approached the Government before he approached his own partu.,29
159,Mr BLACKBURN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I informed the Leader of my party and he approved of having approached the Prime Minister.,29
160,Mr LYONS,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I also informed the Leader of the Opposition that I had spoken to the honourable member for Bourke.,29
161,Mr BLACKBURN,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,I had not the slightest idea that any member of the Standing Orders Committee was opposed to this proposal. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) made a reservation at the last meeting of the committee when he objected to certain proposed disciplinary measures. I did not know that there was any objection to this proposal for the election of Speaker. Had I known of it I should not have made my suggestion to the Prime Minister. Motion (by Mr Holt) negativedThat the question be now put.,29
162,Mr FORDE,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"Capricornia) [4.24] - I urge the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) to agree to the postponement of thp. consideration of this subject. Just before the House met the Orders Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle the Page) spoke to me about the busia'perness proposed to be submitted to honourable members. He said that two or three as small measures would be'brought up. I him if any other business was to on be submitted and he said "" If we have time we shall probably consider the unanimous report from the Standing Committee covering the recommendations for the election of Speaker the nnd so on: but there is nothing contenauauiznitv",29

Sometimes half-adozen reports are submitted in one day. As the Standing Orders Committee was not unanimous on this point I ursre that honourable members be given an opportunity to debate the question. It would not be wise for the Prime Minister to rush this business through in the dying hours of the Parliament. Had this business been put on the notice-paper for a particular time, honourable would have had an opportunity to consider it and might have been prepa.red to discuss it. At any rate they would have had n. chance to peruse the report. Further, the report could have been considered at special meetings of the parties. Honourable might suggest that this is not a subject for party consideration, but surely the provisions of the Standing Orders are of vital consequence not only to members of the Labour party but al?o to the members of other parties in the House. I urge the Prime Minister to agree to the postponement of the consideration of this report which, I find, contains 41 printed pages. I doubt whether it has been read by more than three or four members of the House, and it. should not he expected that the House would accept it without comment' in the dying hours of the Parliament. I am as industrious as any other member of the House, and I have not had time to read the report. There is just cause for asking the Prime Minister to agree to a postponement of the consideration of the report until such time as honourable members have had adequate opportunity to consider it .",30

170,Mr BEASLEY,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,Did he say that?,30
171,Mr LYONS,AMENDMENT OF STANDING,"No . but he must have realized it as the result of what occurred on the last occasion when a Speaker was elected. In order, therefore, that such an occurrence might be avoided in the future, and being desirous of maintaining the dignity of Parliament he, as a former Speaker of the Parliament of Victoria, recommended that some better system be introduced. This had nothing whatever to do with the party. He suggested that if the House could not pass all the recommendations of the committee, it might at least make provision for the election of a Speaker for the next Parliament on proper and 'dignified lines. I accepted that suggestion, T discussed it with my colleagues, and mentioned it to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), who is now absent. I want to be fair . to him : he did not commit himself to any particular line of action.",30

176,Mr LYONS,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [6.6] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The negotiations regarding the British air mail service and Qantas agreements have been proceeded with but, as is usual where negotiations have to be conducted by telegram, there have been delays. For these delays the Commonwealth has not been responsible. Both agreements are nearing the final stage, outstanding matters having been reduced to comparatively minor details. They will be submitted to Parliament at the first opportunity after their completion. We have now reached the end of the proceedings of the present Parliament. I take this opportunity to offer to you first, Mr Speaker, my deep thanks for and my appreciation of the manner in which - you have presided over our deliberations during the last three years. To-day a very high compliment was paid to you by the honourable member far Bourke (Mr Blackburn), who in another sphere occupied the position that you occupy in this sphere, when he said that it was an honour and a privilege to him to sit and serve under you. You have brought to the discharge of your duties not only ability but also impartiality. ' The recent disagreement between you and me emphasized the impartiality of your decisions. You have not recognized party,' but have done your utmost to uphold the dignity of this Parliament. Therefore, I am confident that I speak on behalf of all honourable members when I thank you very sincerely for all that you have done. Whatever limitations may be imposed upon my later remarks, both personal and political, I am in a position to wish you, at any rate, well. The. sentiments that I have expressed in regard to you, I extend also to the  We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the officers of Parliament for the assistance that they have rendered to us. The Clerk of the House was recently promoted to that position. On behalf of members generally, I express appreciation of hi3 ability and impartiality, and thank him for his assistance. I have been associated with the present Clerk of the House throughout my political' career whether in the State or in the Commonwealth Parliament. I was associated with him back in the days when he was Clerk Assistant in the smaller Tasmanian Parliament, and during all these years his work has been marked by efficiency and impartiality. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his recent appointment and to wish him long years of success. To those associated with him and to all other members of the staff of this House, whether their spheres of duty are inside or outside the chamber, I offer my thanks and appreciation. Politicians are very much indebted to them for the assistance that they give. Furthermore, I may be permitted to say at this juncture, because as we approach the general elections the close of these proceedings is different from the normal conclusion of sittings, that I extend my thanks to the whole of the Public Service of the Commonwealth of Australia. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) was leaving this Parliament a week ago to embark upon the election campaign, I expressed my sentiments towards him. We all have the greatest respect for the Leader of the Opposition. Although he is a political opponent, we regard him as being a personal friend, and wish him well personally, although not politically. This has been a strenuous Parliament. We have had to face difficult problems and, at times, party political feeling has run fairly high, 'but at the close of it we are in a position to say that whatever views we have of the politics of, our opponents, we have a high personal regard for them. Therefore, Mr Speaker, at the close of this Parliament, I want to thank all, you Mr Speaker, the Chairman of Committees, officials, members of the Opposition and, particularly, the officers of Hansard, who, with great efficiency, embellish and polish our speeches so that they look worthwhile for us to present in our constituencies. I pay that particular tribute to the Hansard staff because they have been of very great help to honourable members.",32
177,Mr GANDER,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,What about the Whips?,33
178,Mr LYONS,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"The Whips have been wonderful, each to his own particular party. As far as I know there has been nothing more efficient than the mathematical performances of the Whips, because, in divisions, they have been able to count and add up correctly. Therefore, to the Whips 1 offer thanks on behalf of the Government and honourable members on this side. I have no more to say except to express the hope that just as the electors are represented in this ment at this moment, they will again be represented after the elections.",33
179,Mr FORDE,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Capricornia) [6.14] - In the unavoidable absence of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) I wish to express the appreciation of the Opposition at the very fair and impartial manner in which you, Mr Speaker, have carried out your duties to this House. The success of parliamentary institutions depends on the conduct of the business in Parliament, and that in turn depends to a great extent on the personal attributes of the presiding officers. We realise, as an Opposition, that your position is onerous and that your duties at times are irksome. When feeling runs high in debate it is often extremely difficult to maintain order, but we believe, as au Opposition, that you have always endeavoured, to the very best of your ability, to act impartially. You have done credit to yourself and to the exalted position which you occupy. Although the Chairman of Committees and I disagree violently on tariff questions, I am glad to say he has done his work as chairman ably and well, and has endeavoured to sec members of the Opposition as frequently as members on the Government side of the House. It would be extremely difficult for Mr Speaker, and for the Chairman of Committees, to discharge your duties in Parliament without the able services of the Clerk of the Parliament, the Assistant Clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and other members of the staff. In paying tribute to the ability of the present Clerk I extend to him our very hearty congratulations upon the attainment of his high position. I also wish to offer a meed of praise to his predecessor in office, Mr . Parkes, who, having reached the retiring age during the life of this Parliament, has laid down his duties. We were all deeply indebted to him for his assistance in our work. The smooth-running of the machinery of Parliament depends to a. great extent on the courtesy, ability and efficiency of the Clerks.",33
180,Mr BEENNAN,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,It would be interesting to know what they think of us at times.,33
181,Mr FORDE,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"It would be intensely interesting. I also extend our hearty conParlia- gratulations to the members of the Hansard staff. It is really remarkable that in all the confusion that sometimes occurs in Parliament, with cross-firing and interjections, they are able to compile such intelligent reports of our speeches for us to read the next day. We are particularly fortunate in this Parliament, also, in having such a courteous and capable staff of attendants. Frequently four or five signals must appear at a time in the attendants' alcove, and I have been amazed at the speed, accuracy and unfailing courtesy of the attendants in replying to the calls made upon them. They seem to be able to produce, with the utmost promptness, anything that honourable members may desire, except suitable missiles to cast at an opponent. We are indebted to the staff of the Parliamentary Library. Mr Binns and his capable assistants render invaluable service to honourable members by their researches, and their ability to provide us with information for the preparation of our speeches. Although in the heat of debate feeling runs high at times between honourable members on one side of the House and those on the other, and although we, as an Opposition, strongly oppose Government supporters on certain matters of you, policy, we leave this Parliament without carrying away with us any personal animosities. The Labour party faces the elections with a feeling of confidence. We hope that when. Parliament re-assembles we shall be sitting on the other side of the House and honourable gentlemen opposite will be on this side of it, in which event we trust they will be able to extend the co-operation that is expected of a reasonable opposition in order to assist an enlightened government to put its proposed legislation on the statute book.",33
182,Dr EARLE PAGE,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Cowper-Minister for Commerce) [6.21] - I promised the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. MCEwen) some time ago that I would obtain for him information regarding the recent conference of millet-growers. A meeting representative of broom millet growers in .New South Wales, Victoria and 'Queensland, the broom manufacturers in New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce, was held at the office of the Department of Commerce ""in Sydney, today. Questions affecting the disposal of existing stocks, and proposals for dealing with, future crops, were discussed. Arising out of the discussion it was resolved that an Australian Broom Millet Advisory Committee, consisting of not more than two growers, and not more than two manufacturers from each State, should be formed, with an independent chairman nominated by the Department, of Commerce. The purpose of the committee will be immediately to gather all available information regarding present stocks and crop prospects for the coming season. It will then meet again with the object of determining reasonable prices for millet, having regard to the estimated quantity available, manufacturers' requirements and market prospects. Some concern was expressed by delegates regarding the possibility of a surplus of broom millet being carried over into 193S. It was therefore decided that all available information about the present position and future prospects .should be circulated by the Department of Commerce to growers' organizations as soon as possible for the guidance of growers in planning their sowing programme for the coming season. I desire to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) who congratulated you, Mr Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees, upon the manner in which you have carried out your duties. I also desire to express my appreciation and thanks to the officers of the House, to the Hansard staff, to the attendants and all those associated .with the conduct of Parliament, for the assistance they have rendered during the session. I also desire to thank honourable members in all parts of the House for their assistance.",34
183,Mr CASEY,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Corio-Treasurer ) [6.22] - Yesterday the honourable member for Echuca (Mr MCEwen) asked for particulars regarding the operation of the act in which £100,000 was voted for interest and sinking f„n d in connection with funds made available to local bodies for public works. Honourable members will recall that the Commonwealth Government was anxious to assist in making provision for the unemployed in the States. There were two methods, and only two, by which this could be done. One was a grant to the States from revenue, and the other was to allocate loan moneys to the States. It soon became apparent that both methods were becoming increasingly difficult, because the Commonwealth Government did not have any appreciable amount of surplus revenue from which to make grants, and the making of loan moneys available was a dubious advantage, because all loan moneys come out of the same pool, and the more loan moneys made available by the Commonwealth, the less is available for the States. A scheme was therefore devised under which the Commonwealth Government set aside from revenue £100.000 a year for ten years, for use by local bodies in the States on condition that the States set aside a similar amount. This scheme, under which £200,000 a year was made available, came into operation a year ago, and has proved, in practice, very satisfactory. The value of the works thus assisted amounts to £9,250,000. The money was distributed strictly on a population basis, and the States, almost without exception, have acted up to the spirit and letter of the Commonwealth Government's intention. As a complete list of the works approved, most of which have alread>7 been set in motion by the various States, would he too long to insert in Hansard. I have arranged to place fifty or sixty copies of the list on the table of the library, where they may be perused by honourable members.",34
184,Mr BLACKBURN,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Bourke) [6.25] I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) a complaint by members of the Coachmakers Federation that motor bodies which were formerly made in Australia are now'being imported in the form of panels which have only to be assembled. It is claimed Iby the union that this practice has deprived some of its members of employment and threatens the employment of a great many others. I have been asked to bring this state of affairs to the notice of the Minister, and I now ask him to investigate it.",35
185,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Warringah-Minister for Defence) [6.26] The honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Price) asked today what progress was being made in the direction of remedying the disparity between the Australian charges with respect to radiogrammes exchanged with British ships, and those which apply in the case of British coastal stations. I am advised' that the Postmaster-General's Department has been dealing with this matter, but difficulty is being experienced in getting into line other interests concerned. Every endeavour is being made to bring the matter to finality.",35
186,Mr BEASLEY,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"West Sydney) [6.27]. - About three quarters of an hour ago I received a file which the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) promised would be made available to me. It deals with the search for oil in New Guinea, and the reports obtained from the Administrator of the Mandated Territory. The file is a bulky one, and as it will be impossible for me to complete my examination of it before the train departs to-night, I should be glad if the Prime Minister would agree to my taking a portion Of it away with me, so that I might finish my investigation. The facts which I have already gleaned are most informative and important, and will be of great interest to the public.",35
187,Mr WHITE,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.28] - I noticed in the press a statement by one of the trade unions that motor bodies had been admitted a knocked down condition, ready for assembly, but I have had no official complaint. The records show that strong pressure is being exercised to allow panels from which steel bodies are built to be admitted under by-law, but this request has been resisted up to the present time, although the agents for some of the smaller motor cars claim that the poundage basis on which panels are admitted makes them too expensive if assembled in Australia. If the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) has information which shows that Australian workmen are toeing deprived of employment, I shall have the matter investigated, and I shall inform him of the position later by letter, but I doubt whether there has been any loss of employment because the number of employees now engaged in the industry is over 12,000 and is increasing.",35
188,Mr LYONS,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [6.29] - in reply- A few moments ago, I referred to the various branches of the Parliamentary staff to whom the thanks of honourable members are due for their assistance, but I overlooked one very important section of workers in this building, to which we owe a great deal. I desire to add an expression of my appreciation of the services rendered by the members of the press gallery. These gentlemen have become, through the years, the personal friends of all of us. They render a great service to the community by the faithful reports which they supply of the proceedings of this Parliament. I am sure that members of the Opposition join in this expression of appreciation. To-day I offered to allow the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) access to the file relating to the search for oil in Dutch New Guinea and in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I am afraid, however, that I cannot accede to his request that I should allow the whole or any portion of the file to leave Canberra, because, so far as I know, no precedent exists for such a course. The - honourable member may take advantage of any opportunity available to him to peruse the file in Canberra; but I think that he, having had ministerial experience, will agree that it would be improper for me to do as he suggests. The general pracin tice is to table such documents either in. the House or in the Parliamentary Library, where they are available to honourable members and also the press. But this file was made available - only to the honourable member.",35
189,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH AIRMAIL SERVICE AND QANTAS,"Hon. G. J.

Without their co-operation I could not have discharged those duties satisfac-torily. I have done my best, but I would not be human had I always been - right, and honourable members would not be human had they that I was always right. If I have .given satisfaction to Ministers and to honourable members, I , too, am satisfied. The officers of the House and the members of the various staffs have carried - out their duties with exceptional ability, and I thank them for their uniform - courtesy and helpfulness. While in the - chair I have known no politics; but within the next"" few weeks my interest in party politics will be revived.
