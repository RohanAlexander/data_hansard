So reduction, but there has been no real reduction. Commonwealth end throughout the period since 1 July 1997. A second comment that needs to be made is with effect from 1 July 1997, different arrangements one common feature. That common feature provided in accordance with Commonwealth guidelines, of the priorities fixed was family In the process of the negotiation of what are legal aid commissions, the legal aid commissions in the provision of funding and that they need narrow it down and say to families, 'Look, if going to reside we think there should be limits.' a capping of $10,000 per partner and $15,000 terms, is $35,000 of public funding for parents their child will live. That, from my perspective, pretty fair. We know that there are unreasonable people. but a lot of those unrepresented litigants are and who do not have funding for their own representation; who either have not sought legal aid, or, means, are not prepared to put their means into the issue. Another policy reform that we engaged in in commissions in the granting of funding would self-funding litigant would be likely to apply a bit of an outcry in the family law legal practitioners are not getting paid as much from legal aid outcry from Family Court judges because they the system is working. What we have actually found is that in some family law cases being funded by legal aid aggregate funding has meant that more people objective.

I am not in a position, without suggestion that there has been a reduction for that. In the negotiations following the that just operated on an historical basis, new July 1997. In order to cushion the effect of the Commonwealth matters, arrangements were made eliminated and paid out at the beginning of possibly there has been an appearance of a real It has been subject to indexing from the that, in the negotiation of the new agreements were made with each state, but there was was that the Commonwealth funding would be fixing Commonwealth priorities. One law and, in particular, children. in effect purchaser-provider arrangements with have said that there is far too much looseness to narrow it. They have said that they need to you are going to argue over where the child is They negotiated among themselves and fixed per child representative. That, in aggregate to determine the arrangements under which from a government perspective, seems to be There is an increase in unrepresented litigants, not simply people for whom legal aid is refused a lot of those people are people having been refused on the basis that they have the legal aid area was to ensure that legal aid limit the funding to what an ordinarily prudent to their own case. I can appreciate that there is community because the family lawyers as they previously were, and there is a bit of an are seeing more unrepresented litigants. But jurisdictions since 1 July 1997 there are more than there previously were.
